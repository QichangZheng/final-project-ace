Yglesias is wrong about China’s U.S. bond purchases,"Matt Yglesias, Slate’s business and economics correspondent, is a lot like Dr. Evil in that he often laments that he’s surrounded by frickin’ idiots. This confidence came through in force in Yglesias’ recent post titled, “Stop Being Wrong About China Buying Our Bonds.” Ironically, not only is Yglesias himself wrong, but his analysis is downright impressive in the depths of its error. Contrary to Yglesias’ claim, the Chinese government’s enormous stockpile of Treasuries does indeed give it leverage over the U.S. government.

Yglesias’ post opens up with characteristic bravado when he writes:

No subject attracts as much wrong commentary from people in positions of authority and influence as China’s purchases of American government debt. Recent antics around the debt ceiling managed to bring about a new surge in wrongness on this subject, so let me set you straight about it once and for all.

Before diving into Yglesias’ case, let’s review the basic facts. The following table is taken from an August 2013 Congressional Research Service report on Chinese holdings (which in context seems to mean Chinese government and central bank holdings) of U.S. debt:

As the table indicates, currently the Chinese constitute some 23 percent of the entire foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries. Furthermore, the CRS report also indicates that between 2003 and 2012, the Chinese covered at least $40 billion of the U.S. budget deficit in a given year, with the exception of 2011 when China’s holdings of Treasuries slightly declined.

In this light, it’s understandable why so many analysts are alarmed. If for some reason the Chinese government should decide to halt its purchases — let alone dump its accumulated holdings — of Treasuries, surely this would have serious ramifications?

Yglesias argues that these fears are baseless; the situation depicted in the table above “doesn’t give China any leverage over the American government.” How does Yglesias reach such a counterintuitive conclusion? He first explains that at current exchange rates, Americans buy more goods from Chinese exporters than vice versa. This trade deficit by itself would mean more dollars chasing Chinese yuan in the foreign exchange markets. We’ll turn over the narrative to Yglesias’ own words:

Now in the natural course of floating exchange rates what would happen here is that the dollar price of Chinese money would rise, and this would increase the price of Chinese-made stuff in America and decrease the price of American-made stuff in China. That in turn would tend to discourage the flow of Chinese-made stuff to the United States of America. But the Chinese government for various reasons wants to subsidize Chinese manufacturing. So they want to send those dollars they accumulate back to the United States….[W]hat they choose to do…is to purchase lots of US government debt. That’s a nice quiet way of limiting the extent of Chinese currency appreciation. But that’s all it is. It’s not an investment…[I]t’s certainly not a favor to the United States of America. The American government doesn’t need China to provide it with American fiat money — we have plenty of American fiat money. [Bold added]

It’s hard to know where to begin in unpacking the problems with Yglesias’ glib position. One way to tackle it is to look at what is actually happening when the Chinese government chooses to buy Treasuries. Contrary to Yglesias’ description, it’s not really the case that American importers send U.S. dollars to Chinese exporters, who build up piles of American fiat money, and then have to find something to do with it. Rather, the more general case is that American importers (or the financial institutions acting on their behalf) go to the foreign exchange markets and buy Chinese money with their dollars first, then use the Chinese money to buy Chinese goods.

At the same time, if the Chinese central bank wants to acquire more U.S. Treasuries, it doesn’t walk around with hat in hand to various Chinese exporters, asking them to deposit the U.S. dollar bills they’ve accumulated. No, the Chinese central bank enters the foreign exchange markets, looking to buy U.S. dollars with Chinese money, in order to then buy U.S. Treasuries with American money. Thus, to claim that the Chinese government is effectively mailing back dollar bills — which is no favor to us since the Treasury can just print up more dollar bills on our end — isn’t even technically what’s going on.

Yet that’s just a minor quibble. The fundamental problem with Yglesias’ argument is that he ignores the impact on the United States if the Chinese chose to use their dollar holdings to buy American exports, rather than more Treasuries. In other words, the “favor” the Chinese are bestowing on Americans in general (and the U.S. government in particular) isn’t that they are handing over dollars in exchange for more Treasuries. Rather, the “favor” is that they keep sending us manufactured goods without asking for anything “real” in return.

In principle, the Chinese could sell their current holdings of some $1.3 trillion (as of May) in Treasuries, then use the dollars thus raised in order to buy exports from the United States. Then at least one of the following effects would kick in, or (more likely) they would occur in combination:

POSSIBLE EFFECT #1: By dumping $1.3 trillion of Treasuries on the market at once, the Chinese would force up U.S. interest rates. In other words, in the very act of selling, the Chinese might depress the market value of their holdings (a drop in bond prices means a rise in yield), and not get the full $1.3 trillion at current market valuations.

POSSIBLE EFFECT #2: The sudden (and presumably long-term) collapse of Chinese demand for U.S. financial assets would lead to a sharp depreciation of the dollar. Suddenly “cheap” imports from China would not be so cheap. Retailers such as Wal-Mart would not be able to sell lamps, TVs, and other goods as cheaply as they currently do. Crude oil, quoted in U.S. dollars, would suddenly jump in price. Most retail items would become more expensive for American consumers.

POSSIBLE EFFECT #3: The first effect #1 above could be offset to the extent that private American investors stepped into the breach and mimicked the role previously played by the Chinese, by expanding their holdings of Treasuries without asking for a higher yield. In this case, the dollar would still crash against the Chinese currency (effect #2 above). To the extent that the Chinese (and the rest of the world) just wanted to reduce their holdings of U.S. assets, period, this outcome would simply reverse the accumulated trade deficits up to this point; Americans would run a one-time $1.3 trillion trade surplus with China, busting their buns to ship them all sorts of goodies, for nothing — just to get back to even.

POSSIBLE EFFECT #4: The only way to completely offset both effects #1 and #2 above, is if foreign investors are willing to step into the breach and smoothly offset the Chinese unloading of Treasuries, without asking for a higher yield on the assets to induce them to expand their holdings. Only in this case would Americans be relatively unaffected; the immense holdings of Treasuries would simply have switched from China to, say, Japan.

Now I’m sure that Yglesias and other Keynesians would argue that the above outcomes are actually great, given our current “liquidity trap” conditions. My first retort is that Yglesias didn’t qualify his argument by reference to the current slump; he gave a general case that is either true or false regardless of the unemployment rate.

Furthermore, the Keynesian argument, if correct, leads to the conclusion that if the Chinese developed an unstoppable satellite weapon, and demanded that Americans send them $1.3 trillion in goods as tribute to avoid annihilation, that this wouldn’t affect us in any way. In fact, we would be grateful for the stimulus this provided to our economy, since sending them such tribute shows up (other things equal) as $1.3 trillion in “Net Exports” in the GDP calculations.

Paul Krugman, pining for a bogus alien invasion, might indeed go just that far, and hope for a military blackmail of the United States as the path to prosperity. Does Yglesias as well, or is he willing to reconsider his glib post about China?",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2013/10/24/yglesias-is-wrong-about-chinas-u-s-bond-purchases/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwim9_znorP9AhX3mlYBHQe3Csg4MhAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw0FeFvxk0njdEKwH6EOFFos,2013-10-24
Is Trump Ready For China’s Inevitable Test Of American Power?,"China’s worldview prompts it to probe the strength and resolve of the dominant power, and President-elect Donald Trump will inevitably be tested.

In recent years, China has carefully tested and evaluated each new American president.

“The Leninist core of Chinese leadership thinking makes Beijing probe assiduously for international opportunities stemming from changes in counterparts’ personalities, policies, and power,” Dr. Andrew Erickson, a leading expert on China, explained to The Daily Caller News Foundation. China sees power in relative terms; one country’s loss is another’s gain. Weaknesses, even in a dominant power, are vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

For former President George W. Bush, his test was the 2001 Hainan Island Incident.

On April 1, 2001, only a few months into Bush’s first term, a People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) J-8II interceptor fighter jet collided with a U.S. Navy EP-3E ARIES II signal intelligence aircraft near Hainan Island in the South China Sea. Chinese pilot Lieutenant Commander Wang Wei died in the crash.

Although it became an international incident, the crash itself was not the real test for the Bush administration; rather, the test was the pattern of increasingly-dangerous interceptions which occurred prior to the accident.

“The PLA began its recent pattern of aggressive interceptions of U.S. reconnaissance flights in December 2000,” a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report notes. Between December 2000 and April 13, 2001, there were 44 PLA interceptions of U.S. reconnaissance flights in international airspace over the East China Sea and South China Sea.

Chinese interceptor fighter jets came within 30 feet of U.S. aircraft six times. In two instances, the distance between Chinese and U.S. aircraft was less than 10 feet.

Through repeated interceptions, Beijing appeared interested in determining whether or not Washington would call its bluff. The U.S. did exactly that, and the results were fatal.

Following the incident, China scaled back interceptions of U.S. surveillance aircraft, while the U.S. did not make any substantive concessions to the Chinese.

A few weeks after President Barack Obama took office, the Chinese tested him by harassing ocean surveillance ship USNS Impeccable.

China took what retired Navy Capt. Raul Pedrozo called an “aggressive, unsafe, and unprofessional action against an unarmed naval auxiliary vessel.”

On March 8, 2009, five Chinese vessels — specifically a Navy intelligence ship, a government fisheries-patrol vessel, a state oceanographic patrol vessel, and two fishing trawlers — surrounded the Impeccable in international waters about 75 miles off the coast of Hainan Island.

The fishing ships came within 25 feet of the U.S. ship and even stopped in front of it, forcing the Impeccable to take emergency action to avoid a collision.

The Impeccable returned the next day accompanied by a guided-missile destroyer, a reasonable yet temporary solution overlooking a far more complicated and troublesome problem that has continuously resurfaced during Obama’s time in office.

The Chinese fishing vessels dispatched to harass the Impeccable were part of China’s Third Sea Force, its Maritime Militia. The threat has gone unacknowledged and unaddressed by the Obama administration.

As Trump prepares to take office, he can expect to be tested as well, possibly by issues left unresolved by the previous administration.

“Beijing’s longstanding opposition to key principles of international air-sea law and its growing assertiveness in the South China Sea make it view ‘unapproved’ American activities there as contravening vital interests,” Erickson told TheDCNF. “Recent evolution of bilateral frictions suggests that China might test Trump by using Maritime Militia personnel and vessels to pose some sort of ambiguity, complication, and possible harassment to a U.S. freedom-of-navigation operation.”

China uses its Third Sea Force as a paramilitary force while portraying units as noncombatants. The ambiguous appearance allows China’s Maritime Militia to engage in “gray zone aggression.”

“Make no mistake, these are state-organized, -developed, and -controlled forces operating under a direct military chain of command,” Erickson revealed at a House Committee on Armed Services hearing in September.

“Trump and his team must prepare for manifold contingencies from the start. Among them, a Maritime Militia challenge would stand out for the Obama administration’s failure to pave the way with basic public preparations,” Erickson asserted. “The Administration’s apparent dismissal thus far of repeated recommendations that it at least mention China’s Maritime Militia by name to begin raising awareness can only have emboldened Beijing.”

“This is a force that thrives within the shadows of plausible deniability,” Erickson argued in September. “China’s Maritime Militia can only be as deceptive and plausibly deniable as we allow it to be through our own silence and our own inaction.”

Throughout the Obama administration, the Third Sea Force has repeatedly made its presence known. Outside of the incident with the Impeccable, the Maritime Militia was also involved in the 2011 sabotage of two Vietnamese hydrographic vessels, 2012 seizure of Scarborough Shoal, 2014 repulsion of Vietnamese vessels near a Chinese oil rig in disputed waters, and 2015 shadowing of the USS Lassen during a freedom-of-navigation operation.

Although it has yet to do so, the Obama administration still has time to address this challenge.

“To avert a potential setback or crisis, the Obama Administration must immediately ‘call out’ China’s Maritime Militia officially in public, share information with countries at risk, and communicate clearly to Beijing that any ships ignoring repeated warnings by U.S. vessels to desist from disrupting or harassing them will be treated as military-controlled and handled accordingly,” Erickson told TheDCNF. “Regardless of what leadership and stewardship President Obama ultimately demonstrates in this regard, Trump and his team must prepare to pass their China test. The world is watching.”

While Trump promised to get tough on China on the campaign trail, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding Trump and his policies, making him a likely target for persistent probing early on in his first term. “How he responds will reverberate across the region and around the world,” Erickson emphasized.

By firmly upholding the rules of the road, Trump has the ability to pave the way for sustainable U.S.-China cooperation within a rules-based international order. Failure to do so will result in a continuation and possibly an exacerbation of existing challenges.

China May Have Big Plans For Its Aircraft Carriers,"China needs at least six large aircraft carriers to exert power in disputed waters, according to military experts.

The People’s Liberation Army Navy already has one active carrier, the Liaoning, and a second aircraft carrier is in the works, with a launch likely this year. But China is unlikely to stop at just one or two aircraft carriers, Chinese military experts told state-run broadcaster CCTV. China may move to build a full fleet of carriers to defend its interests.

Chinese military expert Cao Weidong noted that China has a long maritime border, exposing the country to numerous threats from the sea. He explained that China needs multiple large-scale operational platforms to mitigate those threats, stressing that China needs more than one or two carriers. The Chinese navy is moving towards nuclear-powered aircraft carriers with bigger tonnage and improved combat capabilities, Cao told CCTV reporters.

Cao encouraged China to develop advanced take-off capabilities and build ships to carry fixed-wing early warning aircraft.

Yin Zhuo, another Chinese military expert, said that China needs carrier battle formations in both the South China Sea and East China Sea, where China is involved in territorial disputes with multiple claimant states. He suggested that there be at least three aircraft carriers operating in each sea.

Cao’s statements on maritime threats is likely reference to the the military efforts of certain rivals.

The U.S. currently has two carriers operating in the region, the USS Carl Vinson and the USS Ronald Reagan. The latter is docked at a port in Japan.

Japan is preparing to send its first large helicopter carrier, the Izumo, to the South China Sea, and Japan’s second large aircraft carrier, the Kaga, just entered service and is expected to be tasked with hunting Chinese submarines.

For the time being, China only has one operational aircraft carrier.

The Liaoning is the standard bearer for the PLAN.

The aircraft carrier was originally a Soviet “heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser,” according to reports from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The ship was bought under questionable circumstances by the Chinese in the late 1990s, hauled to China a few years later, and re-purposed as China’s first aircraft carrier.

The Liaoning was commissioned into the PLAN in September 2012, and it was declared combat ready in November last year.

“As a combat platform, regarding technology and capability to execute missions, China still lags behind the U.S.,” Li Dongyu, the political commissar on board the Liaoning, explained. He added, however, that, “As a military force, we are always prepared for war … We are prepared for actual combat at any time.”

The Liaoning conducted drills in the Bohai Sea, Western Pacific, and South China Sea late last year. Multiple state-run outlets reported that China’s carriers will one day sail into the Eastern Pacific, potentially putting pressure on the U.S.

China Paid WaPo To Publish A News Supplement That Ignored North Korea’s ICBM,"The Washington Post once again published Chinese propaganda Wednesday, a day after North Korea launched another intercontinental ballistic missile. The “news” China paid to insert in WaPo did not mention the launch.

China Watch, a Chinese-funded publication that pays for newspaper-like inserts in WaPo, has repeatedly ignored major Chinese news to paint a rosy picture of Beijing’s relations with Washington. The supplement doesn’t indicate its deadline.

The insert identifies itself as “an advertising supplement to The Washington Post” that is “prepared by China Daily, People’s Republic of China.” The insert also states the publication “did not involve the news or editorial departments of The Washington Post.”

The Chinese propaganda regularly appears in WaPo, and the Russian government also pays for a similar arrangement. Both China Watch and Russia Beyond The Headlines have also been published in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. (RELATED: Chinese, Russian Propaganda Lurking In Mainstream Media)

The Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but spokeswoman Kris Coratti previously told The Daily Caller News Foundation the insert is clearly labeled as an advertising supplement, and that the paper has run them regularly for years. She declined to disclose how much the Chinese government paid WaPo in her previous comments.

Only one article in the supplement — titled “Sino-U.S. Ties At ‘New Historic Starting Point'” — discussed China’s position on North Korea, but didn’t include details beyond saying that Beijing was dedicated to pressuring Pyongyang on its nuclear activities and refuses to acknowledge North Korea as a nuclear weapons-possessing country.

The ICBM North Korea claims it tested could have a range of more than 8,100 miles and could strike anywhere in the U.S.

Meanwhile, WaPo published a news story Wednesday titled “North Korea Missile Test Fresh Challenge For Trump’s Relationship With China,” which included an earlier quote from President Donald Trump saying Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to put economic pressure on Pyongyang.

Other articles in Wednesday’s China Watch include one titled “Vanishing Taboos Give Condoms A Sexy Twist” and another listing U.S. governors hailing “strong bonds with China.”

The Post also hosts a website for China Watch that is not clearly labeled as an advertising supplement and does not disclose that the Chinese government pays for the publication.

China Watch could not be reached for comment.

"All Signs Point To One Man As Chinese Spy In Feinstein’s Staff, And He Wasn’t A Driver …","It was reported that Democratic California Sen. Dianne Feinstein employed a Chinese spy.

Her longtime staffer, Russell Lowe, fits the description of the reported spy.

Feinstein’s office refused to comment on whether Lowe was the spy.

All the details of a former, longtime Sen. Dianne Feinstein staffer who’s accused of relaying information to Chinese intelligence services while working for the California Democrat point to Russell Lowe, a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation has determined.

Lowe worked for 20 years in Feinstein’s San Francisco office, where he was a staff liaison to the Asian-American community before leaving approximately five years ago. All those details match up with the descriptions of the Chinese spy Feinstein reportedly employed.

“Chinese intelligence once recruited a staff member at a California office of U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, and the source reported back to China about local politics,” Politico Magazine reported on July 27, describing the staffer as “a liaison to the local Chinese community” who was secretly “reporting back” to Chinese intelligence services.

Since then, more details have emerged about the alleged spy, including that he worked for Feinstein for 20 years, “attended Chinese consulate functions for the senator” and was fired five years ago.

All of those details point to Lowe, who was listed on Feinstein’s payroll as an “office director” in 2013, according to records maintained by the Sunlight Foundation. (RELATED: FBI Spy Stefan Halper’s Media Contacts Could Pose A Problem, Retired FBI Officials Say)

Lowe joined then-San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee and other California politicians at a farewell reception hosted by the Chinese consul in March 2013.

Lowe and six other attendees “awarded proclamations in recognition of Consul General Gao’s contributions to the friendly cooperation between China and Bay area cities,” according to the consulate’s event recap.

By 2014, Lowe was gone from Feinstein’s staff. When he spoke at an April 2014 conference on Chinese investment in the United States, he was introduced as a “former assistant to Senator Feinstein.”

Hankoryeh, a South Korean news publication, described Lowe in October 2017 as “a Chinese-American who spent 20 years as the aide to Dianne Feinstein.” Lowe visited the publication’s Seoul office at that time with former Democratic California Rep. Mike Honda, who left office in January 2017 after losing to progressive challenger Ro Khanna in 2016.

Feinstein has said that the spy had “no access to sensitive information,” and the former staffer was never prosecuted.

Lowe now works with the Education for Social Justice Foundation, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that says it’s focused on “educating the public on the Japanese military’s ‘comfort women’ system, which forced over 200,000 girls and women from at least 13 Asian countries into sexual slavery by the Japanese Imperial Army before and during WWII.”

Efforts to contact Lowe through the foundation were unsuccessful. Feinstein’s office declined to answer TheDCNF’s questions about Lowe and instead released a broad statement from the senator.

“Five years ago the FBI informed me it had concerns that an administrative member of my California staff was potentially being sought out by the Chinese government to provide information. He was not a mole or a spy, but someone who a foreign intelligence service thought it could recruit,” Feinstein said.

“The FBI reviewed the matter, shared its concerns with me and the employee immediately left my office. He never had access to classified or sensitive information or legislative matters. The FBI never informed me of any compromise of national security information.”

OPINION: China And Pakistan Unveil Their Plan For Afghanistan,"The China Daily, a Chinese government media outlet, published an article, “Pakistan key to Afghan peace process,” by an author from Pakistan, an ally of China, which not only drips with irony but unabashedly explains the Chinese-Pakistani plan for the future of Afghanistan.

It originates from the “non-governmental” Beijing think tank, the Center for China and Globalization, founded and run by former high officials of the Chinese government, one of which was chief negotiator for China’s entry into the World Trade Organization.

The article begins by blaming the United States for waging “an unnecessary and avoidable war” for 17 years, despite the fact that it was actually Pakistan who provided safe haven and supported a Taliban proxy army that “caused the deaths of countless innocent people.”

Contrary to the author’s contention, it was not the War in Afghanistan that “has endangered and destabilized the whole region” but Pakistan’s domestic policy of promoting Islamic extremism to subdue ethnic self-determination and its use of terrorism as an instrument of its foreign policy that led to and nurtured that war.

The author then conveniently identifies the countries collaborating with Pakistan to hasten a U.S. exit from South Asia; China, Russia, Iran and Turkey.

U.S. withdrawal is necessary for “the true potential of the Belt and Road Initiative, especially China-Pakistan Economic Corridor”, to be realized because “Eurasia, Russia and Central Asia can only utilize Gwadar [Pakistan’s port] as a newly emerged trade route through Afghanistan, where CPEC may later extend in the future.”

That can happen when “the [United States] completely withdraws from the country, as in Vietnam … and Pakistan can facilitate this by providing a safe passage for a U.S .withdrawal.” The subtle message being that Pakistan will continue to attack Afghanistan with its Taliban proxies until the United States does so.

Here is the punchline: “China’s Belt and Road Initiative and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization objectives can only be realized only when there is a stable Afghanistan,” that is, a Chinese-Pakistani controlled Afghanistan.

And here is how the Chinese-Pakistani plan will unfold.

China’s ally Pakistan will increase the attacks on Afghanistan by its proxy the Taliban to further undermine the Kabul government and raise the pressure on the United States to reach an agreement for withdrawal.

Together with Pakistan, Iran, Russia and Turkey, China will become a mediator to end the Afghan War.

A coalition government for Afghanistan will be proposed consisting of the Taliban and nominally neutral, but, in practice, pro-Pakistani/pro-Chinese Afghan politicians with a concomitant scheduled drawdown of the United States and NATO forces.

Afghanistan will be offered participation in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and will become a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization as a basis for Afghan reconstruction and development.

Pakistan will withdraw its support of the Taliban and joint Chinese-Pakistani counterterrorism forces will eliminate the remaining Taliban from Afghanistan, for which joint exercises are already underway while solidifying a pro-Pakistani/pro-Chinese government in Kabul.

Following China’s economic subjugation of South Asia, the Chinese will establish military bases in Balochistan on the Arabian Sea to control the vital sea lanes of the northern Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf, link the Chinese naval base in Djibouti with its bases in the South China Sea and isolate India.

Focused narrowly on enticing the Taliban to the negotiating table, the U.S. government appears to have no strategy to counter the China-Pakistan plan to dominate South Asia.

WHITTINGTON: The Race Back To The Moon Has Begun — And China Is In Front,"After a flurry of mysteriously appearing and disappearing tweets announcing the event, China, at last, confirmed that it has successfully landed the Chang’e 4 in the Van Karman Crater located at the South Pole on the far side of the moon.

The landing is a remarkable achievement. It illustrates Beijing’s burning ambition to become the supreme superpower on Earth, in part by conquering space. India and a private group in Israel are planning their own moon landings early in 2019. NASA is due to sponsor commercial lunar landings as part of President Trump’s return to the moon initiative in the next year or so.

The prize of the new space race is the moon’s natural resources and control of the high frontier for all practical purposes.

China is conducting its drive to conquer space with a self-inflicted handicap. The Xi Jinping regime is increasing control of its citizens, instituting a dystopian social credit system designed to stamp out what it regards as anti-social behavior. Beijing has also instituted a policy that has driven China’s Uighur minority into “re-education camps,” a move somewhat reminiscent of Nazi Germany regarding Jews and other “undesirables.”

China will certainly sacrifice innovation and technological progress in its desire to exercise absolute domination over the Chinese. Successful space programs require the permission to question authority, to think outside the box, to not accept dictates from on high as gospel.

China can either be a totalitarian society or a space-faring one. It would be difficult to be both.

The United States, on the other hand, suffers from its own self-inflicted handicap, that being a form of ADD where space policy is concerned. Within the past 15 years, NASA has been instructed to go back to the moon and on to Mars, then bypass the moon and go to Mars, perhaps with a stop at an asteroid, then back to the moon and on to Mars again.

Successful space programs also require focus and a long-term commitment that lasts across several presidencies and congresses. Space races are not won by themselves. They take effort.

The danger of yet another course change may come as a result of the Democratic takeover of the House. John Culberson, a space exploration advocate who led the appropriations subcommittee that funded NASA, was defeated by Lizzie Fletcher, who ousted the former congressman with a pair of blatant anti-science commercials.

Rep. Bernice Johnson, who is due to chair the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, seems more interested in climate change than in returning to the moon. She will be replacing Lamar Smith, a climate change skeptic and a champion of space exploration.

In short, a small but more than zero chance has arisen that House Democrats will try to curtail or even cancel the third attempt to return to the moon in about 30 years. Opposition to human space flight runs deep in the Democratic Party, since the attempts by Democratic Wisconsin Sen. William Proxmire to cut funding for the Apollo program in the early 1960s.

More recently. Rep. Bob Traxler, D-Michigan, tried to cancel the space station project more than once. Democrats were responsible for killing both President George H. W. Bush’s Space Exploration Initiative and President George W. Bush’s Constellation program.

Of course, one cannot discount the intense hatred most Democrats feel for President Donald Trump, a loathing that goes beyond political differences or even personality conflicts, staggering into the realm of religious fervor. Just as many Democrats have flip-flopped on the border wall solely because it is Trump’s project, they may well decide that a return to the moon is anathema because the president proposed it.

NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, a former congressman who knows some of the new players of space policy in the new Congress, will have his work cut out for him. Bridenstine will need all of his political skills and diplomatic acumen to steer the back-to-the-moon program safety through the new reality in the House. America’s future status as a superpower and the course of the Sino-American struggle for dominance will depend on it.

No pressure.

"‘Come On, Man’: Biden Dismisses China Threat To The US","Former Vice President Joe Biden dismissed China as a potential threat to the United States during a Wednesday campaign event in Iowa, stating that China “isn’t in competition for us.”

“China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man,” Biden said at the event in Iowa City, adding that “they’re not competition for us.”

“They can’t even figure out how to deal with the fact that they have this great division between the China Sea and the mountains in the east, I mean in the west,” Biden argued. “They can’t figure out how they are going to deal with the corruption that exists within the system. I mean, you know, they’re not bad folks, folks. But guess what, they’re not competition for us.”

WATCH:

Biden’s position on China puts him at direct odds with President Donald Trump, who was repeatedly warned that China is taking advantage of the United States with its tariff policy. Trump has spent a significant portion of his presidency attempting to negotiate a trade deal with the global superpower that more greatly benefits U.S. workers, all while threatening China with heftier tariffs. (RELATED: China’s Economy Hits A Low Not Seen Since 1990 Amid Tariff Fight With Trump)

At the same time, the United States and its allies have accused China of stealing trade secrets and technology from countries around the world.

“China’s goal, simply put, is to replace the U.S. as the world’s leading superpower, and they’re using illegal methods to get there,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said in December.

UPDATE (7:22 pm):

This article has been updated with video of Biden’s remarks and additional quotes.

Biden Attempts To Walk Back China’s ‘Not Competition’ Remarks,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Saturday clarified remarks he made about China not being an economic threat to the U.S. last week.

“I don’t suggest China is not a problem. I’m the guy who’s been the toughest on – I’ve spent more time with Xi Jinping than anybody else, just because the nature of my job,” Biden said during a fundraiser at the home of Richard “Dick” Harpootlian, an attorney and former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman in Columbia, South Carolina.

“He’s got problems, he’s got gigantic problems. Doesn’t mean he’s not a threat, doesn’t mean they’re not a threat,” Biden added.

Last Wednesday, while campaigning in Iowa, Biden argued that China, the world’s second-largest economy, was “not competition” for the United States. (RELATED: Biden Calls Trump A ‘Clown’ Before Saying He Won’t Get Into A Mud Fight With Him)

“China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man,” Biden said. “They can’t even figure out how to deal with the fact that they have this great division between the China Sea and the mountains in the east, I mean in the west.”

Biden continued, “They can’t figure out how they’re going to deal with the corruption that exists within the system. I mean, you know, they’re not bad folks, folks. But guess what, they’re not, they’re not competition for us.”

Although Biden made similar comments in the past, his Wednesday remarks drew rebukes from not just Republicans but also Democrats.

“It’s wrong to pretend that China isn’t one of our major economic competitors,” the Sanders campaign tweeted. “When we are in the White House we will win that competition by fixing our trade policies.”

Since the China trade deal I voted against, America has lost over 3 million manufacturing jobs. It’s wrong to pretend that China isn’t one of our major economic competitors. When we are in the White House we will win that competition by fixing our trade policies. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) May 2, 2019

Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan called Biden “stunningly out of touch.”

President Donald Trump campaigned on changing U.S. trade policy with China. This past week he attempted to compel the Asian country to strike a deal with his administration by doubling tariffs on $200 billion of China’s sales to the U.S.

"Disney Threatens To Boycott Georgia But Partners With China, Which Puts Muslims In Internment Camps","The Walt Disney Company is considering boycotting Georgia over its new abortion law, even as Disney profits from doing business in China, a notorious human rights violator that is putting Muslims in internment camps.

Disney CEO Bob Iger told Reuters on Thursday the company is likely to cease filming in Georgia if the pro-life law takes effect.

“I think many people who work for us will not want to work there, and we will have to heed their wishes in that regard,” Iger said. “Right now we are watching it very carefully.”

“If [the bill] becomes law, I don’t see how it’s practical for us to continue to shoot there,” Iger said.

Disney apparently has no issue with doing business in China, which has undertaken mass detentions of Uighur Muslims, placing them in internment camps.

Disney opened a $5.5 billion resort in Shanghai, China, in 2016. Iger called Shanghai Disney the company’s “greatest opportunity since buying land in Florida.” Disney partnered with a state-owned company, Shanghai Shendi Group, for the resort.

“With its growing middle class, China is a particularly important growth market for Disney,” The New York Times reported in November 2018.

Chinese authorities in 2018 “dramatically stepped up repression and systematic abuses against the 13 million Turkic Muslims, including Uyghurs and ethnic Kazakhs, in China’s northwestern Xinjiang region,” Human Rights Watch noted in its annual report on China.

“Authorities have carried out mass arbitrary detention, torture, and mistreatment of some of them in various detention facilities, and increasingly imposed pervasive controls on daily life,” the watchdog group’s report said.

Chinese authorities in March implied it would not cease operating its internment camps until the country has no more Muslims to put in the camps.

The Daily Caller News Foundation reached out to Disney’s press team to inquire whether the company sees any contradiction in potentially boycotting Georgia while continuing to profit from its Chinese partnership. (RELATED: IHOP Boycotts Tucker Carlson But Not Saudi Arabia)

TheDCNF did not receive a response by press time.

Disney also filmed movies in Middle Eastern countries with stricter abortion laws than the Georgia bill. Disney recently filmed movies in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, as the Washington Free Beacon first noted.

Report: Google And Other Big Tech Giants Are Bailing On China As Trump’s Tariffs Take Hold,"Google is moving technology out of China as the Silicon Valley company seeks to avoid pain from U.S. tariffs and a hostile Beijing, Bloomberg reported Tuesday night.

Google is shifting production of server hardware out of the communist nation and moving motherboards to Taiwan, as the company tries to avert pain from a 25% tariff, the report notes, citing anonymous sources. Other big tech companies are reportedly following suit and shifting production out of China and back to the U.S.

Wistron Corp, a Taiwanese firm that makes servers for Facebook and Microsoft, also said Wednesday that it too is looking to shift production away from China and perhaps to the U.S., according to the report. The company’s chairman, Simon Lin, didn’t specify which products were moving. (RELATED: Trump Floating More China Tariffs If XI Doesn’t Sit Down At G20)

Domestic and foreign companies are fleeing China amid President Donald Trump’s efforts to remake traditional global trade and manufacturing alignments. Google is no exception. The Silicon Valley giant announced in March it’s creating a new campus in Taipei and expanding staff on the island.

News of Google’s moves come after the company decided in May to distance itself from Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications company the U.S. believes is engaged in foreign espionage. Huawei will reportedly lose access to updates to the Android operating system, as well as the next version of Google’s smartphones.

Trump signed an executive order in May that would effectively ban certain types of technologies from foreign countries deemed a national security threat to the U.S. The president’s administration is also applying pressure on Britain and others to shy away from using Huawei to build out its fifth generation network. Google has not responded to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment about the report. Follow Chris White on Facebook and Twitter

Elite American Institutions Keep Bowing To Communist China… Over And Over Again,"America’s elite institutions are catering to communist China.

The NBA provided the latest example Sunday night, when league commissioner Adam Silver apologized for Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey’s tweet in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. Rockets star James Harden followed suit and apologized to China for Morey’s tweets.

The Brooklyn Nets’ new billionaire owner, Joseph Tsai, slammed Morey in a Facebook post Sunday night. Tsai, the co-founder of Chinese internet titan Alibaba, described Morey’s tweet as “so damaging to the relationship with our fans in China,” adding that “the hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.”

China Daily, the communist government’s propaganda arm, used the NBA’s conciliatory reaction to warn other companies to learn “a lesson: The big Chinese market is open to the world, but those who challenge China’s core interests and hurt Chinese people’s feelings cannot make any profit from it.”

The NBA isn’t alone in bowing to communist China.

American universities have allowed the Chinese government to fund centers called Confucius Institutes that provide the communist regime with avenues to infuse pro-China propaganda into American academia. Eighty-nine Confucius Institutes were operating in the U.S. as of September 2019, according to the National Association of Scholars.

Hollywood has self-censored for years in order to ensure access to the Chinese market. The U.S. government published a report in 2015 detailing how filmmakers tailor their messaging to appease Chinese audiences and—more importantly—Chinese government censors.

“U.S. filmmakers self-censor scenes, dialogue, images, and themes they fear will jeopardize their film’s chance of receiving Chinese approval for import,” stated the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s report, titled, “Directed by Hollywood, Edited by China.”

“For a type of movie, particularly the global blockbusters, they are not going to go and make something that the Chinese would reject for social or political reasons,” Peter Shiao, the CEO of an “independent Hollywood-Chinese coproduction studio,” told the commission.

MGM Studios digitally altered the 2012 remake of “Red Dawn” to change the invading army’s nationality from Chinese—as was the case during filming—to North Korean.

The Walt Disney Company threatened to boycott Georgia in May if a pro-life law took effect, even though the company apparently has no issue doing business with the Chinese regime, which is a notorious human rights violator. (RELATED: IHOP Boycotts Tucker Carlson But Not Saudi Arabia)

Athletic apparel giant Nike pulled a shoe line from Chinese markets in June after the shoes’ designer tweeted support for the Hong Kong protesters. “Nike’s appeasement of China fits into a larger and more dangerous pattern of kowtowing by Western companies to Beijing’s demands for censorship,” the Washington Post’s editorial board warned at the time.

The NFL is apparently looking to emulate the NBA in accessing Chinese revenue streams. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell described China in January as a “priority market.”

“China is a priority market for the NFL,” Goodell said. “We believe that our game has a great deal of potential to expand to grow and bring new fans into our game.”

“We have had double-digit growth this past year in China in our fan base and people engaging with our game,” he added. “So we are excited by it.”

Priest Imprisoned For Nine Years After Calling Chinese Communist Party ‘Morally Incompatible With The Christian Faith’,"A Chinese court sentenced a priest to prison for nine years Monday after the priest called the Chinese Communist Party “morally incompatible with the Christian faith.”

The court sentenced 46-year-old Pastor Wang Yi, who led the Protestant Early Rain Covenant Church in the Chinese city of Chengdu, for incitement of subversion of state power and for illegal business operations, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Chinese government often uses those charges against religious leaders and against those who disagree politically with the government, according to the WSJ.

Wang wrote a 2018 essay titled “Meditations on the Religious War” in which he wrote that the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party is “morally incompatible with the Christian faith and with all those who uphold freedom of the mind and thought.” (RELATED: 6-Year-Old Discovers Plea From Chinese Prisoners In Christmas Card)

Wang’s church had been one of the most politically active churches in China for years, holding a service every year commemorating the 1989 massacre at Tiananmen Square, even though the government severely restricts the observance of this massacre, the WSJ reports. But the church was closed in 2018 as the Chinese government cracked down on religious houses of worship.

Early Rain Covenant Church released a statement from Wang on Monday morning that is not dated and seems to be from before Wang’s trial.

“Regardless of what crime the government charges me with … it is merely a lie and temptation of demons,” Wang wrote, according to the WSJ. “I categorically deny it. I will serve my sentence, but I will not serve the law.”

News of Wang’s sentence comes after 403 pages of leaked documents obtained by The New York Times showing that top Chinese officials’ demands led to the creation of mass indoctrination camps of groups like Uyghurs Muslims and Kazakhs. The secretive camps originated at the demands of officials including Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Is This Objectively Disgusting Soup What’s Causing China’s Disease Outbreak?,"A recent outbreak in China of a new strand of coronavirus may be linked to an objectively disgusting Chinese delicacy called bat soup, according to reports.

Video footage online shows an entire cooked, dead bat sitting in soup. Scientists believe that the virus, which has killed 17 and infected over 640 people, could have spread from snakes or bats. Is this bat soup the cause of the quickly-spreading virus? (RELATED: Measles Outbreak Is Wreaking Havoc, Officials Report 71 New Cases)

The video footage has not been verified, although bats are used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat various illnesses, according to the Daily Mail. Multiple videos have been published online showing people eating the bats sitting in soup, the Daily Mail noted.

“Eat the meat! [Don’t] eat the skin,” a man in one of the videos reportedly says. “[You] should eat the meat on its back.”

Twitter Won’t Remove Chinese Official’s Tweet Suggesting US Army Introduced Virus Into Wuhan,"A Chinese official’s tweets suggesting the U.S. Army is responsible for injecting coronavirus into Wuhan, China, will not be removed, a Twitter spokesman told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

A tweet from Chinese politician Lijian Zhao suggesting the United States is trying to keep secret a plan to inject the virus into China does not violate Twitter rules, a company spokesman said. The spokesman reiterated the company’s existing rules but did not provide a reason for speaking anonymously.

Zhao is deputy director of China’s Foreign Ministry Information Department.

Zhao falsely stated in a Thursday tweet that Centers For Disease Control Robert Redfield was “arrested” before floating the conspiracy theory to his 317,000 followers. (RELATED: Chinese Official Blames US For Introducing Coronavirus To Wuhan, Says US ‘Owes Us An Explanation’)

WATCH:

“When did Patient Zero appear in the United States? How many people are infected? What is the name of the hospital?” he said in the tweet. “It may be that the US military brought the epidemic to Wuhan.”

Zhao added: “America needs to be transparent! The United States owes us an explanation!”

The first case of coronavirus, or COVID-19, is believed to have appeared December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The virus has spread since February to 36 other countries and territories and has a global death toll of 3,041, according to the CDC‘s numbers.

Deaths from the virus in China hit 811 on Feb. 9, surpassing the number of patients who died from SARS, China’s National Health Commission noted at the time. China has reported roughly 80,000 cases since February, though the number of cases in the country appears to be declining.

Twitter’s decision to decline action came after the company announced in June 2019 that it will begin labeling and down ranking politicians’ most vitriolic tweets, a move that could affect how President Donald Trump promotes his message.

The label applies to all verified political candidates and officials with more than 100,000 followers, Twitter noted in a blog post. Users who want to view flagged content must click on a screen that says Twitter’s rules against abusive behavior apply to the tweet.

The Trump administration asked big tech companies on Wednesday to help stomp out misinformation and conspiracy theories related to coronavirus. Twitter was among those companies that attended a conference addressing misinformation with White House officials.

“With a critical mass of expert organizations, official government accounts, health professionals, and epidemiologists on Twitter, our goal is to elevate and amplify authoritative health information on our service,” Twitter spokesman Trenton Kennedy said in a statement following the conference.

EXCLUSIVE: Group Of Republican Congressmen Send Letter To Pompeo Demanding China Be Held Accountable For Coronavirus Spread,"A group of Republican congressmen sent a letter Thursday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo demanding China be held accountable for the spread of the coronavirus.

“Misinformation from China over the past several months has severely crippled global action to combat the global pandemic and undermined efforts by the State Department to work with other nations around the world to bring a swift end to this crisis,” they wrote.

The letter was sent a day after U.S. intelligence confirmed that China falsified data related to the virus outbreak. (RELATED: Trump Campaign Donates Meals To Hospitals During Coronavirus Spread)

“Communist China lied about their data, destroyed evidence, and allowed the Wuhan virus to spread around the world. China arrested the very doctors who tried to warn the world about what was happening, and other whistleblowers have gone missing,” Republican Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar told the Daily Caller. “China’s deception and misinformation campaign cost the global community valuable time to mitigate the spread of the Wuhan virus, and they should be held accountable for unleashing this virus on the world.”

“For years people have speculated whether, in the long run, an open and democratic society like ours is truly better than a closed and authoritarian system like China’s,” Republican South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman told the Daily Caller. “Today the answer is once again evident; that transparency and accountability saves lives. With 50,000 worldwide deaths and counting, the price of censorship is unconscionable.”

The coronavirus pandemic has lead to nearly 5,000 deaths in the U.S. and has brought economic activity in the country to a halt.

“Our first priority in Congress is to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. We also have an obligation to challenge China for their deceit and misinformation campaign,” Republican North Dakota Rep. Kelly Armstrong told the Daily Caller. “We must ensure the Chinese Communist Party is not using this global health crisis to their advantage now or in the future.”

The Chinese Communist Party has also orchestrated a propaganda campaign attempting to place blame on the U.S. for the pandemic.

“The Chinese Communist regime has made this problem exponentially worse by not being truthful about the contagiousness and dangerousness of COVID-19, instead engaging in a campaign of blame-shifting, misinformation, and propaganda,” Republican Rep. Fred Keller told the Daily Caller. “It is imperative we learn more about the depth of China’s deceit to determine how best to hold them accountable for their part in exacerbating this pandemic.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2020/04/02/congressman-china-communist-coronavirus-pompeo/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjN587porP9AhXDslYBHYJBDcg4ZBAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw24jMV5aohIBegHpDLBl85N,2020-04-02
China’s Main Spox Pushed Wild Conspiracy Theories With An Army Of Twitter Accounts Behind Him: Study,"One of China’s top spokesmen has led an army of Chinese officials on Twitter elevating conspiracy theories suggesting the United States military started the coronavirus pandemic, according to a recent study.

Zhao Lijian was one of the first Chinese officials on Twitter to push a theory suggesting the virus originated at a U.S. Army base that houses and researches infectious diseases, according to data collected by the Alliance for Securing Democracy. The theory accelerated after Chinese embassy accounts in France and Jordan retweeted Zhao’s post, the data show.

The Chinese accounts “have become more aggressive, more conspiratorial, and the ones who have done that are their most popular accounts and have by far the most engagement,” Bret Schafer, the digital disinformation fellow at the alliance, told NBC News. Schafer’s group created the Hamilton 2.0 dashboard to aggregate Chinese and Russian Twitter accounts.

China has posted 90,000 tweets mentioning the pandemic since the beginning of April from 200 diplomatic and state-run media accounts, data from the dashboard shows. Schafer’s analysis also shows that Twitter content from Chinese accounts doubled since January. (RELATED: Twitter Won’t Remove Chinese Official’s Tweet Suggesting US Army Introduced Virus Into Wuhan)

Zhao, the spokesman and deputy director of the Foreign Ministry’s Information Department, tweeted in early March that, “It might be the US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.” He also falsely suggested in the tweet that Centers For Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield was “arrested.”

He doubled down the next day, telling his Twitter followers on March 13: “Further evidence that the virus originated in the US,” before linking to a blog post suggesting the virus leaked from Fort Detrick, a U.S. military base that houses a facility where researchers research infectious diseases. This tweet has been retweeted more than 12,600 times and liked 20,000 times.

Other Chinese accounts followed his lead. Hua Chunying, the spokeswoman for the Foreign Affairs Ministry, said in a May 8 tweet that Fort Detrick should be investigated. Nine other Chinese accounts picked up the tweet in the days that followed, according to Schafer, including Zhao’s account.

Twitter has not removed Hua and Zhao’s tweets, and a company spokeswoman previously told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the tweets do not violate company policy, but they can be subject to a new policy that applies labels warning users that the content is misinformation.

The first case of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, is believed to have appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, before spreading since February to more than 40 countries and territories and has a global death toll of 315,000. World leaders want answers.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, for instance, is among a handful of world leaders pushing China and other nations to join the probe into the virus to help prevent future outbreaks.

“I think this is for all of us important, I mean for the whole world it is important,” von der Leyen told CNBC during a May 1 interview.

"Chinese Propaganda Outlet Has Paid US Newspapers $19 Million For Advertising, Printing","One of China’s main propaganda outlets has paid American newspapers nearly $19 million for advertising and printing expenses over the past four years, according to documents filed with the Justice Department.

China Daily, an English-language newspaper controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, has paid more than $4.6 million to The Washington Post and nearly $6 million to The Wall Street Journal since November 2016, the records show.

Both newspapers have published paid supplements that China Daily produces called “China Watch.” The inserts are designed to look like real news articles, though they often contain a pro-Beijing spin on contemporary news events.

One insert from September 2018 touted an initiative pushed by Chinese President Xi Jinping with the headline: “Belt and Road aligns with African nations.” The same insert ran a story titled “Tariffs to take toll on U.S. homebuyers” that asserted that U.S. tariffs on Chinese lumber would raise the cost of building homes in the United States.

China Daily also paid for advertising in several other newspapers: The New York Times ($50,000), Foreign Policy ($240,000), The Des Moines Register ($34,600) and CQ-Roll Call ($76,000).

It spent a total of $11,002,628 on advertising in U.S. newspapers, and another $265,822 on advertising with Twitter.

China Daily has also paid out more than $7.6 million to newspapers and printing companies for its newspaper for U.S.-based readers, the Justice Department’s filings show. (RELATED: PBS Stations That Received Millions In Federal Funds Partnered With Chinese Foreign Agent On Pro-Beijing Film)

The Los Angeles Times, The Seattle Times, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The Chicago Tribune, The Houston Chronicle and The Boston Globe are all listed as clients of China Daily. The Chinese outlet paid the Los Angeles Times $657,523 for printing services, according to the FARA filings.

The Justice Department has for years required China Daily to disclose its activities semi-annually under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). The most recent filing, which China Daily submitted on June 1, is the first to include detailed breakdowns of payments to American news outlets. The outlet disclosed those expenditures for the period between November 2016 and April 2020. (RELATED: Chinese Propaganda Has Influenced The Daily Mail’s Coronavirus Coverage)

It is unclear if China Daily submitted the more detailed filings under pressure from the Justice Department or on its own.

Pro-democracy groups have long warned about the Chinese government’s attempts to push propaganda through American news outlets. Freedom House and the Hoover Institution have both drawn attention to China Daily’s paid inserts in reports on the Chinese government’s efforts to influence the media.

China Daily and other Beijing-controlled propaganda mills have come under intense scrutiny amid the coronavirus pandemic. Chinese government officials have tried to divert blame for the spread of the virus to the United States and other Western nations. Many of the regime-controlled outlets, including China Daily, have echoed the communist leaders’ talking points.

China Daily has slowed its advertising expenditures in recent months, the filings show. China Daily last paid The Washington Post for advertising in December 2019. Its payments to The Wall Street Journal have been less than half their average amount since February 2020, the documents show.

China Daily did not respond to a request for comment.

"TikTok Could Become A Powerful Propaganda Tool If It Stays With China, Experts Warn","China could use TikTok as a powerful propaganda tool if ByteDance, its China-based parent company, retains ownership, according to national security analysts and China experts.

The authoritarian regime could suppress or promote content to benefit the Chinese Communist Party, the experts said. Data collected through the app could be used to create propaganda, they went on to say.

TikTok has denied that it’s beholden to China, and Microsoft is in talks to purchase the app.

TikTok could become a powerful propaganda tool capable of shifting American public opinion if it remains in the hands of its Chinese parent company, national security analysts and China experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The authoritarian regime could use data collected through TikTok to produce more targeted, and consequently, effective propaganda, the experts, who favored banning the app, said. The app could also be used to influence U.S. politics, spy on the nation, or suppress or promote content to benefit the Chinese Communist Party.

“You could influence political behavior or engage in information environment-shaping, or propaganda. All these things can be done, and have been done,” Stephen Yates, CEO of the public policy consultancy firm DC International Advisory, said of a foreign country’s ability to use social media platforms as weapons.

TikTok has faced increased scrutiny across both the U.S. government as well as private industry, and President Donald Trump floated banning the app. Microsoft is in preliminary talks to purchase TikTok from its parent company, ByteDance, the software company confirmed Sunday.

Suppressing and promoting content

China could control what content users see on the app, suppressing videos that are critical of the authoritarian regime or amplifying ones it finds beneficial, according to Yates.

While TikTok is primarily known for its use among Generation Z to create and view dance and comedy videos, the app has already reportedly influenced U.S. politics on at least one occasion.

TikTok users coordinated an effort to get people who didn’t intend on attending a Trump campaign rally in Tulsa sign up for it, CNN reported in June. One TikTok post urging fans of Korean pop to sign up for June rally received over 100,000 likes. Mary Jo Laupp, a 51-year-old women in Iowa, reportedly kickstarted the troll campaign.

Laupp’s video encouraging people to register for free tickets to the rally garnered more than 2 million views. The Trump campaign disputed the claims, saying it weeds out phony registrations.

Yet demonstrations in Hong Kong that received worldwide attention were barely mentioned on TikTok, according to a Washington Post report.

A hashtag used to identify posts showing resistance to an extradition bill supposedly designed to weaken Hong Kong autonomy, #antielab, had only 11 posts on TikTok, but collected more than 34,000 posts on Instagram at the time of reporting. Meanwhile, Hashtags for #HongKongProtests on TikTok returned either a single video or an error message telling users that TikTok could not “find this hashtag: Check out trending videos.”

TikTok also directed moderators to censor content that mentions Tiananmen Square and Tibetan independence and banned religious groups, The Guardian reported in 2019, citing leaked documents highlighting the app’s moderation guidelines.

The app could similarly suppress content regarding China’s treatment of Uighurs, Yates told the DCNF. Numerous reports have shown Uighurs being held in concentration camps and being subjected to forced sterilization.

Comparing TikTok To Facebook

Yates, a foreign policy expert who worked as a deputy national security adviser to former Vice President Dick Cheney, compared TikTok’s potential political influence to how Russia used Facebook posts and advertisements to disrupt the U.S. political system ahead of the 2016 election.

The Russian government spread disinformation to users on a variety of social media platforms during the last presidential election cycle. Facebook gave Congress roughly 3,000 ads in 2017 with links to Russia. The company said it sold $100,000 worth of ads to Russian-linked sources that investigators believe were trying to influence the the 2016 election.

But when it comes to data collection, TikTok and Facebook can’t be equated, according to Yates.

Washington Post tech columnist Geoffrey Fowler argued on a July 13 that much of the concerns related to TikTok’s alleged privacy violations are driven by “xenophobia” and compared its data collection to Facebook, which owns Instagram.

“This would be a commercial and political communication platform that gives a hostile power access to people’s cell phones and computers in which their entire lives have become dependent,” Yates said of TikTok. The app is totally “within China’s sphere of influence,” he added.

And Matt Stoller, the Research Director at the American Economic Liberties Project, told the DCNF that the difference between a company like Facebook and TikTok is that one is “controlled by a greedy American” corporation, while the “other is controlled by a genocidal regime hostile to liberal democracy.”

TikTok’s executives have also managed to avoid U.S. oversight.

TikTok executives “couldn’t attend hearings and testify because executives were located in #China,” Sen. Josh Hawley tweeted in May. He linked to a report that a former Disney executive, Kevin Mayer, would become the app’s new CEO.

“But this new executive lives in the USA,” the Missouri Republican continued. “I look forward to hearing from him. Under oath.”

Meanwhile, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, along with the CEOs of Google, Apple and Amazon, testified before the House Judiciary’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law on July 29 over lawmaker concerns that they are building their empires through anti-competitive methods.

Potential collaboration with China

TikTok has the potential to be used as a spying tool for China, according to Dan Blumenthal, the director of Asian Studies at the American Enterprise Institute. (RELATED: TikTok Hires Former GOP And Democratic Congressional Staffers To Lobby On US Policy Ahead Of The Election)

“The Chinese are building a mass of information about the U.S. including a ‘human network map’ that makes connections it deems important among U.S. financial, corporate, policy media and political elites,” Blumenthal, who supports banning the app, told the DCNF. “This is both for espionage purposes as well as for purposes of influencing U.S. politics.”

Blumenthal did not elaborate on how such data could be used to spy on Americans.

But China’s National Intelligence Law gives the government authority to compel Chinese companies to collect and provide any information it requests, including data on foreign users, Quartz reported in 2017. The law makes spying a duty for Chinese companies, Yi-Zheng Lian, a former chief editor of the Hong Kong Economic Journal, wrote in a 2019 New York Times editorial.

The Australian Strategic Policy Institute reported in 2019 that ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, worked alongside the Chinese Communist Party to enforce the country’s strict censorship laws.

ByteDance “engaged in deeply unethical behavior in Xinjiang, where their work directly supports and enables mass human rights abuses,” the report, titled “Mapping China’s Tech Giants,” said. Xinjiang contains concentration camps where Uighers are held and forced into labor.

“ByteDance collaborates with public security bureaus across China, including in Xinjiang where it plays an active role in disseminating the party-state’s propaganda on Xinjiang,” the report stated. ByteDance also established a joint venture in December 2019 with a Chinese state media group, Shanghai Dongfang Newspaper Company, Reuters reported in 2019.

Additionally, Check Point Research found vulnerabilities in the app that could allow cyber attackers to gain control of TikTok accounts, change the privacy settings on videos, upload videos without permission and obtain email addresses of select users.

The app collects troves of data on users, according to the company’s privacy policy. If a user downloads and opens an app without ever creating an account, for instance, then TikTok can collect a user’s IP address, browsing history on the app, mobile carrier, location data when using a mobile device and information on the device used to gain access to TikTok.

Once a user creates an account, TikTok can gather details about every video a user uploads, the length of time he or she watches a video, what type of content he or she like the most, which videos are shared, and any messages a user exchanges on the app. The app’s portal also asks users for permission to access other social media accounts, their phone number contact list, and geolocation data.

‘We are not the enemy’

Yates, Blumenthal and Stoller made their comments before TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer addressed concerns about data, before Trump threatened to ban TikTok and before the notion of Microsoft purchasing the app became public.

“TikTok has become the latest target, but we are not the enemy,” Mayer wrote Wednesday. He said TikTok will address concerns about “the company’s Chinese origins” “through greater transparency and accountability.”

Mayer did not address what the company would do if China demanded user data. But TikTok dismisses claims that the company is beholden to the authoritarian regime.

“Our security team is led out of the U.S. by our Chief Information Security Officer who has 30-years of Department of Defense and financial services industry experience,” a company spokesperson said in a statement to the DCNF. “TikTok collects much less U.S. user information than many of the companies in our space and stores it in the U.S. and Singapore.”

The app launched what company executives called a transparency center in Los Angeles to allow government officials to monitor TikTok’s content review process, the company noted in a March blog post.

U.S. officials have reported evidence that TikTok is providing personal user data to the CCP. The company is under national security review, Reuters reported Wednesday.

Increasing scrutiny

Regardless, companies often use personal data to dramatically influence how people behave and think, according to researchers at Cracked Lab, an independent research institute based in Austria that measures how information networks impact human thinking.

“[D]ata-driven persuasion undermines the concept of rational choice and thus the basic foundation of market economy,” the group’s researchers wrote in a 2017 report, referring to methods and techniques tech companies use to manipulate users into engaging with content. “When used in political campaigns or in other efforts to shape public policy, it may undermine democracy at large.”

A bipartisan slate of lawmakers and U.S. officials have determined TikTok is a major threat. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for example, suggested during in a July 7 Fox News interview that Americans should download the app “only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, asked the U.S. intelligence community in 2019 to assess TikTok’s national security risks, saying that such apps could be used to spy on U.S. citizens or become targets of foreign influence. Hawley also wants officials to more closely scrutinize the Chinese app.

Companies, governmental bodies, and U.S. political campaigns are asking employees to delete the app.

Wells Fargo told employees to delete the app amid what executives said were concerns about security, CNN reported on July 13. Former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign also directed staffers to stop using TikTok over security concerns, Bloomberg reported.

The Department of Defense also advised military personnel in January to remove the app for similar reasons, The New York Times reported.

But a federal ban of the app is too extreme, according to Peter Micek, a digital human rights expert at Access Now, a digital rights nonprofit.

“[B]anning apps is an extreme measure that does not meet international human rights standards,” Micek told Vice on July 15. “Under international human rights law, blocking an entire service or application is not regarded as necessary and proportionate and has been declared unlawful in several instances.”

Much of the concerns related to TikTok’s ties to China can be solved through comprehensive data protection regulations, Micek argued. The General Data Protection Regulation, a European Union law passed in 2016, gives social media users control over their own personal data, ZDNet reported in 2019.

The law requires companies that gather a person’s personal information to disclose the data they collect, declare the reason for processing such data, and explicitly state how long the information will be retained, ZDNet noted. Companies must also explain if any data is being redirected to third-party groups.

Conversely, Stoller supports banning the Chinese app.

“It’s hard to convey just what a yawning gap there is between elite opinion and the obvious right thing to do. The [People’s Republic of China] is a dangerous expansionist threat. Literally the least we could do is not allow them to manipulate tens of millions of Americans,” he wrote in a July 20 tweet, referring to critics of banning the application.

Beijing-Controlled News Outlet Paid US Newspapers Millions To Publish Propaganda This Year,"An English-language newspaper controlled by the Chinese Communist Party’s propaganda department paid U.S. media companies nearly $2 million for printing and advertising expenses over the past six months, even amid heightened scrutiny over Beijing’s disinformation efforts in the West.

China Daily paid The Wall Street Journal more than $85,000 and the Los Angeles Times $340,000 for advertising campaigns between May and October 2020, according to a disclosure that the propaganda mill filed this week with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).

China Daily also paid Foreign Policy magazine $100,000, The Financial Times, a U.K.-based newspaper, $223,710, and $132,046 to the Canadian outlet Globe & Mail for advertising campaigns, according to the filing.

The Beijing-based outlet paid several newspaper companies a total of $1,154,666 for printing costs, including $110,000 to the Los Angeles Times, $92,000 to The Houston Chronicle and $76,000 to The Boston Globe. (RELATED: China Watch: LA Times Publishes Paid Chinese Propaganda)

Overall, China Daily spent more than $4.4 million on printing, distribution, advertising and administration expenses over the past six months, according to the FARA filing.

China Daily, which is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party’s State Council Information Office, its propaganda agency, has for years paid newspapers and magazines in the U.S. and other Western countries to publish advertorials designed to look like legitimate news articles.

China Daily paid The Washington Post more than $4.6 million from late 2016 through October 2019, according to a FARA disclosure China Daily filed in June.

The Journal received $6 million for advertorials from 2016 through April 2020, according to the disclosure.

So far in 2020, The Journal has received $461,489 in advertising revenue from China Daily.

China Daily’s inserts, which are entitled “China Watch,” have typically offered a pro-Beijing spin regarding the Chinese economy, Chinese culture or China’s geopolitical views.

The Journal, which maintains a website of its sponsored China Daily content, includes numerous articles first published by China Daily touting Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in Wuhan last year.

“Apple CEO: China Getting Outbreak Under Control” is the title of one article on the Journal’s site.

Several articles are critical of U.S. officials who have accused the Chinese government of misleading the West about the pandemic, and allowing the virus to spread globally.

“Trump’s China Remark Rebuked” and “US Spin On Virus’ Name Condemned” are the headlines of two articles on the Journal’s site.

The Journal has not published any articles on its sponsored page since July. China Daily’s FARA filing does not list any payments to the newspaper since the month ending June 30, 2020.

Some American newspapers have cut ties with China Daily in response to the criticism of the pay-for-print arrangements. The Washington Free Beacon reported in August that The New York Times quietly scrubbed its website of advertorials it had published as part of a deal it had with China Daily.

In February, the State Department designated China Daily and four other Beijing-controlled news outlets to be “foreign missions,” which treats them the same as foreign embassies because of their close ties to the Chinese government.

The Wall Street Journal did not respond to a request for comment about its relationship with China Daily. The Los Angeles Times also did not respond to a request for comment.

Why Aren’t We Talking More About China’s ‘Gain Of Function’ Coronavirus Research?,"More than a year since its beginning, the true origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is still unknown, but investigations into the matter have uncovered new questions about a scientific practice known as “gain-of-function” research.

Most of the scientific community still contends that the novel coronavirus wreaking havoc on the world is of natural origin. Others argue gain-of-function (GoF) research may have potentially played a role, though, and critics have warned for years the field was dangerous enough to cause a pandemic.

The simplest explanation of GoF research is that it is the process of taking a disease and making it more dangerous for some kind of scientific benefit. It can take a variety of forms, but the desired outcome is typically to make a disease more contagious, more deadly or both. (RELATED: These Members Of Congress Have Tested Positive For COVID-19 Since The Capitol Riot)

This is primarily done for one of two reasons: to aid in the development of medical remedies such as vaccines and to explore the potential capabilities of certain biological entities as weapons. The National Institutes of Health identify GoF research as a dual-use technology. Nuclear weapons and energy, artificial intelligence, and rocket technologies are just some of the other areas of research which share that categorization.

There are clear benevolent motivations for GoF research. Exploring the ways viruses can do more damage to humans, how they interact with certain organisms or environments and developing medical solutions against the strongest possible threats are all plausible justifications for GoF work that could help scientists better combat dangerous pandemics.

The risks are evident too, though, and many researchers have expressed concern about the field as a result. Not only is the development of disease for potential use as a weapon ethically questionable and potentially dangerous, but accidents can happen too. Human error will always be present in any endeavor, and numerous dangerous pathogens have been accidentally released from a lab setting throughout history.

Even with the precise origins of the COVID-19 pandemic still unclear, there are known connections between GoF research and the coronavirus. It’s well established that the NIH, under the direction of Dr. Anthony Fauci, has been funding GoF research via grants for years. Among the researchers who have gotten a piece of that U.S. taxpayer pie are the ones at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).

“What happened was fairly simple, I’ve come to believe. It was an accident. A virus spent some time in a laboratory, and eventually it got out.”@nicholsonbaker8 explores the disturbing possibility that the pandemic was the result of a lab accident https://t.co/dKgxU8XMYk — Intelligencer (@intelligencer) January 9, 2021

The WIV is home to China’s only biosafety level 4 laboratory. It’s also roughly 20 miles from the Huanan seafood wet market in Wuhan, thought to be the first “super-spreader” location of the pandemic. The WIV has long done research on coronaviruses, specifically coming from bats. China’s famous “bat-woman,” Dr. Shi Zhengli, conducts her work at the WIV.

An example of the GoF work done at the WIV can be found in 2015, when researchers engineered a hybrid version of bat coronavirus and SARS that could infect humans. At the time, critics wondered whether or not the scientific benefits of learning more about the ways bat coronavirus could evolve were worth the risk of engineering a new, dangerous pathogen.

There is some, at the very least circumstantial, evidence that GoF research performed at the WIV may be connected to the novel coronavirus now responsible for killing millions across the world. Nicholson Baker’s New York Magazine report thrust the lab-leak hypothesis into the spotlight, but some researchers have been warning for months that COVID-19 may be the product of GoF work that escaped from a lab.

Karl and Dan Sirotkin had a paper published in Aug. 2020 titled “Might SARS‐CoV‐2 Have Arisen via Serial Passage through an Animal Host or Cell Culture.” The peer-reviewed paper breaks down a laundry list of data points that plausibly suggest the virus may have been a man-made result of serial passage GoF research.

In layman’s terms, serial passage is a form of GoF research in which a virus is passed repeatedly through hosts or environments so it can rapidly adapt to them and be studied. For example, in 2012, a team led by Ron Fouchier published a study on the H5N1 influenza strain that used serial passage to prove the strain could become transmissible through the air without intermingling with different host species or flu strains. (RELATED: H1N1 Response VS COVID-19 Response, Why So Different? We Asked Rep. Roger Marshall, M.D.)

To do so, Fouchier’s team took the non-transmissible influenza virus, infected a ferret with it, let it grow, then took it from that ferret to a second ferret, and repeated until it mutated and became contagious. The Sirotkins have documented numerous data points that suggest a similar process may have been involved in the origin of COVID-19 as part of the collaborative D.R.A.S.T.I.C. project.

COVID-19 has proven highly contagious and dangerous in minks, requiring millions to be slaughtered throughout Europe to prevent mass outbreaks at farms. The Sirotkins say the virus is significantly more adapted to both minks and humans than bats, suggesting “that either lab engineering or an intermediate host animal was required,” Dan says. Karl adds that even with COVID-19 coming originally from bats, as the scientific consensus asserts, “it could not have jumped directly from them [to humans].”

Many scientists have suggested COVID-19 is overwhelmingly likely to have originated naturally because it is 96% similar to another naturally-occurring coronavirus, RaTG13. The issue, the Sirotkins tell the Daily Caller, is that the missing 4% includes the key features that make COVID-19 so adapted to humans.

COVID-19 is highly transmissible between humans largely due to the presence of “furin cleavage sites.” These FCS are missing from RaTG13, the Sirotkins say, and the closest-matching naturally-occurring coronavirus to COVID-19 that does have FCS is only 60% similar.

“When you look at bat coronaviruses, those with FCSes are very dissimilar to COVID-19,” Karl told the Daily Caller in an email. Dan adds, “Raw genetic distance alone doesn’t mean all that much, humans are even closer than that to chimps at about 98% similarity [but] we’re clearly very different species.

Research like this indicates that the question of whether COVID-19 came from serial passage or some other form of GoF work merits some examination. However, it has been dismissed as a conspiracy theory by media outlets and some scientists.

Outlets like Reuters, Scientific American and Business Insider all called the idea of lab-origin a “conspiracy theory.” Other sites like the BBC and ABC have conflated the theory that COVID-19 came from a lab with the separate claim that it was intentionally released as a bioweapon, which isn’t supported by any evidence.

Prior to the pandemic, though, the scientific community warned that something like this could happen as the result of a lab-leak. That was one of the key revelations of Baker’s New York Mag report: scientists warned there was a high chance a pandemic could accidentally be spawned from a lab accident as far back as 2012, and hundreds of dangerous lab accidents dealing with disease study happen every year in the United States alone.

Debate has raged on for years as researchers argued whether or not the medical and defense benefits of GoF research were worth the risk. A Jan. 2020 article in Nature highlights calls from some experts for the U.S. government to be more transparent with what kinds of GoF research it funds through grants.

“We’re not trying to say the policy is wrong, we’re trying to say the policy is ambiguous,” said Harvard School of Public Health Epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch. He said governments shouldn’t fund certain kinds of GoF work, including the aforementioned 2012 Fouchier study. Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins, also urged authorities to “reconsider the need for such work.”

The NIH did heed those kinds of warnings in 2014, when they instituted a ban on the funding of GoF research dealing with influenza, SARS, and MERS. The ban was subsequently lifted in 2017, a move Discovery called “controversial.” (RELATED: Japan Discovers New Strain Of COVID-19)

Even those who entirely dismissed any possibility of a lab-leak causing COVID-19, such as Kelsey Piper of Vox, argued we should stop GoF research entirely. “Allowing gain-of-function research means running unacceptable risks with millions of lives. It’s high time to rethink that,” she wrote in May 2020.

Piper cites a 2014 case in which as many as 75 individuals were accidentally exposed to anthrax due to a laboratory failure. Dan Sirotkin cited several such cases to the Caller that actually resulted in dangerous outbreaks, including a 2007 foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in the U.K., and a 1978 smallpox leak from a British medical school.

Many of the press outlets that dismissed the lab-leak hypothesis did so based on a letter in The Lancet from a group of scientists who sought to “condemn conspiracy theories” about the origin of the virus. The letter was organized by Peter Daszak, who was directly involved in securing NIH funding for the WIV, according to Baker’s New York Mag report.

Many other examples exist of media outlets citing scientists with direct financial or professional interest in the preservation of GoF research. The University of North Carolina’s Dr. Ralph Baric is frequently cited as an expert on coronavirus-related questions. He is a pioneer in the field, having developed a seamless method for cloning a SARS virus with no trace of human intervention, according to Baker. He has reportedly worked directly with the researchers at the WIV in recent years.

Whether or not gain of function experiments ought to be banned, outlawing the use of techniques that make it impossible to distinguish between a natural and cloned virus seems like a no brainer. Bioweapon treaties should require insertion of some kind of genetic watermark. pic.twitter.com/o0eowYs8Gz — Samuel Hammond ???????? (@hamandcheese) January 6, 2021

Gain-of-function research is a big business. The Wuhan lab alone received millions of dollars in NIH funding starting in 2014, according to the Washington Times. With funding already halted once before, increased scrutiny on the practice as a result of COVID-19 could jeopardize further research.

Baker’s New York Magazine piece caused many onlookers to reexamine the possibility of the lab-leak theory. The Washington Post published an editorial shortly after Baker’s piece was published, saying “the possibility of a laboratory accident or inadvertent leak having caused the coronavirus outbreak must not be ignored.”

Other scientists have weighed in to say that a lab-leak cannot be ruled out, and new papers have emerged raising doubts about the origin of the pandemic. The World Health Organization will finally have investigators on the ground in China on Jan. 14, more than a year after the initial outbreak of COVID-19. Answers may be delivered from that investigation, but enough time has passed that it also may be impossible to ever truly know where COVID-19 came from.

There is strong evidence that the #SARSCoV2 #coronavirus is NOT an engineered bioweapon. That said, it’s important to be upfront that we do not have sufficient evidence to exclude entirely the possibility that it escaped from a research lab doing gain of function experiments. — Carl T. Bergstrom (@CT_Bergstrom) April 16, 2020

GoF research is considered dangerous and controversial by many in the scientific community. Even if it is not responsible for COVID-19, the risks associated with that research combined with the increasingly adversarial relationship between the United States and China raise questions not currently in the mainstream of political debate.

Under the direction of Anthony Fauci, the NIH paused, then unpaused funding of this research, including to the Wuhan lab now at the center of the pandemic. Time will tell if more change is afoot after a year marked by millions of deaths and untold economic disasters.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/01/12/china-wuhan-covid-19-coronavirus-gain-of-function-research-lab-leak-nih/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjGyqTporP9AhWgplYBHS6oCDU4WhAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw38FOgPyBtWiNlJpwf5gdhq,2021-01-12
"Biden’s CIA Pick, William Burns, Leads A Think Tank With Close Ties To China","William J. Burns, the nominee for CIA director, is the president of a prominent think tank that has received as much as $2 million in recent years from a Chinese businessman and a think tank with links to the Chinese Communist Party.

As part of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s work with China, Burns invited a group of congressional staffers on a junket to China in 2019 where they met with a professor who works for the Chinese Communist Party’s central committee. They also met with the president of a prominent Chinese front group.

Zhang Yichen, a Carnegie board member and prominent donor, is a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, which advises the Chinese Communist Party on policy issues.

William J. Burns, who is President Joe Biden’s nominee for director of the CIA, is president of a think tank that has received up to $2 million from a Chinese businessman as well as from a think tank with close ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

As president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Burns also invited nearly a dozen congressional staffers to attend a junket to China, where they met with a communist party operative and a president of a Chinese front group.

Burns, who was paid $540,580 last year as president of Carnegie, will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee for a confirmation hearing likely to be held this month. He has been president of Carnegie since March 2015.

During Burns’ tenure at Carnegie, a businessman named Zhang Yichen joined the think tank’s board of trustees.

“We are very fortunate to have Zhang Yichen on our board,” Burns, a former deputy secretary of state, said in a statement in October 2016. “I look forward to working with him to make Carnegie an even finer institution.”

Zhang, the CEO of CITIC Consulting, a China-based investment firm, donated between $500,000 and $999,999 to Carnegie from July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018, according to Carnegie’s website. He gave between $250,000 and $549,999 in the 2020 fiscal year, according to Carnegie’s 2020 annual report.

Zhang is a member of two organizations linked to the Chinese Communist Party, according to his biography at CITIC Capital: the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the Center for China and Globalization.

CPPCC is an advisory group for the Chinese Communist Party that is affiliated with China’s united front system, which promotes Chinese government initiatives abroad.

It is described on the website of one Chinese embassy as “a united front organization under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and an organ for various other political parties, mass organizations and personages of various social circles to take part in the running of the state.”

The Center for China and Globalization, where Zhang serves as senior vice chairman, is a Beijing-based think tank also linked to the communist apparatus.

Zhang’s donations to Carnegie helped fund the Beijing-based Carnegie-Tsinghua Center, according to Carnegie’s 2018 annual report, which formed in 2010 in partnership with Tsinghua University, one of China’s top technological universities.

A spokesperson for Carnegie said that Zhang has provided general support funds for operations at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center.

“His funding does not underwrite research projects or support work in the United States,” the spokesperson told The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The Carnegie-Tsinghua Center has partnered with the Center for China and Globalization to host forums regarding U.S.-China relations.

In May 2018, Sen. Marco Rubio, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, raised concerns that Wang Huiyao, the president of the Center for China and Globalization, was set to speak at an event hosted by the Wilson Center, another U.S. think tank.

Rubio cited Wang’s position with the United Front Work Department, which he said Chinese President Xi Jinping had described as one of the communist regime’s “magic weapons.”

Carnegie has also received funding from the China-United States Exchange Foundation (CUSEF), a Hong Kong-based think tank that is also a part of the united front system.

CUSEF donated between $100,000 and $249,999 to Carnegie in 2015 and the same amount between July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017, according to archived versions of Carnegie’s donor page.

A spokesperson for Carnegie told The Daily Caller News Foundation that CUSEF’s funding ended in 2017.

CUSEF has come under increased scrutiny in recent years because of its ties to the united front system and the communist government. (RELATED: Jake Sullivan Trashed Trump’s Foreign Policy In Interview On Chinese Propaganda Network)

According to the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank led by retired U.S. intelligence officials, CUSEF is “a major player in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s organizational apparatus for conducting united front work in the United States.”

According to the Sept. 16 report, CUSEF’s lobbying activities in the U.S. “allows it to play a valuable role in Beijing’s efforts to sway public opinion and build influence in America.”

Several U.S. consulting firms disclose their work for CUSEF to the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).

According to an Aug. 24, 2018, report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressionally-appointed commission, CUSEF has showed a “clear intent to influence policy toward China in the United States and other countries.”

Republicans have questioned whether the Biden administration will confront Beijing over its unfair trade practices and human rights abuses.

China’s influence efforts came under increased scrutiny under former President Donald Trump. His administration aggressively investigated economic and academic espionage and brought charges against Chinese intelligence officers operating under cover in the U.S.

Counterintelligence officials have also scrutinized China’s use of front groups as part of Beijing’s overseas influence efforts.

Bill Evanina, who served as the U.S. government’s top counterintelligence official until Biden took office, said in December that the U.S. had seen an uptick in “malign foreign influence” activity aimed at associates of potential Biden administration employees.

“We’re starting to see that now play across the country to not only the folks starting in the new administration, but those who are around those folks in the new administration,” Evanina said in an interview in December.

Carnegie is largely supportive of closer diplomatic ties between Beijing and Washington, a far cry from the more aggressive approach to China that has grown popular in recent years.

In May 2019, Carnegie hosted what it called a “1.5 track dialogue” in Beijing aimed at “reduc[ing] misperceptions and keep channels of communication open even at moments of pronounced tensions in the relationship,” according to its annual report that year.

Burns and Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the U.S., appeared together at a Carnegie event in 2018.

Tiankai has pushed multiple conspiracy theories about the coronavirus. And on Sunday, he denied in an interview on CNN that the Chinese government has mistreated Muslim Uighurs living in western China.

Carnegie also hosted a trip for congressional staffers to Beijing in November 2019 to meet with Chinese academics, journalists, business leaders and government officials.

Burns signed the letters inviting the group of staffers on the trip, which he said was aimed at creating “thoughtful bipartisan dialogue on U.S.-China relations,” according to documents filed with Congress.

An itinerary for the trip shows that 11 congressional staffers met with Chinese academics, journalists and think tank officials over the course of several days.

Liang Yabin, an associate professor at the Central Party School of the Communist Party, took part in one panel discussion with the staffers. A Chinese foreign ministry official named Liu Jun spoke to the delegation on the topic of “China’s Views of Security Concerns.”

Li Xiaolin, the president of the Chinese Peoples’ Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC), another front group for the Chinese Communist Party and the united work system, also spoke to the staffers.

In October, the State Department designated CPAFFC a foreign mission of China, saying that the group “sought to directly and malignly influence” state and local leaders in the U.S.

One staffer who went on the Beijing trip told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the overall theme of the junket was a “diplomacy first” approach between the U.S. and China, rather than a more aggressive posture embraced by the Trump administration.

The staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described a luncheon held at the end of the trip with members of the communist party as “awkward,” but said they saw no overt signs of influence peddling.

The staffer said they were surprised Carnegie was “able to have that much access” to Chinese academics and government officials. Burns attended the first day of events, according to the staffer.

The Carnegie spokesperson downplayed any influence from Beijing on the think tank’s research and other programming.

“Carnegie takes no institutional positions on China or any other matter,” the spokesperson said, adding that Zhang’s funding “does not underwrite research projects or support work in the United States.”

Maurice Greenberg, the billionaire insurance mogul, is a major backer of Carnegie. Xi awarded him the China Reform Friendship Medal in December 2018, the highest honor that Beijing grants to foreigners.

Greenberg’s Starr Foundation gave at least $1 million to Carnegie, according to the think tank’s donor list.

Carnegie has also provided China Global Television Network (CGTN), a state-controlled news organization, access to its various foreign policy experts.

Jake Sullivan, who is Biden’s national security adviser, appeared for an interview in December 2017 with CGTN to criticize Trump’s policies in the Middle East. Sullivan was a senior fellow at Carnegie at the time.

In April 2017, Carnegie fellow David Livingston appeared on a panel hosted by CGTN America to discuss what Carnegie called “China’s emerging leadership on climate change internationally.”

In a February 2017 appearance on CGTN, Carnegie scholar Douglas Paal praised Trump’s decision to honor the “One China” policy, which does not recognize Taiwan as independent from mainland China. Beijing lobbies the U.S. and other countries aggressively to maintain the “One China” policy.

Paal also praised Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador.

On Friday, Britain’s communications regulator revoked CGTN’s license because it is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.

ETZIONI: Taiwan Is Not Worth Risking A War With China,"Editor’s note: We endeavor to bring you the top voices on current events representing a range of perspectives. Below is a column arguing that the U.S. should not risk an all-out war with China over Taiwan. You can find a counterpoint here, where Dean Cheng argues that the U.S. should protect Taiwan in the event of an invasion from China.

China considers Taiwan to be one of its provinces, similar to the way we consider Texas to be part the U.S. We are not about to return it to Mexico, come what may. China’s claims of control over the island, which go back to 239 AD, are complicated and contested, but they are by no means without historical foundations.

For decades, the US and China have had an implicit understanding that the U.S. will not recognize Taiwan as an independent nation, and China will not use force to reincorporate Taiwan into the People’s Republic of China. This arrangement stems from Henry Kissinger’s secret 1971 visit to Beijing. As he and his Chinese counterpart, Zhou Enlai, worked to reestablish diplomacy between China and the US, Kissinger raised a variety of demands. Zhou had only one concern — Taiwan. Kissinger agreed that the US would “recognize the government in Beijing, not Taipei, as the only legitimate China” and promised that the United Nations would oust Taiwan, paving the way for President Nixon’s historic visit to China.

When American politicians want to show that they are tough on China, they move closer to treating Taiwan as a nation, approving arms sales to Taiwan and sending officials to visit Taiwan. President Joe Biden, who finally found a theme that is truly bipartisan, bashing China, invited a Taiwanese representative to his inauguration. A delegation consisting of a former US senator and two former deputy secretaries of state headed to Taiwan last week, as “a personal signal” of support from Biden, and the State Department has announced that it is “issuing new guidelines to enable U.S. officials to meet more freely with officials from Taiwan.”

Furthermore, officials from the Biden administration and other international relations mavens have been sounding the alarm that China will attack Taiwan in the near future.

The US military commander for the Indo-Pacific region, Admiral Philip S. Davidson, stated, “I think the threat is manifest during this decade, in fact, in the next six years” without citing evidence, especially about that mystifying date. Meanwhile, China has not even grabbed the Kinmen or Matsu Islands, archipelagos under Taiwanese control that are practically in its parking lot, only about three miles from the mainland.

China is a vicious, authoritarian regime, one that is committing atrocities against its minorities and that oppresses its own people, but it belongs to the class of authoritarian regimes that have no messianic or expansionist ambitions — like Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and Burma. Western sources keep calling China aggressive, but aggression is defined by the UN as “the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State.”

By this definition, China has been aggressive — but only toward some unoccupied piles of rocks. It has claimed rights to much of the South China Sea. But that is about it. Minor clashes with India were quickly defused. Differences with the Philippines have been worked out. Nations on its border have not been subjected to the kind of landgrab that Russia did in Crimea, nor have they been attacked by “volunteers,” as eastern parts of Ukraine have been.

China, despite its military buildup, is no match for the US. It must note that the US has refused to commit itself to not be the first to use nukes in a war and that published reports about US war plans for dealing with China call for striking the mainland in full force. China has worked for decades to rebuild itself after three centuries of humiliation by the West. Why would it now risk all in order to take Taiwan, an act which is likely to lead to severe repercussions?

The only reason China would go to war by seeking to incorporate Taiwan is if the US and its allies decide to push its buttons some more and treat Taiwan as an independent nation. This is a red line which, if crossed, no Chinse leader could ignore. Bonnie Glaser, from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, stated, “Maybe then [Chinese President] Xi is backed into a corner. This could really cause China to make the decision to invade.”

Another perspective: “Is it time for the United States to rethink its Taiwan policy and walk away from Taiwan? Prominent Americans in influential publications insist that it is.” Taiwan has no raw material, major military bases or armed forces, or any other strategic significance for the US (though it is a major producer of semiconductors). These mavens argue that we could gain many concessions from China if we let it regain Taiwan.

I do not believe that we should throw Taiwan under the bus, whatever the goodies the bus driver promises. However, the fact that respected Western international relations experts even raise that thought helps us remember that Taiwan has no particular strategic value for the US. Surely not enough to start World War III. If the Biden administration needs to show that it can be tough, there are many much less risky places to do so, for instance, by standing up to Iran or even Russia, two nations that are truly aggressive and expansionist.

"‘Our Most Important Partner’: China To Fund Taliban, Group Spokesman Reportedly Says","A Taliban-led Afghanistan will receive money as part of China’s New Silk Road initiative, the group’s chief spokesman said Thursday.

“China is our most important partner and represents a fundamental and extraordinary opportunity for us, because it is ready to invest and rebuild our country,” Zabihullah Mujahid told La Repubblica, according to an Al Jazeera translation. China is also expected to maintain its embassy in Kabul, and could become one of the first countries to recognize the Taliban as the official government of Afghanistan. (RELATED: Chinese Foreign Minister Encouraged Secretary Of State Blinken To ‘Positively Guide’ Taliban)

Only Saudia Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates recognized the Taliban when it controlled Afghanistan from 1996-2001.

“China is our most important partner and represents a fundamental and extraordinary opportunity for us,” the Taliban spokesperson said. “China is our pass to markets all over the world.” So much for that economic leverage strategy @PressSec. https://t.co/po8DhDKKMZ — Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) September 2, 2021

Biden administration officials have repeatedly claimed leverage over the Taliban, asserting that if the group wants access to financial markets and the international community, it will have to respect the rights of women and allow Afghans to leave the country.

However, participation in the New Silk Road initiative would allow the Taliban to largely bypass American and European markets in favor of trade with China. More than 60 countries already participate in the initiative, and China could spend as much as $1.3 trillion on it by 2027, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

Describing China as “our pass to markets all over the world,” Mujahid added that Afghanistan’s “rich copper mines” could “be put back into operation and modernized… thanks to the Chinese.”

Afghanistan’s total mineral wealth could be worth more than $1 trillion, some geologists estimate. The country has some of the largest Lithium deposits in the world, and is believed to have major gold and iron caches as well.

Chinese government officials have telegraphed a relationship since the Taliban took Kabul on Aug. 15.

“China will continue to support peace [and] reconstruction in Afghanistan, and do our best to help it with economic [and] social development,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao said on Aug. 18.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/09/02/china-new-silk-road-afghanistan-taliban/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjDzuHnorP9AhX3qlYBHWLQBMg4KBAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw17Lj4WzFHGwxddWpqksOQT,2021-09-02
"Protesters Descend On Apple Store, Blast Production In China Over Uyghur Genocide","A group of protesters descended on an Apple store in New York City on Saturday, blasting the company for its production in China associated with forced labor in Xinjiang province and the Uyghur genocide.

The protesters gathered in front of the store on the corner of 67th and Broadway in Manhattan’s Upper West Side at 3:00 p.m., holding “Divest Uyghur Genocide” signs.

They chanted, “What do we want? Justice for Uyghurs. When do we want it? Now!” and informed passing pedestrians of the alleged links between Apple and China’s industrial slavery practices.

“Apple has chosen to embed itself in a slave state — a state notorious for its concentration camps and slave labor. That’s a disgrace,” Philip Hamburger, a protester, told the Daily Caller.

Both the Biden and Trump administrations have said that China is engaging in genocide against the Uyghur ethnic minority group. The State Department sent out an advisory in July advising businesses that operating in Xinjiang, China, could lead them to violate human rights laws amid continued reports of forced labor and genocide in the region. (RELATED: ‘Torture, Rape, Forced Sterilization’: Businesses Operating In Xinjiang, China, Could Violate US Law, State Dept. Says)

“The PRC’s crimes against humanity include imprisonment, torture, rape, forced sterilization, and persecution, including through forced labor and the imposition of draconian restrictions on freedom of religion or belief, freedom of expression, and freedom of movement,” the advisory states.

Fifty-one of Apple’s top 200 suppliers were based in China, including Hong Kong, in 2020, according to a Nikkei Asia analysis of the Apple Supplier List.

The Campaign for Accountability, a non-profit ethics watchdog group in Washington, D.C., filed a formal complaint with U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Monday over Apple’s alleged use of forced labor in products destined for the U.S.

A May 2021 investigation conducted by The Information found seven companies “supplying device components, coatings and assembly services to Apple that are linked to alleged forced labor involving Uyghurs and other oppressed minorities in China.”

The Washington Post reported in December of 2020 that one of Apple’s suppliers, Lens Technology, relies on forced labor in China to make glass screens for its iPhones.

Apple has denied allegations that they rely on forced Uyghur labor in their supply chains.

Apple has also lobbied against the passage of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, a bipartisan bill that would ban imports from Xinjiang over human rights abuses conducted against the Uyghur ethnic minority by the Chinese government. The bill has passed the House and Senate.

Apple did not reply to a request to comment at the time of publication.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/10/02/protesters-descend-on-apple-store-blast-production-in-china-over-uyghur-genocide/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiT1Z3oorP9AhXGl1YBHZYjBsY4PBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw0iDWGvi7uUC63JiVKNBIJY,2021-10-02
Yahoo Ending Operations In China Due To ‘Challenging’ Environment,"Tech giant Yahoo will no longer conduct any business in China due to a challenging regulatory environment, the company announced Tuesday.

“In recognition of the increasingly challenging business and legal environment in China, Yahoo’s suite of services will no longer be accessible from mainland China as of November 1,” a Yahoo spokesman said in a statement, Reuters reported.

Yahoo’s decision to withdraw from the country follows video game developer Epic’s announcement Monday that its popular online game Fortnite would no longer be available in China. The country’s president, Xi Jinping, has cracked down on video games and kids’ use of social media in recent years.

Microsoft-owned job networking site LinkedIn also withdrew from China last month, citing similar regulatory concerns. (RELATED: LinkedIn Blocks Profile That Mentions Tiananmen Square Massacre)

“[We’re] facing a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China,” Mohak Shroff, senior vice president of engineering at LinkedIn, wrote in a blog post announcing the move.

LinkedIn was the subject of controversy and congressional scrutiny following its repeated censorship of user profiles in China at the behest of the Chinese government.

Yahoo hinted that it was leaving China in part due to the country’s human rights violations and government control of internet services.

“Yahoo remains committed to the rights of our users and a free and open internet. We thank our users for their support,” the company spokesperson said.

China has sought to rein in its technology and social media companies, passing privacy legislation in August hamstringing its social media platforms’ ability to harvest data on users and target them with advertising. The country also restructured financial technology company Ant Group earlier this year.

Yahoo did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

LOHMAN: China Can Afford To Take Its Time On Taiwan,"Editor’s note: We endeavor to bring you the top voices on current events representing a range of perspectives. Below is a column arguing that Taiwan is not in imminent danger of an invasion from China. You can find a counterpoint here, where the American Foreign Policy Council’s James Robbins argues that China may soon take action on Taiwan soon.

Taiwan is in danger of being subsumed by China. But it’s not imminent, and it’s not because of what’s going on in Ukraine – at least not in the way you may think.

Bringing Taiwan under its control has been the driving objective of the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) foreign policy since its founding. An invasion of Taiwan, or even seizing one of its outlying islands, however, is fraught with risk for China’s rulers.

First, there is the operational military risk. Unlike Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a Chinese move on Taiwan involves it getting past hundreds of miles of water. This is one of the most difficult things for any military to do. And this is before it engages in any effort to take and hold ground. Failing in either phase would carry profound political consequences for the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) grip on power.

Then there is the risk of blowback from the international community, much as Russia is suffering right now. The eastern half of China is too rich and developed, too deeply integrated into global value chains, to absorb the sort of isolation that the world is now imposing on Russia.

Over the past 30 years, the Chinese people have forged a tacit bargain with the Communist Party: Keep the good times rolling, and we let you live. Frozen bank accounts and runs on banks would quickly upend this.

Vladmir Putin’s whims do nothing to change these factors.

Besides, why would Beijing take any chances at all if it calculates that Taiwan’s security guarantor, the United States, is in terminal decline? Wait long enough and, devoid of meaningful outside support, Taiwan will fall into the CCP’s lap.

This isn’t just logical speculation. In 2021, General Secretary Xi Jinping said, “The world is undergoing great changes unforeseen in a century, but time and momentum are on our side. This is where our force and vigor reside, and it is also where our confidence and determination reside.” This line of reasoning is one with a long analytical tail. As Rush Doshi recounts in “The Long Game: China’s Grand Strategy to Displace American Order,” the concept first emerged in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and what struck the CCP as the obvious long-term decline of the U.S.

Nothing has happened in the intervening years to change this analysis.

And now there is Ukraine. Vladimir Putin is leading a direct assault on the peace that the US has kept in Europe for almost 80 years. A Putin win, or even a long stalemate, means a weaker U.S. If you’re in Beijing, you reckon that you just need to continue pressing your global advantages.

This historical trendline is Beijing’s greatest ally in taking Taiwan.

Sure, there is still work for Beijing to do. History must be enabled. This is what Beijing’s renewed and very successful campaign to poach Taiwan’s diplomatic allies is about. It’s behind its – again, successful – effort to prevent Taiwan’s fuller participation in international organizations. And it’s why Beijing’s talking points on Taiwan never change. Any capital that wishes to maintain diplomatic relations with China is obliged to recognize just “one China.” The nuances vary from country to country. Beijing interprets them all to mean “there is only one China, and Taiwan is a part of China.” And it reserves the prerogative punish any transgressions, actual, imagined or projected.

This explains Beijing’s frequent saber-rattling over Taiwan. Persistent and massive incursions into Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone have operational benefits. They do not mean China is about to invade. They are warnings to Taiwan not to go too far in exercising its independence, let alone formally declaring it, and to the United States and others not to encourage Taiwan along these lines. It is essentially a threat to shoot the hostage. And it will shoot. Because allowing Taiwan to go independent uncontested also holds immense risk for the CCP.

The fact that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) can now greatly complicate any American ride to Taiwan’s rescue in such a scenario has reinforced the predicted Chinese trend. And if this is not bad enough, there is now the prospect that in addition to U.S. failure in Afghanistan, they will be able to hold up Ukraine as a demoralizing example of American impotence.

The Chinese have us coming and going. Wait for history to unfold on the trajectory it’s on, and the Chinese win Taiwan without firing a shot. Force the issue on Taiwan, and go to war.

The only way to solve the puzzle is to change Chinese perceptions of the historical trend. Win in Ukraine, help Taiwan expand its international economic and political ties, and acquire the weapons it needs to defend itself. Most importantly, the US must convince Beijing that it will have the material and resolve to win a war in the Taiwan Strait long into the future.

While what’s going on in Ukraine does not make war over Taiwan imminent, in the absence of such an effort, a Russian victory will help seal its fate.

The US Just Parked A Fleet Of Aircraft Carriers Right On China’s Doorstep,"Multiple U.S. Navy aircraft carriers have amassed in the waters east of China, the U.S. Naval Institute reported Monday.

The USS Abraham Lincoln and USS Ronald Reagan carrier strike groups, the USS America expeditionary strike group, as well as the USS Tripoli are operating in and around Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines, according to the U.S. Naval Institute fleet tracker.

The exercise marks the first time two America-class ships, the USS America and USS Tripoli, have operated in the Asia-Pacific region at the same time, according to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s translation of China’s Observer News.

Though the USS America and USS Tripoli are capable of carrying helicopters and fighter jets upon their flight decks, and thus resemble small aircraft carriers, the ships are classified as “amphibious assault ships,” according to a Navy profile. Amphibious assault ships are configured to support land-based operations, whereas aircraft carriers are optimized to dominate naval and air encounters, according to RealClear Defense.

The arrival of the U.S. Navy warships near China comes just a week after the USS Port Royal, a Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser, was shadowed by China’s Eastern Theater Command while conducting a freedom of navigation exercise through the Taiwan Strait on May 10. The USS Port Royal’s trip came in response to the Chinese military surrounding Taiwan to the east and southwest between May 6 and 8 in a “rehearsal” for a “reunification-by-force” operation. (RELATED: Here’s How The Navy Responded To China’s Mock Invasion Of Taiwan)

The largest iteration of the Liaoning aircraft carrier group to date also participated in China’s aerial, naval and ballistic live-fire war game in the waters off Taiwan after conducting military drills near the U.S. Navy base at Sasebo, Japan, on May 2.

The Liaoning aircraft carrier group is now reportedly operating near the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, according to China’s Observer. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: US-Based Activist Claims A Chinese Agent ‘Weaponized’ The Justice System To Get Him Arrested On Terrorism Charges)

The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group conducted “dynamic deterrence missions” and “long-range maritime strikes” in the Philippine Sea on May 13, according to the Navy.

The Department of Defense and Navy did not respond immediately to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

The US Military Is Almost Completely Dependent On China For Key Mineral Used In Ammunition: REPORT,"The U.S. military depends almost completely on China for a mineral essential to the production of ammunition and other defense products, Defense News reported Wednesday.

The House Armed Services Committee released draft legislation on Wednesday, which would require a briefing on the antimony supply by October and a five-year outlook on supply chain vulnerabilities, Defense News reported. The U.S. has no domestic mine for the mineral antimony, which is reportedly used in the production of night vision goggles, armor-piercing bullets, explosives and nuclear weapons.

“China in particular does a remarkably good job of hoarding these materials,” Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told Defense News. “China clearly has a comprehensive global strategy to corner the market on these materials and we’re behind and we’re playing catch-up.”

In 2020, approximately half of the antimony mined originated in China, Russia and Tajikistan, according to Britannica.

Moulton and seven Republicans wrote to the defense appropriations subcommittee in April asking for an additional $264 million in funding for the National Defense Stockpile (NDS), a reserve of critical materials used in national emergencies. The letter claimed that in the last 30 years Congress had “authorized the sell-off” of the majority of the stockpiled materials.

“The current stockpile is inadequate to meet the requirements of great power competition,” the letter stated. “The NDS is no longer capable of covering the Department of Defense’s needs for the vast majority of identified materials in the event of a supply chain disruption.” (RELATED: Chinese Deploy Killer Robots In Mock Invasion Exercise, State Media Claims)

The House Armed Services Committee draft legislation follows years of widespread supply chain disruptions initially caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine further strained the supply chain, leading to a serious breakdown in the distribution of oil, grain and other goods.

The House Armed Services Committee, Moulton and the Department of Defense did not respond immediately to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment. (RELATED: China Is Secretly Building A Military Base In Key Strategic Region: REPORT)

CHANG: China’s Economy Is Collapsing. Here’s Why You Should Worry,"Chinese ruler Xi Jinping has staked his rule on making China larger, by annexing neighbors. Taiwan is not his only target. He needs success to assure a precedent-breaking third term as the Communist Party’s general secretary, but the Chinese people, preoccupied by a failing economy, are in no mood for their leader’s aggression.

We start with the Party’s storyline that the relaxation of COVID-19 lockdowns is leading to an economic revival. (RELATED: CHANG: Biden Administration Is Handing Space To China On A Silver Platter)

Don’t believe it. The ongoing downturn is not merely the result of disease-control measures. The most fundamental problem is that Xi has been reversing reforms and reinstituting strict state control. He is a totalitarian at heart.

The second-most fundamental problem is that China is carrying a staggering load of debt. The Bank of International Settlements estimated that the country’s debt was equal to about 290% of gross domestic product in late 2020, and there has subsequently been a rapid accumulation of indebtedness, during the pandemic. When adding the so-called “hidden debt” and deflating GDP to minimize the effect of inflated official reporting, the country’s ratio is now around 350%.

The debt, however large it may be, is distorting the economy, especially the crucial property sector, which accounts for about 30% of GDP. Home prices are declining country-wide, but, more worryingly, sales volumes are plunging. Home sales fell 34.5% in the first five months of this year compared with the same period last year. Property developers are defaulting one after another. One of them, Evergrande Group, is struggling under $305 billion in obligations.

Banks are troubled. There have been at least six bank runs since mid-April, in Henan and Anhui provinces. There are restrictions on deposit withdrawals elsewhere, including Shanghai, the financial capital. China’s banking system is showing the strain of an economy that looks like it is contracting.

Investors are fleeing. The bond market in May recorded its fourth-straight month of outflows as investors chased higher yields in the U.S. The Chinese central bank cannot match the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes because higher rates in China would push the economy deeper into the red. The renminbi, not surprisingly, is trading at its lowest level in 20 months.

Beijing cannot expect others to come to the rescue by buying Chinese products, like they did in 2020. The world, unfortunately for the party, is headed into recession or worse. It will be a “calamity,” Charles Ortel of the “On the Money” podcast tells me. As he notes, “Not since the OPEC oil shock have global economic conditions been so unsettled.” With trends moving against Beijing, the world’s next great economic crisis will almost surely be China’s.

Why should we care? For decades, the primary basis of legitimacy of the Communist Party has been the continual delivery of prosperity. Now, because of the accelerating downturn, the Party’s only remaining basis of legitimacy is nationalism.

Chinese foreign policy since 1949, when the Communist Party came to power, has had one overarching goal: the maintenance of Party rule. Therefore, the world should expect Beijing to engage in even more nationalistic behavior to justify its existence.

In fact, the Party is increasingly belligerent. The Chinese military, for instance, violated sovereign Taiwan airspace in February and in late May intercepted and damaged an Australian reconnaissance plane in international airspace over the South China Sea. This month, General Wei Fenghe, the defense minister, made threatening public comments directed against the United States during the high-profile Shangri-La Dialogue, a security conference in Singapore.

Yet Communist Party aggressors face a fundamental problem, something evident from their unwillingness to come clean about battlefield losses. It took them eight months to admit they had suffered four dead from a sneak attack they launched against India’s forces in June 2020 in Ladakh in the Himalayas. Chinese officials, according to both Indian and Russian estimates, undercounted the dead by a factor of 11.

The skittishness of the regime suggests its leaders know that the Chinese people, suffering from an economic downturn, are in no mood for another military misadventure abroad. A combined air-sea assault on Taiwan, even if successful, would result in massive Chinese casualties.

Xi Jinping, however, wants to march on neighbors, so peace in Asia depends in large measure on whether the Chinese people are able to restrain him. The millennia-old contest between China’s rulers and its people has never been more consequential.

China’s Military Has Violated Taiwan Airspace 3 Times More Under Biden Than Trump,"The Chinese military has violated Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over 1,400 times since Joe Biden took office, according to data from Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense.

China has “imperial” ambitions and is carefully watching how the “international community” handles Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Steve Yates, senior fellow and chair of the China Policy Initiative, told The Daily Caller News Foundation on Monday.

China claims “sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the Taiwan Strait,” Wang Wenbin, China’s foreign minister, said during a June 13 press conference.

The Chinese military has violated Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) three times more under President Joe Biden than during the entirety of Donald Trump’s presidency, according to data from Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense.

As of June 20, the air force of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has flown at least 1,439 sorties into Taiwan’s ADIZ since Biden took office, greatly exceeding the estimated 436 violations Taiwan endured throughout Trump’s four years as president, according to a Daily Caller News Foundation analysis of data from Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense, estimates from Mercedes Trent, a research associate with the Defense Posture Project, and a database compiled by Gerald C. Brown, a defense analyst and contributor at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Since 2020, China’s violations of Taiwan’s ADIZ have skyrocketed and now occur on an almost daily basis.

In 2018, the Chinese military reportedly made no incursions into Taiwan’s ADIZ, according to data from Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense. However, in 2019, China reportedly began to send sorties into Taiwan’s ADIZ, sending between 11 and 20 sorties that year.

The frequency of China’s violations has since escalated, with Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense reporting between 381 and 390 sorties in 2020 and 972 sorties in 2021. China has already sent an estimated 123 warplanes into Taiwan’s ADIZ this year compared to 112 sorties by June 2021. (RELATED: China Launches Largest Aircraft Carrier Asia Has Ever Built)

Steve Yates, senior fellow and chair of the China Policy Initiative, told The Daily Caller News Foundation on Monday that China has imperial ambitions and will annex Taiwan if the U.S. and its allies fail to act.

“By sea and by air, Beijing seeks to impose imperial control over Asian commerce and security in ways that have only existed in the imaginations of simplistic Western observers and Chinese Communist propagandists,” Yates said. “If China meets with minimal resistance and pays no price for recent escalation, then the ‘international community’ risks green-lighting more consequential attacks, in the same way that tough rhetoric and diplomatic appeals signaled to Russia that conditions were favorable to move into Ukraine, but the economic and security consequences at stake in Asia are greater than those unleashed by Russia in Europe.”

On Sunday, the PLA reportedly sent 10 warplanes into Taiwan’s ADIZ, Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense reported. The incursion featured a mix of Chinese fighter jets, a surveillance plane and an H-6 bomber, which broke off from the other warplanes and circled around Taiwan’s southern tip before turning back.

China’s latest incursions come as Beijing has ramped up efforts to claim that the Taiwan Strait is not an international waterway, but rather belongs to China. Wang Wenbin, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, recently made this claim during a press conference on June 13.

“There is no legal basis of ‘international waters’ in the international law of the sea,” Wang said. “It is a false claim when certain countries call the Taiwan Strait ‘international waters’ in order to find a pretext for manipulating issues related to Taiwan and threatening China’s sovereignty and security.”

China has “sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the Taiwan Strait” Wang told reporters during the press conference, citing the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

A Department of Defense spokesman referred TheDCNF to a U.S. government statement regarding China’s territorial claims.

“The Taiwan Strait is an international waterway, meaning that the Taiwan Strait is an area where high seas freedoms, including freedom of navigation and overflight, are guaranteed under international law,” the statement reads. “We are concerned by China’s aggressive rhetoric and coercive activity regarding Taiwan. The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows, and that includes transiting through the Taiwan Strait.”

The Chinese Embassy and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office did not respond immediately to TheDCNF’s request for comment. (RELATED: China’s Xi Jinping Unironically Publishes Treatise On Human Rights)

"Coal Use, Especially In China, Is Poised To Wipe Out 17 Years Worth Of US Emissions Progress","Rising emissions from growing global coal use amidst the current energy crisis are eliminating emissions reductions achieved in the U.S. since the mid-2000s.

China and India are driving the increase in coal emissions, according to RealClear Energy. European countries, including Germany and The Netherlands, have also moved to produce more coal as other energy sources become scarce. (RELATED: GOP Senators Call Out Biden Nominee’s Rant About Bankrupting Fossil Fuel Industries)

China announced that it will increase coal output by 300 million tons this year in April. Last month, India also said it was looking to grow its domestic coal production by more than 400 million tons by the end of 2023, according to Phys.org.

China’s and India’s combined 700 million tons of coal output will result in an additional 1.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions, as burning one ton of coal releases roughly two tons of carbon dioxide, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The same volume of emission reductions that were achieved in the U.S. between 2005 and 2020 was nearly equal to this figure, according to statistics from BP.

Coal-based emissions are only likely to exponentially increase, as a sudden climb in coal use has swept across Europe following the significantly reduced supply of natural gas via the Russian Nord Stream Pipeline. As a response, Germany has brought back coal to sate its demand for fuel, the country’s Economy Minister Robert Habeck announced last week.

Italy, The Netherlands and Austria are also stepping up coal production to lower energy costs before the start of winter and lessen their reliance on Russian natural gas.

The added European coal emissions combined with the massive increases in China and India will exacerbate global emission totals and likely nullify any improvements made by the U.S. over the past 17 years.

DEVORE: Rolling Back Trump’s China Tariffs Will Sell Out The Country,"Editor’s note: We endeavor to bring you the top voices on current events representing a range of perspectives. Below is a column arguing that rolling back Trump’s China tariffs would harm the country. You can find a counterpoint here, where Reason’s Max Gulker argues that rolling back the tariffs will represent a win for American consumers.

President Joe Biden’s job approval ratings are in freefall, tracking inversely with inflation — the higher the inflation rate, the lower Biden’s ratings.

Biden could soon attempt to cover for his own economic failures by dropping tariffs on Chinese goods. That would be a mistake.

The voting public largely — and correctly — sees inflation as mostly the fault of bad government policies. Go to war on the oil and gas industry, get less of it. Fire up the regulatory machine, increase costs to run a business. Print trillions of dollars and pay people to not work, get inflation and a tight labor market with millions sitting on the sidelines.

The COVID-19 public health crisis and the response to it also shares some blame. Global supply chains were disrupted as some nations opted for aggressive measures to contain the virus — measures that, in retrospect, appear to have made no difference as the virus made its way across the world.

And then there’s Russia’s war on Ukraine. While the fault for the invasion must rest squarely with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the fact is that America’s deterrence failed under Biden, only months after the chaos in Kabul and a credibility shredding defeat.

Finally — and this is vital politically — there’s former President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imports from the People’s Republic of China. With the Trump tariffs, Biden now has a convenient foil — a villain to blame for higher costs. By raising the issue of Trump’s tariffs in Chinese imports, Biden can cast the blame for inflation at Trump’s feet and, unlike blaming the “Putin price hike,” it’s an issue that he has the power to address, promising relief will be felt — just after the midterm elections.

Jason Furman, former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under President Barack Obama and now an economist at Harvard, is urging Biden to roll back Trump’s tariffs on China. Speaking on NBC, Furman said, “I’d love to see them lift most of the tariffs that President Trump imposed. That would bring down inflation directly….”

But would it? The short answer is not likely and, in the long run, perhaps 1%, maybe less. There are two reasons for this.

First, China is pursuing its mercantilist objective of maintaining market share and discouraging a shift in manufacturing away from the one-party state. This caused them to largely eat the billions in tariffs imposed. The monthly inflation numbers after Trump kicked off the trade war in 2018 to pressure China into playing by the rules show this.

Second, the goods imported into America have already paid the tariffs and, in a slowing economy, it will take months for new goods to replace them — though, if Biden does relax the tariffs, look for China to quickly raise prices to increase profits.

Of course, Professor Furman, and many others, aren’t entirely free from conflicts of interest as they lobby Biden to reduce tariffs on China. In Furman’s case, his employer, Harvard University, has received millions in contracts and gifts from China and Hong Kong (functionally the same nation today) in the past two years, the most of any foreign power.

Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative during Trump’s four years in office, points out in a letter to the Wall Street Journal that, “Inflation today is highest in the fuel, food, used-cars and some services sectors. None of these is imported from China.” While “Rolling back the tariffs would essentially give the adversary a pass to cheat and cost many Americans their jobs. The China challenge is more important to the long-term prosperity and security of our country than the current inflation.”

Of note, even as China reneged on its promise to buy an extra $200 billion of goods from America — though the COVID-19 slowdown was a factor — American imports from China from grew eight percent in 2020, 28% in 2021 and 15.1% in the first five months of 2022.

But U.S.-China relations continue a downward spiral over China’s massive military buildup, its threats to Taiwan, Japan and other nations in the Indo-Pacific, and its support for Russia’s war on Ukraine. This should cause us to view our increasing imports from China through the lens of national security with items of vital importance to our economy (auto parts and integrated circuits), national security (rare-earth minerals) and well-being (active pharmaceutical ingredients) which would give China leverage in a conflict.

Fortunately, despite Biden’s anti-jobs regulatory push, many American companies are starting to “onshore” out of China, with the construction of new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. more than doubling in a year, far ahead of the overall 10% increase in construction.

A Biden reversal of Trump’s tariffs on China threatens to reverse these gains for America and its workers while delivering little to nothing in the way of inflation relief.

GULKER: A Rollback Of Trump’s China Tariffs Would Be A Win For American Consumers,"Editor’s note: We endeavor to bring you the top voices on current events representing a range of perspectives. Below is a column arguing that rolling back Trump’s China tariffs will represent a win for American consumers. You can find a counterpoint here, where TPPF’s Chuck DeVore argues that rolling back the tariffs would harm the country.

President Joe Biden is reportedly ready to begin rolling back some of the $370 billion in tariffs that his predecessor Donald Trump placed on Chinese imports in 2018 and 2019. Better late than never, Mr. President. The policy change would be a win for American families strained by inflation and an economy still trying to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing supply chain interruptions.

Less than four years ago, in Dec. 2018, former President Trump declared himself a “Tariff Man” in an infamous tweet. “Trade wars are good and easy to win,” Trump claimed as he escalated a trade war with the Chinese government, announcing new tariffs of up to 25% on an expanding list of imports.

Trump’s signal that he was happy to keep ramping up the trade war was no empty threat — he spent the next year extending the tariffs to almost all Chinese imports while wrongly claiming China would foot the bill. Unfortunately, it is always consumers who pay the costs of tariffs.

“Increased tariffs will increase prices for customers,” Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said in 2019.

Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly told Reuters, “The impact of tariffs at 25 percent will result in price increases and will be felt by US consumers.”

Tariff Man’s legacy was imposing billions in taxes on American importers, businesses and consumers, with little evidence of gains to the domestic industries the former president said he sought to protect. Economists overwhelmingly disagreed with Trump’s tariffs. Even before the economic shock of the pandemic, Americans began feeling the economic damage of Trump’s tariffs when they paid more for cell phones, washing machines, toys, aluminum and steel.

“We have repeatedly stated that this tariff is a tax on every washing machine buyer in the U.S.,” a Samsung spokesman told The Wall Street Journal. “Since the tariff was implemented, U.S. consumers have paid more for their washing machines across all brands.”

At this point of his presidency, Biden shares responsibility for the cost increases being passed on to consumers. He has now presided over these massive tariffs for almost as long as Trump. Rolling back, or, better yet, eliminating Trump’s tariffs, should have been a top priority from when Biden assumed office. Instead, the tariffs continue to add costs to consumer goods during a record-setting inflationary period.

Even now, Americans seem to be getting utterly tepid first steps from Biden. The White House is only reportedly planning to reduce tariffs that impact about $10 billion worth of goods. The administration is also purportedly looking at a new process for companies to apply for tariff exemptions, which might reduce more tariffs but would certainly roll out the red carpet for cronyism.

One reason Biden isn’t getting rid of the tariffs is that both major political parties have decided that it is good politics to blame China and free trade for policies and changes some Americans don’t like, so we cannot wholly ignore the generation-long shift in American demand for labor from manufacturing to service and high-tech industries.

Factory closures in small towns and rural America are often incorrectly blamed on free trade rather than a longer-term seismic shift in the U.S. and global economy. Still, far too many economists have taken a flawed path in battling misconceptions pushed by protectionists. Free traders make arguments like “laid-off workers will just transition to new industries,” which are unsatisfying to long-time factory workers and others. Downplaying or ignoring how long and complex such transitions are for some workers and communities helps set the table for protectionists and politicians willing to make false promises to “bring the jobs back to America.”

Another misguided argument for tariffs is that trade restrictions are strategic political tools that force bad actors like the Chinese government into better policies. But brutal crackdowns by the Chinese government on protestors in Hong Kong since tariffs were enacted can’t be ignored. “The Trump administration appears to have made less progress than previous administrations in changing Chinese behavior and at a substantially greater cost. By its own preferred measures, its China trade policy has not been a success,” Phil Levy, the senior economist for trade for President George W. Bush’s administration, wrote.

There are millions of transactions between American and Chinese people and businesses daily. Global trade is not a zero-sum showdown, as politicians like to suggest. U.S. consumers benefit from the lower prices of free trade with China. And even if the Chinese government benefits from that trade, so do its people, whose prosperity and empowerment will do far more in the long run to reduce bad actions than the sticks and carrots of the U.S. government.

The last few years have been a vivid reminder that tariffs raise prices and hurt American consumers and businesses. Rather than being tough on China, the tariffs are tough on Americans. It is time for President Biden to help reduce high prices by making large and broad reductions in tariffs.

CHANG: It’s Time To Liberate TikTok Users From China,"TikTok has just confirmed that parent company ByteDance in China has had access to sensitive U.S. user data generated by the wildly popular video-sharing app.

“Employees outside the U.S., including China-based employees, can have access to TikTok U.S. user data subject to a series of robust cybersecurity controls and authorization approval protocols overseen by our U.S.-based security team,” wrote TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew in a June 30 letter to nine Republican senators.

The disclosure makes clear that TikTok executives had previously misled Congress and the American public about the matter. (RELATED: CHANG: China’s Economy Is Collapsing. Here’s Why You Should Worry)

It is long past time to ban the app or force its sale to American owners. Interim measures, designed to ensure privacy, will not prevent the Chinese central government or the Communist Party from surreptitiously obtaining data.

The nine senators questioned TikTok after BuzzFeed reported on June 17 that audio recordings of more than 80 internal TikTok meetings showed that ByteDance employees had accessed nonpublic U.S. user data from September 2021 to the following January. “Everything is seen in China,” a member of TikTok’s Trust and Safety Department said last September. A “Beijing-based engineer” known as “Master Admin” had “access to everything.”

Moreover, it appears that the U.S.-based operations of TikTok were window dressing. “U.S. staff did not have permission or knowledge of how to access the data on their own, according to the tapes,” the site reported.

TikTok had said it never shared user data with the Chinese government and would not do so. The BuzzFeed reporting suggested that this assurance and similar ones to the Trump administration were false.

“They’re lying to America, they lied to Australia, they lied everywhere,” Paul Dabrowa, an Australian national security expert, told me.

On the day the BuzzFeed story dropped, TikTok announced it was moving all U.S. user traffic to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. The app said that, although it would continue to use its data centers in the U.S. and Singapore for backup, it will “fully pivot to Oracle cloud servers located in the U.S.” BuzzFeed reported that the app was in the middle of what is known internally as Project Texas, an effort to protect U.S. user data.

TikTok is also engaged in technical negotiations with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS, the Treasury Department-led interagency group, BuzzFeed reported. ByteDance is trying to convince the Biden administration that U.S.-generated data is protected even though it will maintain exceptions permitting China access.

Don’t believe ByteDance. Over time, China will obtain U.S. user information by hook or by crook, by taking advantage of technical loopholes in promised protections, by violating agreed protections outright, or by getting U.S.-based personnel to commit espionage.

There is a fundamental problem that no promises can make right. “They can’t say 100% for certain that China is not accessing data,” said Dabrowa, referring to TikTok. “It’s the way the app is built. It is designed to collect data for the Chinese authorities.”

“TikTok is not what it appears to be on the surface,” wrote FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr in a June 24 letter, urging Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores. “It is not just an app for sharing funny videos or memes. That’s the sheep’s clothing. At its core, TikTok functions as a sophisticated surveillance tool that harvests extensive amounts of personal and sensitive data.”

Carr is right to be worried. Articles 7 and 14 of China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law require every Chinese national and entity to spy if authorities make a demand. Moreover, such parties, in China’s top-down system, must follow Communist Party directives. In short, ByteDance is in no position to give assurances.

The only solutions that could work are either a direct prohibition of TikTok in the United States or the sale of all its shares to American parties coupled with a complete severance of ties to China.

What does China use stolen TikTok data for? As Dabrowa noted in September 2020 in testimony to the Australian Senate Select Committee on Foreign Interference through Social Media, TikTok’s algorithms are designed to surreptitiously influence opinion and behavior of foreign populations.

For instance, Radio Free Asia reported that a unit of the Chinese military, based in the now-closed Houston consulate, allegedly used TikTok to incite violent protest in 2020 in America.

“Data breaches are not the real concern and never have been,” Dabrowa told FT Alphaville’s Izabella Kaminska in August 2020. “The real threat is the true agenda of the artificial intelligence that uses TikTok data for manipulation purposes.”

CIA Director: China Will Use ‘Overwhelming Force’ To Invade Taiwan,"Russia’s ongoing struggle to defeat Ukraine has altered the scale and timeline surrounding China’s Taiwan invasion strategy, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) said Wednesday.

Beijing is “unsettled” by Russia’s “strategic failure” in Ukraine and now believes it requires “overwhelming force” to conquer Taiwan, CIA Director William Burns said during an interview at the Aspen Security Forum. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, more than 10,000 have died as of June 24, many of whom have been civilians, BBC News reported.

After the Kremlin launched a multi-pronged attack on Ukraine, poor planning, overconfidence and fierce resistance contributed to heavy Russian casualties and a failure to capture any major cities in the early days of the war, Defense One reported. Meanwhile, international sanctions have been levied against Russia’s economy and the Ukrainian war effort has been bolstered by an influx of money and military hardware from the U.S. and other allied countries, such as the United Kingdom.

“Our sense is that [the Ukraine war] probably affects less the question of whether the Chinese leadership might choose some years down the road to use force to control Taiwan, but how and when they would do it,” Burns said.

While the CIA director said he didn’t believe China was waiting to invade Taiwan until just after General Secretary Xi Jinping stands for re-election later this year, Burns said the risk of an invasion will grow throughout the coming decade because Xi is determined to “assert China’s control” over the island nation.

Beijing rejects Taiwan’s sovereignty and the People’s Liberation Army often threatens “reunification-by-force,” claiming that Taiwan is ruled by “secessionists.” The People’s Republic of China was established by the Chinese Communist Party in the final days of China’s Civil War which ended when the Nationalists fled from mainland China to Taiwan in 1949, according to Britannica.

The Department of Defense (DOD) referred the Daily Caller News Foundation to remarks made by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin during the Singapore Fullerton Lecture Series in July 2021 when asked how the DOD intends to prepare for a communist invasion of Taiwan.

“We’re operating under a new 21st century vision that I call integrated deterrence,” Austin said, defining the term as “using every military and non-military tool in our toolbox in lockstep with our allies and partners.”

To achieve this end, the DOD intends to expand the U.S. military’s presence in the Indo-Pacific, increase training and enhance cooperation with partner nations, such as Taiwan, he stated.

“We will not flinch when our interests are threatened,” said Austin. “Yet we do not seek confrontation.”

The Chinese Embassy and the CIA did not respond immediately to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Gen. Milley Warns US About ‘More Aggressive’ Chinese Military After Confirmed Threats Over Pelosi’s Taiwan Visit,"The number of dangerous encounters between Chinese and U.S. and partner forces in the Pacific has increased in the past five years as China’s military becomes more confrontational, a top U.S. defense official warned Sunday.

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley warned at a meeting with Indonesia’s top general that China is demonstrating “more aggressive” behavior ahead of a meeting with regional heads of defense in Australia scheduled for Monday, the Associated Press reported. He did not provide specific numbers of unsafe interactions.

“The message is the Chinese military, in the air and at sea, have become significantly more and noticeably more aggressive in this particular region,” Milley said.

Milley addressed concerns of a security contract Beijing signed with the Solomon Islands in April that Western officials fear lead to a military base established on the islands, the AP reported. (RELATED: China Is Secretly Building A Military Base In Key Strategic Region: REPORT)

“This is concerning because China is not doing it just for benign reasons. They’re trying to expand their influence throughout the region, and that has potential consequences that are not necessarily favorable to our allies and partners in the region,” said Milley.

Milley’s statement comes as China confirmed prior threats of possible military action should House Speaker Nancy Pelosi follow through with her reported August visit to Taiwan.

China’s rhetoric regarding Pelosi’s visit was notably more combative than it has been in the past, saying China expressed “stronger opposition” to the U.S., Financial Times reported Saturday, citing six people with direct knowledge of the warnings.

Senior U.S. national security leaders expressed concern that Pelosi’s trip could increase the pressure on an already tense relationship between the U.S. and China, particularly relating to alleged escalation after a U.S. warship traveled through the Taiwan Strait, Reuters reported. While the National Security Council provided “context, facts and geopolitical relevant information,” it reiterated that the Speaker is free to make her own decisions, FT reported.

China’s rhetoric regarding Pelosi’s visit was notably more combative than it has been in the past, saying China expressed “stronger opposition” to the U.S., Financial Times reported Saturday, citing six people with direct knowledge of the warnings.

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a press conference Monday that China is “fully prepared for any eventuality.”

“If the US side insists on making the visit, the Chinese side will take firm and strong measures to safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Lijian added.

“The U.S. must assume full responsibility for any serious consequence arising thereof,” said Lijian.

An official press release from the Australian defense ministry states that key topics in the conference include climate change, advanced technologies and the war in Ukraine. It does not explicitly mention China.

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Chinese Embassy to the U.S. and the Joint Chiefs of Staff did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

China Might Be The Biggest Winner In Senate-Passed CHIPS Bill,"The U.S. Senate passed the massive $280 billion semiconductor chip bill Wednesday that could serve China more than the American semiconductor manufacturing industry it aims to prop up.

On the surface, the U.S. Senate passed the CHIPS-plus bill that shells out tens of billions of dollars to the semiconductor manufacturing industry to boost American competitiveness against heavy Chinese opposition.

A deeper look inside the bill shows the Senate stripped it of important protections included in previous versions that ensured the U.S. the advantage. (RELATED: Despite Leadership Opposition, 24 Republicans Help Send CHIPS Package To Biden’s Desk)

The bill does bar any entity that receives financial assistance from the federal government from engaging “in any significant transaction” with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) or any foreign adversary for 10 years after the sum has been awarded.

However, it provides wide carve-outs, like allowing companies to continue funding CCP semiconductor manufacturing as long as the technology is considered “legacy” or is of the 28-nanometer generation or older.

China’s semiconductor manufacturing industry lags the global market, meaning almost the entire Chinese semiconductor industry qualifies as a “legacy” exemption.

(2/4) The vast majority of the OVER $200 billion spent in this bill has nothing to do with semiconductor manufacturing. — Congresswoman Debbie Lesko (@RepDLesko) July 29, 2022

International Data Corporation vice president Mario Morales told CNBC’s Squawk Box Asia in January that China’s semiconductor industry is “three or four generations” behind competitive technology.

“I still believe that [China is] probably three or four generations behind what is considered leading edge. … They have capabilities to support 28-nanometer and they’ve started some sampling of 14-nanometer,” Morales told CNBC. “But, the reality is that they need customers to really scale that capability, and a lot of the Chinese ecosystem is just not using that technology.”

Morales told CNBC that China needs “U.S. partners and customers or European customers, or even Taiwanese customers” to provide an influx of capital to help scale down the cost of improving their infrastructure and “ramp [the] technology effectively.”

(4/4) It is also irresponsible to spend nearly $280 billion and add $79 billion to our national deficit at a time when our nation is entering a recession and Congressional Democrats are pushing to spend billions more through another partisan reconciliation package. — Congresswoman Debbie Lesko (@RepDLesko) July 29, 2022

The U.S. Senate’s bill directs the National Science Foundation (NSF) to effectively be the primary gatekeeper between Chinese intelligence and the advancing U.S. semiconductor industry while also allowing it to award grants to entities, including higher education institutions that partner with the CCP-controlled, Confucius Institutes.

FBI Director Christopher Wray called Confucius Institutes “a platform to disseminate Chinese government or Chinese Communist Party propaganda to encourage censorship to restrict academic freedom” during a 2019 U.S. Senate hearing.

The bill states that the NSF is to “ensure proper security controls are in place to protect sensitive information” while leveraging “resources and expertise” from several federal departments and private sectors, including U.S. colleges and universities.

Although the U.S. Senate bill states that “none of the funds made available to [NSF] … may be obligated or expended to an institution of higher education that maintains a contract or agreement between the institution and a Confucius Institute,” it allows an exception.

The NSF is allowed to award U.S. taxpayer funds to institutions collaborating with a Confucius Institute after the National Academies “determines such a waiver is appropriate,” the bill states.

The Daily Caller reached out to the National Science Foundation about the CHIPS-plus bill allowing an exemption for the Confucius Institute and whether the foundation has plans to collaborate with the CCP-backed institution.

“NSF promotes principled international collaborations and does not have partnerships with Confucius Institutes,” responded an NSF spokesperson. “NSF will continue to encourage principled international collaboration with provisions for security and adherence to the law in place.”

U.S. colleges and universities that began breaking away from the Confucius Institutes during the Trump administration (when the institution’s funding was directly connected to China’s communist government) have welcomed it back under a different name, the Beijing Language and Culture University, reported the National Association of Scholars.

"‘Reunification’ And ‘Reeducation’ Coming For Taiwan, Chinese Ambassador Says","The Chinese ambassador to France commented Wednesday that China plans to subject the Taiwanese to “reeducation” in the event it successfully takes over the self-governing island, French outlet BFM TV reported.

“After reunification, we will do reeducation,” Chinese ambassador to France Lu Shaye said in an interview with BFM TV, a statement reminiscent of the so-called reeducation efforts underway in China’s Xinjiang province. China is currently staging its largest military exercises in at least six areas surrounding Taiwan sparked by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s controversial visit, exercises it claims are a rehearsal for a future “reunification” effort.

“The reunification of our land is our mission. … If Mrs. Tsai Ing-Wen doesn’t back down, then the Chinese government and people will not back down either,” Shaye said, according to France 24. (RELATED: CIA Director: China Will Use ‘Overwhelming Force’ To Invade Taiwan)

“La réunification de la patrie, c’est notre mission […] si Mme Tsai Ing-wen [la présidente de #Taiwan, ndlr] ne recule pas alors le gouvernement et le peuple chinois ne reculeront pas non plus”, affirme Lu Shaye, ambassadeur de #Chine 🇨🇳 en #France 🇫🇷, au micro de @Claire_BO pic.twitter.com/MHTysh6blL — FRANCE 24 Français (@France24_fr) August 3, 2022

“Reeducation” suggests China could subject the Taiwanese to the same treatment the Uighur minority group receives. The U.S. declared China a perpetrator of genocide in 2021 for its human rights abuses in the Xiniang province, including forced labor, organ harvesting and sterilization committed against millions of Uighur Muslims at alleged reeducation camps.

International law and human rights experts said China intends to “destroy” the Uighur population.

Shaye told France 24 in January that while China hoped for the “peaceful reunification” of Taiwan, it “had not ruled out the use of force.” The ambassador singled out “separatists” and “foreign forces” as particular targets of any military operation.

Taiwan’s National Army heightened its alert level and began conducting drills in response to the Chinese army firing near Taiwan, The Guardian reported.

China views Taiwan as a separatist region. While the island is internationally recognized as part of China, per the One China policy, many governments, including the U.S., have independent relationships with the democratic Taiwanese government.

“To achieve China’s full reunification is the shared aspiration and sacred duty of all Chinese people. … No country, force or individual shall misestimate the firm resolve, strong will and great capability of the Chinese Government and people to defend state sovereignty and territorial integrity and to achieve national reunification and rejuvenation,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said Wednesday.

The Chinese Embassy in the U.S., the Chinese foreign ministry and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s requests for comment.

Big Candy Bends The Knee To China Over Snickers Ad,"The producer of beloved candy bar Snickers issued an apology Friday after releasing an ad suggesting Taiwan is a country.

Mars Wrigley, which produces Snickers, apologized for an ad that said a limited edition Snickers bar would only be available in the “countries” of Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan, according to Reuters.

The company issued the apology on its Snickers China Weibo account, saying it had adjusted the ad, according to Reuters. (RELATED: White House Reportedly Pushing Dems To Halt Pro-Taiwan Bill)

Mars Wrigley, one of six American companies that sponsored the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, had not acknowledged the Uyghur genocide as of mid-March, but it did issue a statement on its website about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Daily Caller News Foundation reported. The candy giant also suspended social media, advertising and new investment in Russia in response to the invasion. It has steadily increased its presence in China since 2016, when it partnered with Alibaba.

Mars is also a member of the US-China Business Council.

The U.S. recognizes China’s “One China” policy, which stipulates that Taiwan is under Chinese control. Despite the acknowledgement, the U.S. has an unofficial relationship with the island, supplying arms sales.

"Senate Dems’ Climate Bill Carves Out Benefits For Canada, China While Hurting American Consumers","The Canadian government lobbied to expand the EV tax credit in Senate Democrats’ massive climate bill, benefiting Canadian industry while raising taxes on U.S. consumers and stifling global competition.

Automakers are still dependent on China for refining critical minerals used in EV batteries, an energy-intensive process.

“The very people who are pushing green transition policies oppose mining, oppose the industrial facilities that process these,” prolonging U.S. dependence on China, Dan Kish, a senior fellow at the Institute for Energy Research, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. They’ve created a problem and now that the problem exists they don’t want to do anything to fix it.”

Senate Democrats’ massive climate bill could benefit Canadian makers of electric vehicles, the latest country to make gains from a bill that hurts U.S. consumers and increases U.S. dependence on China to produce materials required for green energy-fueled products, according to experts.

While the draft legislation of the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act only provided a tax credit for American-made vehicles, Canadian officials lobbied lawmakers to expand the provision for an industry that comprises 9% of Canada’s export revenue, according to The Wall Street Journal. Canada and China may benefit more from the Inflation Reduction Act than the American taxpayers it purports to help, as the bill raises taxes, stifles competition and incentivizes a switch to green technologies that require China-made critical minerals to function, experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The Inflation Reduction Act carves out a $7,500 tax credit for purchasing EVs at least 40% sourced in North America. EV production lines traverse U.S. borders, with experts estimating that a vehicle can cross between the U.S., Mexico and Canada up to eight times before final assembly, according to the WSJ.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau lobbied for Canada’s inclusion at a 2021 summit with President Joe Biden and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the WSJ reported. “The Americans are very aware of Canada’s position on [the tax credit] and quite frankly the threat it poses to over 50 years of integrated auto-making in our two countries,” he said.

“Aside from China and a few other countries, Americans benefit from a robust international trade system, especially when it comes to vehicles,” Katie Tubb, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “The EV tax credit … adds a layer of protectionism” and “blocks out a significant number of options out there for Americans.”

Nevertheless, the Biden administration may relax the rules to include components from China, the world’s largest exporter of rare earth minerals.

Kirsten Hillman, Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., argued Canada can help the U.S. diversify its supply chains for crucial green energy components, since Canada produces most of the critical minerals used in electric battery production, the WSJ reported. Dan Kish, a senior fellow at the Institute for Energy Research, told the DCNF that may be true, but not in the quantities required to meet surging global demand — and most of those minerals go to China for a very energy-intensive refining process, anyway.

China accounted for 60% of global rare earth materials production in 2019, according to a 2021 International Energy Agency report. It has invested heavily in mining projects in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Myanmar and other developing countries with significant rare earths reserves.

‘The Little Guys Get Swept Up’: Taxes In Senate Dems’ Climate Bill Threaten Independent Oil, Gas Producershttps://t.co/SZH0UuGEKD — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) August 10, 2022

Regardless of where the rare earths are produced, over 90% of them pass through Chinese refineries before they are re-exported to Western buyers for use in EV batteries, solar panels and other green technologies. China burns over half the world’s coal to process polysilicon, a component in solar panels, much of which occurs in forced labor camps in Xinjiang, said Kish.

The U.S. is the world’s second-largest rare earths producer, but climate advocates continue to shut down efforts to install processing facilities in the U.S., said Kish.

“The very people who are pushing green transition policies oppose mining, oppose the industrial facilities that process [critical minerals],” prolonging U.S. dependence on China, said Kish. “They’ve created a problem, and now that the problem exists they don’t want to do anything to fix it.”

‘Crime Against Humanity’: UN Finally Confirms China’s Forced Labor Camps For Uyghurs,"A U.N. investigation led by the United Nation’s Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, Tomoya Obokata, found it “reasonable to conclude” that China is subjecting the Uyghur ethnic minority group in Xinjiang province to forced labor.



China presents the state-mandated labor programs, where subjects are involuntarily transferred to “low–skilled and low–paid employment,” initiatives to alleviate poverty and provide vocational training to Uyghur, Kazakh and other minority groups residing in the semi-autonomous Xinjiang province, but an independent analysis of available information points to forced labor, the report, dated July 19, states.

Allegations of forced labor rose in 2018 when the U.N. and others said China’s “re-education camps” in Xinjiang violated human rights of the Muslim minority group, The New York Times reported, but the U.N. has not yet likened practice to slavery

“The Special Rapporteur considers that indicators of forced labour pointing to the involuntary nature of work rendered by affected communities have been present in many cases,” the report stated. (RELATED: Leaked Documents Show Chinese President Xi Ordered Uyghur Genocide In ‘Top Secret’ Speeches)

The report detailed two tracks in the labor program, one to provide vocational skills and training where Uyghurs are “detained and subjected” to work placements, and another aimed at poverty alleviation that reassigns agricultural workers to alternative employment.

“Some instances may amount to enslavement as a crime against humanity, meriting a further independent analysis,” the report stated, citing evidence of “excessive surveillance, abusive living and working conditions, restriction of movement through internment, threats, physical and/or sexual violence and other inhuman or degrading treatment.”

In 2021, U.N. human rights experts expressed concern about the “alleged detention and forced labor” of Uyghur minorities, saying they should expand dialogue with China over the issue and conduct an independent investigation in China “based on free and unhindered access.”

While the Special Rapporteur has visited over 20 countries suspected of exploiting human labor since 2009, it has not conducted an investigation in China. In addition, the U.N.’s equivalent report on slavery-like practices in 2021 did not contain any mentions of China or the Uyghurs.

I welcome #China‘s ratification of the ILO Forced Labour Convention 1930 and the Abolition of Forced Labour Convention 1957 today. I encourage the Government to go further and ratify the Protocol of 2014 also.https://t.co/vc78SinRWE via @ILO — UN Special Rapporteur Tomoya Obokata (@TomObokata) August 12, 2022

China has consistently denied allegations of subjecting the Uyghurs to forced labor and other forms of mistreatment, Reuters reported.

China has also attempted to block a U.N. report on human rights in Xinjiang. High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet has promised to release the report before her term concludes at the end of August, following what experts called a “disastrous” trip to China, CNN reported.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin called the recent report “disinformation” Wednesday. He accused the U.N. of “using human rights as a pretext to undermine Xinjiang’s prosperity and stability and contain China’s development and revitalization. Their scheme will never succeed.”

The U.N., Obokata, and the Chinese premier and State Council did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s requests for comment.

"US Likely To Go To War With China In The Next Decade, Experts Say","China will likely attack Taiwan in the near future, triggering a broader conflict involving the U.S., experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The outcome of such a conflict is uncertain, as neither side has experience with or adequate capabilities for the kind of warfare required to win, and threat of escalation is high.

“Washington and Beijing are caught in a downward spiral of each believing the other side is bent on changing the status quo and each trying to dissuade further movement with shows of force and determination,” Denny Roy, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, told the DCNF.

The U.S. and Chinese militaries will clash over a Chinese campaign to take over Taiwan in the near future, experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

China’s unequivocal determination to fully integrate Taiwan with the mainland is compounding U.S. fears of growing Chinese threats to itself and key East Asian allies, setting both sides on a risky path to kinetic conflict, according to experts on defense and China/Taiwan issues. A majority of Americans expect war within the next decade, one that experts said could widen beyond repelling a Taiwanese invasion and test the limits of each side’s naval and aerial capabilities.

“Washington and Beijing are caught in a downward spiral of each believing the other side is bent on changing the status quo and each trying to dissuade further movement with shows of force and determination. There’s a moderate risk of war, even though neither side wants it,” Denny Roy, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, told the DCNF.

China has not put forth clear conditions for invading Taiwan, although a Taiwanese declaration of independence would almost certainly trigger the move, according to David Sacks, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

In 2005, China promulgated the Anti-Secession Law that laid out plans for “peaceful reunification” with Taiwan but also provisioned “vague” circumstances that would justify use of force.

“Peaceful ‘reunification‘ is increasingly a fantasy,” Sacks told the DCNF. Given decreasing appetite in Taiwan to join the mainland, increasing warmongering rhetoric from Beijing and Chinese President Xi Jinping’s tightening window as China’s premier, China will not likely relinquish its claim over Taiwan. (RELATED: China Walks Back Promise Not To Use Force In Taiwan ‘Reunification’)

“China wants it more,” Roy told the DCNF.

Tensions have escalated following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan laid bare tensions between the U.S. and China over the island’s status. China staged its largest ever military exercises around Taiwan in response, claiming the visit violated its sovereign claim to the island, while the U.S. deployed a naval carrier group to patrol the same waters.

The PLA told citizens to “prepare for war” ahead of Pelosi’s trip. However, Xi gave a similar order in 2012, giving former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian affairs David Stilwell some reassurance that open conflict could be avoided.

Stilwell told the DCNF that China has not “boxed itself in” to kinetic action against Taiwan. Instead, the most severe challenge from China will stem from its invasion of U.S. media space, “creating friction… division and discontent” within the U.S. Fomenting “civil war” in an adversary is one of the oldest strategies in the Chinese geopolitics handbook.

China “has been conducting political warfare against the United States nonstop since 1979,” said Stilwell. “If we were to do to them what they are doing to us, if we were to actively destabilize the party — which we can do… they would consider that an act of war.”

Furthermore, China lacks “escalation controls,” or the ability to maintain parameters of the initial war effort and keep it from transforming into a broader campaign, Stilwell said.

For example, during the military drills, PLA rockets penetrated Japan’s special economic zone. Experts agreed that the Chinese Peoples’ Liberation Army (PLA) would attack Japanese targets as part of the invasion.

While the U.S. maintains a policy of “strategic ambiguity” toward Taiwan and has not guaranteed protection in the event of an invasion, Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to defending Japan in a meeting with Japanese leaders Friday. A strike on Japanese territory would therefore pull the U.S. into open conflict with China.

Both sides would incur heavy losses in such a conflict, a Center for Strategic and International Studies war game simulating a U.S. and Taiwanese joint attempt to repel a Chinese invasion showed, The Wall Street Journal reported on Aug. 9.

“Neither military has fought a war with a peer or a near-peer military,” Sacks told the DCNF.

One one hand, the U.S. has a “qualitatively superior” military capability and nuclear primacy, as well as meaningful control over the global financial system, Sacks explained. On the other, China enjoys a home base advantage, the ability to control the narrative and massive munitions stores.

The U.S. also has a geographic disadvantage — the closest U.S. military installments to Taiwan are in Japan, over a thousand nautical miles away — and inadequate munitions stocks, Roy said. Taiwan itself has been slow to address its deficiencies in defense spending and troop readiness.

Much of what the U.S. is able to do in the Asia Pacific is contingent on what Japan will allow the U.S. to do in and near Japanese territory, said Sacks. In addition, the U.S. has worldwide defense commitments, while China can afford to concentrate forces on Taiwan.

After the U.S. ceased arms sales to China in 1989, a reaction to the Tiananmen Square massacre, the Chinese defense ministry began reverse engineering U.S. military hardware, Popular Mechanics reported. China’s J-20 stealth fighters suspiciously resemble the U.S.’ F-22, and their Y-20 transport aircraft is an “almost exact knockoff” of the U.S.’ C-17, according to Stilwell.

China’s longstanding practice of exploiting arms transfers and stealing sensitive technology via widespread espionage networks affords China capabilities beyond what it is technologically capable of — but that’s not totally bad for the U.S., Stilwell told the DCNF.

“They will be able to match what we do best because they don’t understand all the technology or the thought process,” Stilwell explained.

In addition, the rampant corruption hamstrung the PLA’s modernization drive, forcing Xi to ramp up anti-corruption activities and ideological indoctrination, according to Stilwell. PLA soldiers are required to study and test on “Xi Jinping thought.”

“They’re losing hours each day that they’re not spending studying their aircraft, their weapons and their art,” he added.

“If they start something, they probably won’t finish it, but they’re going do a lot of damage,” said Stilwell. “So how do you get the PLA to understand they’re not as good as they think they are?”

Pacific Island Country Bars US Ship From Docking Months After Signing Pact With China,"The Solomon Islands prevented a U.S. Coast Guard ship from docking for routine refueling, just months after the strategic island chain signed a security pact with China that could edge out U.S. influence in the region.

The U.S. Coast Guard vessel Oliver Henry requested diplomatic permission to dock in the port at Honiara on Aug. 23, but the Solomons did not respond, according to Axios. The Solomons imposed a moratorium on entry for all naval vessels regardless of their country of origin while authorities resolved issues in the approval system Tuesday, refuting “misinformation” in foreign media that the islands had deferred to China by blocking the Oliver Henry, according to a statement.

“We’ve seen the Chinese try to bully and coerce nations throughout the Indo-Pacific to do their bidding and to serve what they believe their selfish national security interests are rather than the broader interests of a free and open Indo-Pacific,” White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby said, according to Axios, referring to China’s behavior broadly. (RELATED: China’s Neighbors On Red Alert Over Beijing’s Military Build-Up)

China signed a policing agreement with the Solomons in March, giving China a role in the Solomons’ internal security formerly held by Australia, per a 2018 pact, Reuters reported. China has similar security agreements with other islands in the south Pacific region, including Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Tonga and Vanuatu, according to CNA.

China and the Solomons also signed a security cooperation agreement that could allow for the islands to host Chinese warships and possibly military bases, according to a leaked draft, worrying both the U.S. and Australia, The Associated Press reported.

Solomon Islands authorities claimed a communications delay between the ship and the Office of Prime Minister caused the approval to be issued after the ship had departed, even though the prime minister had granted permission for the Oliver Henry to participate in the FFA Island Chief operation to monitor illegal fishing on Aug. 20.

“We have requested our partners to give us time to review and put in place our new processes before sending further requests for military vessels to enter the country,” Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said.

Problems with foreign military vessels entering Solomons waters without permission also prompted the moratorium, according to the Solomons government.

The Solomons are “the stepping stones to East Asia,” former National Security Council director for Oceania and Indo-Pacific security Alex Gray told Axios. “If the Chinese gain sway in any of them, it changes the entire contour of what the U.S. and Australia and our allies can do in the entire region,” Gray said.

Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and U.S. Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy traveled to the Solomons earlier in August officially to commemorate the Battle of Guadalcanal, when Allied forces fought to retain control of the strategic island chain in World War II, Axios reported.

The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s requests for comment.

Japan Is Supercharging Its Military In Response To China Threat,"Japan’s military requested a record defense budget for 2023 Wednesday following several moves designed to improve its defenses against a rising threat from China.

The 5.6 trillion yen request, equivalent to roughly $40.4 billion, could grow to as much as 6.5 trillion yen once procurement costs for some weapons can be defined after the government adopts a new national security strategy in December, The Associated Press reported. Concerns over China’s military buildup has accelerated Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s drive to expand Japan’s military over the next five years and deepen security cooperation with the U.S., Israel and neighbors in the Asia-Pacific. (RELATED: US Holds Joint Military Drills With Key Asian Ally Amid North Korean, Chinese Threats)

“China continues to threaten to use force to unilaterally change the status quo and is deepening its alliance with Russia,” the ministry said in its budget request, according to Reuters.

Kishida has advocated to double the Japanese military’s defense spending from 1% of the country’s GDP to 2%, roughly 10 trillion yen or $72 billion, paralleling NATO’s spending quota, The Wall Street Journal reported in April. That could make Japan’s military the world’s third largest behind the U.S. and China.

“As we fundamentally strengthen our defense power within the next five years, we need to secure a budget adequate for the first year,” Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada said at a meeting of officials to approve the budget request.

Parliament has until April, the beginning of the fiscal year to approve the final budget that could total at 20% higher than the one for 2022, the AP reported local media as saying.

The budget contains a directive to mass produce cruise missiles and high-velocity ballistic missiles to expand the target range, a stark departure from the short-range missiles authorized in previous budget requests, Reuters reported. Japan’s constitution limits the Self Defense Forces to fielding missiles within a few hundred kilometers of the country.

Japan may place up to 1,000 long-range missiles in locations where they will be capable of reaching Chinese and North Korean targets, Reuters reported Sunday.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also sparked worries among officials China could launch a similar war in Asia, as Moscow reinforces military ties with Beijing, the AP reported. The two countries announced plans to hold joint military exercises from Sept. 1 to Sept. 7, The Associated Press reported.

China launched missiles into Japan’s exclusive economic zone during the military drills it staged around Taiwan earlier in August, which Taiwan called a rehearsal for an invasion.

Japan signed a bilateral defense cooperation agreement with Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz as he wrapped up a visit to the island Tuesday, Reuters reported. Gantz predicted a shift in Japanese defense policy from its WWII-era pacifism.

“There will be real-world ramifications to this, both on the military level and in research and development, and also on the level of defense industries down the line,” Gantz said, Reuters reported. Israel is one of the world’s largest defense exporters.

Taiwan Vows To Counterattack If China Violates Its Territory,"Taiwan’s defense ministry threatened Wednesday that it would strike Chinese armed forces if they come within 12 nautical miles of the Taiwanese air and sea territory.

Taiwan’s vow of self defense comes as China routinely sends warships and air sorties across the unofficial “median line” dividing the democratically-governed island from the mainland, Reuters reported. China’s “high intensity” patrols signaling China’s aims to bring the intermediary waters under full Chinese control would constitute the main sources of instability in the region, the ministry said at a press conference Wednesday.

“For aircraft and ships that entered our sea and air territory of 12 nautical miles, the national army will exercise right to self-defense and counter-attack without exception,” Lin Wen-Huang, Taiwan’s deputy chief of the general staff for operations and planning, said. (RELATED: Biden To Request $1.1 Billion Arms Package For Taiwan)

Taiwanese forces fired warning shots Tuesday for the first time at Chinese drones that flew close to the Taiwan-controlled Kinmen islands near the mainland, following with more flares and warning shots Wednesday, Reuters reported. The drones departed without incident.

Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-Wen had ordered “strong countermeasures” against China’s aggressive action in the Taiwan Strait, Reuters reported.

China immediately took issue with the Taiwanese defense ministry’s statements.

“Let me start by saying that Taiwan is a province of China and it does not have a ‘defense ministry,'” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a press conference Wednesday, adding that Taiwan’s bid to “heighten tensions” would not produce any meaningful outcome.

China’s National Defense University military academy director Ma Cheng-Kun said earlier this week China may move to restrict passage of foreign naval vessels through the strait, consolidating “new military normal status” around the waters, Reuters reported.

Two U.S. warships made a “routine” transit through the Taiwan Strait on Sunday, under close watch from the Chinese military. China claims the waters dividing the self-governing island of Taiwan as part of its “internal waters,” although the U.S. maintains that the territory is solely under international jurisdiction, according to CNN.

The U.S. will not tolerate China’s bid to “permanently alter” the status quo around Taiwan, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, according to Reuters.

“The concerns expressed by leaders in Taiwan are understandable given the aggressive, assertive, coercive, and quite frankly, unnecessary, activities that [China] continues to conduct from a military perspective in and around the Strait,” Kirby added.

Chinese forces have crossed the unofficial “median line” dividing Chinese and Taiwanese territory in the strait daily since House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit, part of a series of military drills intended to maintain pressure on Taiwan. While China has long expressed a desire to incorporate Taiwan into the mainland, it has lately grown comfortable with the idea of “reunification” by force.

The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

CHANG: China Can’t Stop Its Currency Plunge,"China’s central bank has ordered the country’s state banks to stock up on dollars in offshore branches in preparation for a major defense of the renminbi.

Beijing, according to a Sept. 29 Reuters report, will soon be dumping dollars and buying its own currency in markets such as Hong Kong, New York and London. (RELATED: MARTIN: A Key Competition Is Emerging Between China And The US. Here’s What It Is)

The yuan, as China’s currency is informally known, has plunged against the greenback, falling almost 14% in onshore markets this year, on track for the biggest drop since 1994 when Beijing forced a devaluation as part of a major reform effort. Both the onshore and offshore yuan — they usually move in tandem — have fallen below the seven-yuan-to-one-dollar psychological barrier.

Almost every analyst in recent weeks has said that Beijing is not concerned about the renminbi’s weakness. The dollar’s surge, after all, is the direct result of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes, meant to stem inflation in America. The dollar has gained ground on every major currency recently.

Analysts correctly point out that the People’s Bank of China, the central bank, pays more attention to the relationship of the yuan with the China Foreign Exchange Trading System’s index of 24 currencies. China’s currency this year has remained relatively steady against this broad-based basket.

The fall of the yuan, a direct result of the Fed’s actions, highlights a key vulnerability of the country: China has remained vulnerable to policy actions in other countries. That means the renminbi is hostage to “hot money” flows.

“For all the talk of the rise of China and the apparent strength of the economy, the Chinese currency has failed to become a safe haven or must-have asset,” Fraser Howie, the co-author of “Red Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of China’s Extraordinary Rise,” told me. “Capital flows into China while much more open than in years gone by are largely speculative in nature. Stocks remain notoriously volatile and the attraction of Chinese government bonds was not a vote of confidence in China but a yield play based on real yields well above prevailing dollar yields. That time has now passed, and capital is leaving China looking for better returns elsewhere.”

So far, the PBOC, the central bank, has resorted to warnings to traders — “You will lose if you keep betting”— and technical fixes, such as requiring banks to deposit reserves when buying foreign currency through forward contracts.

Nothing has worked, however. And as the Wall Street Journal points out, the “two major factors” that supported the renminbi “look likely to reverse.” The paper argues that exports, the one bright spot in the economy, will decline as consumers in America and Europe pull back. At the same time, Beijing will have to loosen monetary policy to avoid a collapse of the Chinese property sector.

China’s exports in the last couple months have been ailing. That’s bad news for Beijing because China is more dependent on exports than it has been for decades. Net exports of goods and services provided 25% of economic growth in 2020 and 21% last year, the highest percentages since 1997. In the first half of this year, the figure hit 36%. These numbers, even in the best of times, are unsustainable.

China’s crucial property sector, which accounts for at least a quarter of the country’s gross domestic product, is ailing too. The big property developers have been defaulting on bond and other obligations since Evergrande Group went bust last September.

Fundamentals of the sector look awful. In the first half of this year, residential property sales were down 26.6% in terms of floor area and 31.8% in terms of value. New construction permits were off 35.4% in terms of floor area. Land purchases plunged 48.3%.

The sector has eroded since then, and eventually Beijing will have to loosen the money supply further — it is already doing so — to prevent a complete failure. Any loosening will make the yuan even less attractive to hold.

China has bigger problems than declining exports and falling property prices, however. Xi Jinping, set to get his third five-year term as the Communist Party’s general secretary at the 20th National Congress this month, is reembracing Maoism and totalitarian social controls, neither of which have been good for the Chinese economy.

His attack on foreign businesses and domestic private entrepreneurs — both large and small — has had a chilling effect. As a result, companies are either withdrawing from China or reducing Chinese exposure.

If this were not bad enough, Xi’s “dynamic zero-COVID” policy has severely disrupted society and the economy.

“The prerequisite for stabilizing the yuan is stabilizing the economy,” Larry Hu of Macquarie told the WSJ. China cannot stabilize the economy with a Maoist in command.

Many are not worried about the renminbi because of the country’s huge foreign exchange reserves, reported to stand at $3.055 trillion at the end of August. Furthermore, as Goldman Sachs noted late last month, Chinese banks accumulated dollars from “strong inflow pressures” from mid-2020 to 2021, and these assets can be used as “buffers for outflows.”

The confidence in the reserves is misplaced. Beijing almost certainly has been including illiquid stock investments and difficult-to-recover loans as part of its reserves, assets that do not meet the IMF’s definition of includable assets. In short, Chinese officials do not possess enormous “firepower” to battle currency speculators shorting the renminbi.

In any event, past Chinese currency interventions have not worked out particularly well. For example, the central bank burned through roughly $1 trillion of foreign exchange reserves in 2015 defending the currency.

“The big question with such a weak currency in China is will this drive a mass rush of capital outflow as regular middle class investors look to protect their money?” Howie asks. “The Communist Party has been able to control much of the economy because of the strong capital controls ensuring money cannot rush out of China but what happens now when years of strength are being wiped away within a few weeks or months?”

The PBOC will undoubtedly fall back on its last resort: currency controls. The renminbi is not convertible on the capital account and during times of stress it has not been, as a practical matter, freely convertible on the current account either.

So instead of capitulating to market forces, look for Beijing to clamp down hard on outbound money flows when — not if — other tactics fail to stop the yuan from spiraling downward.

Currency controls just buy the Chinese regime time, however. Beijing can censor and misreport news and issue phony economic statistics, but the direction of the currency is almost beyond its control, at least over the longer term.

"China Is ‘On A Much Faster Timeline’ To Conquer Taiwan, Biden’s Secretary Of State Says","Communist China has accelerated its timeline for conquering Taiwan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during an event at the Hoover Institution Monday.

Beijing has become increasingly “adversarial” in recent years and is now totally committed to “reunification” with Taiwan, Blinken said while speaking with former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice, who now serves as the director of Stanford’s Hoover Institution. While describing China as “more repressive at home” and more “aggressive abroad,” Blinken said the communist nation’s recent behavior was a “profound concern” to the U.S. and allies.

“There has been a change in the approach from Beijing toward Taiwan in recent years,” Blinken told Rice. “Beijing is determined to pursue reunification on a much faster timeline.” (RELATED: ‘Use Of Force’: Xi Threatens Taiwan Invasion As Chinese Communist Party Congress Kicks Off)

Communist China rejects Taiwan’s sovereignty and in recent years the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has increasingly threatened “reunification-by-force,” claiming that the island nation is governed by “separatists.” While Beijing’s Taiwan invasion timeline remains unclear, Xi allegedly told the PLA to be capable of conquering Taiwan by 2027, CIA Deputy Director David Cohen said in September, according to CNN.

General Secretary Xi Jinping reiterated Beijing’s willingness to use violence to “resolve the Taiwan issue” during the opening session of the 20th National Congress of the CCP in Beijing on Sunday, according to Chinese state-run media outlet CCTV News.

“We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and the utmost effort, but we will never promise to renounce the use of force, and we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary,” Xi said.

Tensions between communist China and the U.S. have spiked in recent years, with the PLA conducting large-scale war games around Taiwan including a massive invasion “rehearsal” which occurred in May. During President Joe Biden’s tenure the PLA has deployed warplanes into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone over 1,400 times, including in August when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the island democracy.

The Chinese Embassy referred the DCNF to comments made by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Tuesday.

“Division of the country for ‘Taiwan independence’ and a peaceful solution are incompatible with each other,” said Wang. “The more rampant ‘Taiwan independence’ forces are, the less likely it is for a peaceful solution to the Taiwan question.”

Washington officially adheres to a “one China policy,” which “does not support Taiwan independence,” yet makes available U.S. “defense articles and services” to Taipei, according to the U.S. Department of State.

The Department of State did not respond immediately to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

China Recruited UK Air Force Pilots To Train Its Military,"China recruited highly-skilled pilots who retired from the British military to train fighters in the People’s Liberation Army, according to the New York Times.

A senior British defense official said the practice began some time before the coronavirus pandemic, but that instances of former military pilots, some of whom flew advanced fighter jets, going to work for the People’s Liberation Army had grown more frequent in recent months, the NYT reported. The official worried the practice could threaten the UK’s national security and said the U.K. was collaborating with allies, some of whom Beijing has also targeted for recruiting trainers.

The official declined to specifically name the other countries the US was working with, according to the NYT.

“We are taking decisive steps to stop Chinese recruitment schemes attempting to headhunt serving and former U.K. Armed Forces pilots to train People’s Liberation Army personnel in the People’s Republic of China,” a U.K. Ministry of Defense (MOD) spokesperson told the Daily Caller News Foundation in a statement. (RELATED: US Air Force ‘Got Its Ass Handed To It’ In War Game Against Simulated Chinese Attack)

As many as 30 former members of the Royal Air Force and other branches of the U.K. armed services accepted contract offers of up to $270,000 through a third-party recruiting company in South Africa, the NYT reported.

None of the retired pilots appear to have violated the Official Secrets Act, which deals with espionage and related crimes, according to the NYT.

“All serving and former personnel are already subject to the Official Secrets Act, and we are reviewing the use of confidentiality contracts and non-disclosure agreements across Defence,” the MoD spokesperson told the DCNF.

While the U.K. does not have clear legislation to block contracts with the PLA, the country has determined to revise laws that allow former servicemembers to provide training support for members of foreign militaries, the official told the NYT.

Britain’s National Security Bill, passed in June to address espionage and other foreign influence threats, “will create additional tools to tackle contemporary security challenges – including this one,” the spokesperson added.

None of the former pilots trained on the F-35, the most advanced warplane in the U.K. fleet, but the PLA fighters pressed the U.K. veterans for information on British and Western maneuvers, the NYT reported.

The MoD spokesperson did not answer the DCNF’s question regarding whether the PLA forces were able to observe or access information about any proprietary maneuvers from the UK servicemembers.

Chinese and Western militaries have plunged into a modernization race in recent years; the PLA has advanced much more quickly than U.S. and U.K. policymakers anticipated. Much of the technology used has come from Western components bought or stolen by entities associated with the Chinese military.

"Qatar Signs 27-Year Gas Deal With China, Fueling Global Energy Competition","Qatar has signed an agreement to supply China’s Sinopec with natural gas for 27 years, the longest deal of its kind, QatarEnergy chief Saad al-Kaabi Kaabi told Reuters Monday.

The $60 billion deal will provide 4 million tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) per year to China as overall global demand for LNG from non-Russian sources has soared, with Qatar, the world’s largest LNG exporter, set to reap the rewards, Reuters reported. China has imported record amounts of LNG from Russia over previous months after Russian prices tanked as a result of the West’s punishing sanctions regime, amid fierce competition for energy resources.

“Today is an important milestone for the first sales and purchase agreement for North Field East project, it is 4 million tonnes for 27 years to Sinopec of China,” Kaabi told Reuters. “It signifies long-term deals are here and important for both seller and buyer.” (RELATED: Here’s How China Is Cashing In On Europe’s Energy Crisis)

Qatar’s North Field comprises part of the world’s largest natural gas field, which it shares with Iran, according to Reuters. QatarEnergy signed two deals earlier in 2022 expanding its reach into the North Field.

“We are very happy about this deal with Sinopec because we have had a long-term relationship in the past, and this takes our relationship to new heights as we have an SPA that will last into the 2050s,” Kaabi told Reuters.

Kaabi added that QatarEnergy is in discussions with other European and Chinese buyers for future deals, as the world looks to increase energy security amid volatile markets.

Sanctions against main LNG exporter Russia, a bid by Western countries to impose consequences for its war in Ukraine, have disrupted global LNG availability and sparked efforts by European countries to seek alternative suppliers.

“I think the recent volatility has driven buyers to understand the importance of having long-term supply,” Kaabi told Reuters.

Kaabi projected Qatar as a significant energy source for Europe over the next several decades in October and is planning to open new production facilities by 2026 to support increased demand, Axios reported.

Qatar may not be able to alleviate Europe’s energy crunch in the short term, Kaabi told Gulf Times, but said “new Qatari LNG exports to Europe should be significant.”

“I think 10 to 15 year deals are probably what are most acceptable to both sides. But for us, the long-term deal, it’s not just about duration, it’s about price,” Kaabi said, according to Gulf Times.

Qatar overtook the U.S. in April as the world’s most significant supplier of LNG, according to the International Trade Administration and Kamco Invest.

The deal comes as Qatar is hosting the World Cup soccer tournament. The small desert country has risen to prominence since it began exploiting natural gas reserves off its coast, while government officials have tied the World Cup to the country’s overall growth, according to The Wall Street Journal.

"The Pentagon Is Sounding The Alarm On China’s Massive Nuclear Build-Out, But Experts Disagree About How To Respond","The U.S. has failed to upgrade or enlarge its nuclear arsenal to keep pace with China’s “ambitious” nuclear expansion, experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation after a Pentagon report showed China on track to own 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035.

U.S. nuclear inferiority may weaken its ability to deter adversaries from launching a first strike or behaving more aggressively, the researchers said.

However, some experts believe that working toward an agreement with China capping the number of nuclear weapons allowed on both sides is the best way to manage China’s nuclear buildup and avoid a costly arms race.



“ Beijing is already racing, and the only thing worse than engaging in an arms race is losing one,” Bradley Bowman of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies told the DCNF.

The Department of Defense (DOD) confirmed China’s “ambitious” acceleration of its nuclear program in a report Tuesday, but experts disagree whether the development presents a growing threat to the U.S. as the Pentagon struggles to update and expand its own aging arsenal.

China’s current nuclear stockpile has exceeded 400 warheads is on track to reach 1,500 warheads by 2035, signaling a push from Beijing to achieve nuclear superiority over the U.S., the Department of Defense (DOD) warned in an annual report on China’s military and security threat to the U.S. released Tuesday. The United States’ nuclear arsenal has grown older in the meantime and smaller relative to those of its peer adversaries, leaving experts wondering how much change is needed to dissuade China from further aggression, experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

“Beijing is already racing, and the only thing worse than engaging in an arms race is losing one,” Bradley Bowman, director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the DCNF. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Pentagon Funded Former Chinese Government Employee, CCP Member’s Nuclear Warfare Research)

China “probably” intends to construct new warheads and missiles that “at least equal the effectiveness, reliability” and resilience of those belonging to the U.S., the report stated. However, China denies taking part in an arms race, instead accusing the U.S. of boosting the “China threat” narrative as a convenient excuse for enhancing its nuclear arsenal and pursuing global military dominance, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.

Satellite imagery from 2021, depicting 300 missile silos under construction in north-central China that could potentially house nuclear weapons, suggested otherwise, according to researchers from the Federation of American Scientists. Earlier that year, Beijing surprised Washington when it apparently conducted a successful test of a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile.

China’s accumulation of nuclear power in recent years represents a “dramatic acceleration” from the mid-2000s, a senior military official told Politico.

However, the United States’ firm rejection of a “no first use” policy and commitment to protect allies under its nuclear umbrella could frighten China into supersizing its own arsenal, Lyle Goldstein, director of the Asia Engagement program at Defense Priorities, told the DCNF

“China is doing a response to what we are doing,” he said.

Washington has recently begun to upgrade the technology on existing nuclear weapons; while the Pentagon positioned the U.S. nuclear force to manage only a Russian threat in the 20th century, it has changed little since, experts told the DCNF.



“We are decidedly behind,” in both quantity and diversity of nuclear capabilities, Tom DiNanno, a Hudson Institute fellow and former arms control official in the State Department, told the DCNF. “Our nuclear force has not been not been modernized, problem one,” while China and Russia have both modernized theirs, he added.

The U.S. has agreed to limit nuclear buildup under the stipulations of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia; the U.S. currently owns roughly 5,500 warheads, of which 1600 are deployed and 1,700 are retired.

To combat the perceived threat from China, the U.S. not only needs newer weaponry, but more nuclear weapons with a variety of characteristics to support an array of deterrence purposes, Patty-Jane Geller, a researcher at the Heritage Foundation’s Center for National Defense, told the DCNF.

“We have the number of nuclear weapons to deter only Russia as a large nuclear threat,” Geller said. “Now that China is second, we won’t have enough to maintain strong nuclear deterrence.”

“Our focus is both undersized and has qualitative issues. We have no hypersonic capability,” DiNanno said.

For example, long-range missiles deployed in the 1970’s are still deployed, even though the Pentagon intended them to last just 10 years, The Associated Press reported.

The Biden administration also plans to retire the United States’ most powerful nuclear weapon, the B83 gravity bomb, over unsustainable operations and maintenance costs, but has not stated how it plans to replace the bomb with an equivalent capability that access well-protected targets, Geller said, a sentiment echoed by Republican congressmembers.

China is equipping its nuclear submarines w/ missiles that can reach our homeland, while the Biden admin is canceling our nuclear-tipped sea-launched missile—against the advice of top military officers. Why are we scaling back our nuclear capabilities while China builds its up? — John Kennedy (@SenJohnKennedy) November 28, 2022

“In order to convince an adversary it’s not a good idea to launch a nuclear weapon, we want to threaten what they value” — their nuclear weapons — “and we also want to be able to limit damage in a nuclear war,” Geller continued. Should America’s adversaries achieve nuclear superiority, “it would allow them to take greater risk in their aggression.”

Some experts questioned whether China’s buildup matters at all. China has long surpassed a threshold of nuclear weapons needed to “credibly threaten to destroy dozens of American cities,” Goldstein told the DCNF, so any increase in the number of weapons China holds in absolute terms is “irrelevant.”

China has abandoned its historically minimalist strategy, which advocated holding the smallest possible number of nuclear weapons to ensure China’s national security, in favor of an “ambitious” nuclear buildup regime, the defense official said, according to Politico.

The U.S. should focus on quality over quantity, he argued, while attempting the difficult task of getting China to agree to arms control measures, thus avoiding a costly arms race.

While China has pledged never to launch a first nuclear strike, it has demanded nuclear parity with peer countries who hope to welcome China into an international arms control system, The Washington Post reported. China’s hesitance to agree to nonproliferation terms could further upset the global balance of power and provide China with an enhanced array of options for “deterrence signaling,” exercises of power meant to contain U.S. action, the defense official said.

“The more proliferation there is, the more concerning it is — the more deeply destabilizing to the region it is,” Pentagon spokesperson Brig. Gen Pat Ryder said in a statement Tuesday.

China could mimic Russia’s fielding of nuclear weapons over Ukraine in a Taiwan contingency, frightening the U.S. into stifling support for a key ally, Geller explained to the DCNF.

However, if the U.S. were to scale back its commitments, a scenario where China and the U.S. have trained tactical warheads on one another could be avoided, Goldstein said.

“The pace and opaque nature of Beijing’s ‘strategic breakout,’ combined with its refusal to engage in substantive nuclear arms talks with the United States, risk miscalculation and force the Pentagon to assume the worst,” Bowman told the DCNF.

"China’s Xi, Saudi Arabia Celebrate Relationship ‘Milestone’ Months After Crown Prince Snubs Biden","Chinese General Secretary Xi Jinping touched down Riyadh on Wednesday to cement “milestone” relations between the two nations, after Saudi leaders snubbed U.S. President Joe Biden in a similar state visit in July.

Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammad bin Salman (MBS) is expected to offer Xi a lavish welcome ahead of a series of bilateral talks, where the two are expected to deepen ties and ink billions in economic agreements, according to Reuters. The Saudis have painted the meeting as a repudiation of foreign attempts to meddle in Riyadh’s internal politics, a possible allusion to Biden’s repeated characterization of the kingdom as a “pariah” and human rights offender.

The meeting represents an “an epoch-making milestone in the history of the development of China-Arab relations,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Wednesday.

Xi and Saudi rulers will hold a first-ever joint China-Arab States Summit t0 “strengthen solidarity and coordination,” Ning added. (RELATED: Qatar Signs 27-Year Gas Deal With China, Fueling Global Energy Competition)

The meeting follows a terse encounter between Biden and MBS in July which culminated in a failed U.S. effort to persuade Saudi Arabia to increase oil output at an upcoming OPEC+ meeting ahead of the November midterm elections, after which the White House said it is “re-evaluating” its relationship with the oil-rich kingdom.

Saudi Arabia maintains that it evaluates relationships on the basis of the advantages it can provide to the kingdom, according to The Wall Street Journal. However, its deepening military and economic cooperation with China has unsettled Washington, used to relying on Saudi Arabia as a reliable energy producer and source of stability in the Middle East.

“We are mindful of the influence that China is trying to grow around the world,” National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday, Reuters reported.

China is Saudi Arabia’s biggest trading partner and produces 18% of Beijing’s total oil imports, still the China’s largest energy supplier even as the effect of Europe’s oil price cap on Russian crude, also a major supplier for China, remains uncertain, according to the Saudi-owned Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper.

Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman pledged to ensure Saudi Arabia proves a “trusted and reliable” partner to China on energy, Reuters reported. The two countries are expected to agree to roughly $29 billion in mutual investment, including a Chinese factory hub in the kingdom.

“Beijing does not burden its partners with demands or political expectations and refrains from interfering in their internal affairs,” Saudi columnist Abdulrahman Al-Rashed wrote in Asharq Al-Awsat, according to Reuters.

The visit also comes as tensions between the U.S. and China reach their highest levels in decades. The Pentagon identifies China as the largest “pacing” challenge facing the U.S. military, and China’s saber-rattling in the Indo-pacific, predatory trade practices and human rights violations on a massive scale have further soured relations with the U.S.

"China To Team Up With Russia, Conduct Joint Naval Drills","Russian and Chinese navies will conduct joint exercises in the coming days to strengthen cooperation between the two nations, Russia’s defense ministry said Monday, according to media reports.

A naval contingent deployed from the base in Vladivostok on Monday to participate in the combined drills with Chinese warships from Dec. 21 to Dec. 27, Moscow said Monday, according to The Wall Street Journal. The drills are the latest in an annual series of joint exercises since 2012, but they underscore increasing worries in the West of military cooperation between two major U.S. adversaries.

“The main purpose of the exercises is to strengthen naval cooperation between Russia and China, and maintain peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,” the defense ministry said, according to Reuters. (RELATED: Japan Reverses Course, Announces Largest Military Buildup Since WWII Amid Rising China Threat)

The drills will involve submarine maneuvers and firing artillery at targets in the East China Sea, where Russian and Chinese bombers conducted joint operations in May ahead of President Joe Biden’s visit to Tokyo, according to Reuters. Four Russian warships and six Chinese vessels will take part, along with fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters.

Chinese authorities have not made a public statement about the drills, according to the WSJ.

The two countries last conducted large-scale military exercises in August, marking the first time China has deployed forces from three military branches to participate in a single series of drills with Russia.

China and Russia agreed to a “no limits” partnership aimed at hedging out America’s global influence in February, days before Russia launched its invasion into Ukraine, Reuters reported. While Beijing has criticized the West’s sanctions regime against Russia, it has avoided decisive language exposing its attitude toward Moscow’s war and stopped short of providing overt military support.

Russian President Vladimir Putin revealed Chinese General Secretary Xi Jinping had expressed some concerns about Russia’s war in Ukraine in September, opening a window into the two countries’ relationship, Reuters reported. Putin said he appreciated China’s “balanced” position toward the war.

However, Xi has issued instructions centered around developing stronger economic ties with Russia in recent weeks, the WSJ reported, citing policy advisers in Beijing, and Russia has supported China’s position toward Taiwan.

“Cooperation between our countries is developing dynamically in all areas. I believe that the report by the General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Xi Jinping opens up new prospects here, which will undoubtedly be implemented,” Russian Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko said in October, according to Russian state-run media agency TASS.

The partnership between the two countries has lawmakers in the U.S. worried; Congress’ latest bill directs the intelligence community to research and report on China’s military support for Russia.

I don’t believe Russia could be weakened in the long term given its landmass, rich resources and talented people. A weakened Russia would be a bad news for the region and the world. So don’t gloat! — Chen Weihua （陈卫华） (@chenweihua) December 19, 2022

Russian President Vladimir Putin landed in Belarus on Monday for a meeting with President Alexander Lukashenko, and could use the meeting to apply pressure on Belarus to enhance cooperation with Russia, the WSJ reported.

The Russian and Chinese foreign ministries did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

EXCLUSIVE: Gov. Youngkin Pulls Virginia From Location Consideration In Chinese Deal With Ford,"Virginia is removing itself from consideration as the location of a manufacturing plant in an ongoing deal between Ford Motor Co. and a Chinese battery manufacturer, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), a person close to talks told the Daily Caller.

“The governor has directed the Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP) to remove Virginia from consideration for this project and not to submit an incentive package,” the source told the Daily Caller. “Ultimately, Virginia is removing itself from any possibilities of the CATL plant being established due to concerns surrounding the deal.”

The ownership arrangement between Ford and CATL permits Ford to own the plant, including all buildings and structures, while CATL will have control of the factory operations and the technology used to build the car batteries.

CATL’s connection to the Chinese government is a “major concern” for Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a source close to the talks told the Daily Caller, adding that Youngkin also has an issue with the terms of the deal that would allow CATL to receive U.S. tax benefits under the new Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

SCOOP: Ford and China’s CATL are considering building a battery manufacturing plant in Michigan in a complex arrangement designed to reap new tax benefits without running afoul of US-China political sensitivities, sources tell @gablova @KeithNaughton & mehttps://t.co/fNDfllrmlg — Eric Martin (@EMPosts) December 15, 2022

Although operated by a Chinese company, this unconventional partnership would qualify the Ford-owned plant to receive the renewable energy production tax credits through Section 48C expansions in the IRA.

Youngkin recently took steps to block CCP-linked applications at the state level, according to an executive order the governor signed on Dec. 16. The order banned TikTok and WeChat from being used on government-issued devices, including state-issued cellphones, laptops, or other devices capable of connecting to the internet except for public safety purposes.

“TikTok and WeChat data are a channel to the Chinese Communist Party, and their continued presence represents a threat to national security, the intelligence community, and the personal privacy of every single American,” said Youngkin in a press release. “We are taking this step today to secure state government devices and wireless networks from the threat of infiltration and ensure that we safeguard the data and cybersecurity of state government.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/12/20/exclusive-gov-youngkin-pulls-virginia-location-consideration-chinese-deal-ford/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjrjJfnorP9AhUBsVYBHWuQBMg4FBAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw2E_Fp6ryKx5AHfNXiggKdE,2022-12-20
Taiwan Claims China Staged Huge Military Incursion,"Taiwan’s defense ministry claimed Monday that China staged one of its biggest incursions into the island’s sea and airspace.

Some 71 Chinese air force planes entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone in recent days. Forty-three crossed the median line between the two countries in the South China Sea on Monday, according to the BBC. This is Beijing’s second large-scale incursion of 2022. The first came in August after Beijing was enraged that then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, the first high-ranking U.S. official to do so in 25 years.

Is Taiwan the next military flashpoint? https://t.co/r2oMLCFRUN — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) December 22, 2022

Taiwan is in practice an independent state, despite China’s claims political ownership of the island. China has never said it is unwilling to use force to bring Taiwan back under the control of the Chinese Communist Party, the BBC noted.

Taiwan’s defense ministry is concerned of the possibility of a full-scale invasion and military conflict with China, issuing survival handbooks to citizens in April to prepare for such a scenario. (RELATED: Chinese Ambassador Says War ‘Likely’ With US If Taiwan Continues Toward Independence)

China stated that the recent incursion was a series of “strike drills” that occurred around the island on Sunday. Beijing claimed it was a response to Taiwanese and American provocation, the BBC continued. Similar drills have been held throughout the year.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/12/26/taiwan-claims-china-staged-huge-military-incursion/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwim9_znorP9AhX3mlYBHQe3Csg4MhAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw213XkS8sjpbaPJADWDaDEE,2022-12-26
GORDON CHANG: China Must Be Shaking Its Head In Disbelief At The Biden Admin’s Stunningly Bad Decision-Making,"“I’ve come to expect so little from the federal government,” Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told Newsmax. “Even at that standard, this was underwhelming, to say the least.”

The senator was referring to the Biden administration clearing a Chinese company to own 370 acres of land within 12 miles of Grand Forks Air Force Base in Grand Forks, North Dakota.

As a result, China will be able to use a proposed $700 million corn milling plant on the site to spy on military communications and even disrupt them. In Beijing, they must be shaking their heads in disbelief at the inability of the U.S. to protect some of its most sensitive communications. (RELATED: GORDON CHANG: China Insults A Submissive Biden Desperate To Talk To Xi)

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a Treasury Department-led interagency task force, decided that the purchase was not a “covered transaction” within the meaning of Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950. Therefore, CFIUS, as the agency is known, decided it did not have jurisdiction to block the land purchase.

CFIUS is correct in its statutory reading. As trade and investment expert Alan Tonelson told Gatestone, the task force “did not need more than five minutes to determine that it did not have the authority to stop the sale.”

The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 authorized CFIUS to review, among other things, purchases by foreign parties of land close to “specific airports, maritime ports, or military installations.” Those military facilities are listed in an appendix to regulations.

“Grand Forks Air Force Base did not make the cut,” Tonelson, who blogs at RealityChek, said. “The decision of the Congressional authors of the recent CFIUS reform to permit any foreign purchase of any land near any U.S. military installation was a clear case of legislative malpractice.”

Moreover, the failure to include all military installations in the implementing regulations was a clear case of regulatory malpractice.

As a result of these enormous mistakes, Fufeng USA, a subsidiary of a Shandong province-based agribusiness giant, is, at least for the moment, free to build its wet corn milling and biofermentation plant in Grand Forks.

Fufeng USA said it was “pleased” with the decision. Chinese war planners must be ecstatic. (RELATED: BETSY MCCAUGHEY: The Left’s ESG Scam Is A Mirror Image Of CCP-Style Thuggery)

“The Chinese will now have the ability to conduct passive, persistent surveillance of both signals controlling experimental drones that are routinely tested at that USAF facility as well as signals that are routinely beamed to and from sensitive U.S. military satellites,” said Brandon Weichert, author of “Winning Space: How America Remains a Superpower,” to this publication.

Yet that is not all. “The worst-case scenario involves active sabotage of operations at the Grand Forks facility,” Weichert points out. “Should the U.S. and China end up in a shooting war over, say, Taiwan, Fufeng’s property near the Air Force base could be used to send malicious signals to jam passing satellites or disrupt the operation of drones. We have made ourselves vulnerable on our own territory.”

This is not just a theoretical concern. In the Chinese Communist Party’s top-down system, no Chinese entity or individual can resist one of its demands. Moreover, Articles 7 and 14 of China’s National Intelligence Law of 2017 requires every Chinese party to spy upon receipt of an order to do so.

So, what to do?

“The fight is not over,” said Jodi Carlson, a Grand Forks resident, to Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post, referring to the Fufeng plant.

President Joe Biden can use his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to block the sale of the Grand Forks land and the building of the milling facility.

For future cases, Tonelson says, “either the law needs to be rewritten immediately to bring such cases under CFIUS purview or the President should issue an executive order mandating this change.”

There is a larger issue. As Weichert asks, “What other purchases by foreigners have slipped through the cracks?”

“As long as we’re talking about fixing things, we ought to start with the most serious problem: The Committee is chaired by Treasury, which never saw a foreign investment it did not approve,” Frank Gaffney, vice chair of the Committee on the Present Danger: China, told Gatestone. “This means, as a practical matter, that an agency that basically doesn’t give a damn about national security is entrusted with running a process that supposedly evaluates and protects national security.”

Consequently, CFIUS rarely turns down foreign purchases, “precious few” as he says.

Gaffney believes the CFIUS mandate must be broadened “to include any foreign investment that threatens our national security interests or, for that matter, other vital interests, in the face of unrestricted and especially economic warfare.”

China’s regime, for instance, has for decades launched broad-based assaults on America, and the current CFIUS framework is inadequate to deal with such threats.

Yes, America is strong because of its open system, which has allowed foreign parties to invest and strengthen the American economy. Yet China’s regime, which has declared a “people’s war” on the U.S., uses investments to undermine America.

In wartime — the Communist Party believes it is currently in such a struggle with America — Washington needs to prohibit all investments from China, especially ones near critical Air Force installations in North Dakota.

World Health Organization Finally Calls Out China For Lying About COVID-19,"The World Health Organization (WHO) called out the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for its lack of transparency regarding the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in China after a meeting between officials Tuesday.

The WHO issued a statement on the meeting with Chinese officials Wednesday, stating that it “continue to closely monitor the situation in the People’s Republic of China” and that there’s a “critical need for and importance of additional analysis as well as sharing of sequence data.” The CCP has only reported a handful of deaths in recent weeks from the virus, while some analysts claim true infection numbers could be in the tens of millions and deaths could be more than 10,000 per day.

The World Health Organization has said that China is under-representing the true impact of Covid in the country. On Tuesday, China said passengers arriving from abroad will no longer have to quarantine. — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) January 5, 2023

Mike Ryan, emergencies director at the WHO, went further in comments to reporters Wednesday. “The current numbers being published from China underestimate the true impact of the disease in terms of hospital admissions and ICU admissions and in terms of deaths,” he said. “The state should be the primary source of credible, accurate information relating to people’s health of which they can take appropriate action.”

Cases and deaths have spiked substantially in China since the CCP lifted its zero-COVID policy in December, although it’s difficult to ascertain just how severe the situation is due to the lack of transparency offered by Chinese authorities. Some prognosticators have projected that the number of Chinese people who may die this year following the abandonment of zero-COVID to be in the millions, as Chinese vaccines are not particularly effective and there is a low level of population-wide natural immunity due to lockdowns. (RELATED: How Did The World Health Organization Became A Mouthpiece For China?)

Critics of the WHO argued during the early days of the pandemic that the body was not doing enough to hold China accountable for the outbreak of COVID-19. The organization’s initial team assembled to investigate the origins of COVID-19 in China was marred by controversy and conflicts of interest among its members. Since, the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has acknowledged that a lab leak of COVID-19 is possible and more member countries are calling on China to be open about the severity of its COVID-19 outbreak.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/05/world-health-organization-china-coronavirus-data/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwji5fboorP9AhVFpVYBHYidA8U4UBAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw3qtSlWUQStZUfg3BByufWv,2023-01-05
China Strikes A Deal To Get Oil From The Taliban,"A subsidiary of a Chinese state-run energy firm signed a deal Thursday to extract oil in the Taliban-run Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

Xinjiang Central Asia Petroleum and Gas, a subsidiary of the state-run Chinese National Petroleum Corporation, will invest up to $150 million annually, which will increase to $540 million in three years, to pump oil in the Amu River Oil Basin, according to a statement released by the Taliban government. The contract, which represents the Taliban administration’s first international energy deal, was signed in the presence of the Taliban’s Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and the Chinese Ambassador to Afghanistan Wang Yu. (RELATED: US Solar Panel Installations Fall Following Crackdown On Chinese Slave Labor, Report Finds)

The Taliban government will receive a 15% royalty fee and oil production will begin at 1,000 tons per day, eventually hitting 20,000 tons, Omid Khurram, a spokesman for the country’s ministry of mines and petroleum, told Bloomberg. The oil project, which is located in a basin that holds more than 80 million barrels of crude oil, will directly provide jobs to 3,000 Afghans, according to CNN.

Although no country has officially recognized the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, China has maintained close economic ties and will benefit from a recently built trade route between the two states, according to the Taliban’s Ministry For Economic Affairs. China is attempting to secure its energy supply chains and ramp up domestic power production to avoid supply shortages, the state-affiliated Global Times reported Wednesday.

The United Nations condemned the Taliban in December after the Islamic fundamentalist group banned Afghan women from attending university. Multiple foreign governments, including the United States, have refrained from officially recognizing the Taliban administration until it reverses its stance on women’s education, according to Reuters.

A spokesperson for the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

China Kicks Off 2023 With Massive Combat Drills Around Taiwan,"Dozens of Chinese warplanes and four ships conducted massive combat drills, the first of 2023, around Taiwan into the early hours of Monday, according to the defense ministries of China and Taiwan.

The exercises, which began Sunday, focused on testing Chinese naval and aerial forces’ ability to complete joint assaults and “resolutely counter the collusive and provocative acts of the external forces and the ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces, China’s defense ministry said in a statement. Taiwan’s defense ministry accused 28 aircraft, out of the 57 total taking part in the exercises, of crossing the unofficial dividing line through the Taiwan Strait into the island’s protected airspace.

“Armed Forces have monitored the situation,” Taiwan’s defense ministry said. (RELATED: Chinese Invasion Of Taiwan Would Devastate US And Allies, Simulation Finds)

China nearly doubled the number of fighter jets, bombers and support aircraft incursions into Taiwan’s claimed airspace in 2022 compared to the year prior, according to AFP, as Beijing grows more explicit in its desire to absorb Taiwan — by force if necessary — and the U.S. sounds the alarm on China’s growing military influence in the Pacific region.

“We seek neither escalation nor conflict,” Taiwan’s defense ministry added Monday in a rare follow up to their regular statement on Chinese territorial incursions.

Beijing’s “false accusation and irrational provocation have severely destabilized the security of Taiwan Strait and neighboring regions,” the ministry said. “We can and we will keep our homeland safe.”

The large-scale combat exercises are the second in less than a month. China sent a sortie of 47 fighter jets across the median line, with a record 71 total spotted near the island, on Dec. 25, shortly after President Joe Biden signed a bill authorizing billions in military support for Taiwan, CNN reported.

The U.S. conducted its first Freedom of Navigation Operation of the year on Jan 5, transiting the USS Chung-Hoon through the Taiwan Strait “through waters where high-seas freedoms of navigation and overflight apply in accordance with international law,” according to a statement. The U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet conducts Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea just a few times each year in a show of force against China’s territorial claims.

Chinese state-run Global Times published a story afterward threatening intense military drills in response to any continued “provocations” from external forces and “Taiwan independence” fighters. The outlet cited a State Department announcement of a potential $180 million arms sale to Taiwan on Dec. 28.

The exercises preceded a visit from German lawmakers to the island on Monday, who plan to meet with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-Wen, the government’s National Security Council head and the main council responsible for relations with China, according to The Associated Press.

House Votes To Block Biden From Selling Oil Reserves To China,"The House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted Thursday to ban the sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China.

All 218 voting Republicans and 113 Democrats supported the Protecting America’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act, while all 97 “no” votes came from Democrats. The legislation, introduced by Energy and Commerce Committee chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, is one of seven bills guaranteed by the House rules package to receive a vote.

“Draining our strategic reserves for political purposes and selling portions of it to China is a significant threat to our national security,” McMorris Rodgers said in a floor speech. “The administration is not just hurting our own ability to respond to emergencies and national security events, they are actively bolstering the oil reserves of our most dangerous geopolitical adversary, the Chinese Communist Party. This is unacceptable and it must stop.”

The Biden administration has sold nearly six million barrels of oil to the Chinese state oil company Sinopec since 2021. Overall, the administration sold more than 260 million barrels of oil in 2021 and 2022 in a bid to stabilize gas prices. Americans use about 20 million barrels of oil a day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Republicans have questioned whether or not Hunter Biden benefited financially from the sale, given his longtime connections to Sinopec. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Oversight Republicans Call Out Chinese Oil Sale That May Have Benefited Hunter Biden, Russia)

The House rules package, negotiated by GOP leadership and the 20 Republicans who initially withheld support from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, names seven bills and resolutions that must come up for votes during the 118th Congress. In addition to the oil sale ban, the resolution also names bills addressing illegal immigration and rising crime.

Chinese Communist Party-Linked Solar Panel Company Could Reap ‘Inflation Reduction Act’ Handouts With US Factory,"JA Solar, a Chinese green energy giant whose chairman is tied to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), has leased a plot of land in Phoenix, Arizona, to construct a $60 million solar panel factory that is poised to benefit from huge green energy tax incentives included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Jin Baofang, chairman and CEO of the Bejing-based company, said that he had been a CCP member for 40 years during a 2020 interview with the Chinese state-run newspaper “The Paper.” The JA Solar factory, which could take advantage of the green energy tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), will create 600 jobs and use automated assembly lines to manufacture 2 gigawatts’ worth of solar panels annually once it becomes fully operational, according to a Tuesday Arizona Commerce Authority press release. (RELATED: China Strikes A Deal To Get Oil From The Taliban)

Baofang also works for the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products and also served as a delegate to the 10th, 11th and 12th National People’s Congress of China, the country’s legislative body, according to JA Solar’s website. On its website, the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products purports to be a nonprofit trade organization; however, Chinese chambers of commerce and similar trade groups are often state-controlled and have long been a part of efforts to expand CCP influence around the world, according to 2019 report published by the Jamestown Foundation, a conservative defense policy think tank.

The IRA, which President Joe Biden signed into law in August, offers up $369 billion in tax credits for domestic solar, wind and other renewable energy projects that begin construction before Dec. 31, 2025, according to Marcum LLP, an accounting and advisory firm. The bill establishes the “Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit” which will reward PV module (solar panel) manufacturers 7 cents per watt of energy produced in the U.S., according to the Energy Department (DOE).

The legislation package also includes an investment tax credit of up to 30% of qualifying investment costs if solar producers are able satisfy labor requirements issued by the Treasury Department pertaining to the construction of the manufacturing facility.

Foreign multinational companies with existing or planned subsidiaries in the U.S. will be eligible to receive IRA tax credits, according to Vistra, a corporate service provider. In addition to the manufacturing credits, the legislation will allow homeowners to subtract 30% of the cost of installing solar panels and other sun-powered home products from their federal taxes, incentivizing Americans to buy solar products, according to the DOE.

“Arizona is proud to welcome JA Solar’s first U.S. manufacturing facility to Phoenix,” Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs said in a statement. “There’s no better place in the world for sustainable industries like solar and we are excited to see this facility add to Arizona’s clean energy reputation.”

JA Solar, the Arizona Commerce Authority, Hobbs’ office and the White House did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Chinese State Media Claims New Stealth Fighter Proved It Can Sneak Attack Taiwan,"Communist China’s newest stealth fighter eluded detection by Taiwanese military radar during a recent aerial skirmish against undisclosed foreign aircraft, Chinese state-run media reported late Tuesday night.

Two J-20 fighter jets from the Wang Hai Group of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) allegedly intercepted and “expelled” two foreign aircraft at an undisclosed location recently during an “emergency” mission, Chinese state-run media outlet Global Times reported. Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense, which publishes daily bulletins tracking PLA flight paths around Taiwan, failed to report the J-20 stealth fighters, according to Global Times. (RELATED: The World Economic Forum Partners With Chinese Tech Firms Allegedly Linked To Genocide, Surveillance)

“The J-20’s stealth capability is its biggest advantage. It means that the enemy radar can see nothing, but we can already launch attacks,” pilot Wei Xin told CCTV.

Brandon Weichert, a U.S. Air Force consultant, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that it is “entirely believable” that Taiwan was unable to detect the J-20, claiming that the U.S. military is also unable to detect China’s new warplane.

“It’s something that the Air Force has been trying to work on for the better part of a year and it hasn’t overcome the deficit due to budgetary constraints,” Weichert said. “It operates the E-3 spy plane, which is completely obsolete when compared to the suite of capabilities the Chinese have in the J-20.”

“The Australians do have the E-7 which can detect the J-20, but the U.S. Air Force has not resourced getting this capability sufficiently enough and the regional allies cannot meet the increased demand,” Weichert told the DCNF. “So, it’s a huge and ongoing gap that China will exploit at every opportunity.”

The J-20 was first officially unveiled in August 2021, according to Zhejiang Daily News, and sports a “low-observable” design which allegedly allows the aircraft to “bypass radar and electronic countermeasures with low to zero visibility,” the Washington, D.C., think tank, Center for Strategic and International Studies, has reported.

(RELATED: FBI Raided Overseas Chinese Government Police Station In New York, Seized Materials: REPORT) In an alleged recent nighttime aerial encounter involving foreign aircraft of an undisclosed nation facing off against J-20’s cousin, the J-16 fighter jet , the PLA warplane reportedly also demonstrated stealth capabilities by “shutting off all active electronic devices and flying low” to sneak up behind the foreign aircraft, Global Times reported.

J-16 fighter jets have increasingly been involved in a series of engagements with Western air forces, according to multiple sources. For example, a J-16 allegedly intercepted an Australian P-8 maritime surveillance aircraft in June 2022 and discharged metal shards into the P-8’s engine, Australia’s defense minister, Richard Marles, said at the time. A spokesman for United States Indo-Pacific Command, which is headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii, declined to comment on “intelligence matters” and referred the DCNF to the 2022 Department of Defense (DOD) report concerning China’s “military and security developments.” The Chinese Embassy and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office did not respond immediately to the DCNF’s request for comment.

GORDON CHANG: A Fierce Adversary Has Emerged Against China,"“Perfectly aligned.”

That’s how Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, while meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday in Washington, described his country and the United States. (RELATED: GORDON CHANG: China Smiles As America Falls Deeper Into The TikTok Trap)

The alignment may not be perfect — President Joe Biden publicly referred to disagreements when greeting Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Friday — but the relationship is close nonetheless. The aggressive People’s Republic of China is forcing countries to stand together.

In East Asia, countries can smell war. Japan is on a “war footing” write Zack Cooper and Eric Sayers on the War on the Rocks site.

Kishida’s trip to America was the last stop on a five-nation tour that covered all the G7 countries except Germany. The trip was historic. Along the way, he inked Japan’s first security-related pact with a European nation, the U.K. The U.K. pact, which covers joint deployments, will serve as a model for future ones, Tokyo-based Lance Gatling of Nexial Research, an aerospace and defense consultancy, told me.

In Washington, Japan cemented other significant agreements. Japan and the U.S. signed a deal on cooperation in space, which extends to space the coverage of the U.S.-Japan mutual defense treaty.

Moreover, the two countries announced a redeployment of U.S. Marines on the Japanese island of Okinawa. The 12th Marine Regiment, now an artillery unit, will become by 2025 the 12th Marine Littoral Regiment, a quick-reaction force. Tokyo okayed the change despite persistent local opposition that has stymied defense deployments in the past.

A “senior administration official” told the AP that negotiations with Japan over U.S. force deployments on Okinawa have always been “unbelievably fraught, incredibly challenging and difficult” and often required years to complete. The agreement covering the most recent redeployment, in the words of that news organization, was “completed with striking speed.”

It is stunning that Japan has signed a flurry of defense pacts in the span of a week. More stunning is the speed at which the Japanese defense establishment is now moving. The space agreement was, as Blinken said, “a decade in the making.” It is no coincidence that arrangements that took years to finalize are now being completed at rapid speed.

Gatling terms the change in Japanese defense thinking “a quiet revolution for over a decade.” “While often criticized as too slow to change, Japan does change, and the result of many hard years of intense diplomatic and bureaucratic labor are making headlines today,” he says.

Slow no more. As Biden declared when greeting Kishida at the White House on Friday, “We meet at a remarkable moment.”

The moment is all the more remarkable because Japan’s “tipping point” came after the assassination of the country’s former prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in early July. Many thought the country would return to a dovish stance after the passing of the long-serving Abe, then the leader of the biggest faction in the governing Liberal Democratic Party.

Yet Abe or no Abe, there are for Japan four overriding realities, all relating in some fashion to China. First, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine jolted Tokyo. As Kishida said in June, “Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow.” The prospect for war is now real for Japan.

Second, any Chinese invasion of Taiwan will almost certainly mean China commits acts of war against Japan.

Why? Japan’s westernmost and southernmost inhabited island, Yonaguni, is actually south of Taiwan’s capital of Taipei, and Taiwan’s mountains are visible from the Japanese island on a clear day. For a Chinese invasion of Taiwan to be successful, the People’s Liberation Army must establish a blockade. For the blockade to be successful, it must include Yonaguni and nearby islands.

Third, Tokyo is supportive of Taipei because the defense of the Japanese homeland depends on Taiwan remaining in friendly hands. Japan and Taiwan, after all, are part of the same island chain, and Japan’s southern flank will be wide open if Taiwan is incorporated as China’s 34th province.

As an Asian security expert once told me, “Japan will never let China take Taiwan.”

Fourth, China’s territorial ambitions are expanding. During the Mao era, Beijing acknowledged that the Senkaku Islands, eight outcroppings in the East China Sea, were Japanese. In 1971, however, China raised a sovereignty claim to them. Now, Beijing is laying the groundwork for a claim to Okinawa and the rest of the Ryukyu chain. China, everyone in Japan can now see, wants to dismember Japan.

So, despite grumbling in the Japanese business community and noisy concerns of pacifists, Tokyo realizes it must take an active role in its own defense. In the past, Japan was content to be the junior partner in their mutual defense treaty, merely providing basing support for U.S. forces going into battle.

Last month, however, Tokyo took a critical step forward by issuing its National Security Strategy and supporting documents, which incorporate a fundamental change in thinking. Kishida’s government dropped a self-imposed prohibition on attacking attackers on their home soil.

To give itself that “counterstrike” capability, Japan will be buying Tomahawk cruise missiles from the United States. It will also be participating in offensive cyber activities.

So China, thanks to its belligerence, has just acquired another adversary, which can immeasurably complicate Chinese war planning. And more important, that new adversary is beginning to look fierce.

REPORT: US Defense Industrial Base Not Prepared For War With China,"The U.S. defense industrial base is not prepared for a protracted war with China in the Taiwan Strait, according to a new think tank report.

The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) found in its report that some U.S. munitions, such as long-range precision-guided munitions, would run out in less than a week of conflict in the Taiwan Strait. (RELATED: US Quietly Boosts Military Training For Taiwan: REPORT)

The munitions shortfalls demonstrate that the U.S. defense industrial base lacks the capacity for a major war as China continues to invest in munitions and weapons systems six times faster than the U.S., the report says.

The quantity of javelins sent to Ukraine as of August 2022 represented seven years of production based on fiscal year (FY) 2022 rates and the Stingers sent to Ukraine are roughly equal to 20 years worth of production, according to CSIS.

U.S. military support has enabled the Ukrainians to deter Russian aggression and demonstrates how conflict between major powers is likely to be protracted and industrial if deterrence fails, CSIS says. The U.S. has been slow to replenish its weapons stocks and it is likely to take years for the defense industrial base to produce and deliver critical weapons systems that have been used up, the CSIS report says.

The report also highlights outdated contracting procedures and bureaucracy that make deterrence more difficult and suggests streamlining them for wartime footing, according to CSIS.

“The U.S. military services have underinvested in weapons systems and munitions for a conventional war, and the DoD’s acquisition system faces challenges in creating the incentives for industry to invest in sufficient stockpiles of key weapons systems,” the report warns.

“The U.S. Department of Defense, in coordination with Congress, should develop a plan now that involves taking steps to streamline and improve production, acquisitions, replenishment, Foreign Military Sales, ITAR, and other policies and procedures,” the report specifies.

CSIS Senior Vice President Seth Jones conducted the report based on CSIS war games, interviews with dozens of national security officials, publicly available data and other CSIS analysis. “The bottom line is the defense industrial base, in my judgment, is not prepared for the security environment that now exists,” Jones said to The Wall Street Journal.

China Is Dominating The Electric Vehicle Market. Here’s Why,"Chinese manufacturers continue to dominate the global market for electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries, thanks to their control of minerals critical to the EV supply chain, according to economists who spoke with the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Chinese brands control an overwhelming majority of their domestic market, accounting for 81% of all electric vehicle sales in 2022, with China on pace to become the first country where 50% of yearly sales to be electric in 2025, according to the Financial Times. China has been able to maintain its dominant position through its control of the mineral resources necessary to produce batteries for electric vehicles, Heritage Foundation economist Diana Furchtgott-Roth told the DCNF (RELATED: China’s Network Of Foreign Ports Is Fueling The Country’s Military Intelligence Ambitions)

Battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), while not state-owned, has alleged deep ties with the Chinese Communist Party, and gets significant tax benefits from China’s “Made in China 2025” initiative, which launched in 2015 to promote Chinese technology. The battery-maker was at the heart of Republic Governor Glenn Youngkin of Virginia’s decision to pull Virginia out of the running for a Ford battery manufacturing facility, as CATL would retain ownership of the battery technology at the heart of Ford’s cars.

The move drew criticism from Democrats in the Virginia state government, who accused the governor of sacrificing an estimated 2,5000 Virginian jobs for his political gain, according to the Associated Press. Furchtgott-Roth praised Youngkin for showing “strategic insight,” and promoting “American interests over the Chinese game.”

CATL — which supplies batteries for Tesla and Volkswagen — combines with China’s second-largest battery-maker BYD to produce more than 50% of all electric vehicle batteries in the world, the FT reported. The company is able to control such a large portion of the market thanks to government-funded mines for rare earth minerals in eastern China and agreements with cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where it sourced roughly 25% of its cobalt reserves in 2022, Furchtgott-Roth told the DCNF. (RELATED: Tesla’s China Head Now Oversees Its US Factories, Becomes Musk’s Number Two: REPORT)

As of 2019, China produced roughly 60% of rare earth minerals worldwide, while the DRC produced roughly 70% of the world’s supply of cobalt, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). China was also the world’s number one processor of “transition minerals,” considered key to green energy projects, processing nearly 90% of the world’s rare earth minerals, and roughly 60% of all cobalt and lithium, while accounting for more than 30% of global processing for nickel and copper.

China has enjoyed relatively uncontested access to African rare earth minerals because the U.S. effectively “pretends as though Africa doesn’t exist” and is generally unwilling to negotiate or collaborate with African governments, according to Furchtgott-Roth.

Electric vehicles require more than four times the minerals of a car with a conventional internal combustion engine, according to the IEA. In addition, while traditional cars typically only require copper and manganese, electric vehicles also require nickel, lithium, cobalt, graphite and trace amounts of rare earth minerals.

It is this access to and control of the most in-demand minerals that has enabled Chinese dominance of the electric vehicle market, Fuchgott-Roth told the DCNF.

“Basically, we have left Africa to the Chinese, so we’ve left all those minerals to the Chinese, to the detriment of our [electric battery] operations” said Furchtgott-Roth.

Through 2020, roughly 15% of the world’s cobalt and rare earth minerals were used in clean energy technologies, according to the IEA. By 2040, between 40% to 70% of demand for cobalt will be driven by clean energy technology, with a smaller jump to 25% to roughly 40% of demand for rare earth metals being taken up by clean tech, depending on how aggressively countries pursue climate change agreements.

A loosened “regulatory process for U.S. companies to actually engage with African firms,” would make it easier for U.S. companies to compete with Chinese firms in Africa, but that is unlikely to happen soon, Ryan Yonk, a member of the senior research faculty at the American Institute for Economic Research, told the DCNF. Yonk credits China’s aggressive action to take control of the electric vehicle market, combined with relative inaction from the U.S., for China’s position in the market.

“I think they have first actor advantage,” Yonk told the DCNF.

Despite this, Yonk believes that these investments are unsustainable in the long-run. China’s policies are typically geared towards benefitting politicians over businesses and consumers, meaning the industry’s momentum is likely to fizzle out, according to Yonk.

“We’ve seen this in other industries in China, the state-backed performance doesn’t hold up over time,” said Yonk. “It can look real successful in the short run, but over the long run … consistent value delivery to consumers is what leads to a successful economy.”

Both economists argued in favor of scaling back U.S. regulations to promote U.S. company’s ability to innovate. Furchtgott-Roth was particularly critical of Democratic states like New York and California that had implemented rules banning the sale of gas-powered cars after 2035, noting that electric vehicles were already encouraged by several manufacturing tax credits.

“They shouldn’t be choosing products for people,” she said. “It’s just really amazing, all these Democrats who say they’re pro choice, and they’re pro choice over whether to kill your baby, but they’re not pro choice over whether to have … an electric vehicle or an internal combustion engine. … Isn’t that funny?”

The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing Chinese automakers, did not respond to a DCNF request for comment.

"While Housing Biden’s Classified Docs, Penn Hosted Groups With Members Now Under Scrutiny For China Ties: REPORT","President Joe Biden left unguarded classified documents within his University of Pennsylvania center while it held events with organizations whose leadership includes individuals who’ve come under scrutiny for their China ties, the Washington Free Beacon reported Tuesday.

The Penn Biden Center held a two-day “Congressional bootcamp” between June 27 and 28, 2022, in partnership with The Penn Project on the Future of U.S.-China Relations where Kaiser Kuo, editor-at-large of The China Project, is a senior adviser, according to the Washington Free Beacon, as well as with the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) where Maurice Greenberg, CEO of Starr Insurance Companies, sits on the board of trustees. While the event’s full roster of attendees remains unclear, Kuo and Greenberg have both recently come under scrutiny for their ties with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). (RELATED: US Media Outlet Has Extensive Partnerships, Financial Dealings With Orgs Tied To Chinese Communist Party Influence Operations)

Shannon Van Sant, a former business editor at SupChina — which rebranded as The China Project in July 2022 — delivered a sworn declaration to Congress and the Department of Justice (DOJ) on Oct. 21, alleging her former employer fired her in June 2020 for being out of “alignment” with the organization’s alleged pro-CCP bias. Among other things, Van Sant’s declaration alleged that Kuo told staff that “the U.S. government was responsible” for the “unrest” in Hong Kong, in reference to the city’s 2020 protests, and had thus forced China to “impose national security legislation to protect the city.”

Van Sant’s declaration also alleged that The China Project cooperated with CCP organizations, such as the China Association for Science and Technology, to “protect” Chinese scientists whom the U.S. government had charged with espionage.

Furthermore, while Kuo was editor-at-large of The China Project, approximately 20 organizations that may be headed by members of the CCP or members of alleged Chinese influence operations sponsored or partnered with The China Project, a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation determined in December 2022.

The Biden Center’s two-day event reportedly included sessions discussing subjects such as “elite politics,” “climate” and “energy policies,” according to CSIS’ records.

Biden recently claimed that the classified documents in question had been housed within the Penn Biden Center after he’d served as vice president for former President Barack Obama and briefly worked as a Penn professor, according to remarks made on Jan. 10.

As with Kuo, Greenberg’s dealings with alleged Chinese intelligence front groups also recently made headlines after The Wall Street Journal reported that prior to Biden’s meeting with General Secretary Xi Jinping in Indonesia on Nov. 14, Greenberg held backchannel discussions concerning U.S.-China relations with the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs (CPIFA), an alleged front group serving the United Front Work Department (UFWD), according to Chinese intelligence analysts at the Hoover Institution.

The UFWD is a “Chinese intelligence service” whose “primary missions” include “liaison with foreign political parties,” “influence operations” and “intelligence collection,” the U.S.-China Economic Security and Review Commission has stated.

The DCNF recently revealed that CPIFA’s board includes individuals with ties to the China Reform Forum, which Chinese intelligence analyst Alex Joske has identified as a Chinese intelligence front group.

The White House, Penn, The China Project, CSIS, Kuo and Greenberg didn’t respond immediately to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Rep. Adam Schiff Fundraises On China-Owned TikTok After Getting Booted From Intel Committee,"California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff delivered a fundraising pitch on the Chinese-owned TikTok app shortly after Speaker Kevin McCarthy removed him from the House Intelligence Committee.

Schiff posted a video accusing McCarthy of removing him from the committee “for doing my job, for holding Trump accountable and standing up to the extreme MAGA Republicans” before asking for donations.

Schiff served as chair of the House Intelligence Committee from 2019-2023, when Democrats held a majority in the chamber. After winning the speakership, McCarthy removed Schiff and California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell. “I cannot put partisan loyalty ahead of national security,” McCarthy explained in a letter to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.

I have rejected the appointments of Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell for the House Intelligence Committee. I am committed to returning the @HouseIntel Committee to one of genuine honesty and credibility that regains the trust of the American people. pic.twitter.com/ePxlbanxta — Kevin McCarthy (@SpeakerMcCarthy) January 25, 2023

“It is my assessment that the misuse of this panel during the 116th and 117th Congresses severely undermined its primary national security and oversight missions— ultimately leaving our nation less safe,” McCarthy said.

TikTok is owned by China-based tech firm ByteDance, and the company’s ties to the Chinese Communist Party are under national security review by the Treasury Department’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).

Congress recently passed legislation banning TikTok from being used on government devices due to national security concerns. The federal ban followed a wave of similar restrictions in several states.

In Sept. 2022, the New York Times reported that TikTok and the Biden administration negotiated a draft agreement for TikTok to continue operating in the United States without fundamentally changing its ownership structure.

The negotiations have been delayed because of persistent national security concerns surrounding TikTok’s trustworthiness and its potent recommendation algorithm, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Christopher Wray said during a Nov. 2022 hearing that the bureau is concerned about TikTok operating in the U.S. The company has spent $1.5 billion building a U.S. based subsidiary to store American user data with oversight from Oracle Corp. and a board of national security professionals, Reuters reported.

Tech analysts believe TikTok’s oversight proposal would not prevent China from having access from U.S. user data, which has repeatedly been accessed by China-based ByteDance employees without users’ permission, according to reports from Forbes and Buzzfeed.

“As we debate solutions to the TikTok problem, it’s important to understand that the app has captured the left. Politicians like Schiff are reliant on the platform to message and campaign. This is why they favor a U.S. sale over a ban. It has nothing to do with security,” tweeted Heritage Foundation Tech Analyst Jake Denton.

Rep. Schiff announced a run for Senate on Thursday, entering a growing field of Democratic candidates vying for 89-year-old Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s seat.

DAVID BLACKMON: Why Doesn’t Greta Thunberg Stage Climate Protests In China?,"Climate change activist Greta Thunberg made news recently when she was arrested during a protest at a coal mining site near Lutzerath, Germany. The news did not come so much from her arrest by German police dressed up in riot gear, but by the obvious staging of the event with the full cooperation of the policemen and the press covering the event.

Ms. Thunberg and the officers no doubt assumed video of all the obvious staging and repeated takes from different angles would not leak, but leak it did, revealing the phoniness of it all. Such staging of major “news” events is not really anything new, but it is revelatory of Thunberg’s real role as a crisis actor for the climate alarmist movement.

It is a role she appears to have been raised by her parents to fulfill, but her staging choices raise some questions about her sincerity to the supposed cause. (RELATED: MICHAEL BASTASCH: There’s A New Book The Climate Industrial Complex Doesn’t Want You To Read)

Put simply: Ms. Thunberg seems to aim her protests at the wrong targets.

For example, why is it that the Thunberg campaign to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide has never traveled to China? China is, after all, the world’s biggest carbon emitter by far.

Oxford Analytics recently published a chart, based on data compiled by the International Energy Agency, showing that, in 2022, China generated more electricity by burning coal alone than the U.S. generated from all energy sources.

So, if Greta wants to protest coal — which emits more CO2 than any other source of power generation — why not do it in the country that uses vastly more coal than any other?

Why pick on Germany, which is in the midst of a severe, if self-inflicted, energy crisis and has no choice but to burn more coal to keep its citizens from freezing in the dark this winter? Doing so seems somewhat callous, even cruel.

It’s a compelling question, but no one in the climate narrative-friendly press seems interested in asking it. (RELATED: STEPHEN MOORE: The Night The Lights Went Out In Europe)

When an independent journalist with Rebel News did confront Thunberg with that very question on the streets of Davos a few days after her fake arrest, another reporter following Greta’s entourage could be heard in the background calling him an “idiot.”

Such is the kind of fawning loyalty to which Thunberg has grown accustomed from her media friends.

To be fair to Greta, her odd reluctance to chastise the Chinese government falls right into lockstep with the general attitude displayed by the jet-setting elites who attend these climate-focused global conferences like the WEF and last November’s UN-sponsored COP 27 conference held in Egypt. Unlike China, the governments of the western world have actually made progress towards cutting their carbon emissions over the last quarter century, even if they’ve chosen to devalue their currencies to fund trillions in green subsidies in the process.

China, meanwhile, has not only continued to consume an ever-rising volume of coal for power generation, but it currently also plans to build at least 300 additional coal-fired plants at home and abroad in the years to come. Where the western world obsesses on a goal of becoming “Net Zero by 2050” in carbon emissions, the global collective has chosen to place no real obligations on China to make any real changes in its emissions profile until well after that deadline has come and gone.

In fact, the virtual absence of any utterance of the word “China” during its week of ruminations on climate change was one of the most striking aspects of the WEF conference. It is almost as if the subject is now taboo in the circles of the global elite.

It’s a classic case of an effort to ignore the proverbial elephant occupying the sofa in the living room. When it comes to carbon emissions, China is unambiguously that elephant that everyone in the west tries to walk and talk around.

Greta Thunberg is just the crisis actor these western elites have used as a poster child. Greta is no longer a child, though: She is 20 years old now, and should know better.

This crisis theater is too costly and destructive to continue.

China Denies Balloon Mysteriously Flying Over US Military Sites Is For Spying,"China said a weather balloon blew off course over the continental U.S. Friday after the Pentagon revealed it had tracked a suspected Chinese spy balloon traversing over sensitive U.S. military sites.

The Pentagon revealed Thursday it had been monitoring a surveillance balloon believed to be a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) attempt to gather information over sensitive U.S. military sites that President Joe Biden had chosen not to blow out of the sky. While China evaded responsibility for the craft initially, it later claimed ownership of a “civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes” that accidentally “deviated far from its planned course,” a foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement Friday.

“The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into US airspace due to force majeure,” the spokesperson said. (RELATED: ‘The PRC Is Our Only Competitor’: Blinken Claims Biden Has Made Major Progress On Reining In China)

After the Pentagon’s announcement, Beijing “noted” the relevant reports and is “gathering and verifying the facts,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular press conference Friday.

“China is a responsible country and we always act in accordance with international law,” Ning added. “We hope both sides can handle the matter together in a cool-headed and prudent manner.”

Pentagon officials said the balloon did not provide any additional surveillance advantage beyond what China also has access to through low-orbit satellites and does not present a significant threat to Americans on the ground in a briefing Thursday.

President Joe Biden asked whether he should pursue a military response, but Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin counseled against doing so over concern that falling debris could cause injuries, the officials said.

“We know exactly where this balloon is, exactly what it is passing over. And we are taking steps to be extra vigilant so that we can mitigate any foreign intelligence risk,” a senior U.S. defense official said.

Speaker of the House GOP Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California called for a Gang of Eight meeting late Thursday night.

“This incident demonstrates that the CCP threat is not confined to distant shores — it is here at home and we must act to counter this threat,” Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin and Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois said in a joint statement. Gallagher chairs the new House Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the U.S. and the CCP, and Krishnamoorthi is ranking member.

Blinken is set to visit Beijing and converse with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming days, the first time a Secretary of State has visited China since 2018, according to Voice of America.

“As to whether Secretary Blinken will visit China, I have nothing to offer at the moment,” the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said.

GOP Reps Push Bill To Ban China From Buying US Farmland,"Two Republican members of Congress introduced a bill Thursday that would prohibit nonresident aliens, companies and other entities associated with the Chinese government from buying agricultural land in the U.S.

Washington Reps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Dan Newhouse’s Prohibition of Agricultural Land for the People’s Republic of China Act would also ban those interests’ participation in U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) programs beyond food safety inspections, according to her press release. Chinese foreign investors held more than 191,000 acres of U.S. agricultural and non-agricultural land in 2019, the USDA indicated.

Grand Forks, North Dakota, Mayor Brandon Bochenski announced an effort Tuesday to stop China’s Fufeng Group from building a corn mill on 370 acres purchased in his city not far from Grand Forks Air Force Base, according to The Wall Street Journal. Bochenski and other local leaders had celebrated the project when the Fufeng Group’s decision to build in Grand Forks was publicized in 2021, but Air Force Assistant Secretary Andrew Hunter said Jan. 27 the Defense Department believed it presented “a significant threat to national security,” the WSJ reported. (RELATED: China Denies Balloon Mysteriously Flying Over US Military Sites Is For Spying)

Newhouse’s press secretary Mike Marinella told the DCNF the Grand Forks corn mill project news did not influence his introduction of the bill, saying, “This is yet another example of a potential threat from the Chinese Communist Party and Rep. Newhouse will continue to be a leader in protecting American farmland from our nation’s adversaries.”

“Agriculture is Eastern Washington’s number one industry. We simply cannot allow companies from China to lock down our resources and undermine our farmers and ranchers’ ability to feed the world,” Rogers said. “Americans should not be forced to rely on China for the food they put on the table. Prohibiting the Chinese Communist Party from purchasing farmland in the United States is a no-brainer that will support domestic food production and decrease our dangerous dependence on foreign adversaries.”

China Says It May ‘Respond Further’ After US Takes Down Spy Balloon,"The Chinese government said Saturday it may “respond further” after President Joe Biden had the spy balloon shot down.

The U.S. took down the spy balloon Saturday afternoon after the craft was seen floating over the continental U.S. for several days. The Pentagon was tracking the balloon as it headed eastward over the Carolinas before hovering above the Atlantic Ocean. U.S. military jets were seen flying near the balloon while there were several recovery vessels in the waters below.

Biden ordered the Pentagon to take down the balloon, which is believed to have been spying on “strategic sites” in the U.S., as soon as it was safe, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin confirmed to the Daily Caller News Foundation in a statement.

Biden reportedly wanted the balloon to be taken down earlier but military officials recommended against it warning that the falling debris could possible injure those on the ground below.

GORDON CHANG: Kevin McCarthy Squares Up Against The ‘World’s Largest Bully’ — China,"The People’s Liberation Army flew 34 aircraft near Taiwan on Tuesday and Wednesday. Twenty of them crossed the “median line,” the de facto border running down the Taiwan Strait between China and Taiwan.

The Chinese military also sent nine vessels near Taiwan, the island republic that Beijing claims as its own. (RELATED: GORDON CHANG: China Smiles As America Falls Deeper Into The TikTok Trap)

Global Times, a semi-official tabloid, left Washington in no doubt about the meaning of what it called “intense warplane and warship activities.” “This could be seen as a warning to McCarthy that he should not follow his predecessor Nancy Pelosi’s suit in provocatively interfering in China’s internal affairs,” the paper declared.

Yes, Beijing is unhappy that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, fulfilling a promise he made while running for the post, is planning to visit Taipei.

The Chinese foreign ministry was relatively restrained in its remarks about a possible McCarthy trip to the island republic. “We hope U.S. lawmakers will abide by the one-China principle and the Three China-U.S. Joint Communiques and refrain from doing things detrimental to China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” said Spokesperson Mao Ning on Jan. 30.

Global Times, often used by the Chinese regime to issue threats it does not want to make officially, suggested “setting up exclusion zones that prevent McCarthy from landing.”

China’s regime routinely makes threats over Americans planning to visit Taiwan.

“The position of the Chinese government and people on the Taiwan question is consistent, and resolutely safeguarding China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity is the firm will of the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people,” Chinese ruler Xi Jinping told President Joe Biden during their phone call on July 28 of last year, according to the Chinese foreign ministry, just days before Pelosi’s widely anticipated trip. “The public opinion cannot be defied. Those who play with fire will perish by it.”

There was concern that Beijing would try to block Pelosi’s plane, but she landed in Taipei without incident the following month. The U.S. let the threat to assassinate her — and Biden — slide then, so the Chinese felt free to make a similar threat against McCarthy now.

It’s unlikely that Beijing by words alone will be able to intimidate McCarthy into not going to Taiwan, but it is almost certain Chinese officials will work on Biden. He was, after all, the weak link in the controversy in the run up to Pelosi’s visit.

Infamously, he tried to prevent Pelosi from going. His administration from all accounts leaked plans of her trip, thereby putting the visit in play.

After the leak, Biden went public with opposition to the speaker’s visit. “Well, I think that the military thinks it’s not a good idea right now,” he told reporters on July 20, before the trip. “But I don’t know what the status of it is.”

This comment apparently convinced Chinese officials to turn up the heat because they could see Biden was wavering. The president’s words, unfortunately, emboldened the worst elements in the Chinese political system. It is no surprise then that Xi, during the July 28 phone call, thought he could threaten Biden’s and Pelosi’s lives.

So what should we look out for this time, now that the Chinese are manufacturing another crisis over a speaker’s trip?

History is repeating itself. There is reporting that the Biden administration leaked the news of McCarthy’s trip to, in the words of Eurasia Group, “get ahead of the issue.” Perhaps, but it is more probable that the administration leaked to prevent the trip.

“Beijing will be watching very closely for daylight between the White House and Speaker McCarthy for them to exploit, as was the case with Speaker Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan last year,” Steve Yates, chair of the China Policy Initiative at the America First Policy Institute, told me. “The White House was seen as urging Pelosi to postpone, minimize, or cancel her visit. Beijing uses division and confusion like this as part of its political warfare against Taiwan, undermining confidence that friends will stand with them against the world’s largest bully.”

Maybe Biden administration machinations no longer matter. Nancy Pelosi, as Yates correctly says, should have gone to Taiwan earlier in her tenure as speaker, but she has now made it difficult for her successors not to go, especially considering the change in American views of China.

“I think every member of Congress should visit Taiwan,” said Sen. Todd Young of Indiana to Politico, when asked about the McCarthy trip.

The senator is right. Every member of Congress should go. And so should every president of the United States.

Biden, by making himself and America look weak on Taiwan last year, can remedy that mistake by taking a trip of his own to Taipei now. If nothing else, a presidential visit will show Beijing that not only are speakers unafraid of China but that the president of the United States is not afraid either.

Ro Khanna Favors ‘Forced Sale’ Of TikTok To US Company,"Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California said Monday he was in favor of a “forced sale” of the Chinese-owned social media app TikTok to an American company during a Monday appearance on CNBC.

“I believe there should be a forced sale to an American company. You can’t just ban something that millions of young people are using,” Khanna told CNBC host Joe Kernan. “But the issues are very serious about who’s collecting this data, is it being used to manipulate information to many American young people?” (RELATED: Rep. Adam Schiff Fundraises On China-Owned TikTok After Getting Booted From Intel Committee)

TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a China-based company that reportedly requires employees to attend monthly meetings to study Chinese Community Party policies, CNN reported. The company’s executives refused to stop sending data to China, where employees of ByteDance reportedly access the information, during a September hearing.

WATCH:

The United States Air Force shot down a Chinese spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina Saturday. The balloon, which China claimed was a civilian meteorological research platform, drifted over states where bases housing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and strategic bombers like the B-2 Spirit, are located.

The Department of Defense confirmed a second balloon, similar to the one shot down off South Carolina, was flying over Latin America Friday.

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas banned TikTok and a number of other apps, most tied to China, from government devices Monday, calling the apps a security threat.

“The security risks associated with the use of TikTok on devices used to conduct the important business of our state must not be underestimated or ignored,” Abbot said in a statement. “Owned by a Chinese company that employs Chinese Communist Party members, TikTok harvests significant amounts of data from a user’s device.”

The House of Representatives and Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly of Kansas also issued bans on the Chinese-owned social media app.

“We’re sorry to see the unintended consequences of these rushed TikTok bans—policies that will do nothing to advance cybersecurity— beginning to impact universities’ ability to share information, recruit students, and build communities around athletic teams, student groups, campus publications, and more,” a spokesperson for TikTok told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Pentagon Poised To Crackdown On Partnerships With Hollywood Films That Kowtow To China: REPORT,"Hollywood executives are bracing for increased scrutiny over how their films are censored on behalf of the Chinese government, as the Department of Defense (DOD) prepares new regulations that would crack down on potential Chinese influence over U.S. media, Deadline reported Monday.

When the regulations are finalized, the DOD will be prohibited from funding or otherwise allowing the use of funds to support any “entertainment project” that either “has complied or is likely to comply” with a censorship request from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that promotes the interests of the CCP, according to the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act. It is not uncommon for the U.S. government to collaborate with films and other projects centered on the military, such as the popular “Top Gun: Maverick,” according to Deadline.

“The language is designed to counter China’s campaign to control what Americans hear, see and ultimately think,” Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas told Deadline. “Under this provision, Hollywood studios that want to work with the government — things like using military locations or resources for filming — will have to keep the CCP off of the set and out of the editing room.”

Some members of the industry note that both the number of U.S. films exported to China and that get assistance from the DOD are small, although there are some concerns that this will further limit films from being exported to China, Deadline reported. Others see the provision as a way for Republicans to make Hollywood a bigger political target, according to Deadline.

“It’s a very silly political statement that has no real-world application,” Schuyler Moore, an entertainment finance attorney at Los Angeles-based Greenberg Gluskey, told Deadline.

“Top Gun: Maverick” drew criticism from Republicans, such as Cruz, when a trailer replaced the flag patches for Japan and Taiwan on a jacket worn by Tom Cruise’s character, Deadline reported. Although the flags were restored in the final version of the movie shown to U.S. audiences, they were still replaced in the Chinese version. (RELATED: Trump Officials Offer Inconsistent Explanations About Prior Chinese Spy Balloons)

Then-Attorney General William Barr under President Donald Trump targeted films such as “World War Z” and “Doctor Strange” in 2020 over reports that they had made changes to better appeal to the Chinese market, Deadline reported. Barr described the efforts as a “massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party.”

Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, chairman of the newly established select committee on China, warned both Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger and NBA commissioner Adam Silver that they would likely be made to testify before the committee on their company’s business in China. Cruz told Deadline that expects that the Biden administration will “faithfully” enact the NDAA provision.

Solomon Islands Ousts Provincial Governor Who Objected To Chinese Encroachment,"A provincial governor in the Solomon Islands has been ousted by his legislature for criticizing the country’s growing relationship with China.

The legislature removed David Suidani, premier of Solomon Islands’ Malaita province, in an unanimous no-confidence vote Tuesday, Reuters reported. Suidani banned Chinese companies from operating in Malaita and fostered a close relationship with Taiwan, a former ally of the Solomon Islands. (RELATED: Here’s How Much US Farmland Has Been Bought Up By China)

Big news for Solomon Islands. Malaita premier, Daniel Suidani, has been ousted from his position in a vote of no confidence. He was one of the country’s most vocal critics of China, opposing PM Sogovare’s relationship with the PRC, including the security pact signed last year. — Marian Faa (@marianfaa) February 7, 2023

Protests broke out after the no-confidence vote and led to protesters throwing stones at police officers. Police responded with tear gas and one officer was injured. The protests fizzled out and were not widespread, The Guardian reported.

Suidani unsuccessfully challenged the vote’s legality in high court and boycotted the proceedings. He was accused of financial mismanagement, using public funds to pay his security guards and soliciting money from a Chinese mining company.

He has feuded with Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare about shifting diplomatic ties to China, a decision known as “the switch,” according to Al Jazeera. Activists in Malaita opposed Sogavare’s 2019 decision to recognize China instead of Taiwan and abide by a “One China” policy.

The switch is unpopular among Solomon Islanders who believe it has been motivated by corruption. They worry about forging close economic ties with China and differences in values between the two countries. The Solomon Islands is a Christian, democratic nation, unlike the authoritarian rule by Chinese Communist Party.

The two nations signed a security agreement in May 2022 deepening ties and potentially opening the door to a Chinese military base on the Solomon Islands. Beijing reportedly sent police, military personnel and other forces to maintain order and protect Chinese equipment.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/07/solomon-islands-governor-china/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwio88zoorP9AhU3hVYBHfjaB8g4RhAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw32DcyzJI0OAwl9rj5M_BIB,2023-02-07
US Notches Record Trade Deficit In 2022 — Thanks Partly To China,"The U.S. trade deficit increased to its highest recorded level in 2022, thanks in part to a surging trade deficit with China.

The U.S. registered a roughly $948.1 billion goods and services deficit for the year, including a $382.9 billion goods deficit to China, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) revealed Tuesday. This 12.2% surge over 2021 marks an all-time U.S. trade deficit record, The Wall Street Journal reported. (RELATED: White House Sends Out Error-Laden Economy ‘Fact Sheet’ On Eve Of SOTU)

The yearly goods deficit with China increased by around $29.4 billion in 2022 and far outpaced that with any other country: the U.S. reached yearly deficits of about $203.9 billion and $130.6 billion with the European Union and Mexico respectively, recording a $76.2 billion surplus with South and Central America, based on BEA data.

U.S. exports fell by approximately $2.2 billion in December compared to November, coinciding with a $4.2 billion imports surge, the statistics indicate. However, the December goods deficit to China was $3.0 billion higher than during the previous month.

China experienced one of its worst economic growth years in decades and its first-ever population decline since 1961 in 2022, Reuters reported. General Administration of Customs statistics indicated the country’s overall exports sank 9.9% in December, according to CNN.

The U.S. trade deficit rose as the Federal Reserve hiked its target federal-funds interest rate several times in 2022. That trend has continued into 2023, with a 0.25% interest rate increase Wednesday.

KOK BAYRAQ: Biden Logic: I’m Tough Because I Didn’t Apologize To China,"When Joe Biden referenced China in his State of the Union address on Tuesday, he tried to indicate that he was standing up to China: “Before I came to office, the story was about how the People’s Republic of China was increasing its power and America was falling in the world. Not anymore,” he said.

However, this effort was only clear in his intonation; the content and logic of his speech reflected the reverse.

“I will make no apologies to China,” he proudly stated. Is he or the U.S. obligated to apologize to China?

For context, he explained, “We are investing to make America strong. Investing in American innovation, in industries that will define the future, and that China’s government is intent on dominating. Investing in our alliances and working with our allies to protect our advanced technologies so they’re not used against us.”

This is all common sense stuff. Why would any of this require an apology?

Thinking and talking about an apology without reason represents the soul rising outward. It seems Joe Biden thinks it natural for China to buy Europe and use it against the U.S., and it would not be right for the US to stop it. Joe Biden may not be saying this explicitly, but we can understand this feeling from a psychological point of view.

If one apologizes because of a mistake, it is from a sense of justice. If it is without reason, it is a sign of cowardice — submission to the power of the other party.

The US has historically contributed to China’s development in many ways, including bringing China into the UN and the World Trade Organization (WTO). American criticism of human rights violations and the defense of Taiwan can never be cause for an apology.

Saying, “I’m brave, I’m not apologizing to China or asking for forgiveness,” is absurd logic and that Joe Biden has brought to the literature of American heroism.

“I made clear in my personal conversations, which have been many, with President Xi, that we seek competition, not conflict,” Biden stated.

Here, Biden admits that he has always offered goodwill to China and asked them not to escalate tensions. Unfortunately, Chinese leaders have never feared that the U.S. would start a war with them. Nor do they have any interest in cooperation or goodwill.

China is highlighting that America’s time as world hegemon is over. Xi Jinping’s slogan of transforming a unipolar world into a multipolar one and his attempt to present a new development model to the world is another version of that claim. America is an obstacle.

Why does Biden continue to state that the US has no intention of conflict with China when the Chinese see it otherwise? The problem is that Biden does not believe in American power. Does he see China’s power as something to fear?

Maybe because of these fears, he has called Xi Jinping a “smart, smart guy” during his press conference in 2021, characterized his meeting with Xi in 2022 as “open and candid” and praised him as “straightforward.”

In the rhetoric of competition, not conflict, which Biden often repeats, there is no stance of courage or valor. On the contrary, it exhibits begging and flattery.

Nothing short of fear explains why Biden was aware of China’s spy balloon but did not bring it up on his agenda until the public knew about it. It can be assumed that Biden would not have ordered the balloon shot down had it not been for the strong reaction of a group of House Republicans. Perhaps he hoped the balloon would quietly leave after it had crossed the U.S. Unsurprising, because Joe Biden has made it his mission to avoid any sort of confrontation with China.

The spy balloon entering US territory is itself an achievement for China. It managed to exhibit the power Xi wanted to show the world, especially his allies: that he could violate American sovereignty with no consequences. And he did it without any human or moral harm.

“But make no mistake about it. As we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country, and we did,” said Biden. However, if a country invades Kenya in Africa, Palau in the Pacific, or Chile in Latin America, those countries will not remain silent. It’s a rule as simple as Tuesday comes after Monday, or that 1 + 99 = 100. It is not an act of heroism or toughness — it’s stating the obvious.

There was really only one bold statement made against China in Biden’s speech: “And those who bet against America learn how wrong they are. It’s never ever been a good bet to bet against America.” Unfortunately, Joe Biden made this statement without mentioning China, which is like a cowardly soldier shooting into the air.

I am not saying that Biden should “show courage” against China in his speech because, as an Uyghur-American who has witnessed China’s brutal regime, I know that simply talking to China won’t work. I’m just saying that Biden shouldn’t dictate his own cowardly mentality to us as heroic — it comes off as empty threats.

DEROY MURDOCK: China’s Dominance In One Market Could Literally Be The Death Of Us. Here’s How,"Imagine what would Joe Biden or a future president of the United States would do if Chinese dictator Xi Jinping dispatched another spy balloon toward America and declared: “If America destroys our peace-loving balloon, we will have no choice but to suspend immediately and until further notice all U.S.-bound exports of Chinese-made antibiotics and antibiotic precursor chemicals. We eagerly await the White House’s response.”

This chilling hypothetical and last week’s all-too-real spy-balloon fiasco should make it excruciatingly clear that America urgently needs to repatriate critical industries from China back to the USA.

If, God forbid, the Chinese Communist Party attacked Taiwan, it’s hard to imagine that Beijing would not use antibiotics and other vital drugs to extort U.S. neutrality while China conquers and Communizes that nation. (RELATED: GORDON CHANG: Kevin McCarthy Squares Up Against The ‘World’s Largest Bully’ — China)

America could face this rotten choice: Defend Taiwan and, before long, watch helplessly as strep throat, gonorrhea, meningitis and other bacterial infections went untreated — perhaps fatally so — or keep the life-sustaining antibiotics flowing as Beijing strangles Taipei.

Letting the CCP crush its island neighbor would trample the Taiwan Relations Act, America’s de facto commitment to the integrity of that prosperous, free-market, constitutional republic. American military and diplomatic prestige would plunge even as atrocities and bloodshed in Taiwan soared.

“Right now, the U.S. has virtually no capacity to manufacture antibiotics,” healthcare expert Rosemary Gibson wrote in Market Watch. “That’s because China currently controls roughly 90% of the global supply of inputs needed to make the generic antibiotics that treat bronchitis, pneumonia, pediatric ear infections, and life-threatening conditions such as sepsis.”

Congress should pass and Biden should sign robust incentives to entice U.S. pharmaceutical, strategic-mineral and other concerns in China to come home. Specifically, eligible companies that repatriate their operations should face a federal corporate tax rate of 0% for the first five years after they leave Communist China and return to the Land of the Brave.

This massive shot in the arm would help lure these organizations back and entice them to erect U.S. facilities, employ American workers, etc. Similar incentives should be available to domestic start-ups and business expansions in this life-and-death sector.

Democrats also must stop being bipolar about electric vehicles.

In Tuesday’s State of the Union address, Biden touted “tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles.” Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act teems with EV subsidies.

California, Oregon and Washington have banned sales of new gasoline-powered cars as early as 2035. If this seems comfortably distant, 2035 is nearer into the future than the 2008 financial meltdown was in the past.

Love or hate this new largesse and these new laws, if the Left insists on EVs, then why are they making it harder to build them?

“Joe Biden banned mining in 225,000 acres of Minnesota’s Iron Range, and locked up development of taconite, copper, nickel, cobalt, platinum-group elements, and more,” Minnesota Republican Congressman Pete Stauber lamented on Jan. 26. Democrats blocked the Twin Metals mine, home to 34% of U.S. copper, 88% of American cobalt and 95% of domestic nickel reserves. Thanks to Team Biden, this all remains underground.

If Democrats shutter domestic sources for EV-component minerals, where else would they be?

China!

A typical EV’s 1,000-pound battery requires 25 pounds of lithium, 30 pounds of cobalt, 60 pounds of nickel, 90 pounds of copper and 110 pounds of graphite.

Naturally, China possesses or processes 60% of Earth’s lithium, 80% of cobalt, 5 % of nickel, 43% of copper and up to 80% of graphite.

It is theatrically absurd for Democrats to seal the mines whose contents compose the EVs that they insist Americans purchase. Instead, to hand Red China a giant stick made of these minerals and wait for it to blackmail the U.S. is either the nadir of bone-headedness or the zenith of self-sabotage.

America must in-source these lifesaving, technology-driving materials before it’s too late. If not, nosy balloons will be the least of our worries.

JOSH HAMMER: Where Do US-China Relations Stand After The Spy Balloon Fiasco?,"The utterly humiliating saga of a high-altitude Chinese surveillance “balloon” successfully traversing the entire North American continent, only to be shot down off the South Carolina coast after completing its intelligence-gathering voyage, ought to serve as a wake-up call for America’s decadent ruling class.

At Newsweek, Paul du Quenoy sagely compared the affair to the young West German pilot Mathias Rust’s successful 1987 landing of his small Cessna just outside Moscow’s Red Square, a similarly “irreparable blight” wherein a “sclerotic empire’s air defense systems stood powerless at the sight of an airborne foreign intruder.” (RELATED: DEROY MURDOCK: China’s Dominance In One Market Could Literally Be The Death Of Us. Here’s How)

That comparison is damning, but proper. True, a different and less senile commander in chief might have — and should have — responded in swifter and more decisive fashion, but the sheer fact of the matter is that America’s geopolitical arch-foe felt emboldened to act as it did. The relevant question now presented to America’s ruling class is whether it has the humility to soberly acknowledge the fallen state of U.S.-China relations and to chart a path forward that best secures the national interest of our ailing and war-weary republic.

As Sohrab Ahmari chronicled in his most recent column for The American Conservative, post-Cold War U.S. foreign policy vis-a-vis China has typically fallen into one of two categorical buckets: “integrationism” and “confrontationism.” But as Ahmari notes, in “horseshoe theory” of politics fashion, these two schools of thought on U.S.-China relations actually share a great deal in common with one another.

The reason for that is simple: The “let China join the World Trade Organization”-style economic integrationists and the “defend Taiwan at all costs”-style foreign policy confrontationists both share an underlying conceit that we still live in a unipolar global moment of American geopolitical, economic, military and cultural hegemony.

That is a delusion, as this column argued nearly a year ago, after the Russo-Ukrainian War flared up. The unipolar moment of unquestioned American hegemony that briefly existed in the aftermath of the Cold War is, in fact, now over.

Whatever our issues may be with the Beijing regime and the regnant Communist Party of China — and I have many — it is simply undeniable at this juncture that China is a great power, with an intimidating nuclear arsenal and a sprawling “Belt and Road Initiative” of global economic clout. This necessarily demands a hard-headed, “great power competition”-inspired geostrategy. As this same column nearly a year ago put it: “We must reconcile ourselves … to the inevitability of China’s continual rise and the likely return of a new Cold War-resemblant global chessboard.”

The era of globalism is over; the imperative now is to decouple, reshore and renationalize. Moreover, to help undermine “Belt and Road,” the U.S. can try to enter strategic bilateral trade deals with nations that might otherwise fall to Beijing’s economic predations. The economic realm, more so than any other area, is where an ailing and decadent U.S. can still make a dent and make the Chinese Politburo feel pain — while also buttressing America’s own economic hand, in line with the national developmentalist tradition.

But in the area of foreign policy and national security, the imperative is to be sober, realistic and restrained. True, a worthier commander in chief than the doddering dolt from Delaware would have shot the Chinese surveillance balloon out of the sky the moment it crossed over into sovereign U.S. airspace. But to secure the territorial integrity of American airspace is one thing; to seek to project militaristic strength within the territorial sphere of influence of a fellow great power — again, no matter how noxious to our sensibilities such a great power may be — is something else entirely.

For example, as much as we may ardently desire preventing Beijing from swallowing up comparatively free and economically critical Taiwan — news flash: only 100 miles east of the Chinese mainland —one sober conclusion to draw from the end of the unipolar moment is the obvious geographical reality that Taiwan sits comfortably within China’s broader sphere of influence.

In this sense, the twin imperatives of “economic hawkishness” and foreign policy realism dovetail nicely: the foreseeability of China’s exertion of pressure on Taiwan, and its possible full invasion and absorption of the island, ought to galvanize the U.S. to expedite the reshoring and redevelopment of its lagging semiconductor industry. The recently passed CHIPS Act, though imperfect, was a worthy (if ham-fisted) first step in this direction.

America’s ruling class, which is all too frequently entangled in an economic bed with China, far too often approaches these matters with an unhealthy dose of wistfulness. It is always far easier, alas, to act as one wishes the world to be, and not as it is. But if our self-regarding elites care about one thing, it is surely their own standing and, ultimately, their own survival.

Here’s hoping they sober up on the Chinese challenge faster than the Soviets did after their own “airborne foreign intruder” incident of 1987.

While demanding that the U.S. should “change its ways,” China’s foreign minister, Wang Wenbin, claimed that U.S. “high-altitude balloons” trespassed into China’s airspace more than 10 times since January 2022, yet declined to provide additional details during a press conference in Beijing on Monday, according to the report. China’s allegation comes a little over a week after the U.S. Air Force shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the coast of the Carolinas on Feb. 4 which had floated over the continental U.S. in the preceding days.

“Any claim that the U.S. government operates surveillance balloons over the PRC is false,” Adrienne Watson, National Security Council spokesperson, tweeted Monday.

“It is China that has a high-altitude surveillance balloon program for intelligence collection, that it has used to violate the sovereignty of the U.S. and over 40 countries across five continents,” she continued.

In addition to the suspected Chinese spy balloon, the U.S. military has since downed three additional unidentified aircraft flying over North America including a “high-altitude airborne object” on Feb. 10 discovered off Alaska’s north coast, a “cylindrical” aircraft over Canada on Feb. 11 and an “octagonal” object flying over Lake Huron on Feb. 12.

“It’s unlikely that the most recent three unidentified objects belong to China as they flew at much lower altitudes compared to the Chinese high-altitude balloon,” Lu Xiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), told Chinese state-run media outlet Global Times on Monday.

“Judging from the altitude, they are completely different types of objects,” Lu said.

Yet, CASS is controlled by the State Council of the Chinese Communist Party, according to Chinese government records, and “many” CASS personnel allegedly covertly work for Chinese intelligence agencies, such as the Ministry of State Security, Alex Joske, former Chinese intelligence analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, wrote in “Spies and Lies.”

GARCIA: China Could Cash In On IRS Tax Credits Intended For Americans,"This past week, in a blatant violation of American sovereignty, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) invaded U.S. airspace with its now-infamous surveillance balloon. But while the U.S. needs to ramp up its defenses against the PRC’s hostile activity from above, policymakers must also push back against Beijing’s efforts to infiltrate America from within. One of Xi Jinping’s top targets is America’s manufacturing sector.

In particular, he has his eyes set on America’s fledgling electric vehicle and electric vehicle battery industries. As more commercial and military vehicles and products become electric, it will be incumbent for the U.S. to have secure and reliable EV batteries and components, such as critical minerals, for economic and national security matters.

Currently, China controls more than 75 percent of the global lithium-ion battery production and dominates the global supply of critical minerals necessary for EV batteries. Xi Jinping wants to keep it this way, and one of his strategies is bringing PRC companies to America’s shores. Our political leaders cannot allow this.

We recently saw this first-hand in Virginia, where Ford sought to establish an electric vehicle battery factory operated by the Chinese company Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL). CATL is the world’s largest battery maker, supplying batteries to Ford, Tesla, BMW, and others. Under this arrangement, Ford would own the factory, but CATL would own the technology and manage the factory operations, receiving royalties and fees.

Fortunately, Governor Youngkin stopped this factory from being built in Virginia, calling it a “trojan horse” for China that would harm U.S. national and economic security and make America more, not less, reliant on China for electric vehicle batteries. A joint venture with CATL, which the governor rightly calls a “CCP front,” in the U.S. would be a boon for PRC intelligence operations and corporate espionage. According to China’s National Security Law, “any organization or citizen shall support, assist, and cooperate with state intelligence work according to law” and “state intelligence work organs, when legally carrying forth intelligence work, may demand that concerned organs, organizations, or citizens provide needed support, assistance, and cooperation.”

What makes this arrangement even more outrageous is that these two parties are seeking state-level incentives and loopholes to make their products eligible for tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act. If successful, this would mean that U.S. taxpayer dollars from this poorly thought-out legislation would flow to Beijing, not American companies.

While Virginia won’t allow this CCP-front into its borders, other states may. Michigan, led by Democrat Governor Gretchen Whitmer is fighting to bring the factory to Detroit. If Governor Whitmer is successful, it would harm U.S. economic and national security and give the CCP easier access to surveil, manipulate and harm U.S. citizens, businesses, and government agencies. Governors and state lawmakers across the country should make clear that projects that bolster Beijing and weaken American industry are not welcome in their states.

There are also steps at the federal level that must be taken to prevent Chinese companies like CATL from benefiting from American tax dollars. The Department of Treasury and the IRS are preparing to publish proposed guidance for the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) clean vehicle tax credit program that is due in March. This program is a massive waste of money and simply a subsidy for the rich, but worst of all, the CCP may also cash in on it.

This program seeks to incentivize domestic manufacturing by providing a tax credit for vehicles with batteries and battery components, including critical minerals manufactured or sourced in the U.S. or in nations with which the U.S. maintains a free trade agreement. According to the letter of the law, electric vehicles that rely on battery or battery components from “foreign entities of concern,” which includes companies from China, North Korea, Iran, and Russia, would be ineligible for these tax credits. Batteries produced or co-produced by CATL, whether in the U.S. or in China, must fall under this category. If not, China will be further embedded in U.S. industry and have access to sensitive technology and economic data, harming our security interests.

However, an effort is underway calling on the Department of Treasury to broaden the definition of “foreign entity of concern” that would open up a backdoor for companies like CATL to benefit from the IRA. The Department must reject this campaign and issue guidance that includes a definition of a “foreign entity of concern” that prohibits vehicles that include batteries that have critical minerals or components from a foreign entity of concern from receiving any U.S. tax credits. This must expressly exclude arrangements such as the Ford-CATL joint factory.

Congress and the Biden Administration must prevent this bad legislation from being even worse, and ensure that CCP-connected companies cannot benefit from any of IRA’s provisions. U.S. national and economic security depends on it.

Prominent Democratic Lawmakers Continue To Use China-Owned TikTok Despite National Security Concerns,"Many Democratic lawmakers continue to use TikTok for their campaigns despite national security concerns about the platform’s ties to China.

Democratic Congressional lawmakers such as Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rep. Adam Schiff of California are among those with official TikTok accounts that spread content to the platform’s audience.

Democratic governors, including Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Jared Polis of Colorado, also post on official TikTok accounts.

TikTok has become the dominant social media app among American teens, outpacing YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat and other competitors in terms of how much time users spend on the platform per day, survey data from Feb. 7 shows. The platform is owned by ByteDance, a China-based tech firm with reported ties to the Chinese government. (RELATED: TikTok’s Security Protocols Won’t Prevent China From Spying On American Users, Analysts Warn)

ByteDance and TikTok reportedly have 300 employees with experience working in Chinese state media, and ByteDance allegedly promoted content supportive of the Chinese communist party on its now-inoperative U.S. news app, TopBuzz. Employees of ByteDance working in China have reportedly accessed U.S. user data on multiple occasions and monitored journalists who reported on the data access.

The Biden administration is negotiating a national security agreement with TikTok to address questions about the app’s recommendation algorithm and ties to China. TikTok and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) in the Treasury Department have drafted an agreement to address national security concerns without altering TikTok’s ownership structure.

Negotiations between the Biden administration and TikTok have been delayed because of persistent national security concerns from U.S. officials, according to The Wall Street Journal. As part of the negotiations, TikTok has agreed to create a U.S. data subsidiary with oversight by Oracle Corp. and a board of national security experts, Reuters first reported.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/14/dem-lawmakers-tiktok-national-security-china/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiT1Z3oorP9AhXGl1YBHZYjBsY4PBAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw1MyyWhwM8SAQWPJOkIWV9B,2023-02-14
GORDON CHANG: Biden Should Stop Sucking Up To China,"“We believe in the importance of maintaining open lines of communication between the United States and the PRC in order to responsibly manage the relationship,” declared Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon spokesman, in a February 7 statement. “Unfortunately, the PRC has declined our request. Our commitment to open lines of communication will continue.”

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had tried to arrange a telephone conversation with China’s Defense Minister Gen. Wei Fenghe, after the February 4 shoot-down of the Chinese spy balloon, but the Chinese official refused to take the call.

Austin must now be accustomed to being rebuffed by Wei. In November in Cambodia at a meeting of defense ministers, Austin proposed reopening communication channels that Beijing had ended after then Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taipei. The Chinese so far have not replied. (RELATED: GORDON CHANG: China Must Be Shaking Its Head In Disbelief At The Biden Admin’s Stunningly Bad Decision-Making)

“Since the US’s irresponsible wrongdoings failed to create an atmosphere for communication between the militaries of the two countries, China does not accept the US’s proposal for a defense chiefs’ call,” said Defense Ministry spokesperson Tan Kefei in the words of China’s semi-official Global Times.

Good. The United States should stop trying to talk to China.

There are many things wrong about Austin’s attempts to communicate with Wei. As an initial matter, Wei’s rank is far below Austin’s. As defense minister, he is a central government official with little or no authority over the Chinese military. The People’s Liberation Army does not report to the Chinese government. It reports to the Communist Party.

The Communist Party official with the comparable rank to Austin is Xi Jinping, in his role as chairman of the Party’s Central Military Commission. Our defense secretary should insist, when he talks, to talk to the people in charge.

Americans love to talk. “I do hope that the United States and China can find a way to have a dialogue on these issues,” said Leon Panetta, a defense secretary during the Obama years, to Andrea Mitchell on February 9 on her MSNBC show, referring to the spy balloon incident.

As evident from Panetta’s comment, Americans are big on “dialogue.” They believe, as an article of faith, that there must be communication to maintain relations. In fact, communication with China has over the course of decades made matters worse.

How so? American attempts at dialogue empower the worst elements in the Chinese political system by showing everyone else that bad conduct works. The cycle is well known in Beijing: China engages in belligerent conduct and America then tries to placate the hostile regime. Desperate attempts to talk make America look like a supplicant.

Austin unfortunately reinforced that image after the shoot-down. As James Fanell of the Geneva Centre for Security Policy told Gatestone, if Secretary Austin was going to call anyone in Beijing, it should not have been after the balloon shoot-down, thereby making it look like America was trying to justify its action. Austin, if he were to call, should have done so as the craft approached U.S. airspace in late January.

Americans are focused on making sure that everyone understands each other. “I think it’s important that we try to avoid a miscalculation,” Panetta told Mitchell. “It’s important that the United States and China at least develop a process to try to work together on these kinds of issues to avoid what could be an instance that could have us in a war.”

A “process”? Americans already have many consultative processes with the Chinese military, such as those established in a 2008 agreement on a military-to-military hotline and the September 2015 Memorandum of Understanding on the same topic. The People’s Liberation Army has continued to ignore communication mechanisms.

“The People’s Republic of China cannot be trusted to comply with any agreement they sign,” notes Fanell, also a retired U.S. Navy captain who served as director of Intelligence and Information Operations of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.

Chinese leaders do not want to have communications with foreigners until they settle on their positions after internal bargaining and deliberations. They are, in the words of the Associated Press, “suspicious” of Americans “talking their way out of repercussions for a U.S. provocation.” No agreement can get Chinese officials to engage in dialogue when they consider dialogue to not be in their interests. In short, China will talk only when it wants to.

What should Washington do now?

America should reverse the dynamic and break off communication with China. Severing dialogue could intimidate Chinese leaders and officials. What will Beijing think when normally eager-to-talk Americans do not call and even refuse to answer their phones?

Moreover, the U.S. can up the pressure by ordering Beijing to close its remaining four consulates and to strip down its overly large embassy to just the ambassador. Ordering the closures and expulsions now will, among other things, emphasize that America is no longer willing to tolerate dangerous behavior.

If these steps do not work, Washington can end other ties — trade, investment, technical cooperation — that China needs for its struggling economy, something the U.S. should do anyway.

Are these steps risky?

Yes, but after decades of misguided policy every option is risky, and the riskiest policy of all is to continue with an approach that created this perilous situation in the first place.

China’s officials say that America no longer deters them. Americans need to take them at their word and try something different to reestablish deterrence.

The brazen balloon intrusion shows the utter disrespect of the United States by China’s regime. We do not know why the Chinese thought they could get away with such an act, but attempts at dialogue cannot solve the problem.

In any event, Americans may wonder what is the point of talking with a Chinese regime that is not prepared to deal with their country in good faith.

The Chinese are masters in the art of getting what they want by not talking. Americans need to learn this skill as well.

"Communist China Cracked Down On Christians In 2022, Report Says","The Chinese government cracked down on Christians in 2022 in the run-up to the 20th Party Congress, a new report from ChinaAid reveals.

The Chinese Communist Party now requires for Chinese churches to actively promote the party’s ideology from the pulpit and censors, fines and even imprisons Christians who fail to toe the line, according to the report.

“Not only should they submit to the Party’s demands, but they must also actively support socialism,” Jonathan Dingler, a spokesman for ChinaAid who worked on the report, told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) censored, fined, politically indoctrinated and forcibly disappeared Chinese Christians in 2022, according to a new report from the nonprofit ChinaAid Tuesday.

The People’s Republic of China (PRC) reportedly employed a range of new methods to persecute Chinese Christians in 2022 including fabricating charges of fraud as well as criminalizing the legal international travel of church leaders, the report states. China’s crackdown on Christianity reportedly intensified in the run-up to the CCP’s 20th Party Congress in October 2022, during which time General Secretary Xi Jinping secured a third term as the communist nation’s supreme leader, according to ChinaAid. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: GOP Reps Call On FBI To Investigate Biden Appointee’s Ties To Alleged Chinese Intel Front Groups)

“Xi Jinping and the Communist Party did all they could to silence Christians leading up to the 20th National Congress,” Jonathan Dingler, a spokesman for ChinaAid who worked on the report, told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Christians account for approximately 5% of China’s religious community, according to the CIA World Factbook. While Catholics number around 10 million, Protestants account for the majority of China’s Christian community, with approximately 38 million followers as of 2020, The Economist reported.

Dingler told the DCNF that after the CCP’s crackdown leading up to the 20th Party Congress “the tone shifted” within the state-sanctioned churches which then began treating Xi “as if he were the leader of the church.”

ChinaAid identified a March 2022 paper entitled “Adhering to the Sinicization of Religion in China” published by the United Front Work Department (UFWD) as the political motivation behind the CCP’s 2022 crackdown on Christianity.

The UFWD is a “Chinese government entity charged with extending the CCP’s influence and control over non-Party organizations both domestically and abroad to advance CCP policy objectives,” according to a 2021 report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC). Moreover, the USCC also identified the UFWD as a “Chinese intelligence service” in 2016.

The UFWD’s March 2022 paper reportedly emphasized “promoting the Sinicization of religion, adhering to the orientation of the core socialist values and submerging all religious beliefs in Chinese culture to better adapt religion to China’s socialist society and the New Era of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics,” according to ChinaAid.

“Sinicization is the government’s attempt to make a more CCP-friendly church,” Dingler told the DCNF. “Not only should they submit to the Party’s demands, but they must also actively support socialism.”

“However, last year we observed that now Sinicization requires even more: undying allegiance to Xi Jinping,” Dingler said.

China’s state-sanctioned churches must now actively promote Xi’s thoughts “from the pulpit,” which in practice means that churches which don’t “flat-out fall at Xi’s feet and worship him are considered ‘inciting subversion of state power,'” Dingler told the DCNF.

Churches were reportedly even converted into political propaganda centers in order to broadcast Xi’s speech during the 20th Party Congress in October 2022, according to ChinaAid’s report. Likewise, churches in Jiangsu, Sichuan and other provinces were also reportedly repurposed to hold “study” sessions on CCP policies such as “Reinforcing Management of Religion on All Fronts: 10 Prohibitions and 10 Mustn’ts.”

The Chinese government also increasingly persecuted Christians online in 2022, censoring words like “Jesus,” “Savior” and “Amen” on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, according to ChinaAid’s report. At the same time, the Chinese government also shut down church websites and Christians’ social media accounts.

“Congregants can’t even give to their churches online anymore, thanks to new regulations,” Dingler said. “They want to break down house churches even further, hoping they will finally give in and submit.”

However, the full extent of the CCP’s crackdown remains unclear to ChinaAid, Dingler told the DCNF.

“ChinaAid does not have a truly accurate sense of how many Christians are affected by persecution, whether that be imprisonment or forced disappearance,” said Dingler. “Throughout the years it has been harder and harder to get a clear number because so many churches are afraid to share their lived persecution experiences with us due to the CCP.”

“Seeing the cases that come in day-by-day, I can’t say I blame them,” he added.

The Chinese Embassy did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Dem Sen. Mark Warner Rips China For ‘Hypocrisy’ Over Its Battery Plant Deal With Ford,"Democratic Virginia Sen. and Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Mark Warner called out China’s scrutiny of the Ford Motor Company’s recent deal with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) Thursday, according to Bloomberg.

Chinese officials expressed concern about CATL’s battery technology being revealed to the U.S. after Ford announced that it would be opening a multi-billion-dollar factory in Michigan that will rely on Chinese electric vehicle (EV) batteries, according to Bloomberg. The senator called this ironic given that American companies have been required to transfer their technology to their Chinese counterparts.

Beijing said that while they are pleased that the Ford deal shows China’s prowess in the electric vehicle (EV) battery space, they’re concerned about the company’s main technology being accessed by the American motor company, according to Bloomberg.

CCP in Michigan: @ford and State of MI penned deal with Chinese battery company CATL to build plant in Michigan. CATL will provide tech and Chinese workers. Ford will own it, to get around US-owned requirements for Federal subsidies. Ford/Michigan embrace CCP. — Scott (@Scott4WA8) February 17, 2023

Sen. Warner called the Chinese review of the deal, “hypocrisy of the Communist Party regime,” according to Bloomberg. “They have forced technology transfer, stolen technology, and now want to try and reverse the flow,” Warner said.

Chinese tech companies have a history of stealing sensitive data from American private companies in their efforts to become the world technology leader. One 2017 case involved Chinese workers hacking into Equifax, one of the biggest credit-reporting firms in the U.S., and recovered personal information from about 145 million Americans, according to Foreignpolicy.com. (RELATED: Bleak Future If US Loses Tech War To China, New SCSP Report Warns)

The deal between Ford and CATL has also received scrutiny from the other side of the aisle. “I am alarmed at Ford’s plan to establish a large, Michigan-based factory, structured as a wholly owned subsidiary that licenses its technology from CATL,” Sen. Marco Rubio, ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, wrote in a Feb. 13 letter to President Biden provided to the DCNF.

The office of Sen. Mark Warner did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Secretary Of State Blinken Warns China May Consider Providing ‘Lethal Support’ To Russia,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned China may be aiding Russia with “lethal support” in its military operation against Ukraine.

Blinken met with China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, at the Munich Security Conference Saturday, where he expressed concern about China providing lethal aid to Russian troops. He told CBS News’ “Face the Nation” that U.S. officials have retrieved information that the Chinese government is seriously considering supplying weapons.

“The concern that we have now is based on the information we have that they are considering providing lethal support and we’ve made very clear to them [China] that that would cause a serious problem for us and our relationship,” Blinken said.

He said this includes both ammunition and weaponry in addition to the non-lethal support the nation has already provided to Russia since the beginning of the war in February 2022. U.S. officials have feared this possibility since the very start of the war, leading President Joe Biden to raise the issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping in its first weeks.

The U.S. sanctioned a Chinese company in late January for allegedly aiding the Wagner Group, a mercenary organization that provides thousands of fighters to Russia, with satellite imagery of Ukraine, BBC News reported. (RELATED: China To Team Up With Russia, Conduct Joint Naval Drills)

Blinken pointed to a February 4, 2022 meeting between Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the weeks leading up to the Russian invasion in which the allied countries established a “partnership with no limits” and expressed opposition to expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The secretary of state said the U.S. remains concerned that this unlimited support includes China aiding the war in Ukraine.

Xi has yet to condemn the war in Ukraine and has remained neutral on the issue, a position which Putin has praised. The two leaders affirmed their alliance in September by denouncing the U.S.’ opposition to a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan.

Blinken also addressed the “growing concern” of Iran providing Iranian-made drones to Russia to assist the war in exchange for Russian weaponry.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/19/antony-blinken-china-lethal-support-russia-face-the-nation/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjrjJfnorP9AhUBsVYBHWuQBMg4FBAWegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw02jY8ty1fhe_hhxRElzdK6,2023-02-19
STEINHAUER: Sun Tzu’s Art Of War Is Key To Understanding The Conflict With China,"The goal of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has remained the same since the days of its founder Mao Zedong in the 50s: for China to once again become the strongest, most powerful nation on earth. Or as current CCP supreme leader Xi Jinping puts it, China taking “center stage in the world.”

This objective of global supremacy is inherently zero sum, for like Highlander, there can be only one. Thus, the CCP must first dislodge the current occupant, the United States, from its leading position and realign the world order to reflect China’s preferences.

To accomplish this end, the CCP is following the doctrines of Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu as distilled in his famous military treatise the Art of War, which despite being around 2,500 years old remains highly influential in modern Chinese strategy.

One of Sun Tzu’s fundamental principles is that “the greatest victory is that which requires no battle.” Thus, while western generals often seek to bring about a single decisive battle, adherents of Sun Tzu, like the CCP, seek to achieve such a dominant strategic position that battle itself becomes unnecessary, as the outcome is already decided.

Following this advice, the CCP has for decades employed various forms of indirect warfare against the United States including political, psychological, cultural, subversive, legal, and economic, to compromise and degrade America’s strategic strength and position over time. While concurrently, the CCP has sought to enhance China’s own strategic power and position relative to the United States. So that eventually the power imbalance would be so vast and apparent, that China’s victory would merely be, as the French would say, a fait accompli.

Indeed, we can see this strategy in many of Xi Jinping’s signature policies.

For instance, Xi’s dual circulation strategy, which seeks for China to become economically self-sufficient, while in turn ensuring the rest of the world, including America, remains dependent upon China for manufacturing, supply chains, even future growth, and prosperity. Thereby giving the CCP enormous leverage, with the ability to reward and punish others as it desires, while removing undue foreign influence over itself.

Additionally, there is Xi’s Belt and Road initiative. A new “silk road” meant to bind much of the world through Chinese built infrastructure and debt trap diplomacy, in an “all roads lead to China” strategy. This has already allowed China to lay claim to strategic ports, land, and natural resources in places like Africa.

Then there is Xi’s military-civil fusion strategy whereby Chinese companies are forced to assist China’s military and defense capabilities through the acquisition and integration of dual-use technologies, those with both commercial and military application, such as artificial intelligence, to give China the most technologically superior military, and leapfrog the United States.

Finally, there is Xi’s Made in China 2025 initiative, a massive state driven industrial policy aimed squarely at China winning the world’s most consequential technologies, those that will decide future global power, such as advanced manufacturing, robotics, and quantum computing.

These policies, and others like them, are meant to place China in a strategically dominant position from an economic, military, and technological standpoint, so that per Sun Tzu, America eventually capitulates and accepts China’s rise, and thus its own decline, as a historical inevitability that must simply be accommodated. For example, by ceding Asia, including Taiwan, to China as the hemispheric hegemon.

It’s imperative then that America understands and combats this CCP strategy and whole of nation approach to warfare. If we do not, we may awake one day soon to find we have lost, and the war over without the firing of a single shot.

Perhaps, it’s time to brush up on our Sun Tzu.

"Dem Reps Defend Biden Appointee Who Belonged To Alleged Chinese Intel Fronts, Suggest Critics Are Racist","A Democratic congresswoman tied to alleged Chinese Communist Party (CCP) intelligence front groups, along with other members of her party, defended a Biden administration official on Friday after Republicans raised questions about his alleged Chinese government links.

After six Republican lawmakers led by Texas Republican Rep. Lance Gooden urged the FBI to investigate the alleged CCP intel front group ties of Dominic Ng, CEO of East West Bank and Biden’s appointee to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) led by California Democratic Rep. Judy Chu accused Gooden and his peers of singling out Ng due to his ethnicity, according to a joint press release on Chu’s website. Without providing evidence, CAPAC’s statement, which was also signed by Democratic Reps. Ted Lieu and Mark Takano of California as well as Grace Meng of New York, claimed the recent “suspicions” surrounding Ng’s alleged CCP ties were racially motivated and based on findings from “extreme-right” outlets, referring to the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: Biden Appointee’s Firm Admits He Belonged To Alleged Chinese Intel Operation)

The DCNF recently revealed that Ng served as “executive director” at both the China Overseas Exchange Association (COEA) and the China Overseas Friendship Association (COFA). China experts, such as former CIA officer Nicholas Eftimiades, have identified both COEA and COFA as Chinese intelligence front groups.

“No Chinese Americans — indeed no Americans — should face suspicions of disloyalty or treason based on their ethnicity, nation of origin, or that of their family members,” CAPAC’s press release stated. “That kind of profiling is beneath us all, particularly those entrusted with public office.”

However, Chu’s comments follow a series of DNCF investigations that produced evidence of her own alleged CCP intel front group ties.

Chu served as the “honorary chairwoman” for an organization opposing Taiwan’s independence, which the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission identified as a front group of the United Front Work Department, one of the CCP’s overseas influence operations, according to a previous DCNF investigation. The DCNF also found that since 2012, Chu has served as the “honorary president” at the All-America Chinese Youth Federation, an organization whose leaders have included five individuals who’ve belonged to alleged UFWD front groups.

Most recently, the DCNF reported that Chu gave certificates of “Congressional Recognition” to at least 10 individuals who belonged to alleged CCP intel groups, many of whom also made political donations to Chu, campaign finance records reveal.

“Anyone who comes to Mr. Ng’s defense has questionable judgment, but calling members who are simply demanding an investigation ‘racist’ is just sad,” Gooden told the DCNF on Monday.

Prior to Ng’s appointment to APEC, CAPAC unsuccessfully lobbied President-elect Biden in December 2020 to appoint Ng to serve as secretary of the Commerce Department, according to Rep. Chu’s website.

In response to the Republicans’ demands, an East West Bank spokesman claimed that although Ng never belonged to COFA, Ng served at an “executive-director level” in an “honorary position” at COEA, but allegedly withdrew from the organization in 2014 due to “non-participation,” according to an American Banker report Friday. However, the DCNF’s investigation revealed that Ng was listed as COEA’s “executive director” throughout the entirety of COEA’s 5th Council between 2013 and 2017, citing multiple archived versions of COEA’s website.

Reps. Chu, Meng, Lieu and Takano were also among the Democratic votes opposing the formation of the House Select Committee charged with investigating the CCP’s malign influence efforts.

While defending their vote, CAPAC alleged that the new committee might lead to anti-Asian violence, according to its statement.

“Unquestionably anti-Asian violence is a real problem, but it’s a problem that the CCP wants,” Ina Mitchell, co-author of “The Mosaic Effect: How The Chinese Communist Party Started A War In America’s Backyard,” told the DCNF.

“The CCP deliberately amplifies social chaos and stirs up racism because it is an effective tool against questions of loyalty, which in the end really does hurt hard working Asian-Americans who have nothing to do with the CCP,” Mitchell said.

CAPAC and Chu did not respond immediately to the DCNF’s request for comment.

"‘Tip Of The Iceberg’: Biden Appointee’s Ties To Alleged Chinese Intel Groups Put Him In Legal Hot Water, Experts Say","President Joe Biden’s appointee representing U.S. business interests in Asia should be investigated for his ties to an alleged Chinese Communist Party (CCP) intelligence front group, multiple legal experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Dominic Ng, CEO of East West Bank, may be required to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), and he may have also violated The Espionage Act (TEA), legal experts told the DCNF after reviewing relevant statutes. Ng served in leadership positions within two organizations identified by China experts as CCP intelligence front groups, the DCNF revealed in a recent investigation.

“It may be prudent for the Biden administration to suspend or put on hold this appointment of Mr. Ng,” Morse Tan, dean of Liberty University’s School of Law, told the DCNF. “An investigation should be engaged in to determine what is going on here because there could be U.S. interests that are at stake that could be damaged, and also advantage given to the Chinese Communist Party, who is well known to be engaged in espionage, intelligence gathering and other such things within the United States.” (RELATED: Biden Appointee’s Firm Admits He Belonged To Alleged Chinese Intel Operation)

East West Bank admitted Friday that Ng had served at an “executive-director level” in an “honorary position” at the China Overseas Exchange Association (COEA). Yet, Ng allegedly withdrew from the organization in 2014 due to “non-participation,” according to an East West Bank spokesman’s statements reported by American Banker on Friday.

The statements were made following a DCNF investigation which found that Ng served as “executive director” at COEA between 2013 and 2017, before the banker began a five-year position with the same title of “executive director” at the related China Overseas Friendship Association (COFA) in 2019.

Chinese intelligence experts, such as former CIA officer Nicholas Eftimiades, have identified both COEA and COFA as front groups for the United Front Work Department (UFWD), a CCP agency overseeing both influence and intelligence operations, according to multiple reports from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC).

“He should be immediately removed from APEC — at least until a proper FBI investigation clears Ng of any such involvement,” Eric Early, managing partner at the law firm of Early, Sullivan, Wright, Gizer & McRae, told the DCNF.

In response to the DCNF’s investigation, six Republican members of Congress led by Rep. Lance Gooden of Texas sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Feb. 15, demanding for Ng to be investigated to determine the “extent of Mr. Ng’s knowledge of sensitive information.”

In addition to a suspension from APEC, Ng should also be compelled to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), Tan told the DCNF.

“[FARA] is for U.S. individuals that are agents of a foreign principal — the foreign principal here being the Chinese Communist Party,” said Tan. “[Ng] was involved as the executive director for a couple of front organizations, which both merged into one, and had extensive interactions with the CCP — sometimes high-ranking CCP individuals.”

“In terms of whether or not [Ng] was an ‘agent’ there seems to be a broad understanding of what ‘agent’ means under [FARA] and includes all individuals acting in a political or quasi-political capacity,” Tan told the DCNF.

Based on the available evidence, Michael Chamberlain, director of Protect the Public’s Trust, told the DCNF that it “appears that Mr. Ng may well qualify as an ‘agent of a foreign principal,’ which would require him to register and disclose his relationship under FARA.”

Likewise, Reed D. Rubinstein, Senior Counselor and Director of Oversight and Investigations at America First Legal, told the DCNF that “by virtue of his admitted service” in COEA, Ng “may well have had an obligation to register under FARA.”

“Obviously, there are facts we don’t know about what his role really may have been, and the allegations about the organization and its connections to the CCP,” said Rubinstein. “If those allegations are in fact, true, then, at a minimum, yes, there should have been a [FARA] registration.”

As chair of APEC’s Business Advisory Council, Ng is tasked with providing “recommendations to APEC leaders reflecting the perspectives of key APEC stakeholders,” the State Department announced. After the World Trade Organization, APEC is Beijing’s most valuable trade forum, accounting for a reported 70% of all China’s trade, according to China Briefing, an online publication concerning business in China.

“To me, this is the tip of an iceberg that is very, very deep that encompasses corporate leaders, academic leaders and politicians,” Rubinstein added.

However, several Democratic members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPC) led by California Democratic Rep. Judy Chu came out in Ng’s defense on Friday, characterizing Republican lawmakers’ calls to investigate the embattled banker as “profiling,” according to a joint press release from CAPAC.

Yet, Tan, who identified himself as the first Asian-American ambassador-at-large in U.S. history, told the DCNF that “legitimate concerns” of “espionage or actions of a foreign agent” should not be dismissed even if people are “crying racism.”

Despite Ng’s membership in an alleged UFWD front group, it will likely require a formal investigation to determine whether or not he’s actually violated TEA, experts said.

Tan said that 18 U.S. Code Section 793 — “Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information” — is the modern form of TEA which was passed in 1917.

Rubinstein told the DCNF that not enough was known to say whether or not the “statutory trip wires” of TEA had been crossed, “I don’t think we know enough to be able to say one way or the other.”

But, if it is shown that Ng passed “information onto our nation’s enemy” then “he may very well have violated The Espionage Act,” Early said.

“If the FBI acts, as it immediately should, on the request of the Congress members who sent the letter, it may very well uncover information sufficient to find TEA violations,” said Early.

Although it remains unclear to which level of classified information, if any, Ng might have access as chair of APEC’s Business Advisory Council, Tan said that if the U.S. government ultimately decides to prosecute the banker, such a case would have to prove that Ng obtained sensitive information concerning national defense with the intent or reason to believe the information would be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of a foreign nation, like China.

In the event that such an investigation occurs, prosecutors might therefore seek to establish that Ng had given “advantage” to China, Tan said, as that element of 18 U.S. Code Section 793 might be the easiest to satisfy.

However, the U.S. government owes the American public an explanation given that an individual with ties to alleged CCP intel front groups was appointed to a senior government position in the first place, experts told the DCNF.

“Why would an administration claiming the mantle of the most ethical and transparent in history, and promising to restore norms, even consider someone to represent the United States in such a role who has these kinds of ties to a hostile foreign regime?” Chamberlain said.

These calls were echoed by Republican lawmakers.

“I want to know if this was flagged while Mr. Ng was vetted for this position, and if the Biden Administration knew about his ties to the CCP, why they allowed his appointment to move forward,” Florida Republican Rep. Mike Waltz told the DCNF.

“We know the CCP has an even greater espionage campaign than the Soviet Union ever had in our country, yet this administration refuses to take the threat of China seriously,” Waltz said.

Rubinstein told the DCNF that Ng’s ties “should have been picked up” during the government’s vetting process.

“You would hope that the government would have the kind of base level of competence necessary to flag those things,” said Rubinstein, while noting that the DCNF was able to discover Ng’s CCP ties.

Tan said that, during his own vetting process, the U.S. government interviewed him for over seven hours prior to government service.

“There were extensive questions about whether or not I was tied to any foreign government — or even foreign nationals for that matter — and whether I had been involved in any organizations that would be of concern to the U.S. government,” Tan told the DCNF.

The U.S. government will still owe the American public an explanation if it turns out that Ng’s CCP ties were identified, but ignored, during his vetting process, experts told the DCNF.

“There needs to be an explanation as to how that relationship either was missed during the vet or why it was apparently passed over without a more robust second level sort of investigation,” Rubinstein said.

“One would like to think that administrations appoint individuals because of their knowledge and skills, and not because they wrote a big check, but reality is what it is,” Rubinstein said, referring to the fact that Ng donated $100,000 to the Biden Victory Fund and $35,500 to the Democratic National Committee in 2020, according to campaign finance records.

“These types of arrangements are precisely why D.C. has earned its moniker as ‘The Swamp’ and a major reason behind the American public’s trust in government falling faster than a balloon shot by an F-16,” Chamberlain said.

APEC, East West Bank, Ng and the White House did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

NBA Begins ‘Strategic Collaboration’ With Giant Chinese Company,"The NBA and Chinese financial technology giant Ant Group announced on Tuesday a “comprehensive strategic collaboration” to create original content on Alipay, Ant’s payment platform.

Alipay users will gain exposure to original NBA content and customized fan experiences through the collaboration, Ant Group and NBA China said in a press release. Types of content will include video content, joint membership, NBA-mini program, joint marketing campaigns, digital collectables and social responsibility initiatives.

“The NBA is always seeking to embrace innovative technology,” said NBA China CEO Michael Ma. “We have a common vision with Ant Group, which is to bring rich and high-quality content services and consumer experience to fans through digital services, blockchain technology and other user-friendly technologies. Through our cooperation with Ant Group, more fans will be able to experience the excitement and passion of the NBA more conveniently than ever before.”

NBA China is the league’s outpost for all business operations in the country. It was formed in 2008 after the NBA opened its Hong Kong office in 1992. NBA China created an NBA channel on Alipay on Feb. 15th, featuring content from the league’s Chinese influencers and Alipay’s authorized content creators.

The NBA has developed a close relationship with China since the league began broadcasting games on Chinese state TV in the 1980s. Critics have objected to the NBA’s support for progressive causes in America while downplaying China’s alleged human rights violations towards Uyghur muslims and other minority groups.

When former Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for Hong Kong in October 2019, China stopped broadcasting NBA games for 17 months until a matchup between the Los Angeles Clippers and Utah Jazz was televised in April 2022.

Notre Dame Condemns China For Uyghur ‘Genocide’ In International Criminal Complaint Brief,"Notre Dame Law School (NDLS) announced Tuesday that it had filed a brief in support of an international criminal complaint against China for the “genocide” of Uyghurs, according to a press release.

Human rights organizations have estimated at least 1 million Uyghurs, Turkish Muslims residing in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, have been detained, tortured and even forcefully sterilized by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), according to the BBC. NDLS’ Religious Liberty Initiative announced in a press release a 39-page amicus brief in support of a criminal complaint against China filed in August 2022 by several human rights groups. (RELATED: NBA Begins ‘Strategic Collaboration’ With Giant Chinese Company)

“The Chinese government’s actions have been recognized as a genocide by two successive U.S. administrations,” the press release read. “According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, China’s suppression of the Uyghur population, including through forced detention, torture, killing, systematic annihilation, and forced sterilization, constitute crimes against humanity, which can be prosecuted and punished for the preservation of international peace and fundamental freedoms.”

The brief accuses China of facilitating the deaths of 5 to 10% of the Uyghurs it imprisons while noting that “exact numbers are difficult to ascertain given the Chinese government’s attempts to suppress public knowledge of its actions.”

The CCP also has, according to the brief, “committed all five actions” constituting genocide according to international law.

“[K]illing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; forcibly transferring children of the group to another group,” the brief read, citing the definition of genocide.

Stephanie Barclay, director of the Notre Dame Law School Religious Liberty Initiative, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that its “very important for universities to condemn the Uyghur situation in China.”

“No one deserves to be persecuted due to their religious beliefs or distinct ethnic identity,” Barclay said. “ At an event about the Uyghur genocide that took place at Notre Dame Law School in October, a student expressed that, if more people truly understood the gravity of the situation, more action would be taken. Students should have the opportunity to learn about the genocide and ways they could potentially help the Uyghur community.”

NDLS’ brief came as a response to an original criminal complaint filed in August 2022 by the World Uyghur Congress (WUC), an international organization that represents the interests of Uyghurs globally, and the Uyghur Human Rights Project (UHRP), an organization that “promotes the rights of the Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim peoples. TWUC and UHRP submitted the complaint to the Argentinian universal jurisdiction court provided by the Argentinian Constitution, which accepts criminal complaints regarding “international crimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity, and torture wherever they take place,” according to UHRP’s press release.

If the Argentinian court decides to hear the case, witnesses could be called to testify about the CCP’s treatment of the Uyghurs for the “first time” since the abuse began, according to the press release.

Uyghur Human Rights Project did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Biden Admin Threatens ‘Consequences’ If China Crosses ‘Red Line’ — But Won’t Reveal What They Are,"The Biden administration has threatened consequences for China if it provides military support to Russia, but won’t disclose what exactly China would suffer.

China has denied it is considering weapons and ammunition transfers to Russia, attempting to position itself as a neutral mediator, according to media reports. However, the U.S. has information Chinese authorities may be considering providing direct military support to Ukraine, Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned on a CBS News clip released Saturday.

“We have made very clear to China that providing lethal weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine or systematically aiding sanctions evasion would cause real consequences in our relationship with China. We’re not going to lay out what the consequences would be,” a State Department spokesperson told the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: Secretary Of State Blinken Postpones China Trip Over Spy Balloon Rift)

“China understands what’s at risk were it to proceed with providing material support of that kind to Russia. And it would cause a real problem for China in its relationships with many other countries, not just the United States,” the spokesperson added.

American officials shared “disturbing” trends in Chinese involvement in Russia’s war effort with allies, CNN reported Saturday. Vice President Kamala Harris and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield voiced similar concerns and threatened consequences for Beijing if it follows through, the outlet reported.

“We also have to be clear that if there are any thoughts and efforts by the Chinese and others to provide lethal support to the Russians in their brutal attack against Ukraine, that that is unacceptable,” Thomas-Greenfield told CNN. “That would be a red line.”

“Looking ahead, any steps by China to provide lethal support to Russia would only reward aggression, continue the killing, and further undermine a rules-based order,” Harris told the audience at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, according to CNN.

Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang expressed alarm that the conflict in Ukraine is “intensifying and even getting out of control,” AFP reported. China would work to reach a peaceful settlement to the war, the diplomat added.

Beijing has avoided endorsing Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and officials told CNN the hesitance to provide military assistance could stem from a desire not to further alienate China from the rest of the world.

However, the U.S. believes China has scaled up technical and economic assistance to Russia since the beginning of the war and fears more robust military assistance, including weapons and ammunition, could come in the future.

“To date, we have seen Chinese companies – and, of course, in China there is really no distinction between private companies and the state – we have seen them provide non-lethal support to … Russia for use in the Ukraine,” Blinken told CBS News.

Other non-lethal support could include flack jackets and helmets, CNN reported, citing multiple U.S. and European sources close to the intelligence.

China previously declared an unlimited partnership with Russia just before the invasion in early 2022.

China Pushes For Investigation Into Nord Stream Pipeline Explosion,"Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin called for an investigation Feb. 20 into the Nord Stream Pipeline explosion.

During his press conference, Wenbin stated that the United States has not been vocal about the incident since it occurred.

“The Nord Stream pipelines used to be considered Europe’s energy lifeline. The explosions dealt a severe blow to the global energy market and the global eco-environment,” Wenbin said. “It also caused fear across Europe of a long, cold winter. An objective, impartial and professional investigation into the incident is clearly in order.” (RELATED: The CIA Saw Nord Stream Blasts Coming Weeks Ago)

“In the wake of these revelations, the US government and media have been mysteriously quiet and the countries concerned in Europe seem rather hesitant about how they would react. These unusual signs give people even more reason to believe that the truth behind the Nord Stream blast is more complicated than they can imagine. Given the gravity of sabotaging vital transnational infrastructure and the serious consequences arising thereof, the international community has every right to demand a thorough investigation into this,” Wenbin added.

During a UN Security Council briefing Tuesday, Chinese ambassador Zhang Jun reiterated the call for an investigation into the Nord Stream Pipeline.

“It is increasingly clear that what happened to the Nord Stream pipelines was by no means an accident, but rather a deliberate act,” Zhang said, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP). “From the perspective of physical conditions, it is hard to imagine that any non-state actor would be capable of carrying out such destruction alone.”

An investigation revealed that an explosion destroyed both Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines on September 26, 2022. Nord Stream 1 Pipeline delivered gas from Russia to Germany. Construction of Nord stream 2, was completed in 2021, but had yet to go into service. Russia has called for an investigation into the origins of the disaster, the Associated Press reported.

“Any deliberate sabotage of transboundary infrastructure is a malicious act,” Zhang said, SCMP reported. “Failure to find out why it happened and who is behind the destruction will send a wrong signal to those with ill intentions and make them believe that they can get away with whatever they do.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/22/china-pushes-investigation-nord-stream-pipeline/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj3rb_norP9AhUhmVYBHdjmCMg4HhAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw1YhH7GJq69h_SHjqIdBfWx,2023-02-22
"Massive Landslide In China Kills Six Mine Workers, Traps Dozens More: Officials","At least six workers were killed as 47 remain missing following a massive landslide in a Chinese open-pit coal mine Wednesday, officials say.

Chinese state broadcaster CCTV noted the massive scale of the approximately 260-foot high and 1,600-foot wide debris field, according to Reuters. Six workers were pulled out alive as of Thursday evening, the outlet reported, citing state media.

The mine, located in the Inner Mongolia province and operated by the Xinjing Coal Mining Co., remains at risk of suffering further collapses, Reuters reported. A second landslide later forced a temporary suspension of rescue efforts.

“The rescue work is being carried out in an orderly and tense manner,” rescue operation leader Wei Zhiguo told CCTV, according to the BBC. Certain individuals have been “controlled” as an investigation remains underway, police reportedly told CCTV.

The landslide spurred mandatory inspections at all open-pit mines across Inner Mongolia, Reuters reported. The Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces also ordered safety inspections over their respective mines. (RELATED: Massive Fire Engulfs 42 Floor Skyscraper In China)
