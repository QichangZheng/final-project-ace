Pat Buchanan questions U.S. intervention in Libya: ‘This is an Arab crisis. Arabs are killing Arabs’,"While some are debating the legality of President Barack Obama’s Libya policy and others are questioning the rationale of the president’s military strategy in the country, MSNBC contributor Pat Buchanan is wondering why the United States is traveling half-way around the world to play any role at all?

On Tuesday’s “Morning Joe” on MSNBC, network contributor Pat Buchanan questioned the basis of U.S. involvement in Libya and wondered why countries neighboring Libya don’t intervene instead?

“You’re dead right – [Sen. John] McCain and [Sen. Joe] Lieberman and the fellow from South Carolina [Sen. Lindsey Graham], they’re yelling about attacking this guy and that guy,” Buchanan said. “We have no right to do those attacks. But look – the Arab League has, so-called, authorized this. Why in the devil are the Egyptians who have 85 million people when Libya has got six? Why is their army not moving into Tobruk? Why is their army not moving into Benghazi?”

According to the former Republican presidential contender and senior adviser to former Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan, if these nations would intervene, the crisis would end quickly.

“This is an Arab crisis. Arabs are killing Arabs,” Buchanan continued. “Why is the United States, all the way across the ocean, got to go in and stop Arabs from killing Arabs when they could have done that job themselves? The Egyptians and the other Arabs – there’s 35 million people in Algeria. There’s 10 million in Tunisia. All they got to do is send their army across the border, secure Benghazi and Tobruk in the east and the other cities in the west and this would be over. Why are we in there?”

"Acting US ambassador to Pakistan met with Code Pink, discussed ‘classified’ drone casualty counts","Richard Hoagland, the acting U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, discussed with Code Pink and anti-Israel activists what he said was classified information, during an October 3 meeting with the groups in Islamabad.

Code Pink, a liberal anti-war organization known for disrupting Republican and conservative public events, uploaded a video of the meeting to an Internet video sharing website on Oct. 5.

“I looked at the numbers today before I came here, and I saw a number of civilian casualties — officially U.S. government classified information,” Hoagland said at the meeting. “Since July 2008 it is in the two-figures. I can’t vouch for you that that’s accurate, in any way, so I can’t talk about the numbers. Alright. I wanted to see what we have on the internal record. [It’s] quite low.”

Realizing what he had said, Hoagland told the activist gathering: “I probably just, you know, got into big trouble with what I just said.”

Watch:

The left-wing delegation to Pakistan included Medea Benjamin, the co-founder of Code Pink, and Robert Naiman, the policy director of a left-wing group called Just Foreign Policy, whose board members include Julian Bond, the former NAACP chairman, and Tom Hayden, the 1960s radical and former California politician.

During the five-minute video, Naiman hands the ambassador a petition, which he claims was signed by more than three thousand people, calling for an end to U.S. military drone strikes in Pakistan.

Naiman also is seen giving Hoagland an anti-drone letter from left-wing American activists, including Alice Walker, Noam Chomsky, Juan Cole and Oliver Stone.

“We demand an immediate moratorium on the drone strikes,” the letter reads, in part. “We demand that U.S. policy in Pakistan be brought into compliance with U.S. and international law, that the U.S. government come clean about civilian casualties, that civilian victims and their families be compensated, and that ‘signature’ drone strikes and attacks on civilian rescuers be permanently abandoned, in Pakistan and everywhere else.”

Naiman, the policy director of the Just Foreign Policy organization, is a longtime anti-Israel activist who participated in an attempt to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza in 2011.

Several days after meeting with the anti-war activists, a Pakistani news outlet reported that Hoagland vowed that the U.S. would continue to deploy all resources, “including drones,” to fight terrorism coming from Pakistan, noting a new wave of terrorism there that began with the shooting of 15-year-old education activist Malala Yousafzai.

EPA costs US economy $353 billion per year,"Transparency is the lifeblood of democracy. Washington needs more of it, especially in the all-too-opaque world of regulation. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for example, is the most expensive federal regulatory agency. Its annual budget is fairly modest in Beltway terms, at a little less than $11 billion, but that’s not where the vast majority of its costs come from. Complying with EPA regulations costs the U.S. economy $353 billion per year — more than 30 times its budget — according to the best available estimate. By way of comparison, that is more than the entire 2011 national GDPs of Denmark ($332 billion) and Thailand ($345 billion).

That figure doesn’t come from the EPA, which last released such an estimate in 1990, but from the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s Wayne Crews, who parsed through publicly available documents, cost estimates of economically significant regulations, and whatever else he could find. That so much effort was required is part of the problem.

The agency should be much more open about the burdens it imposes. It can accomplish this by releasing its own annual estimate of the total cost of all its rules currently in effect. Better yet, given that agencies have an incentive to lowball their costs and highball their benefits, an independent auditor with no skin in the game should perform the estimate every year.

Another important question is the size of the EPA’s regulatory maze. Just how many of its regulations are there? It’s a tricky question, and you won’t find the answer from the agency.

Twice per year, a document called the Unified Agenda is published in the Federal Register. In it, all rulemaking agencies disclose what rules they have in the pipeline or are likely to propose in the near future. It’s a good transparency tool. The trouble is that it doesn’t keep up with agency rulemaking in a timely manner. Its most recent edition is the one for fall 2011. The spring 2012 edition was never published and the fall 2012 edition is now overdue.

In the last edition of the Unified Agenda, the fall 2011 edition, the EPA had 318 rules at various stages of the regulatory process. Nobody outside the agency knows how many rules it currently has in the pipeline. All in all, 4,995 EPA rules appeared in the Winter Unified Agenda from 1999-2011. Over the same period, 7,161 EPA final rules were published in the Federal Register. That means more than 2,000 final rules, which have the force of law, came into effect without first appearing in the Unified Agenda. This could indicate an important transparency problem.

That’s just the EPA’s annual flow of regulations. The agency has existed for more than 40 years. How many total rules does it currently have in effect? Again, the answer doesn’t come from the agency. Earlier this year, the Mercatus Center’s Omar Al-Ubaydli and Patrick A. McLaughlin ran text searches through the entire Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) for terms such as “shall,” “must,” “prohibited,” and the like. The CFR Title covering environmental protection alone contains at least 88,852 specific regulatory restrictions. The number could be as high as 154,350.

This is important information. The public, policy makers, journalists, and the EPA itself would have a better idea of how effectively it is pursuing its mission if this information were available.

Now, while it may seem that I have been singling out the EPA for its transparency shortcomings, the agency is not unique. Other agencies have similar problems. That’s why every rulemaking agency should release an annual report card-style document collecting widely dispersed information about compliance costs, the number of regulatory restrictions, and upcoming significant rules into a single, publicly accessible document. The Competitive Enterprise Institute recently published a report card for the EPA that could serve as a starting point for agencies’ own report cards. (We have more planned for other agencies.)

Justice Louis Brandeis correctly believed that sunshine is the best disinfectant. With high regulatory costs contributing to a stagnant economic recovery, it is well past time to shine more light on regulatory agencies. Annual agency report cards would make a good start.

Yglesias is wrong about China’s U.S. bond purchases,"Matt Yglesias, Slate’s business and economics correspondent, is a lot like Dr. Evil in that he often laments that he’s surrounded by frickin’ idiots. This confidence came through in force in Yglesias’ recent post titled, “Stop Being Wrong About China Buying Our Bonds.” Ironically, not only is Yglesias himself wrong, but his analysis is downright impressive in the depths of its error. Contrary to Yglesias’ claim, the Chinese government’s enormous stockpile of Treasuries does indeed give it leverage over the U.S. government.

Yglesias’ post opens up with characteristic bravado when he writes:

No subject attracts as much wrong commentary from people in positions of authority and influence as China’s purchases of American government debt. Recent antics around the debt ceiling managed to bring about a new surge in wrongness on this subject, so let me set you straight about it once and for all.

Before diving into Yglesias’ case, let’s review the basic facts. The following table is taken from an August 2013 Congressional Research Service report on Chinese holdings (which in context seems to mean Chinese government and central bank holdings) of U.S. debt:

As the table indicates, currently the Chinese constitute some 23 percent of the entire foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries. Furthermore, the CRS report also indicates that between 2003 and 2012, the Chinese covered at least $40 billion of the U.S. budget deficit in a given year, with the exception of 2011 when China’s holdings of Treasuries slightly declined.

In this light, it’s understandable why so many analysts are alarmed. If for some reason the Chinese government should decide to halt its purchases — let alone dump its accumulated holdings — of Treasuries, surely this would have serious ramifications?

Yglesias argues that these fears are baseless; the situation depicted in the table above “doesn’t give China any leverage over the American government.” How does Yglesias reach such a counterintuitive conclusion? He first explains that at current exchange rates, Americans buy more goods from Chinese exporters than vice versa. This trade deficit by itself would mean more dollars chasing Chinese yuan in the foreign exchange markets. We’ll turn over the narrative to Yglesias’ own words:

Now in the natural course of floating exchange rates what would happen here is that the dollar price of Chinese money would rise, and this would increase the price of Chinese-made stuff in America and decrease the price of American-made stuff in China. That in turn would tend to discourage the flow of Chinese-made stuff to the United States of America. But the Chinese government for various reasons wants to subsidize Chinese manufacturing. So they want to send those dollars they accumulate back to the United States….[W]hat they choose to do…is to purchase lots of US government debt. That’s a nice quiet way of limiting the extent of Chinese currency appreciation. But that’s all it is. It’s not an investment…[I]t’s certainly not a favor to the United States of America. The American government doesn’t need China to provide it with American fiat money — we have plenty of American fiat money. [Bold added]

It’s hard to know where to begin in unpacking the problems with Yglesias’ glib position. One way to tackle it is to look at what is actually happening when the Chinese government chooses to buy Treasuries. Contrary to Yglesias’ description, it’s not really the case that American importers send U.S. dollars to Chinese exporters, who build up piles of American fiat money, and then have to find something to do with it. Rather, the more general case is that American importers (or the financial institutions acting on their behalf) go to the foreign exchange markets and buy Chinese money with their dollars first, then use the Chinese money to buy Chinese goods.

At the same time, if the Chinese central bank wants to acquire more U.S. Treasuries, it doesn’t walk around with hat in hand to various Chinese exporters, asking them to deposit the U.S. dollar bills they’ve accumulated. No, the Chinese central bank enters the foreign exchange markets, looking to buy U.S. dollars with Chinese money, in order to then buy U.S. Treasuries with American money. Thus, to claim that the Chinese government is effectively mailing back dollar bills — which is no favor to us since the Treasury can just print up more dollar bills on our end — isn’t even technically what’s going on.

Yet that’s just a minor quibble. The fundamental problem with Yglesias’ argument is that he ignores the impact on the United States if the Chinese chose to use their dollar holdings to buy American exports, rather than more Treasuries. In other words, the “favor” the Chinese are bestowing on Americans in general (and the U.S. government in particular) isn’t that they are handing over dollars in exchange for more Treasuries. Rather, the “favor” is that they keep sending us manufactured goods without asking for anything “real” in return.

In principle, the Chinese could sell their current holdings of some $1.3 trillion (as of May) in Treasuries, then use the dollars thus raised in order to buy exports from the United States. Then at least one of the following effects would kick in, or (more likely) they would occur in combination:

POSSIBLE EFFECT #1: By dumping $1.3 trillion of Treasuries on the market at once, the Chinese would force up U.S. interest rates. In other words, in the very act of selling, the Chinese might depress the market value of their holdings (a drop in bond prices means a rise in yield), and not get the full $1.3 trillion at current market valuations.

POSSIBLE EFFECT #2: The sudden (and presumably long-term) collapse of Chinese demand for U.S. financial assets would lead to a sharp depreciation of the dollar. Suddenly “cheap” imports from China would not be so cheap. Retailers such as Wal-Mart would not be able to sell lamps, TVs, and other goods as cheaply as they currently do. Crude oil, quoted in U.S. dollars, would suddenly jump in price. Most retail items would become more expensive for American consumers.

POSSIBLE EFFECT #3: The first effect #1 above could be offset to the extent that private American investors stepped into the breach and mimicked the role previously played by the Chinese, by expanding their holdings of Treasuries without asking for a higher yield. In this case, the dollar would still crash against the Chinese currency (effect #2 above). To the extent that the Chinese (and the rest of the world) just wanted to reduce their holdings of U.S. assets, period, this outcome would simply reverse the accumulated trade deficits up to this point; Americans would run a one-time $1.3 trillion trade surplus with China, busting their buns to ship them all sorts of goodies, for nothing — just to get back to even.

POSSIBLE EFFECT #4: The only way to completely offset both effects #1 and #2 above, is if foreign investors are willing to step into the breach and smoothly offset the Chinese unloading of Treasuries, without asking for a higher yield on the assets to induce them to expand their holdings. Only in this case would Americans be relatively unaffected; the immense holdings of Treasuries would simply have switched from China to, say, Japan.

Now I’m sure that Yglesias and other Keynesians would argue that the above outcomes are actually great, given our current “liquidity trap” conditions. My first retort is that Yglesias didn’t qualify his argument by reference to the current slump; he gave a general case that is either true or false regardless of the unemployment rate.

Furthermore, the Keynesian argument, if correct, leads to the conclusion that if the Chinese developed an unstoppable satellite weapon, and demanded that Americans send them $1.3 trillion in goods as tribute to avoid annihilation, that this wouldn’t affect us in any way. In fact, we would be grateful for the stimulus this provided to our economy, since sending them such tribute shows up (other things equal) as $1.3 trillion in “Net Exports” in the GDP calculations.

Paul Krugman, pining for a bogus alien invasion, might indeed go just that far, and hope for a military blackmail of the United States as the path to prosperity. Does Yglesias as well, or is he willing to reconsider his glib post about China?",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2013/10/24/yglesias-is-wrong-about-chinas-u-s-bond-purchases/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjRhbXKobP9AhWUpVYBHcvmAsY4UBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw2M8S6IJt9XGtWGyJOURvW7,2013-10-24
When ‘leave us alone’ became ‘bake us a cake!’,"Would Jesus bake a cake for a gay wedding?

It’s a weird question, but we do live in interesting times. And believe it or not, this has become one of the most heated debates of the week. That’s because, this week, liberal Christians pushed the argument that legislation allowing Christian florists and bakers to decline to work for same-sex weddings is tantamount to Jim Crow laws.

The analogy is a stretch. Sexual orientation is not race — and permitting what would most definitely be a very small number of observant Christians to exercise their right of conscience is vastly different from pervasive and state-sponsored racism. (But it is perfectly understandable why anyone would want to appropriate the moral high ground that comes from comparing yourself to civil rights crusaders — and your opponents to white supremacists.)

This doesn’t mean the laws are a good idea, but it does mean this particular analogy (no matter how tempting it is to deploy) is a false one. It’s also a powder keg. If your opening volley hinges on comparing your intellectual adversaries to segregationists, you can’t expect an elevated debate.

The truth is, this is a tough issue that pits things we value as a society against things we value as a society.

We have reached a point in the gay rights debate where all the low-hanging fruit has been picked. We are now entering into the zero-sum game phase of the debate, where gay rights and religious liberty must collide. (In other words, the cake is only so big. If you take a piece, you are guaranteeing the other guy has less cake.)

So who’s right? My guess is one could guarantee public opinion is on either side of the issue, depending on how you frame the question. If, for example, you were to ask someone whether or not “businesses should be allowed to deny services to same-sex couples,” the answer would, of course, be “no.”

On the other hand, ask Americans if “government should have the right to forcefully coerce Christians to violate their convictions,” and the answer would also be “no.”

This is a much more difficult and nuanced topic than either side would care to admit. Where you stand on this issue probably comes down to whether or not you see this through the frame of Jim Crow — or through the frame of religious liberty.

And that is probably contingent on your values.

The tension between liberty and equality is alive and well in this debate.

But let’s be honest about something else. This is really a surrogate battle. A much bigger one is coming.

Opponents of these bills score points when they argue that florists and bakers aren’t exactly granting their imprimatur when they make a cake or put together a flower arrangement for a gay wedding. Additionally, they are correct in assuming that most Christians, whether they agree with same-sex marriage, or not, would still bake the cake. In fact, this could be seen as an example of Christian love.

But this is another example of how this schism cannot be easily brushed aside like so many wedding cake crumbs. In recent years, libertarian-leaning conservatives have largely sided with the gay rights argument. Proud members of the “leave us alone” coalition were apt to side with a group of people who just wanted to be left alone to love the person they love (and what happens in the bedroom is nobody’s business).

At some point, however, “leave us alone” became “bake us a cake. Or else!”

And that’s a very different thing, altogether.

The reason conservative Christians are fighting this fight today is because it’s a firewall. The real danger, of course, is that Christian pastors and preachers will eventually be coerced into performing same-sex marriages. (Note: It is entirely possible for someone to believe gay marriage is fine, and to still oppose forcing people who hold strong religious convictions to participate — but I suspect that is where we are heading.)

Think of it this way. If you were a congregant in a church, wouldn’t you expect the pastor to marry you? Why should you be treated different?

Any pastor — if he or she wants to maintain the church’s tax status, that is — had better grapple with this now.

Whether the analogy is fair, or not, refusing to officiate a gay wedding can just as easily be called “denying service.” And it will predictably also be compared to the bad old days of Jim Crow — where racist Christians opposed interracial marriage (until the courts struck down state laws prohibiting biracial marriage).

Muslim Congressmen Want To Block ‘Islamophobic’ Dutch Lawmaker Geert Wilders From Entering US,"The two Muslim members of Congress have called on two U.S. Cabinet members to block Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders from entering the U.S. because they believe he is “Islamophobic.”

Minnesota Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison and Indiana Democratic Rep. Andre Carson penned a joint letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson last Thursday. Foreign Policy reported it on Tuesday.

“We write to raise our deep concern regarding the visit of Mr. Geert Wilders, a Dutch lawmaker known for perpetuating Islamophobia,” the Democratic lawmakers wrote, citing a 1998 law, the International Religious Freedom Act. The law allows the State Department to deny foreign leaders guilty of “severe violations of religious freedom” from entering the U.S.

The law has only been enforced once before, in 2005, to ban Narendra Modi, India’s current prime minister. He was accused of failing to protect Muslims during riots in 2002 in which more than 1,000 people died.

Wilders, the leader of the Party for Freedom, is slated to appear at several events during his trip to the U.S. On Wednesday, he will appear at two events in Washington D.C. at the invitation of Iowa U.S. Rep. Steve King. One is hosted by the Conservative Opportunity Society. Texas U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert has also helped facilitate Wilders’ appearences.

“I feel deeply honored by the invitations. In my speeches I will warn my American colleagues of the dangers of Islamization,” Wilders stated on his personal website earlier this month.

On Sunday, Wilders travels to Garland, Tex. where he will give a speech at the American Freedom Defense Initiative, an event hosted by Pamela Geller. That group will hold its inaugural “Muhammad Art Exhibit” and will award a $10,000 prize for the best cartoon depiction of Muhammad. The contest was created in response to the Islamist massacre at the Paris headquarters of Charlie Hebdo earlier this year.

But Ellison and Carson believe that Wilders’ past criticism of Islam — and he has indeed been critical — is hate speech and that it warrants him being kept out of the U.S.

“We respectfully request that the U.S. government deny Mr. Wilders’s entry due to his participation in inciting anti-Muslim aggression and violence,” wrote Ellison and Carson, the first and second Muslims to be elected to national public office, respectively. “Mr. Wilders’s policy agenda is centered on the principle that Christian culture is superior to other cultures.”

The lawmakers point out that in 2010 and 2011 Wilders was brought up on formal charges of inciting hatred and discrimination. He is also currently facing charges because of a recent speech in which he called for fewer Moroccans in the Netherlands, they point out.

“Mr. Wilders’ policy agenda is centered on the principle that Christian culture is superior to other cultures,” the joint letter states, citing Wilders’ comment that “Islam is not a religion, it’s an ideology, the ideology of a retarded culture.”

“We should not be importing hate speech.”

While noting that freedom of speech is “a bedrock principle” that distinguishes free societies from oppressive regimes, “free speech…is not absolute,” the letter reads.

Geller called Ellison’s and Carson’s evidence of “sharia,” or Islamic law.

“It is revealing that these Muslim congressmen would show themselves to be enemies of free speech and free discourse,” Geller told The Daily Caller. “They cannot refute Wilders and don’t dare debate him. All these little authoritarians can do is try to prevent people from hearing his message.”

FBI Director Admits US Can’t Vet All Syrian Refugees For Terror Ties [VIDEO],"FBI director James Comey said during a House Committee on Homeland Security hearing on Wednesday that the federal government does not have the ability to conduct thorough background checks on all of the 10,000 Syrian refugees that the Obama administration says will be allowed to come to the U.S.

“We can only query against that which we have collected,” Comey said in response to a line of questioning from Mississippi Rep. [crscore]Bennie Thompson[/crscore].

“And so if someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home, but there will be nothing show up because we have no record of them.”

More than 4 million Syrians have fled their homeland amid a brutal civil war. But many Middle Eastern countries have refused to accept refugees, putting the burden on Europe and the West. Under pressure to assist, President Obama approved a proposal to allow at least 10,000 refugees to settle. According to The New York Times, just over 1,800 have come to the U.S. so far.

But many have expressed concerns over allowing refugees from ISIS’ breeding ground to enter the country.

As Thompson, a Democrat, said, “a lot of us are concerned about whether you have enough information available to you to do an accurate vetting.”

Comey acknowledged that knowledge gap.

“You can only query what you’ve collected,” he reiterated.

He also acknowledged differences in the U.S.’s ability to screen Syrian refugees compared to how Iraqi refugees were vetted in the aftermath of the Iraq War.

“And with respect with Iraqi databases, we had far more because of our country’s work there for a decade,” he said.

“This is a different situation.”

US Healthcare Under Tidal Wave Of Chinese Hacking,"It appears that a familiar cyber foe has been caught (again) with his Chinese hand in the digital cookie jar.

U.S. officials have determined that Chinese hackers breached the health insurance company Anthem in order to gain insight into the American medical system, Financial Times reports. Anthem noticed the breach February after the hackers accessed the information of 80 million customers and employees.

A government official that was involved with the investigation told the Financial Times the digital attack would lead to a wealth of information for China, which could be later implemented to improve their own health care system. (RELATED: Report: United Airlines Data Breached By China-Backed Hackers.)

“Knowledge is power,” the official said. “How is it set up? What are they insuring? Why is this procedure covered but not that one? All of that is useful information.”

According to the Financial Times, insurance regulators sought help from the cyber security firm CrowdStrike to examine Anthem. When the Daily Caller News Foundation reached out to CrowdStrike for comment on the hack, a representative said that “as a corporate policy, we don’t comment on customers.”

China instituted an initiative called “Healthy China 2020,” with an ambitious goal of providing universal health care coverage to all of China’s 1.3 billion citizens.

A World Bank report from 2013 explained that:

…the basic objective of China’s health reforms has been to provide the whole nation with basic medical and health care, while ensuring equal access to, and affordability of, health services…China’s Reform Plan is a massive undertaking, requiring coordination across national ministries…[will target five health sectors]: health insurance, essential medicines, public hospital reform, primary care delivery, and public health services.

Yet, among China’s middle and lower classes, there is widespread dissatisfaction with the level of medical care.

As reported by the Sydney Morning Herald in 2014 “China has seen rising discontent over the healthcare system as a result of sky rocketing medical costs and shrinking resources. This has lead to an increased level of anger, and in some cases violence, against doctors and medical staff.”

The allegations against China for the Anthem breach come shortly after it was discovered that Chinese hackers were also penetrating the security systems of seven US technology and pharmaceutical industries. (RELATED: Fool Me Twice … China Attacks Seven Companies After US Cyber Truce.)

The investigator’s conclusions are unsurprising given the aggressive digital relationship between the US and China. (RELATED: China Is Stealing American Property.)

During Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to the United States on Sept. 25, both Jinping and President Barack Obama agreed to cooperate on cyber security issues.

Since the pact, however, revelations of China’s digital espionage have become a common occurrence. (RELATED: The U.S. Must Call Out China For Its Aggression.)

IRS: You Can’t Sue Us Unless We Say You Can,"Department of Justice lawyers claimed Wednesday the IRS cannot be sued for damages by the estimated 330,000 taxpayers victimized by hackers who earlier this year breached the federal tax agency’s computer files.

Plaintiffs Becky Welborn and Wendy Windrich’s claim of damage under the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedures Act cannot be pursued because the doctrine of Sovereign Immunity, which holds the federal government immune to damage claims unless it agrees to such litigation.

Without such an agreement from the IRS, the federal courts have no jurisdiction over the damage claim filed by Welborn and Windrich, according to Justice Department lawyers.

The government’s lawyers also argued in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that the tax agency can only be sued on claims involving alleged violations of the IRS tax code’s privacy provisions to protect the confidentiality of documents submitted by taxpayers.

In addition, “their alleged injuries — in general terms, the future threat of a cybersecurity breach and the voluntarily incurred costs intended to prevent future theft — are not sufficient to establish an imminent injury that is certainly impending,” the government argued, according to Law360.

Welborn and Windrich were participants in the IRS’s online “Get Transcript” service that allows taxpayers to access their tax information and tax returns from prior years. Participants must answer a series of unique questions about themselves and their financial affairs before the system allows them to login.

But the hackers compromised the system and gained access to the Social Security numbers, current and past W-2s, tax returns, personal identification data like home addresses and details about financial assets and debts of more than 330,000 taxpayers and businesses.

The IRS did not publicly admit the hack had taken place until April, at least two months after the government’s computer files were breached.

“What should have been a trustworthy digital service had been compromised and is yet the latest sign that the U.S. government cannot be relied upon to keep the personal data of its citizens safe,” Welborn and Windrich said in their complaint. “As custodians of taxpayer information, the IRS has an obligation to protect the confidentiality of sensitive information against unauthorized access or loss.”

The IRS hacking was among many in recent months, including breaches of the federal government’s central personnel data file maintained by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The OPM breach compromised personal and financial information on millions of current and retired civil servants and their families.

First Crude Oil Shipment Exports From U.S. After 40 Year Ban Lifted,"The first crude oil shipment exported from the United States, after a 40 year ban, left from Corpus Christi, Texas last Thursday.

NuStar Energy and ConocoPhillips loaded a vessel with light crude oil pumped from the Eagle Ford Shale of South Texas at NuStar’s North Beach Terminal at Port Corpus Christi. The crude is to be sold to the international trading company Vitol.

“Infrastructure improvements at Port Corpus Christi have placed our port in a unique position as a critical component in the export of U.S. crude and condensate. Port Corpus Christi’s deep draft ship channel and strategic location to some of the largest production areas in the US provides a secure and competitive supply chain to markets worldwide,” John LaRue, Port Corpus Christi Executive Director, said in a statement. “Future capital improvements including deepening the ship channel will accommodate larger vessels that are required to cost effectively supply US crude oil to global markets.”

As a result of the federal government’s repeal of the 40-year ban on the export of crude oil, via the last government omnibus spending bill, crude oil shipments are free to leave the country now.

The original crude oil export ban was put into effect during the 1970’s in the midst of the Arab Oil Embargo, which triggered gas rationing and fuel spikes at the pump for the American driver.

Left Behind: Iraqi Interpreter Faces Death Threats For Helping US Troops,"Thousands of interpreters risked their lives working on behalf of the United States during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. While most of the U.S. military personnel who fought in those conflicts have now returned home, a majority of their interpreters remain in-country and their lives are in as much danger now as they were before.

One such interpreter desperate for help contacted The Daily Caller News Foundation.

“Please, I want your help, I am [an] Iraqi interpreter,” read the subject line of the first email received by TheDCNF.

After corresponding with Mahbeer, TheDCNF was not only able to verify his identity, but it also became clear that Mahbeer was awarded commendations and certificates for his position as an integral part within the Army’s 1st Cavalry Division.

The email, and subsequent exchanges, told a dire and intricately detailed story. Mahbeer, a pseudonym assigned to the interpreter to protect his true identity, explained how he worked for the U.S. Army for five years as an interpreter. He provided remarkable details as to the nature of his employment, his documentation proving his identity, pictures of him and the unit he worked with and even pictures proving the identity of his family. Mahbeer was not the only one in danger: His wife and two young children, a boy and a girl, were also under threat from those in Iraq who hunt down anyone who worked with the U.S. military.

“I was working with U.S. forces as interpreter … I want or I hope … to get immigration to [the] U.S.A.,” said Mahbeer in his email. “I started working with U.S. forces from 2006 to 2011 … I have all the paperwork to prove I was [working] and support[ing] U.S. Army ween (sic) they [were] in Iraq. Now, as you know, the security situation in Iraq is very dangerous for my life and the life of [my] family. I got threat [sic] by bad people. I have two kids and my wife.”

“Your hard work and dedication greatly increased our standard of living and … morale. As a result of your support [the unit] performed its mission flawlessly,” said Mahbeer’s Army commendation. A second certificate of appreciation hailed Mahbeer’s “generosity” and “dedication to our soldiers, their families and the nation in this time of war.”

Unfortunately, commendations and certificates would not protect Mahbeer.

“Now terrorism everywhere in my country, militias and Daesh [ISIS],” he explained. “And they hate all the people [who worked] with the U.S. Army … some are calling me … a spy and I got a [threatened] because I [supported] the U.S. Army … I was working with the U.S. military in order for freedom.”

He went on to say how he became involved with the Army during the occupation. He was discovered by an Army unit after he revealed he spoke decent English — a rare find at the time when interpreters were hard to come by. When asked if he would like to work for the Army, his response was simple: “gladly, sir.” Mahbeer ended up working side-by-side with U.S. forces for five years until the U.S. withdrawal in 2011.

“What is happening in Iraq is a bad thing in all areas: security, economy, etc.,” Mahbeer told TheDCNF. As bad as life is for many Iraqis, he noted that it is especially bad for those who worked with the U.S. “We are afraid of everything: armed militias backed by Iran on our streets, without fear of the government, on the pretext that they are protecting Iraq and at the same time they are a serial killer[s].”

Mahbeer is from a town east of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, which he says is essentially controlled by Iranian-backed Shia Popular Mobilization Units (PMUs). Many of the Shia militants fighting in the PMUs also fought U.S. soldiers during the occupation, and they disdain anyone who collaborated with the U.S. Mahbeer said his life was first threatened through an anonymous letter warning his death.

“The problem is that I can not to tell the police because most of them working [are] for the militias, and now I do not know what to do,” he explained in a later email.

“I trust you,” read a second message shortly after.

Mahbeer said he knows many interpreters who have been harassed and killed for their work with the U.S. One example he provided was that of a young man who was killed four months ago. He left his house one day never to return — his body was later discovered. The man’s father reportedly died of grief shortly after.

Cases like those of Mahbeer are all too common. In an attempt to rectify the situation, the U.S. government created what is called the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program, which would allow interpreters whose lives were under threat for their work to immigrate to the U.S. Unfortunately, the bureaucratic complexity of the program has caused some interpreters to be lost in the system. TheDCNF originally reported on this issue in February.

Mahbeer’s case is similar. In order to successfully receive a visa in the SIV program, an interpreter must prove that they worked for the U.S. for two years, obtain a letter of recommendation from the military commander of the unit they worked for and receive a letter written on their behalf from their employer.

Obtaining a letter from employers is often the hardest step in the process for former interpreters.

“Multiple contractors held these contracts throughout the war,” explained Matt Zeller, a former Army officer who now runs No One Left Behind, a non-profit dedicated to helping save former interpreters.

To make matters worse, many contractors, such as Mahbeer’s, simply closed up shop in Iraq and Afghanistan after the wars concluded. Mahbeer had a glowing recommendation from his unit’s commander.

“I would be very proud to call [Mahbeer] my fellow American, due to his enduring loyalty that he already has to a country he is not a part of, but wishes to be,” wrote the commander, who personally vouched that Mahbeer would not present a security concern to the U.S.

Unfortunately for Mahbeer, even the highest praise from a senior U.S. military officer is not enough to break through bureaucratic red tape.

Mahbeer explained to TheDCNF that he had been attempting to secure a letter from his former employer, Global Linguist Solutions (GLS), for some time, but to no avail. Without the letter, there was no way Mahbeer would be able to save himself, his wife, or his two young children.

After GLS failed to respond to an email from TheDCNF on Mahbeer’s behalf, contact with the company was eventually established through a phone call. An email from Mahbeer two days later confirmed he had received his letter from GLS confirming his employment.

GLS did not provide a response to TheDCNF’s request for comment.

Though the letter is a crucial step in ensuring the safety of Mahbeer and his family, they are not out of danger yet. Applications for the SIV program were due September 30, 2014. He is no longer eligible for the program because he was unable to complete his package.

Fortunately, alternative options do exist. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has a program that helps Iraqi interpreters who are under threat. But like the SIV program, IOM also required a letter of recommendation from Mahbeer’s employer. Now that he has secured that letter, he should be able to complete his application and eventually migrate to the U.S.

“Hundreds of translators face the same problem,” said Mahbeer in an email to TheDCNF after he received his letter. Though he expressed his happiness over receiving the long awaited final piece to his application, he noted it took as long as two years before some interpreters were finally able to come to the U.S. after applying.

Mahbeer’s fight is far from over, but he and his family are one step closer to safety than those who are not as fortunate. His case may be just one of thousands.

How The US Should Respond To China’s ‘Secret’ Weapon,"China’s naval and coast guard ships in the South China Sea tend to draw the most attention, but a more troublesome force has been hiding in plain sight for years.

China deploys three types of ships to enact its will in the South China Sea. These include navy “grey hulls,” coast guard “white hulls,” and maritime militia “blue hulls,” Naval War College Professor Dr. Andrew Erickson explained during a House Committee on Armed Services hearing Thursday.

Naval vessels — labeled People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) ships — are noticeably threatening and escalatory, so China often limits their deployment.

Coast guard and maritime law enforcement ships are seen as China’s go-to units in the South China Sea. Between 2010 and 2016, Chinese coast guard units were involved in 71 percent of the 45 incidents. China’s coast guard vessels are growing in size and are, in some cases, navy “grey hulls” which have been painted white, according to Center for Strategic and International Studies scholar Bonnie Glaser, who also spoke at the hearing.

The third sea force, China’s maritime militia, is a paramilitary force that operates on the front lines but hides behind the façade of civilian operations. They are often presented as fishing trawlers, but they rarely behave as such. These maritime militia “blue hulls” are waging a campaign of “grey zone aggression.”

“Make no mistake, these are state-organized, developed, and controlled forces operating under a direct military chain of command,” Erickson stated emphatically during the recent hearing.

China’s maritime militia has been involved in numerous incidents. Maritime militia units made appearances during the 2009 harassment of a U.S. surveillance ship, 2011 sabotage of two Vietnamese hydrographic vessels, 2012 seizure of Scarborough Shoal, 2014 repulsion of Vietnamese vessels near a Chinese oil rig in disputed waters, and 2015 harassment of the U.S.S. Lassen during a Freedom of Navigation Operation (FONOP).

“China is generating a worrying new wave … in leading maritime militia development,” Erickson mentioned. “The Sansha maritime militia was established to be a professional paramilitary force first and foremost, with fishing a secondary mission at best,” he added.

Several new, large maritime militia vessels with reinforced hulls, external rails for the mitigation of collision damage, and water cannons have been deployed in the South China Sea. Such features are not necessary for standard fishing trawlers, but they work well for ramming other vessels and spraying other ships with water to force them out of certain areas.

A 1978 report estimated that China’s maritime militia consisted of 750,000 personnel and 140,000 vessels, but the current size of this force is unknown. A 2010 defense white paper reported that China had 8 million militia units; the maritime militia would be a smaller subset of that group.

China’s maritime militia is typically positioned on the front line, with naval and coast guard vessels stationed nearby for protection. China uses these vessels to skirt claims that it is militarizing the South China Sea. “This is a force that thrives within the shadows of plausible deniability,” argued Erickson.

Despite the present administration’s emphasis on pivoting to Asia and deterring Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, the U.S. government has not addressed this lethal third sea force. Erickson explained, “American officials must reveal the third sea force’s true nature and deeds. China’s maritime militia can only be as deceptive and plausibly deniable as we allow it to be through our own silence and our own inaction.”

China’s maritime militia is not really a “secret” weapon. It is a force that has been operating in the open for quite some time.

An English-language China Daily article openly referred to the “less noticed force, China’s maritime militia” earlier this year. An image in the article showed men in military drab training with firearms equipped with bayonets, but the article claimed that “most of the maritime militia is made up of local fishermen.”

Maritime militia units have taken part in many air and naval exercises since 2014, according to Senior Colonel Xu Qingduan.

“The maritime militia is … a component of China’s ocean defense armed forces [that enjoys] low sensitivity and great leeway in maritime rights protection actions,” explained Zhoushan Garrison Commander Zeng Pengxiang.

Erickson asserts that the U.S. should acknowledge China’s maritime militia as a paramilitary force, revoking civilian protections for these vessels in the event of a conflict.

The U.S. should also call out China’s maritime militia publicly and share information with countries affected by the third sea force, Erickson said in his testimony. Furthermore, the U.S. should make it clear that units which ignore repeated warnings from U.S. vessels will be treated as military units and dealt with accordingly.

Plausible deniability is a strength, yet unmasking it will expose the maritime militia force to vulnerabilities. “We have to make it clear that we are wise to Beijing’s game,” said Erickson.

The South China Sea is a national interest for the U.S., as well as American allies and partners. “The issue is really about having a rules-based order, that if there are no international rules everybody agrees to and abides by, then you have chaos and anarchy in a region where we have enormous interests,” Glaser explained. China appears to be undermining that order to create its own regional norms.

US Intel Report Confirms Kremlin Pushed Anti-Fracking Propaganda,"U.S. intelligence officials confirmed in a declassified report that a Kremlin-controlled media outlet ran programming critical of hydraulic fracturing to ward off challenges to Russia’s energy empire.

Officials reported that RT, which they call the “Kremlin’s principal international propaganda outlet,” ran “anti-fracking programming, highlighting environmental issues and the impacts on public health.”

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) confirmed the Kremlin’s use of RT to attack U.S. fracking for oil and natural gas in a report presenting evidence of Russian intelligence attempts to delegitimize the results of the 2016 election.

“This is likely reflective of the Russian Government’s concern about the impact of fracking and US natural gas production on the global energy market and the potential challenges to Gazprom’s profitability,” ODNI reported.

Russia has seen its oil revenues collapse and gas monopoly over Europe threatened by fracked oil and gas from the U.S. Russian President Vladimir Putin, and his oligarchs have publicly voiced concerns about the impacts of fracking.

Putin has said “black stuff comes out of the tap” when there’s fracking, and Russian state-owned gas company Gazprom said fracking poses “significant environmental risks” to water supplies.

RT, a Russian state-owned media outlet, has been running programs critical of fracking for years, and have eagerly covered even the most insignificant anti-fracking protests in Europe and the U.S.

Industry experts have speculated for years Russia was working behind the scenes and funding anti-fracking movements.

Eastern European officials claimed Russia is backing environmental protesters at potential fracking sites in Romania and Bulgaria.

Former NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters in 2014 that Russia “engaged actively with so-called non-governmental organisations – environmental organisations working against shale gas – to maintain European dependence on imported Russian gas.”

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told audience members during a paid speech in 2014 that Russian oligarchs were propping up “against phony environmental groups” opposed to pipelines and fracking.

The text of that speech was, rather ironically, made public by WikiLeaks — the very website ODNI says has ties to the Russian government. ODNI says Russian intelligence funneled emails from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta’s email account to WikiLeaks.

WikiLeaks published thousands of Podesta’s emails online. ODNI says it was part of a broader effort to “undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.” ODNI even claims Putin had a “clear preference” for President-elect Donald Trump.

So far, there’s limited evidence of Russian oligarchs funding U.S.-based environmentalists.

But the Environmental Policy Alliance (EPA) found a Bermuda-based shell corporation with ties to Russian oligarchs has given $23 million to the Sea Change Foundation, an environmental nonprofit, in 2010 and 2011.

Sea Change gave millions to U.S.-based environmentalists that year, including the s the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters.

“These organizations are involved in advocacy and lobbying against the development of natural gas through the process of fracking,” EPA reported in 2015.

"EXCLUSIVE: Deployed US Navy Has A Pregnancy Problem, And It’s Getting Worse","A record 16 out of 100 Navy women are reassigned from ships to shore duty due to pregnancy, according to data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Investigative Group.

That number is up 2 percent from 2015, representing hundreds more who have to cut their deployments short, taxing both their unit’s manpower, military budgets and combat readiness. Further, such increases cast a shadow over the lofty gender integration goals set by former President Barack Obama.

Overall, women unexpectedly leave their stations on Navy ships as much as 50% more frequently to return to land duty, according to documents obtained from the Navy. The statistics were compiled by the Navy Personnel Command at the request of TheDCNF, covering the period from January 2015 to September 2016.

The evacuation of pregnant women is costly for the Navy. Jude Eden, a nationally known author about women in the military who served in 2004 as a Marine deployed to Iraq said a single transfer can cost the Navy up to $30,000 for each woman trained for a specific task, then evacuated from an active duty ship and sent to land. That figure translates into $115 million in expenses for 2016 alone.

“This is an avoidable cost and expense, leaving a gap for other people to pick up the work slack,” Eden said.

“A pregnancy takes you out of action for about two years. And there’s no replacement,” said Elaine Donnelly, president of the Center for Military Readiness, a nonpartisan public policy organization. “So everybody else has to work all that harder,” adding that on small ships and on submarines, “you really have a potential crew disaster.”

Navy Lt. Cmdr. Nathan Christensen told TheDCNF the Navy tries to plan for the unplanned.

“Just as we deal with other unplanned manning losses due to injury or other hardships, we work to ensure that pregnant service members are taken care of and that commands are equipped to fulfill their missions when an unexpected loss occurs,” he said.

In January 2015, 3,335 women were pregnant aboard military vessels, representing about 14 percent of the 23,735 women then serving such duty, according to the data.

But by August 2016 that number reached nearly 16 percent, an all-time high. The Navy reported 3,840 of the 24,259 women sailors who were aboard Navy ships were pregnant.

The Obama administration understated the pregnancy problem throughout its eight years and even suppressed some data about the impact of its “gender-neutral” policies on the Navy.

For decades, for instance, the Navy published results from exhaustive surveys of 25,000 men and women in a document called the “Navy Pregnancy and Parenthood Survey.”

The reports once were 75 to 100 pages long and disclosed attitudes among men and women and their behavior. However, the Obama administration published only brief two to three-page summaries from 2012 onward.

A civilian attached to the Navy Personnel, Research, Studies and Technology group, which researched and published the surveys, told TheDCNF full reports were completed regularly even though it’s detailed findings were not released to the public. The individual requested anonymity.

“The military has been tight lipped over the years about these numbers. They don’t like to publicize them,” Eden told TheDCNF.

The Navy has been dogged for years by lingering claims that some women get pregnant simply to avoid deployment.

“We all know that happens. Women do it to avoid deployment,” Eden told TheDCNF.

“There do seem to be coincidences,” said Donnelly. “There is a lot of anecdotal evidence.”

“This information is considered so sensitive. You just don’t talk about it. And you don’t ask. It’s just something that everybody knows occurs. Don’t ask, don’t tell,” Donnelly said. She served on the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services and on the Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces.

The sudden departure of pregnant women aboard military vessels severely hurts military readiness and morale for those left behind and who must pick up the slack. The expecting sailors must be transferred from a ship after the 20th week of pregnancy.

The Navy officially considered pregnancy incompatible with military service and women who became pregnant were automatically discharged, according to The Alliance for National Defense.

However, with the introduction of the all-volunteer military, the Navy provided many lucrative incentives to men and women — including free housing, medical care, recreation and educational opportunities.

But women got additional benefits, including free prenatal care, daycare, counseling, and special education for toddlers and children with disabilities or for other “special needs.”

“Since benefits offered to recruits who are women are so very generous, it almost becomes an incentive,” said Donnelly. “One feminist advocate many years ago referred to the military as a ‘Mecca for single moms.'”

“I think there are so many carrots. The military has become a modern-day jobs program,” Eden said.

Obama during his eight years in office sought to increase dramatically the number of women on ships.

In May 2015, Admiral Michelle Howard announced a quota of 25% women on all ships. “We’re going back and looking at the ships — all of them — and what percentage of women are on the ships. Over time, we’ll modernize them to make sure we get to about 25 percent on each ship,” she said.

Former Navy Secretary Ray Mabus in September 2015 pushed the new policy, stating that the Navy SEALs and all other combat jobs in the Navy should be open to women, with no exemptions as part of the Pentagon’s new “gender-neutral” employment policy.

Eden believes the policy of increasing women on ships results in failure. “It’s bad policy when you think of ships that have to be battle-ready and then have to transfer women off for pregnancy — something that has to do with controlled behavior or voluntary behavior,” she said.

It is unclear how President Donald Trump’s Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis will handle women in the military. He has been a skeptic, but also said during his confirmation hearing he would support a combat role for women.

REVEALED: Turkey’s Plan To ‘Camouflage’ Its Lobbying Activities In The US,"The government of Turkey planned to use front groups and operatives “camouflaged” as journalists to gain access to Capitol Hill and the U.S. security apparatus, hacked emails released by WikiLeaks reveal.

The documents, which are from the Gmail account of Berat Albayrak, Turkey’s energy minister and the son-in-law of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, show the nascent plan for what has turned into a sprawling lobbying and PR campaign undertaken by the Turkish government.

Turkey’s lobbying efforts catapulted into the news last week after Donald Trump’s short-lived national security adviser Michael Flynn registered as a foreign lobbyist for Turkey.

Flynn was paid $530,000 for three months of work by Inovo BV, a Dutch shell company owned by a businessman with deep connections to Ankara.

The blueprints laid out in the Albayrak emails, released by WikiLeaks in December, show a scheme that is borderline illegal, says one analyst of Turkish politics.

“This is an attempt to infiltrate Capitol Hill and the U.S. security establishment through front organizations and lobbyists under the guise of journalism,” the analyst told The Daily Caller.

The analyst requested anonymity because of the Turkish government’s crackdown on Turkish citizens and journalists who report on the hacked emails. At least seven journalists have been jailed for doing so since the documents were released in September.

The emails, which were first released by a hacker collective called RedHack in October, are dated from 2011 and 2012, when Albayrak was CEO of Calik Holding. He has been married to Erdogan’s daughter since 2004 and has operated in the Islamist politician’s inner circle for years.

In the documents, Halil Danismaz, the recent president of the Turkish Heritage Organization, a New York-based non-profit that is strongly supportive of Erdogan, proposed to Albayrak a plan to skirt lobbying laws by hiring journalists who could obtain access to “American political and bureaucratic circles,” including members of Congress.

In one PowerPoint presentation, Danismaz refers to using a “camouflaged shell” to create a conduit for a “problem-free funds-transfer” to operate what appears to be a covert lobbying campaign.

“With this type of structure, funding regulations and tax barriers that limit lobbying activities in the US will be overcome,” reads one of the slides in the presentation, which was translated for TheDC by three separate Turkish speakers.

The setup would allow the Turkish government to obtain “first-hand” information about the “American thought structure.”

In the presentation, Danismaz estimated that the cost of the campaign would run between $1.5 million and $2.5 million each year.

One of the PowerPoints in Danismaz’s email to Albayrak proposes creating a “new media venue” which involved “hiring/paying and using prominent journalists as freelancers to have access to the administration in the American government.”

The scheme would allow the Turkish government to “circumvent tax and other impediments in the laws,” wrote Danismaz, who at the time worked for Turkish Airlines, a company which has close ties to the government.

While the Turkish government has questioned the legitimacy of the emails, WikiLeaks provides what’s called a DKIM verification for emails sent by Gmail showing that they have not been altered or edited.

Danismaz’s emails to Albayrak are verified in that manner.

“This PowerPoint is the smoking gun of Turkish government’s lobbying blueprint,” the above-mentioned analyst told TheDC in one of two phone interviews.

“It is the mental map of what eventually materialized in the lobbying effort.”

Abdullah Bozkurt, the former bureau chief of Today’s Zaman, a prominent English-language newpspaer in Ankara, says that the PowerPoints lay out how Turkish government operatives planned to “disguise” money flows for lobbying activities.

“Erdogan has planned to set up a media outlet in the U.S. to channel his influence and buy out people in important positions,” says Bozkurt, who fled Turkey last year amid Erdogan’s crackdown on critical media outlets.

“His associates probably thought disbursing lavish amount of money within the disguise of royalty payments for articles in the journal will help them recruit and enlist allies in various circles from Congress to American press.”

How Danismaz’s proposal was ultimately put into action is unknown. But several years after he exchanged the emails with Albayrak, he was appointed head of the Turkish Heritage Organization.

The group, founded in Dec. 2014, has hosted events for Erdogan, Albayrak and other Turkish government officials. It has hired firms to lobby on its behalf but has not registered as a lobbyist or foreign agent on its own despite seemingly receiving heavy input from Albayrak.

Michael Rubin, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, has argued that THO should be considered a foreign agent of Turkey because of some of the activities exposed in the emails.

“A US-based organization worked as a front for the Turkish government without a [Foreign Agent Registration Act]-registration,” Rubin wrote in November.

Danismaz left THO under unexplained circumstances after Albayrak’s emails were published.

One of the emails hacked from Albayrak’s account show what may have been behind his departure.

In a Sept. 8, 2016 email, Ibrahim Uyar, the president the Turkish American Steering Committee, told Albayrak that he and several other members of that group had been interviewed by the FBI about their work for the Turkish government.

“They are accusing me of trying to intervene in American politics on behalf of our president and working as a secret agent in the name of the Republic of Turkey,” he wrote, according to a translation from Turkish.

Danismaz, a TASC board member, was identified in the email as also being interviewed.

Neither Danismaz nor Uyar have responded to requests for comment. WikiLeaks verified the email’s authenticity using DKIM.

The Turkish government’s lobbying focus has shifted in the years since Danismaz’s emails to Albayrak.

In the past, defense issues and opposition to bills calling for the recognition of Ottoman genocide against Armenians a century ago have occupied much of the lobbyists’ attention. Now, Ankara is spending heavily to convince the U.S. government to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania.

Erdogan blames Gulen for a failed coup attempt that hit Ankara and Istanbul in July.

A law firm called Amsterdam & Partners directs most of Turkey’s Gulen efforts in the U.S. Flynn’s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, was also hired to work on the issue. Its contract called for conducting research on Gulen, with an eye on making “criminal referrals” in the matter. Flynn Intel met twice with the House Homeland Security Committee to present whatever information it had, and Flynn himself met with Albayrak and Turkey’s foreign minister in September.

Amsterdam has subcontracted with several other Beltway lobbying and PR firms over the past several years. Mercury Public Affairs, APCO Worldwide and Ogilvy all helped disseminate dirt on Gulen to various U.S. media outlets. Amsterdam recently signed with a firm called Advanced Advocacy to do similar work.

Flynn Intel subcontracted with SGR LLC., another Beltway PR firm, to create a documentary on Gulen and disseminate op-eds and other materials on the cleric. Flynn details much of that relationship to the Justice Department last week when registering as a foreign agent.

Former US Attorney: Susan Rice Ordered Spy Agencies To Produce ‘Detailed Spreadsheets’ Involving Trump,"Update: In response to a question Tuesday from NBC News reporter Andrea Mitchell, former Obama White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice denied that she “prepared” spreadsheets of surveilled telephone calls involving Donald Trump and his aides. The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group, however, reported that Rice “ordered” the spreadsheets to be produced.

In addition, former U.S. Attorney Joe DiGenova, one of TheDCNF’s sources, said Tuesday in response to Rice that her denial “would come as quite a surprise to the government officials who have reviewed dozens of those spreadsheets.”

Former President Barack Obama’s national security adviser Susan Rice ordered U.S. spy agencies to produce “detailed spreadsheets” of legal phone calls involving Donald Trump and his aides when he was running for president, according to former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova.

“What was produced by the intelligence community at the request of Ms. Rice were detailed spreadsheets of intercepted phone calls with unmasked Trump associates in perfectly legal conversations with individuals,” diGenova told The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group Monday.

“The overheard conversations involved no illegal activity by anybody of the Trump associates, or anyone they were speaking with,” diGenova said. “In short, the only apparent illegal activity was the unmasking of the people in the calls.”

Other official sources with direct knowledge and who requested anonymity confirmed to TheDCNF diGenova’s description of surveillance reports Rice ordered one year before the 2016 presidential election.

Also on Monday, Fox News and Bloomberg News, citing multiple sources reported that Rice had requested the intelligence information that was produced in a highly organized operation. Fox said the unmasked names of Trump aides were given to officials at the National Security Council (NSC), the Department of Defense, James Clapper, President Obama’s Director of National Intelligence, and John Brennan, Obama’s CIA Director.

Joining Rice in the alleged White House operations was her deputy Ben Rhodes, according to Fox.

Critics of the atmosphere prevailing throughout the Obama administration’s last year in office point to former Obama Deputy Defense Secretary Evelyn Farkas who admitted in a March 2 television interview on MSNBC that she “was urging my former colleagues,” to “get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration.”

Farkas sought to walk back her comments in the weeks following: “I didn’t give anybody anything except advice.”

Col. (Ret.) James Waurishuk, an NSC veteran and former deputy director for intelligence at the U.S. Central Command, told TheDCNF that many hands had to be involved throughout the Obama administration to launch such a political spying program.

“The surveillance initially is the responsibility of the National Security Agency,” Waurishuk said. “They have to abide by this guidance when one of the other agencies says, ‘we’re looking at this particular person which we would like to unmask.'”

“The lawyers and counsel at the NSA surely would be talking to the lawyers and members of counsel at CIA, or at the National Security Council or at the Director of National Intelligence or at the FBI,” he said. “It’s unbelievable of the level and degree of the administration to look for information on Donald Trump and his associates, his campaign team and his transition team. This is really, really serious stuff.”

Michael Doran, former NSC senior director, told TheDCNF Monday that “somebody blew a hole in the wall between national security secrets and partisan politics.” This “was a stream of information that was supposed to be hermetically sealed from politics and the Obama administration found a way to blow a hole in that wall,” he said.

Doran charged that potential serious crimes were undertaken because “this is a leaking of signal intelligence.”

“That’s a felony,” he told TheDCNF. “And you can get 10 years for that. It is a tremendous abuse of the system. We’re not supposed to be monitoring American citizens. Bigger than the crime, is the breach of public trust.”

Waurishuk said he was most dismayed that “this is now using national intelligence assets and capabilities to spy on the elected, yet-to-be-seated president.”

“We’re looking at a potential constitutional crisis from the standpoint that we used an extremely strong capability that’s supposed to be used to safeguard and protect the country,” he said. “And we used it for political purposes by a sitting president. That takes on a new precedent.”

US Soldier Killed In Afghanistan Identified As Army Ranger On His Third Deployment,"The U.S service member killed in Afghanistan on Saturday has been identified as Sgt. Leandro Jasso, 25, according to the Department of Defense.

Jasso, from Leavenworth, Washington, was an Army Ranger assigned to 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment on his third deployment to Afghanistan supporting Operation Freedom’s Sentinel.

He was killed “as a result of wounds sustained while engaging enemy forces in Khash Rod District, Nimruz Province, Afghanistan,” the Defense Department statement reads, a region the U.S. is not known to conduct many military operations, according to The Washington Post.

“The loss of Sgt. Jasso is felt by his family and loved ones, by all who served with him and by all on this mission to protect our country and our allies,” Gen. Austin “Scott” Miller, the top U.S. officer in Afghanistan said.

Jasso enlisted in the Army in 2012 and completed the Basic Airborne Course. Among his decorations are the Army Achievement Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Ranger Tab, the Combat Infantryman Badge and the Expert Infantryman Badge. (RELATED: US Service Member Killed In Afghanistan)

“Sgt. Jasso was a humble professional who placed the mission first, lived the Ranger Creed and will be deeply missed,” Lt. Col. Rob McChrystal, the commander of Jasso’s battalion, said in a statement, according to the Army Times.

Jasso’s death marks the tenth U.S. military fatality in 2018, and the second this month.

Army Maj. Brent Taylor of the Utah Army National Guard was also killed in combat in November in an apparent insider attack in Afghanistan.

Initial reports indicated that Taylor was shot and killed by a member of the Afghan security forces, according to Operation Resolute Support, the NATO training mission in Afghanistan.

"Amish Projected To Overtake The Current US Population In 215 Years, If Growth Rates Continue","The population of the Amish is projected to be greater than the current population of the United States in 215 years if the Amish growth rate, which has held constant for more than 100 years, remains the same.

Over the past 100 years, the Amish population has doubled every 19.63 years on average, according to data from Elizabethtown College.

Due in part to their opposition to modern birth control and the value they place on fertility, the Amish are one of the fastest growing populations in the world. Amish often use modern medicine and visit doctors, but some are hesitant to do so and prefer natural treatments. One study found that the Amish are less likely to seek medical care and more likely to delay care. The combination of natural fertility (fertility in a population that does not control or limit births) and modern health care results in exponential population growth. (RELATED: Study: Rare Genetic Mutation In Amish Boosts Lifespan)

The Amish have Swiss-German-Anabaptist origins and live in communities centered around church and family relationships, and are located across the United States and Canada, with heavy concentrations in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. The majority of Amish are descended from about 200 families who immigrated to the United States in the 1700s. They reject much of modern technology in a effort to live in accordance with their interpretation of scripture, and are frequently seen using horse-drawn buggies instead of cars.

On average, the Amish have families larger than the typical American family, which has 1.9 children. Demographers estimate the Amish have an average of 6-7 children per family, according to Amish America. Some more conservative Amish settlements have even higher fertility rates. The Swiss Amish settlement in Adams County, Indiana, has an average of 9 children per family, according to Thomas J. Meyers and Steven M. Nolt’s book “An Amish Patchwork.”

The population of the Amish has grown at extraordinary rates in the last century. The Amish population in 2018 was estimated to be 324,900, according to Elizabethtown College’s Amish Studies Center. Twenty years ago, the Amish population was 169,442, and twenty years prior to that, the population was 69,653. In 1901, the total Amish population in the United States was 6,300.

“They’re doubling their population about every 21 to 22 years, primarily because they produce large families and the vast majority of daughters and sons remain in the community as adults baptized into the faith, starting their own families and sustaining their religious beliefs and practices,” said Ohio State researcher Joseph Donnermeyer.

It is not possible to project the Amish population in the distant future with absolute certainty, owing to the inevitable power of change. However, population projections based on Amish growth rates sustained for over a century show the power of exponential growth.

The Amish have kept their growth rate for over 100 years, and little evidence shows this growth rate changing. If the Amish continue to grow at their current rate, then they will surpass the current United States population (327.2 million people) in 215 years, provided no other factors impact or change the current growth rate.

In 100 years, 10 million Amish people will live in the United States and Canada if Donnermeyer’s estimates of current growth continue.

One thing certain for the Amish is that young people are not abandoning their faith. Young Amish adults must choose whether or not to be baptized following their teenage years, and almost 90 percent of them choose to stay with their community, according to PBS. The Amish retention rate of 85 to 90 percent is significantly larger than the 37 percent retention rate for millennial mainline Protestants, according to the Pew Research Center.

The Amish religion stresses living in separation from the world, so as to avoid being corrupted by its influence. Ordung, the rule of the Amish church, has proscriptions on clothing, electricity, cars and telephones, and must be observed by all members of the community, lest they risk excommunication, or even shunning. For example, the Amish avoid electric power lines as they believe they make them “conformed to the world” and do not keep photographs as they believe photographs only cultivate their vanity.

Even if the Amish continue their rapid growth for only a few more decades, the Amish could impact American society more profoundly in the future as they are projected to hit one million members by 2050. As American society advances technologically, the Amish could be a growing presence that retains the past. Right alongside the rise of artificial intelligence, could be the rise of the Amish, pushing America into a divide between the past and the future.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2019/07/31/amish-population-america-growth-rates/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwicrZzLobP9AhXih1YBHe6dCr44ZBAWegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw3Ora-8oJnX9RTOywBjiXpV,2019-07-31
"Chinese Propaganda Outlet Has Paid US Newspapers $19 Million For Advertising, Printing","One of China’s main propaganda outlets has paid American newspapers nearly $19 million for advertising and printing expenses over the past four years, according to documents filed with the Justice Department.

China Daily, an English-language newspaper controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, has paid more than $4.6 million to The Washington Post and nearly $6 million to The Wall Street Journal since November 2016, the records show.

Both newspapers have published paid supplements that China Daily produces called “China Watch.” The inserts are designed to look like real news articles, though they often contain a pro-Beijing spin on contemporary news events.

One insert from September 2018 touted an initiative pushed by Chinese President Xi Jinping with the headline: “Belt and Road aligns with African nations.” The same insert ran a story titled “Tariffs to take toll on U.S. homebuyers” that asserted that U.S. tariffs on Chinese lumber would raise the cost of building homes in the United States.

China Daily also paid for advertising in several other newspapers: The New York Times ($50,000), Foreign Policy ($240,000), The Des Moines Register ($34,600) and CQ-Roll Call ($76,000).

It spent a total of $11,002,628 on advertising in U.S. newspapers, and another $265,822 on advertising with Twitter.

China Daily has also paid out more than $7.6 million to newspapers and printing companies for its newspaper for U.S.-based readers, the Justice Department’s filings show. (RELATED: PBS Stations That Received Millions In Federal Funds Partnered With Chinese Foreign Agent On Pro-Beijing Film)

The Los Angeles Times, The Seattle Times, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The Chicago Tribune, The Houston Chronicle and The Boston Globe are all listed as clients of China Daily. The Chinese outlet paid the Los Angeles Times $657,523 for printing services, according to the FARA filings.

The Justice Department has for years required China Daily to disclose its activities semi-annually under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). The most recent filing, which China Daily submitted on June 1, is the first to include detailed breakdowns of payments to American news outlets. The outlet disclosed those expenditures for the period between November 2016 and April 2020. (RELATED: Chinese Propaganda Has Influenced The Daily Mail’s Coronavirus Coverage)

It is unclear if China Daily submitted the more detailed filings under pressure from the Justice Department or on its own.

Pro-democracy groups have long warned about the Chinese government’s attempts to push propaganda through American news outlets. Freedom House and the Hoover Institution have both drawn attention to China Daily’s paid inserts in reports on the Chinese government’s efforts to influence the media.

China Daily and other Beijing-controlled propaganda mills have come under intense scrutiny amid the coronavirus pandemic. Chinese government officials have tried to divert blame for the spread of the virus to the United States and other Western nations. Many of the regime-controlled outlets, including China Daily, have echoed the communist leaders’ talking points.

China Daily has slowed its advertising expenditures in recent months, the filings show. China Daily last paid The Washington Post for advertising in December 2019. Its payments to The Wall Street Journal have been less than half their average amount since February 2020, the documents show.

China Daily did not respond to a request for comment.

US Researcher With Chinese Ties Admits He Convinced WHO Team That Missing Wuhan Lab Data Was Irrelevant,"The Wuhan Institute of Virology removed public databases in September 2019 that contained information on at least 16,000 virus samples it had studied prior to the pandemic.

The World Health Organization did not even ask to review the deleted databases during its investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic in China in early 2021.

The sole U.S. member of the WHO team said his colleagues took him at his word when he vouched for the WIV during the investigation and claimed there’s no relevant information in the deleted databases.

Dr. Peter Daszak’s involvement in the WHO probe has been described as a major conflict of interest due to his long work history and financial ties with the WIV, along with his work to suppress debate on the lab leak theory at the onset of the pandemic.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology deleted public databases containing information on at least 16,000 virus samples in September 2019, but the World Health Organization did not even request to review the data as part of their investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic in China in early 2021.

The sole U.S. member of the WHO team, EcoHealth Alliance president Dr. Peter Daszak, revealed during a panel discussion Wednesday that they did not request to see the deleted WIV databases because he personally vouched for the lab, saying the data did not contain relevant information on the pandemic’s origins.

“We did not ask to see the data,” Daszak said during a panel discussion organized by Chatham House. “A lot of this work is work that has been conducted with EcoHealth Alliance. I’m also part of those data and we do basically know what’s in those databases … I got to talk with both sides about the work we’ve done with Wuhan Institute of Virology and explained what’s there.”

“There is no evidence of viruses closer to SARS-CoV-2 than RaTG13 in those databases,” Daszak said, referring to a bat coronavirus studied by the WIV prior to the pandemic that is 96.2% similar to the virus that causes COVID-19.

Earlier in the discussion, Daszak said his work is guided by the scientific process, which, according to Dazsak, “involves looking at data, analyzing it, coming to conclusions about what it means and publishing it and making it public.”

Daszak said it was “absolutely reasonable” that the WIV took the databases down because he said he was told by his longtime colleague and the WIV’s lead Chinese researcher, Shi Zhengli, that there were “hacking attempts on it. About 3,000 hacking attempts.”



U.S. intelligence officials believe it is suspicious that the WIV refuses to allow an outside examination of its deleted databases, according to NBC News.

Daszak did not respond to a request for comment.

Daszak’s prior work and financial history with the WIV, along with his role in organizing a public relations campaign in early 2020 to paint the theory that COVID-19 could have accidentally leaked from the lab as a “conspiracy,” has been described as a major conflict of interest by U.S.-based epidemiologists and medical groups. (RELATED: The Man At The Center Of The World’s Biggest Story Has A Conflict Of Interest. Why Won’t The Media Report It?)

EcoHealth Alliance, Daszak’s nonprofit group, routed $600,000 in taxpayer funds to the WIV in form of subgrants as part of a project to study bat-based coronaviruses in China, funding that was terminated by the National Institutes of Health in May 2020.

From the onset of the pandemic, Daszak has denied he has a conflict of interest with the WIV, a claim that Rutgers University professor of chemical biology Richard H. Ebright said in April was a “brazen lie.”

“‘I have no conflicts of interest,’ said Peter Daszak” It would be hard to imagine a more brazen lie. — Richard H. Ebright (@R_H_Ebright) April 24, 2020

The WHO has defended its decision to appoint Daszak to the investigation of its COVID-9 origins despite accusations that his involvement mires the probe with major conflict of interests.

The WHO investigative panel shelved plans last week to release an interim report detailing how it concluded that it was “extremely unlikely” that COVID-19 could have accidentally leaked from the WIV. It now says that a full report on the investigation will be released “in coming weeks.”

Despite working at the onset of the pandemic to suppress debate on the lab leak theory, Daszak said former White House strategist Steve Bannon and the Chinese Falun Gong religious sect, which financially backs the Epoch Times newspaper and faces persecution from the Chinese Communist Party, are the ones responsible for China’s decision to block an outside investigation of the pandemic’s origins for over a year after the initial outbreak.

“I’ve seen incredible efforts from everything from Falun Gong to … Steve Bannon’s group pushing the conspiracy theories around China,” Daszak said during Wednesday’s panel discussion. “It’s useful to them. They’re funding it and pushing it and science has been to some extent caught up in that to other instances absolutely crushed by it.”

“We’ve not had access to work in China on the origins for the last 12 months, which is ironic because we could have been on the ground there working with our Chinese colleagues and by now we could have found some really important answers,” he said. “The rhetoric has held that up.”

"France Warned The US In 2015 About The Wuhan Lab It Helped Build, Former COVID-19 Investigator Claims","In 2015, French intelligence officials warned the U.S. State Department that China was cutting back on agreed collaboration at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a former State Department official told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

France provided the lab’s design, much of its technology, and biosafety training, a State Department cable reported in 2018.

The French government and public and private French scientific organizations gave their support to constructing the lab, the prime minister of France said at the lab’s accreditation ceremony in February 2017.

French security and defense experts did not support sharing the sensitive technology, according to the French newspaper Le Figaro.

The U.S. federal government should have stopped funding research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in 2015 when China reduced its cooperation with the French in building and operating the lab, according to the leader of an investigation into COVID-19’s origins by the State Department under the Trump administration.

In 2015, French intelligence officials warned the U.S. State Department and their own foreign ministry that China was cutting back on agreed collaboration at the lab, former State official David Asher, now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank, told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

By 2017, the French “were kicked out” of the lab and cooperation ceased, leading French officials to warn the State Department that they had grave concerns as to Chinese motivations, according to Asher.

The State Department alleged in January 2021, at the end of the Trump administration, that the Wuhan lab had engaged in classified research on behalf of the Chinese military since at least 2017.

The State Department did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

On Thursday, China said it would not allow the World Health Organization to inspect the lab further. China has blocked the WHO from accessing important records at the lab. (RELATED: China Rejects WHO Plan To Investigate The Origins Of COVID-19)

“The Chinese basically sucked State into its honey pot operation to gain access to U.S. technology, knowledge, and material support. Classic. Just as they have done in every sector,” Asher said.

Between October 2009 and May 2019, the U.S. Agency for International Development provided $1.1 million to the U.S.-based EcoHealth Alliance for a sub-agreement with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, according to USAID. EcoHealth Alliance also received funding from the Department of Defense’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency that was subcontracted to the Wuhan lab, New York magazine reported. National Institutes of Health grants to EcoHealth Alliance totaling $600,000 between 2014 and 2019 were subcontracted to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

The NIH, Defense Department and USAID should have stopped sending U.S. federal funding to the Wuhan lab back when the French warned the State Department in 2015, Asher said.

State Department officials “in charge of nonproliferation should have shut down all cooperation,” he added.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is at the center of speculation that COVID-19 may have originated from a lab accident, was initiated in 2004 as a joint project between France and China.

France provided the lab’s design, biosafety training, and much of its technology.

The French envisioned the Wuhan institute as an open and transparent lab that would serve the global scientific community in studying potential pandemics, according to a State Department cable in April 2018, citing a Wuhan-based French consulate official who worked on science and technology cooperation with China.

While top French politicians supported the collaboration, French security and defense experts did not, the French newspaper Le Figaro reported.

National security officials did not want to share sensitive technology with an oppressive country that was not an ally and they feared the lab could one day be transformed into a “biological arsenal,” according to Le Figaro.

As early as 2009, the U.S. State Department, then under former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, expressed concerns about the Wuhan lab, asking what France knew of how China planned to “vet incoming foreign researchers” and avoid technology transfer to countries of biological weapons proliferation concern, according to emails released by WikiLeaks.

The project took more than a decade to complete, and in February 2017, high-level French and Chinese officials held a ceremony to mark the lab’s accreditation.

Then-French Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said at the time that it was a celebration of Franco-Chinese scientific cooperation.

To support the China-French project, France would make its technical expertise available to China to support the continuous improvement of the laboratory’s quality and safety, Cazeneuve added.

It would also budget 1 million euros per year for five years, he said.

That would fund about 50 French scientists to help train the Chinese lab workers, the director of Inserm, a French public research organization that helped set up the Wuhan lab, told the French magazine Science & Sante in May 2017.

However, little by little, the laboratory completely escaped the control of the French scientists who were, according to an agreement between Paris and Beijing, to supervise the work of the Chinese researchers in Wuhan, according to Le Figaro. The fifty French researchers who were to work in the lab for five years never left, the newspaper reported.

In January 2018, a State Department cable warned of a lack of highly trained technicians to operate the lab in a cable first reported by The Washington Post.

The U.S. officials who had visited the lab and made the warning via the cable were not permitted to return, because they were asking “too many questions,” according to Asher.

Chinese Military Stalks US Destroyer In Taiwan Strait,"Chinese military forces reportedly stalked a U.S. Navy destroyer as it passed through the Taiwan Strait on Tuesday, according to an announcement from the People’s Liberation Army.

Colonel Shi Yi of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command announced his military was on high alert monitoring the USS Sampson guided-missile destroyer as it sailed through the Taiwan Strait, according to an official Chinese language PLA bulletin. (RELATED: China Stockpiling Nuclear Weapons At An Alarming Rate: REPORT)

“All too often the U.S. carries out such provocative operations, sending a misleading message to the ‘Taiwan Independence Faction’ in a deliberate destruction of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, which we resolutely oppose,” the colonel said, according to a Daily Caller News Foundation translation of the PLA bulletin.

The People’s Republic of China maintains that Taiwan is an “island of the motherland” and Xi Jinping has repeatedly vowed that “reunification” with Taiwan is a prerequisite for realizing the Chinese Dream of “national rejuvenation.” (RELATED: Taiwan’s Fighting Spirit: ‘Rational Assessment Does Not Favor Beijing’)

The Chinese military announced that it “likely” responded to the arrival of the USS Sampson by scrambling fighter jets and marshaling its navy, Chinese state-run media outlet, Global Times reported. The PLA dispatched two J-16 fighter jets into Taiwan’s southwest air defense identification zone on Tuesday.

PLA fighter jets violate Taiwan’s airspace on a daily basis, according to Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense.

The PLA Navy reportedly responded to the USS Sampson’s arrival by directing a guided missile frigate and an amphibious landing ship through the Miyako Strait, according to the Times report.

The Miyako Strait is located roughly between Taiwan’s northeast tip and Okinawa, Japan, a stretch of sea which The Diplomat characterizes as a “critical chokepoint for Chinese military operations.”

The USS Sampson’s freedom of navigation exercise through the Taiwan Strait was confirmed by a Tuesday announcement from the U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet.

“The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Sampson (DDG 102) conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit April 26 (local time) through international waters in accordance with international law,” the 7th Fleet reported. “The United States military flies, sails, and operates anywhere international law allows.”

The USS Sampson’s crossing was the fourth instance of a U.S. Navy vessel sailing through the Taiwan Strait in 2022, according to Stars and Stripes, a newspaper under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense.

US Falling Behind the 8-Ball: Blockchain Lessons to Learn from China,"Beijing has set itself an ambitious goal to be the world leader in blockchain technology by 2025, a mere three years away from today. In an October 2019 seminar at the Chinese Politburo, the decision-making body of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), President Xi Jinping identified blockchain as a key area of technological breakthrough for China; he was recorded as remarking that the technology was of strategic importance to the nation.

This was followed by a policy change from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), which has broad administrative & planning control over the economy of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). In April 2020, the NDRC incorporated blockchain technology into the scope of “new infrastructure development” for the first time. A year later in 2021, China’s State Council published a blueprint for the development of the national digital economy by 2025. In this plan, blockchain was once again labeled as a “key digital technology” – along with artificial intelligence, big data, and cloud computing.

This rapid pivot towards blockchain technology has been reflected in Chinese fiscal policy as well. The PRC’s central bank has embraced digital currencies, rolling out their own version often referred to as the “digital yuan.” In other practical terms, Beijing’s Blockchain Services Network (BSN), a state-backed blockchain company, announced in January 2022 that it will launch infrastructure to enable the trading of nonfungible tokens (NFTs). BSN will reportedly launch its NFT infrastructure on modified blockchains that will require verification of real user identities and create a backdoor for Chinese regulators.

The end goal for Beijing is simple, yet ambitious: to establish the PRC as the world leader in the blockchain technology industry by 2025, and to expand to a complete blockchain ecosystem by 2035.

These lofty goals are not strictly the product of so-called ‘Xi Jingping Thought’ or a desire to prove the superiority of Beijing’s political-economic model. Recent reports indicate that, across all continents, Asia stands to realize the greatest economic benefits from the expansion & utilization of blockchain technology. In terms of individual countries, blockchain could have the highest potential net benefit in China, to the tune of some $440 billion USD in terms of traceability & provenance.

Against these recent developments from China, one might have expected a mirrored behavior from Washington. However, that has not yet been the case under the current or previous administrations. Just this past March, the US’s President Biden issued an executive order regarding a ‘whole of government approach’ to the cryptocurrency industry. “The United States must maintain technological leadership in this rapidly growing space, supporting innovation while mitigating the risks for consumers, businesses, the broader financial system and the climate. And, it must play a leading role in international engagement and global governance of digital assets consistent with democratic values and U.S. global competitiveness,” a White House fact sheet announcing the directive said.

In practice, Biden’s executive order essentially mandates several federal agencies & bodies to produce various reports & answer specific questions, which may or may not be taken into consideration as his administration considers a future cryptocurrency policy. However, what cannot be overlooked is that this initial executive order signaling DC’s aims towards the blockchain sphere is solely focused on the financial aspect of blockchain technology, specifically cryptocurrency & its usage as a financial asset. The other 99% of blockchain applications have continued to fly under Washington’s radar.

Biden’s current ‘’whole of government’’ approach is not a ‘’whole of blockchain’’ approach; this is where the US is getting behind the 8-ball compared to Beijing’s more holistic, inclusive approach which focuses on the strategic application of blockchain technology in the whole of society. Xi Jingping isn’t looking to safeguard a payments system or a domestic brick-and-mortar financial industry; the PRC is developing (and implementing) a plan to utilize blockchain tech not just for domestic purposes, but as soft-power leverage.

Additionally, as mentioned earlier regarding NFTs, Chinese blockchain technology is being constructed with built-in backdoors for government access. There have been repeated, similar concerns with the usage of Chinese technology in the west regarding secret backdoors allowing the PRC to collect data & intelligence surreptitiously in everything from mobile devices to TikTok; if Chinese blockchain applications are the only options available, western consumers & governments may face the undesirable option of choosing between security & convenience.

Although the desire to maintain a unipolar world may no longer be a policy objective in Washington, and there are many lessons we can learn from the Chinese blockchain initiatives. All that is necessary is adequate government policy and smart regulation. US blockchain success will depend on a regulatory policy environment that provides clarity, allows for growth, and keeps the industry accountable. These are no-nonsense principles which should see bipartisan acceptance on both the state & federal level.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/05/24/us-falling-behind-the-8-ball-blockchain-lessons-to-learn-from-china/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwicrZzLobP9AhXih1YBHe6dCr44ZBAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw3eMrfzBadLsDgOO_m4_Ll-,2022-05-24
The US Hasn’t Built A Major Oil Refinery In Nearly 50 Years. Here’s Why,"U.S. petroleum refining capacity has declined and few plants have been built thanks to the projected decline in fuel demand and increased burdensome regulations.

“There was already some contraction happening in the industry as a result of projected declines in U.S. gasoline demand into the future and companies just deciding that the assets were better used as other projects or shut down completely,” said Geoff Moody, the vice president of government relations at the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers.

“They just throw lots of red tape at these folks,” Dan Kish, a senior fellow at the Institute for Energy Research, told The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The U.S. hasn’t constructed a major petroleum refinery since 1977 even as fuel demand and domestic oil production have surged in recent decades.

Major refinery operators have largely opted to upgrade facilities rather than construct new greenfield plants because of the projected fuel demand decline in coming years and lengthy regulatory process required for such projects, according to industry experts. There have been 14 small refineries, each processing 4,100-46,250 barrels of oil a day, constructed since Marathon Oil opened its 200,000-barrel-per-day facility in Garyville, Louisiana, in 1977.

“The COVID pandemic really drove down gasoline and diesel demand which accelerated some things that were already happening,” Geoff Moody, the vice president of government relations at the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), told The Daily Caller News Foundation in an interview. (RELATED: RUNNING ON EMPTY: America’s Diesel Stockpiles Are Rapidly Dwindling, Fuel Rationing On The Horizon)

“There was already some contraction happening in the industry as a result of projected declines in U.S. gasoline demand into the future and companies just deciding that the assets were better used as other projects or shut down completely,” Moody continued. “Some of its been very policy-driven and companies decided that it wasn’t worth it to keep operating those assets.”

The U.S. and other western nations have accelerated plans for a global green transition away from fossil fuels even as prices have skyrocketed to record levels this year. AFPM and other industry groups have urged the Biden administration to focus on long-term solutions, like boosting domestic oil production and shoring up refining capacity, amid the current energy crisis.

Global refining, which is vital for producing fuels like gasoline and diesel, decreased by 1.4 million barrels a day between 2019 and the first quarter of 2022, according to the International Energy Agency. Most of the refinery closures occurred in western countries, the data showed.

In the U.S., refineries processing a total of more than 800,000 barrels a day have closed since 2019 leaving the nation with a total operating refinery capacity of 17.7 million barrels a day, its lowest level since 2013. In addition, there are five idle U.S. refineries — the highest number since 2012 — which have a total capacity of 408,000 barrels a day, an issue the White House is reportedly considering addressing.

“Some refineries just shut down because of lack of demand, and they’re not coming back on,” Hugh Daigle, a professor of petroleum engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, told Minnesota Public Radio.

Moody, from the AFPM, added that companies have chosen to grow the footprint and throughput of existing refineries rather than make risky investments in new facilities. Refinery capacity has grown by about 3.3 million barrels per day as the number of refineries has fallen from 199 to 124 since 1985.

Dan Kish, a senior fellow at the Institute for Energy Research, blamed the decreased refinery capacity and lack of new greenfield projects on the growing number of environmental regulations and required permits.

“We’ve gone from many smaller refineries to refineries operating more efficiently and more economically,” Kish told TheDCNF in an interview. “Just like everything else, it’s very difficult to build anything or to keep anything operating in the United States where we have the strictest environmental laws in the world.”

“They keep squeezing emissions through Clean Air Act, through [the National Environmental Policy Act],” he continued. “They just throw lots of red tape at these folks and it makes it harder and harder to stay afloat.”

Since 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has entered into 37 settlements covering 112 refineries across 32 states with companies that control more than 95% of total U.S. refining capacity, according to a database of EPA enforcement actions. In March, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company agreed to make facility upgrades worth $118 million and pay a $3.4 million penalty over alleged Clean Air Act violations.

Meanwhile, a refinery being built in North Dakota, the largest greenfield refinery since the 1977 Marathon plant, began its permitting process in 2013 and isn’t expected to be completed until 2023, Forbes reported in 2020.

Another greenfield project located in Utah appears to have stalled since receiving a permit from the state’s Department of Air Quality (DAQ) eight years ago. The plant remains permitted but still hasn’t been constructed, Utah DAQ spokesperson Ashley Sumner confirmed in an email to TheDCNF.

China Fears US Military Is Secretly Training Taiwanese Forces For War Of Attrition,"Chinese state-run media alleged that the U.S. intends to covertly train Taiwan’s military in preparation for a prolonged war of attrition on Wednesday.

Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen announced that the U.S. National Guard is planning on “cooperation” with Taiwan’s military during Illinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth’s visit to Taipei on Tuesday, according to Reuters. Global Times, a Chinese state-run publication, responded by alleging that the U.S. National Guard actually aims to provide training to enhance Taiwan’s “urban warfare capability” in order to bog down the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in a war of attrition in the event of an invasion of Taiwan.

“The U.S. National Guard is a U.S. domestic armed force that deals with emergency public incident like anti-terrorism, so the focus of the cooperation between the U.S. National Guard and Taiwan’s armed forces could be urban warfare,” Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times. “The U.S. wants to enable the island of Taiwan to drag the PLA into a war of attrition using urban warfare when the PLA lands on the island.”

Characterizing U.S.-Taiwan cooperation as “collusion,” Song told the Global Times that the U.S. is allegedly sending the “wrong signal” that it supports Taiwan independence by helping Taiwan’s military “resist reunification by force.” The U.S. has also allegedly been “secretly encouraging and supporting” Taiwan independence forces, Senior Colonel Shi Yi, spokesman for the PLA Eastern Theater Command, told the Global Times.

“The United States makes available to Taiwan defense articles and services necessary to enable it to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability commensurate with [the People’s Republic of China’s] threat to Taiwan,” Lt. Col. Martin Meiners, a Department of Defense spokesman, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: ‘Meant To Intimidate’: Leaked Audio Of China’s Alleged Taiwan Invasion Plans Could Be A CCP Ploy)

The PLA reportedly “greeted” Duckworth when she arrived for her surprise visit to Taiwan on Monday by sending “at least 30 warplanes of nine different types” and then “saw Duckworth off” with a “large-scale military exercise” on Wednesday, Global Times reported.

The Chinese Embassy, the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Representative Office and Duckworth did not respond immediately to TheDCNF’s request for comment. (RELATED: China Threatens To ‘Downgrade’ Diplomatic Relations With Israel: REPORT)

US Responds To North Korean Missiles,"The United States and South Korea fired eight missiles from four different locations in the Eastern Sea during a test Monday morning, Yonhap reported.

The military tests were conducted after the South Korean military reported further North Korean short-range missile launches on June 5, according to Yonhap, a Korean news agency. The U.S. fired one missile, and South Korean forces launched seven, Yonhap reported. Pyongyang has yet to respond.

North Korea has repeatedly fired missiles into the East Sea throughout 2022. The U.S. Department of Defense labeled North Korea’s actions as threatening “the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and the Indo-Pacific region,” Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said, after a missile launch in early May.

Several other countries, including Germany and the United Kingdom, also condemned North Korean military testing in the East Sea. The ministers of the G7 countries recognized North Korea’s actions as “further blatant violation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions” and expressed their concern for international peace and security after North Korea launched an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile on May 25.

The North Korean military conducted an unprecedented amount of missile testing in 2022 with 18 recorded instances, Politico reported. This recent testing also includes the country’s first Intercontinental Ballistic Missile since 2017. (RELATED: North Korea Launches Missiles For Third Time In A Month)

The US Military Is Almost Completely Dependent On China For Key Mineral Used In Ammunition: REPORT,"The U.S. military depends almost completely on China for a mineral essential to the production of ammunition and other defense products, Defense News reported Wednesday.

The House Armed Services Committee released draft legislation on Wednesday, which would require a briefing on the antimony supply by October and a five-year outlook on supply chain vulnerabilities, Defense News reported. The U.S. has no domestic mine for the mineral antimony, which is reportedly used in the production of night vision goggles, armor-piercing bullets, explosives and nuclear weapons.

“China in particular does a remarkably good job of hoarding these materials,” Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told Defense News. “China clearly has a comprehensive global strategy to corner the market on these materials and we’re behind and we’re playing catch-up.”

In 2020, approximately half of the antimony mined originated in China, Russia and Tajikistan, according to Britannica.

Moulton and seven Republicans wrote to the defense appropriations subcommittee in April asking for an additional $264 million in funding for the National Defense Stockpile (NDS), a reserve of critical materials used in national emergencies. The letter claimed that in the last 30 years Congress had “authorized the sell-off” of the majority of the stockpiled materials.

“The current stockpile is inadequate to meet the requirements of great power competition,” the letter stated. “The NDS is no longer capable of covering the Department of Defense’s needs for the vast majority of identified materials in the event of a supply chain disruption.” (RELATED: Chinese Deploy Killer Robots In Mock Invasion Exercise, State Media Claims)

The House Armed Services Committee draft legislation follows years of widespread supply chain disruptions initially caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine further strained the supply chain, leading to a serious breakdown in the distribution of oil, grain and other goods.

The House Armed Services Committee, Moulton and the Department of Defense did not respond immediately to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment. (RELATED: China Is Secretly Building A Military Base In Key Strategic Region: REPORT)

US Ends COVID-19 Testing Requirement For International Visitors,"The Biden administration is reportedly set to announce Friday that the country is lifting its COVID-19 testing requirement for travelers heading to the U.S.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ultimately makes the decision to maintain or lift the requirement on U.S.-bound air travelers to test negative for COVID-19 before being allowed into the country. Senior administration officials told CNN that the CDC is expected to lift the restrictions at midnight on Sunday, and will reassess the decision in 90 days. Several other outlets also reported the U.S. is set to remove the testing rule.

Airlines have been lobbying the Biden administration to lift the testing requirements, blaming them for depressing ticket sales, according to Bloomberg. The travel industry and other scientific experts have said the policy has been out of date for months, and both Republicans and some Democrats have called for it to be dropped.

REPORT: Oil That Biden Released From US Strategic Reserves Ended Up In China,"Millions of barrels of oil released last month from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve by President Joe Biden went to foreign nations, including China, according to Reuters.

Biden ordered the release of 50 million barrels of oil from Strategic Petroleum Reserve in November, 30 million barrels on March 1 and 180 million barrels on March 31, saying the “historic” actions would ease the pressure faced at pumps. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve will continue to release one million barrels a day through October, even as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has fallen to its lowest level since 1986, according to Reuters. U.S. crude inventories are at their lowest since 2004, according to the report.

“These releases will put more than one million barrels per day on the market over the next six months, and will help address supply disruptions caused by Putin’s further invasion of Ukraine and the Price Hike that Americans are facing at the pump,” Biden said in April when announcing the release.

But it turns out millions of barrels have been sent to China and other nations, according to Reuters. (RELATED: Is Biden’s Mass Release From The Strategic Oil Reserves Even Legal)

Cargoes of crude oil have been shipped to the Netherlands, a Reliance refinery in India, and China, Reuters reported, citing an industry source. China and India have steadily purchased U.S. sour crude oil produced in the Gulf of Mexico, Bloomberg previously reported.

Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler, told Reuters that the release of the oil isn’t having the intended effects.

“Crude and fuel prices would likely be higher if (the Strategic Petroleum Reserve releases) hadn’t happened, but at the same time, it isn’t really having the effect that was assumed,” Smith reportedly said.

Oil and gasoline prices have increased despite the Strategic Reserve releases. Ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Energy Subcommittee Republican leader Fred Upton demanded answers from the Biden administration recently over how the releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves are giving our adversaries “geopolitical leverage.”

“China ramped up its purchases of crude oil from Russia and the United States to boost its own reserves, even as oil prices surged and President Biden called for a coordinated release,” Republican leaders wrote. “China is reportedly in talks with Russia to buy even more oil for its strategic reserves, while the United States and the E.U. pledged to ban Russian imports.”

“As a result, China may now control the world’s largest stockpile of oil, with total crude inventories estimated at 950 million barrels,” the letter continued.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/07/06/report-oil-that-biden-released-from-us-strategic-reserves-ended-up-in-china/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiJnt3KobP9AhV6pVYBHbGbDMY4WhAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw0WFQ8I-_ExaRqfF1Ype2Ez,2022-07-06
"US Army Abandons Recruitment Goals, But Not Its Woke Policies","The Army cut its force size projections for 2022 and 2023 Tuesday in the midst of a historic recruitment struggle, raising questions about overall readiness as it clings to its “woke” agenda.

The Army could miss its recruitment goal for 2022 by 25%, Army Gen. Joseph Martin, vice chief of staff for the Army, told The Associated Press. Projected end strength, the total size of the Army including active and reserve components, is set to decrease by 10,000 troops this year and an additional 14,000 to 21,000 in 2023.

“Do we lower standards to meet end strength, or do we lower end strength to maintain a quality, professional force? We believe the answer is obvious—quality is more important than quantity,” Lt. Col. Randee Farrell, spokeswoman for Army Secretary Christine Wormuth, told the AP.

Investigations into extremism in the ranks, diversity quotas, rigid vaccination mandates and other “woke” policies have undermined military recruitment by alienating families, the military’s largest recruiting market, according to Center for Military Readiness founder Elaine Donnelly. The Pentagon’s insistence on social justice over meritocracy, lowering of standards and “anti-recruiting messages” pushes away potential recruits, Donnelly told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

“Secretary Wormuth is ignoring the ‘check engine’ light on her dashboard.She keeps driving on, failing to notice how the administration’s policies are making the recruiting crisis worse,” said Donnelly. (RELATED: House Dems Hunt For ‘White Supremacy’ In Military’s Ranks)

The Army has achieved only 50% of its overall recruitment goal of 60,000 soldiers for fiscal year 2022 that ends in October, according to the AP.

The Army attained 17,800 new recruits to active duty service out of a 2002 goal of 26,000 as of April, according to data from the Department of Defense. The recruitment objective fell 20% from 2021, when by April the Army had brought on 28,000 active duty recruits, well on its way to the yearly goal of 32,000.

For comparison, by April 2017, the Army had achieved nearly 100% of its active duty recruiting goal.

Addressing ways to improve Army recruitment, Martin focused on improving climate within the service, including on issues like extremism.

“To compete for talent, the Army must provide a workplace environment free of harmful behaviors, to include sexual assault, sexual harassment, racism, extremism, and the risk factors which lead to death by suicide,” he said at a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday.

Despite force size drawdowns and plans to increase personnel spending, service leaders have argued that Congress is underfunding military readiness accounts that deal with maintenance and operations, according to House Readiness Subcommittee Chairman Republican Rep. John Garamendi of California, who spoke at the hearing Tuesday.

“On the spending issues, Congress should start asking very specific questions about the costs of LGBT mandates, experimental training like the Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) fiasco, replacements for personnel discharged due to COVID issues, etc.,” Donnelly told the DCNF. “Woke attitudes and mandates are not free.”

Germany Now ‘Hostage’ To Putin After US Poured Billions Into Defending It From Russia,"Russia’s cuts to natural gas exports have crippled Germany’s economy after a history of poorly executed climate policy.

The U.S. has invested billions in shoring up European defenses and putting pressure on Germany to boost defense spending, but Germany continued to pursue deeper ties with Russia.

“Foolish decisions by the German government have made the country hostage to Russia,” Myron Ebell, director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s Center for Energy and Environment, told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s temporary shutdown of the NordStream 1 pipeline in July sent gas prices soaring and Germany bracing for permanent energy insecurity. While the U.S. has invested heavily in Europe’s defenses as a counter to Russia, Germany could still lose out to Russia on economic terms.

The U.S. made Germany a cornerstone of its European defense, investing billions of dollars and thousands of troops to man the front lines of the Cold War against Russia over previous decades, experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation. But Germany’s botched transition to renewable energy sources has given Russia, which controls a third of Germany’s gas imports according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the power to cripple Germany’s economy and expose it to a brutal winter.

“Foolish decisions by the German government have made the country hostage to Russia,” Myron Ebell, director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s Center for Energy and Environment, told the DCNF. “Germany’s energy transition to green energy has been an incredibly expensive disaster.”

After Germany joined its Western allies in levying sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, Putin cut gas flows to Europe. Germany’s economy crumbled from the lack of access to cheap energy, sending it scrambling for alternatives, like coal and nuclear, it previously spurned. (RELATED: Putin Promises To Keep The Gas Flowing To Europe — For Now)

If Russian gas flows stop, Germany could lose up to 5% of its GDP in 2022, with losses deepening in 2023 and 2024, according to the IMF.

Failure to find a substitute for Russian gas could lead to “people freezing to death next winter, as well as industrial collapse,” Ebell said.

Germany has been reliant on Russian energy for decades, since the West German government shared its knowledge of industrial production with the former USSR in exchange for natural gas, Peter Earle, an economist at the American Institute for Economic Research, explained to the DCNF.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump had warned Germany against overreliance on Russian energy at a UN General Assembly meeting in 2018. The German delegation present mocked him.

Former chancellor Angela Merkel, known as the “climate chancellor” for her focus on reducing emissions, decided to shift away from nuclear energy in 2021, Reuters reported. Critics said this would sabotage Germany’s efforts to transition away from natural gas from Russia.

Former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder currently sits on the board of Nord Stream, a company controlled by Russia’s state-owned oil giant Gazprom, and remains unapologetic even after the invasion, The New York Times reported in April.

Given what bedwetters Germans are anyway when it comes to confronting Russia (see the existential struggle over whether to send Ukraine armoured personnel carriers), it makes more sense for Putin longer term to just keep them guessing by rattling their cage every now and again. — Matt Karnitschnig (@MKarnitschnig) July 16, 2022



So when the Russian army was amassing on the border of Ukraine in early February, Germany stalled on a decision to halt Nord Stream 2, a controversial pipeline that would bypass Ukraine to deliver Russian gas to Germany at a lower cost, Deutsch Welle (DW) reported. Germany also received widespread criticism after donating just 5,000 helmets to Ukrainian troops preparing for war.

Germany feels caught between a desire for positive relations with Russia and a need to maintain strong ties to the U.S. and other NATO states, Christopher Layne, Robert M. Gates Chair in National Security and professor at Texas A&M University, told the DCNF.

“Maintaining a cooperative relationship with Russia has been one of the cardinal aims of post-World War II German foreign policy,” Layne said. He called Germany’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine both “conflicted” and “ambivalent.”

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz ramped up Germany’s defense budget on Feb. 27, just days after Putin invaded, introducing a EUR100 billion supplemental fund and pledging to meet the minimum 2% GDP NATO spending requirement from 2022 forward. The government also authorized arms shipments to Ukraine despite the majority coalition’s prior rules against sending weapons to active conflict zones, DW reported.

But German heavy weaponry didn’t reach Ukraine until June, after it greenlighted deliveries of self-propelled antiaircraft guns in April, The Washington Post reported.

The U.S. considers Germany, the headquarters of the Army’s European Command, a key player in the anti-Russia NATO alliance, according to the State Department.

Roughly 48,000 U.S. active duty, reserve and civilian personnel were stationed in Germany as of March 2022, according to the Defense Manpower Data Center. The U.S. deployed an additional 20,000 troops to Europe between February and June 2022 to bolster NATO’s eastern flank, according to a Department of Defense (DOD) statement.

“Germany’s politicians have been pounding podiums in public but issuing no meaningful commands or actions behind the scenes,” Peter Doran, a fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies with a focus on Russia, Ukraine and transatlantic relations, told the DCNF. “Berlin has been keen to gain public approval on the world stage for its soaring rhetoric — but without reversing two decades of its colossally short-sighted pro-Russia policy.”

The German Embassy to the U.S. declined to comment, and DOD directed the DCNF to public statements. The U.S. Embassy to Germany did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder serves on the board of Nord Stream, a firm controlled by Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom, and not on the board of Gazprom itself. He declined an invitation to join the Gazprom board earlier this year.

"US Army Plans To Create A Fat Camp For Overweight, Out Of Shape Recruits","The Army announced plans Tuesday to establish a “prep course” for potential recruits who fall below the Army’s minimum academic requirements and exceed weight and body fat percentage caps amidst a historic recruiting crisis.

Created in response to a “precipitous” decline in the number of young recruits who meet the Army’s enlistment requirements, the 90-day Future Soldier Preparatory Course pilot program, which begins in August, will help prospective service members lose weight and improve their academic performance, the Army said in a statement. Only 23% of young Americans are eligible to enlist based on weight and educational metrics, according to the Army.

“This course is one of many approaches the Army is taking to invest in America’s young people,” Gen. Paul E. Funk II, commanding general of Training and Doctrine Command, said in the statement. “We have to acknowledge that society has changed and help our youth improve so they can benefit from the training and opportunities that Army service provides.”

The Army has achieved only 50% of its overall recruitment goal of 60,000 soldiers as of July, with just three months to go before the fiscal year ends in October, The Associated Press reported. The recruiting shortfall prompted officials to reduce active and reserve force size projections by 10,000 troops in 2022 and up to an additional 21,000 in 2023.

Worsening obesity and declining scores on the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) inspired the prep course, Army officials said Tuesday, according to Army Times.

Recruits still have to pass the gender-neutral Occupational Physical Assessment Test (OPAT) before entering the prep course, the Army said. Recruits who finish body fat composition between 2% and 6% higher than the accession standards will transfer into the prep course.

During the 90-day prep course, trainees will be tested every three weeks and, if they meet the required standards, will automatically ship to basic training afterward, the Army said.

“We’ll take a holistic health and fitness approach, exposing these trainees to diet, exercise, resilience and reflection while they’re here,” post commander Brig. Gen. Patrick Michaelis told Army Times.

Pride in all who serve. 🏳️‍🌈 pic.twitter.com/NqRYtK3HVc — Air Force Recruiting (@USAFRecruiting) June 17, 2022

The program has two tracks, one for physical fitness and the other for educational assistance to boost scores on the AFQT, according to the Army. AFQT scores have declined 9% since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lt. Gen. Maria Gervais said.

After exploring various explanations for the recruiting decline, including a disinterested youth market, the COVID-19 pandemic and competition with the private sector, Army leaders discovered the test score deadline was slicing off possible recruits, Gervais said. (RELATED: The Army Has Approved Just 20 Permanent Religious Vaccine Exemptions Out Of Thousands Of Requests)

Army leaders said they would not reduce standards to increase enlistment. In July, the Army scrapped an initiative allowing applicants to waive the high school diploma or GED requirements as a way to boost recruitment, just a week after announcing the plan.

Military and civilian instructors would focus on “teaching” students rather than subjecting them to the harsher treatment experienced at basic training, said Michaelis.

The program will cost $4 million in 2022, according to Federal News Network.

The Army did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

"CCP-Linked TikTok To Crack Down On Election ‘Misinformation’, Partners With US Gov","TikTok, a social media giant with ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), announced Wednesday it is partnering with a U.S. government organization and ramping up efforts to combat “harmful misinformation” on the app in preparation for the November midterm elections.

TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has faced scrutiny and ban threats from regulators and U.S. politicians for its potential ties to the CCP; Chinese employees at ByteDance reportedly enjoy full access to data from U.S. devices, according to a June BuzzFeed investigation, and many ex-Chinese state media employees work or have worked at the company.

The platform said that it may ban users who post content that spreads “misinformation” about how to vote or threatens election officials; it will also partner with Federal Voting Assistance Program, a U.S. government organization that assists overseas voters, according to a company press release. (RELATED: TikTok Intentionally Downplayed Ties To China, Documents Reveal)

The short-form video app will also prevent content creators from posting political advertisements, expanding upon the company’s original 2019 ban on paid political messaging and preventing political action committees from circumventing TikTok standards by paying an individual, according to a company press release.

TikTok is also launching an in-app election center to inform its users of voting information; users will be able to access state-by-state election information, provided by TikTok’s partner the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), according to the press release. NASS will provide information on how to register to vote, how to vote by mail and where to find polling sites.

TikTok is also working alongside non-governmental voter assistance organizations that target specific demographics and the Restore Your Vote program, which will assist voters with prior convictions, as well as the Campus Vote Project, which will help college students vote.

In order to bolster its efforts to monitor content in time for the midterms elections, TikTok will collaborate with independent intelligence firms and authorized fact-checking groups to evaluate videos and respond to misinformation. The firm said that these measures were spurred on by the lessons it learned from the 2020 election.

TikTok did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Biden Admin Moves To Fund Canadian Mines While Blocking US Mining Efforts,"The Biden administration is considering funding the Canadian mining and metal industry as it is desperate to acquire more rare earth minerals to build renewable energy technologies; however, the administration has previously blocked the development of U.S. mining efforts, according to E&E News.

Following the passage of the Democrats’ massive climate spending package, the Biden administration is looking to import critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt and nickel and may even give money to the Canadian mining industry to acquire such minerals and help push mineral supply chains out of Chinese hands, according to E&E News. Although it is desperate to produce these minerals and confront the Chinese dominance of the mineral market, the administration has blocked major mining projects in Minnesota and Alaska. (RELATED: Environmentalists Are Holding Up A Key Part Of Biden’s Climate Agenda)

“The Department of The Interior is not for development of any kind … whether its mining or oil and gas,” Steve Milloy, a member of former President Donald Trump’s EPA transition team, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Canada has courts and climate activists and does not the same ability to undercut China’s slave labor and therefore, the plan has serious limitations.”

The move to acquire minerals from outside the U.S. comes amid the Biden administration’s repeated efforts to prevent domestic mining developments. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced in May that it would review a proposal that dealt a significant blow to the Pebble Project, an Alaska mining project that would produce about 1.5 billion tons of critical minerals over 20 years. Additionally, Biden’s Interior Department (DOI) canceled two mineral leases belonging to the Twin Metals Mine in Minnesota in January, halting the mine’s construction.

Canada may benefit from Biden’s Defense Production Act funding for specific mining activities that support the production of “clean energy” technologies like electric vehicles and solar panels, despite the fact that the act stipulates that funding for defense projects must only come from domestic sources, according to E&E News. However, Canadian businesses are considered to be domestic sources, according to a June White House report.

“China still controls most of the processing for these minerals,” Milloy added. “How green is it to send Canadian minerals to be processed in China.”

China’s share of worldwide mineral refining is around 35% for nickel, 50-70% for lithium and cobalt, and nearly 90% for rare earth elements, according to a 2021 IEA report.

American companies are attempting to mine for important minerals like cobalt, graphite, and nickel; however, it is not known whether there are enough metal reserves in the U.S. to meet the massive mineral demand needed, according to E&E News.

“Growing global demand will force the world to rely on China… it is impossible for Canadian or U.S. production to catch up as China will continue to undercut them,” Milloy stated.

The DOI and White House did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

"US Likely To Go To War With China In The Next Decade, Experts Say","China will likely attack Taiwan in the near future, triggering a broader conflict involving the U.S., experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The outcome of such a conflict is uncertain, as neither side has experience with or adequate capabilities for the kind of warfare required to win, and threat of escalation is high.

“Washington and Beijing are caught in a downward spiral of each believing the other side is bent on changing the status quo and each trying to dissuade further movement with shows of force and determination,” Denny Roy, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, told the DCNF.

The U.S. and Chinese militaries will clash over a Chinese campaign to take over Taiwan in the near future, experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

China’s unequivocal determination to fully integrate Taiwan with the mainland is compounding U.S. fears of growing Chinese threats to itself and key East Asian allies, setting both sides on a risky path to kinetic conflict, according to experts on defense and China/Taiwan issues. A majority of Americans expect war within the next decade, one that experts said could widen beyond repelling a Taiwanese invasion and test the limits of each side’s naval and aerial capabilities.

“Washington and Beijing are caught in a downward spiral of each believing the other side is bent on changing the status quo and each trying to dissuade further movement with shows of force and determination. There’s a moderate risk of war, even though neither side wants it,” Denny Roy, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, told the DCNF.

China has not put forth clear conditions for invading Taiwan, although a Taiwanese declaration of independence would almost certainly trigger the move, according to David Sacks, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

In 2005, China promulgated the Anti-Secession Law that laid out plans for “peaceful reunification” with Taiwan but also provisioned “vague” circumstances that would justify use of force.

“Peaceful ‘reunification‘ is increasingly a fantasy,” Sacks told the DCNF. Given decreasing appetite in Taiwan to join the mainland, increasing warmongering rhetoric from Beijing and Chinese President Xi Jinping’s tightening window as China’s premier, China will not likely relinquish its claim over Taiwan. (RELATED: China Walks Back Promise Not To Use Force In Taiwan ‘Reunification’)

“China wants it more,” Roy told the DCNF.

Tensions have escalated following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan laid bare tensions between the U.S. and China over the island’s status. China staged its largest ever military exercises around Taiwan in response, claiming the visit violated its sovereign claim to the island, while the U.S. deployed a naval carrier group to patrol the same waters.

The PLA told citizens to “prepare for war” ahead of Pelosi’s trip. However, Xi gave a similar order in 2012, giving former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian affairs David Stilwell some reassurance that open conflict could be avoided.

Stilwell told the DCNF that China has not “boxed itself in” to kinetic action against Taiwan. Instead, the most severe challenge from China will stem from its invasion of U.S. media space, “creating friction… division and discontent” within the U.S. Fomenting “civil war” in an adversary is one of the oldest strategies in the Chinese geopolitics handbook.

China “has been conducting political warfare against the United States nonstop since 1979,” said Stilwell. “If we were to do to them what they are doing to us, if we were to actively destabilize the party — which we can do… they would consider that an act of war.”

Furthermore, China lacks “escalation controls,” or the ability to maintain parameters of the initial war effort and keep it from transforming into a broader campaign, Stilwell said.

For example, during the military drills, PLA rockets penetrated Japan’s special economic zone. Experts agreed that the Chinese Peoples’ Liberation Army (PLA) would attack Japanese targets as part of the invasion.

While the U.S. maintains a policy of “strategic ambiguity” toward Taiwan and has not guaranteed protection in the event of an invasion, Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to defending Japan in a meeting with Japanese leaders Friday. A strike on Japanese territory would therefore pull the U.S. into open conflict with China.

Both sides would incur heavy losses in such a conflict, a Center for Strategic and International Studies war game simulating a U.S. and Taiwanese joint attempt to repel a Chinese invasion showed, The Wall Street Journal reported on Aug. 9.

“Neither military has fought a war with a peer or a near-peer military,” Sacks told the DCNF.

One one hand, the U.S. has a “qualitatively superior” military capability and nuclear primacy, as well as meaningful control over the global financial system, Sacks explained. On the other, China enjoys a home base advantage, the ability to control the narrative and massive munitions stores.

The U.S. also has a geographic disadvantage — the closest U.S. military installments to Taiwan are in Japan, over a thousand nautical miles away — and inadequate munitions stocks, Roy said. Taiwan itself has been slow to address its deficiencies in defense spending and troop readiness.

Much of what the U.S. is able to do in the Asia Pacific is contingent on what Japan will allow the U.S. to do in and near Japanese territory, said Sacks. In addition, the U.S. has worldwide defense commitments, while China can afford to concentrate forces on Taiwan.

After the U.S. ceased arms sales to China in 1989, a reaction to the Tiananmen Square massacre, the Chinese defense ministry began reverse engineering U.S. military hardware, Popular Mechanics reported. China’s J-20 stealth fighters suspiciously resemble the U.S.’ F-22, and their Y-20 transport aircraft is an “almost exact knockoff” of the U.S.’ C-17, according to Stilwell.

China’s longstanding practice of exploiting arms transfers and stealing sensitive technology via widespread espionage networks affords China capabilities beyond what it is technologically capable of — but that’s not totally bad for the U.S., Stilwell told the DCNF.

“They will be able to match what we do best because they don’t understand all the technology or the thought process,” Stilwell explained.

In addition, the rampant corruption hamstrung the PLA’s modernization drive, forcing Xi to ramp up anti-corruption activities and ideological indoctrination, according to Stilwell. PLA soldiers are required to study and test on “Xi Jinping thought.”

“They’re losing hours each day that they’re not spending studying their aircraft, their weapons and their art,” he added.

“If they start something, they probably won’t finish it, but they’re going do a lot of damage,” said Stilwell. “So how do you get the PLA to understand they’re not as good as they think they are?”

Pacific Island Country Bars US Ship From Docking Months After Signing Pact With China,"The Solomon Islands prevented a U.S. Coast Guard ship from docking for routine refueling, just months after the strategic island chain signed a security pact with China that could edge out U.S. influence in the region.

The U.S. Coast Guard vessel Oliver Henry requested diplomatic permission to dock in the port at Honiara on Aug. 23, but the Solomons did not respond, according to Axios. The Solomons imposed a moratorium on entry for all naval vessels regardless of their country of origin while authorities resolved issues in the approval system Tuesday, refuting “misinformation” in foreign media that the islands had deferred to China by blocking the Oliver Henry, according to a statement.

“We’ve seen the Chinese try to bully and coerce nations throughout the Indo-Pacific to do their bidding and to serve what they believe their selfish national security interests are rather than the broader interests of a free and open Indo-Pacific,” White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby said, according to Axios, referring to China’s behavior broadly. (RELATED: China’s Neighbors On Red Alert Over Beijing’s Military Build-Up)

China signed a policing agreement with the Solomons in March, giving China a role in the Solomons’ internal security formerly held by Australia, per a 2018 pact, Reuters reported. China has similar security agreements with other islands in the south Pacific region, including Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Tonga and Vanuatu, according to CNA.

China and the Solomons also signed a security cooperation agreement that could allow for the islands to host Chinese warships and possibly military bases, according to a leaked draft, worrying both the U.S. and Australia, The Associated Press reported.

Solomon Islands authorities claimed a communications delay between the ship and the Office of Prime Minister caused the approval to be issued after the ship had departed, even though the prime minister had granted permission for the Oliver Henry to participate in the FFA Island Chief operation to monitor illegal fishing on Aug. 20.

“We have requested our partners to give us time to review and put in place our new processes before sending further requests for military vessels to enter the country,” Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said.

Problems with foreign military vessels entering Solomons waters without permission also prompted the moratorium, according to the Solomons government.

The Solomons are “the stepping stones to East Asia,” former National Security Council director for Oceania and Indo-Pacific security Alex Gray told Axios. “If the Chinese gain sway in any of them, it changes the entire contour of what the U.S. and Australia and our allies can do in the entire region,” Gray said.

Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and U.S. Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy traveled to the Solomons earlier in August officially to commemorate the Battle of Guadalcanal, when Allied forces fought to retain control of the strategic island chain in World War II, Axios reported.

The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s requests for comment.

US Military Running Low On Ammo After Arming Ukraine,"Pentagon officials are concerned that U.S. ammunition stocks donated to Ukraine have severely depleted U.S. stocks, weakening U.S. readiness in the event of a conflict, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.

The Biden administration has drawn much of the over $13 billion in weapons systems and accompanying ammunition the U.S. has provided to Ukraine from existing arsenals, according to the WSJ. While the Department of Defense has declined to disclose the number of ammunition rounds in storage at the beginning of 2022, before the war in Ukraine began, it has taken few steps to replenish depleting stocks, sparking worries that the U.S. may not have the ammunition it needs for its own protection.

The level of 155mm combat rounds, fired by the howitzer weapons system, in U.S. stockpiles has become “uncomfortably low,” a Pentagon official told the WSJ. The U.S. has sent 806,000 rounds of the 100-pound explosives to Ukraine as of Aug. 24.

“It is not at the level we would like to go into combat,” the defense official told the WSJ. U.S.-supplied howitzers have seen extended use from Ukrainian forces since entering the conflict in late May, Fox News reported. (RELATED: Ukrainian Military Says Long-Awaited Counterattack Has Begun)

Last week, the U.S. provided smaller 105mm ammunition to feed Ukraine’s howitzers in order to spare 155mm rounds for the U.S., according to the WSJ. The U.S. military most recently employed howitzers in a strike on Iran-backed targets in Syria on Aug. 24.

Depleting U.S. arsenals “was forewarned, including from industry leaders to the Pentagon. And it was easily fixable,” Mackenzie Eaglen, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told the WSJ.

The Army plans to conduct a “deep dive” into the “ammunitions industrial base” to determine the best way to support Ukraine while retaining necessary supplies for the U.S., Army officials told the WSJ. It has requested an additional $500 million yearly for upgrades to ammunition factories and increasing the threshold on existing production contracts, but has not signed any new contracts.

Officials also said that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley authorized monthly reviews of U.S. weapons stores to monitor readiness. However, defense industry leaders said the administration has not clearly communicated the changes in production requirements brought on by U.S. assistance to Ukraine and has not expanded production capacity to make up for the additional munitions needed to replenish stocks.

The Biden administration has requested a record $773 billion defense budget for 2023. While additional funding can alleviate part of the problem, ongoing supply chain issues can make the months or years-long manufacturing process take even longer, according to the WSJ.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s requests for comment.

Yellen Says US Economy Is Stronger Than Before The Pandemic,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, speaking at a Ford electric vehicle center in Michigan Thursday, said that despite high inflation, current economic conditions were much better than could have been predicted even prior to the pandemic.

Yellen claimed that “by any traditional metric,” the U.S. has undergone one of the quickest economic recoveries in modern history, according to a prepared transcript of her remarks. However, since gross domestic product (GDP) has declined for the past two quarters, the country is currently experiencing a recession, according to a widely accepted “rule of thumb” amongst economists defining a recession as two consecutive quarters of declining GDP. (RELATED: It’s Official: Revised GDP Numbers Show The Economy Is Definitely Shrinking)

“Our plan has worked,” said Yellen, touting the American Rescue Plan and the administration’s vaccination campaign. “Household balance sheets are strong. Businesses continue to invest. Our broad and inclusive recovery has outpaced that of many other large economies.”

On Thursday, the Federal Reserve announced that the outlook for future growth in the U.S. was “generally weak,” in its regular report on the nation’s economic health known as the Beige Book. Nearly half of the regional banks managed by the Federal Reserve reported contractions to their regional economies, with the same amount reporting slight to modest growth.

Yellen’s speech in Detroit tries to place recent legislation into a new model of “modern supply-side economics.” — Ylan Q. Mui (@ylanmui) September 8, 2022

Yellen said that the Federal Reserve had the “primary role” in fighting inflation, but the administration was making “a meaningful difference.” Yellen acknowledged that the pain felt by inflation was “personal” to most people, and cited efforts such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) as examples of efforts made by the Biden administration to combat inflation.

While the administration has taken credit for lowering gas prices through the release of oil from the SPR, the U.S. government will likely have to refill the SPR at a loss of around $30 per barrel. Media outlets from across the political spectrum have also cast doubt on the Inflation Reduction Act’s ability to reduce inflation.

Yellen also stressed “economic fairness,” highlighting in particular a “national imperative to increase the affordability of housing.”

“Simply put, it should be easy – not hard – to put a roof over your head,” she said. “Even as the Administration’s policies prevented the tsunami of pandemic-related evictions that we had feared, we must continue advancing our coordinated government approach to expand the supply of housing.”

Only 6% of the more than 3,300 emergency housing vouchers distributed by the Biden administration’s Department of Housing and Urban Development to Los Angeles to help with its housing crisis have been leased, The Los Angeles Times reported in July. Nationwide, only 38% of 70,000 vouchers had been leased.

The cost of shelter has increased 5.7% year-on-year through July, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

US Embassy In Russia Urges Americans To Leave The Country While They Still Can,"The U.S. Embassy in Moscow warned U.S. citizens to leave Russia as soon as possible in an advisory sent out Tuesday.

The advisory cites Russia’s partial mobilization on Sept. 21 as the reason for issuing the advisory, suggesting that Moscow may attempt to draft American citizens living in or traveling to the country. The embassy’s ability to provide services for U.S. citizens and assist with transportation out of the country is extremely limited and could become even more restricted without warning, according to the advisory.

“Russia may refuse to acknowledge dual nationals’ U.S. citizenship, deny their access to U.S. consular assistance, prevent their departure from Russia, and conscript dual nationals for military service,” the advisory stated.

The advisory noted that commercial flights out of the country have become extremely difficult to secure on short notice.

“If you wish to depart Russia, you should make independent arrangements as soon as possible,” the alert warned.

Authorities have also arrested U.S. citizens participating in protests against the authoritarian government’s widely condemned invasion of Ukraine, according to the embassy.

“We remind U.S. citizens that the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression are not guaranteed in Russia. Avoid all political or social protests and do not photograph security personnel at these events,” the advisory stated.

The Polish embassy also issued a statement Tuesday local time advising citizens to leave Russia as soon as possible and avoid travel to the country due to “Russian authorities recognizing Poland as a hostile state,” TVP World reported.

The State Department did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s requests for comment.

"For The First Time, Conservative Think Tank Ranks US Military As ‘Weak’","The U.S. military earned a rating of “weak” for the first time since the inauguration of the Heritage Foundation’s annual Index of U.S. Military Might, according to the report released Tuesday.

Under the Biden administration’s leadership focus on other domestic priorities, the military’s ability to meet rising threats abroad has severely declined, the report found.

“There has been a distraction from warfighting as the focus and purpose of the United States military in recent years,” Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The U.S. military deserves a rating of “weak” for the first time, according to Heritage Foundation’s annual analysis of American military might, released Tuesday.

The appraisal was given after the organization found the U.S. military lacks the capacity to manage a major war and attend to its smaller commitments across the globe at the same time. As adversaries such as China and Iran are improving their forces to threaten U.S. interests in the world, the military has seen an “erosion” of strength across all the services exacerbated by the Biden administration’s hyper-focus on domestic priorities, the think tank alleged in the 2023 Index of U.S. Military Strength.

“Biden’s reckless, naive foreign policy continues to embolden our adversaries, while his domestic agenda undermines the strength of our military,” Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts said in a statement. “There is no question that under his failed leadership the strength of our military has hit an all-time low.”

Degradation in the military’s capacity, capabilities and readiness for the first time became so extensive that the “military’s ability to fulfill its primary mission is in jeopardy,” according to a press release.

Of the services, only the Marine Corps earned a score of “strong,” while the U.S. nuclear deterrent also received a “strong” rating. The remaining services — Army, Navy, Air Force and Space Force — all earned a score of “marginal” or worse, with the Air Force ranking as “very weak,” the lowest possible score.

No service was seen as “very strong.”

The Air Force and the Navy have seen the greatest decline since 2022, according to the report. That has lawmakers concerned, as a conflict with China would involve those two services predominately, Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin explained to the DCNF. (RELATED: Biden’s New China Strategy Is Hamstrung By Competing Democratic Priorities, Experts Say)

One of the main culprits for the military’s plummeting strength levels is funding, according to the report. The military has lost $59 billion between 2018 and 2023 as a result of budget cuts and inflation, which has reached historic levels under the Biden administration.

The White House requested a $773 defense budget for fiscal year 2023. Despite promising to be the largest dollar amount in history, it fails to keep pace with the current rate of inflation.

“It kneecaps us from the start,” Gallagher said.

In addition, the Biden administration’s defense leaders have elevated issues like climate change and “divisive” ideology to the forefront of national security policy, crowding out needed investment in other military priorities, Roberts said in the statement.

Top echelons of Department of Defense leadership have seen a “distraction from warfighting as the focus and purpose of the United States military in recent years,” Gallagher said to the DCNF.

“That’s a harder thing to quantify — it doesn’t lend itself to sort of a number on a chart — but I think it’s evident in a variety of peacetime accidents that we’re seeing, a lot of controversial issues that I believe are contributing to our recruitment crisis” and the “perceived politicization of our general flag officers,” he added.

The administration’s insistence on “integrated deterrence” — that is, prioritizing other forms of American power to prevent wars — has undermined the U.S. ability to accomplish defense objectives, according to Gallagher. However, integrated deterrence fails if the military cannot present a credible threat, particularly to adversaries like China, whose rapid modernization agenda and increasingly aggressive behavior suggest an imminent confrontation with the U.S. or allies.

“If the military loses focus on its sole purpose, why do you have one?” retired Lt. Col. Dakota Wood, Heritage senior research fellow and editor of the Index, told the DCNF.

Heritage creates the Index using data from public sources to inform lawmakers on the state of the military and its major challenges, according to Wood.

The index analyzes the U.S. military’s posture against the geopolitical environment, focusing on areas such as China and the Middle East where U.S. vital interests are at stake. Each service is assigned a score for “capacity” to address the range of magnitude of issues facing the U.S.; “capability,” or use of modern technology; “readiness” and “overall.”

“We have not reviewed the report and do not have a comment to provide on the index,” said Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, a spokesman for the Air Force. “The U.S. military is the strongest fighting force the world has ever known. Every day around the globe, the men and women of our Armed Forces safeguard vital U.S. national interests by backstopping diplomacy, confronting aggression, deterring conflict, projecting strength, and protecting the American people.”

US Mulls Teaming Up With Taiwan To Produce Weapons: REPORT,"The White House is in talks with Taiwanese leaders to jointly produce U.S.-designed weapons to deter and defend against a potential Chinese invasion, Japanese outlet Nikkei reported Wednesday.

While discussions remain in their early stages, officials will likely reach a deal by 2023 that involves technology transfers from U.S. contractors to Taiwanese manufacturers or U.S.-based assembly of weapons using Taiwan-made parts, Nikkei reported, citing three officials familiar with the discussions. The unusual move comes amid high-level warnings that China plans to imminently invade Taiwan while the U.S. and allies run low on weapons and ammunition.

Taiwan has never co-produced munitions or weapons platforms with the U.S., a representative from the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council told Nikkei. Only the Hsiung Feng II and III missiles utilize U.S. technology in their production. (RELATED: Pentagon To Speed Up Weapons Sales To Allies As US Struggles To Maintain Its Own Stocks)

Prior U.S. administrations have resisted cooperation with Taiwan on defense production despite the U.S. standing pledge to provide the autonomously-governed island everything it needs to defend itself against China, Nikkei reported. One reason is fear that transfer of sensitive technology intended to give the U.S. military a competitive advantage over its rivals could leak to adversaries.

“This is going to take some time to really shake out,” a source told Nikkei.

However, the co-production plan could expedite arms transfers to Taiwan in the longer term after the Senate appeared to have struck out a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act that would require U.S. defense contractors to prioritize Taiwanese orders, Defense News reported Monday.

Typically, arms sales can take up to a decade between the initial request and final delivery, according to Nikkei.

The future of Taiwan must be determined peacefully, democratically, and only by the people of Taiwan. Full stop. — 王定宇 Wang Ting-yu, MP (@MPWangTingyu) October 16, 2022

The war in Ukraine has severely depleted U.S. stocks of air defense systems and accompanying ammunition that Taiwan would use to repel a Chinese aerial attack. Stinger missiles and HIMARS launchers are also in limited supply due to supply chain knots and materials shortages, and defense contractors have warned they may not be able to surge production to meet needs for Ukraine and Taiwan, Defense News reported.

However, Lockheed Martin pledged Tuesday to boost HIMARS production, Politico reported.

The U.S. has “pretty much run out of 155 millimeter Howitzers and 155 millimeter ammunition,” Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, previously told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Taiwan’s defense ministry planned to receive a shipment of stingers by March 2026, HIMARS in 2027 and Harpoon anti-ship missile systems in 2028, while it may cancel an order for howitzers altogether, Nikkei reported.

Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping is pushing the Chinese military to reach a state of readiness to invade Taiwan by 2027, despite alleging he will prioritize a “peaceful reunification.”

At least 10 arms sales to Taiwan worth $13 billion remain backlogged since 2019, Nikkei reported, citing internal U.S. documents.

The National Security Council and office of the Taiwanese president did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

HANKE And HOFMANN: How The Federal Reserve Destroyed The US Economy,"Editor’s note: This article has been updated.

According to the Federal Reserve, the White House, and the media, the U.S. inflation mess, or, as President Joe Biden likes to call it, “Putin’s Price Hike,” can be attributed to supply chain glitches, corporate greed, the war in Ukraine and so on and so forth.

Remember, they even told us that inflation would be transitory. Officialdom has it all wrong. Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. (RELATED: FURCHTGOTT-ROTH: Biden’s Tales Of An Economic ‘Recovery’ Don’t Mesh With Reality)

With the onset of the pandemic, federal spending and the deficit exploded. Most of it was monetized by the Fed. Consequently, the money supply ballooned. From February 2020 to its peak in March 2022, broad money (M2) grew by an unprecedented, cumulative 41%.

As a result of this unchained monetary growth, U.S. inflation peaked at 9.1% per year in June 2022, the highest rate in 40 years. Inflation has remained persistent, coming in at 8.2% per year in September.

None of the 416 economists employed at Fed headquarters in Washington, D.C., where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a ratio of 48.5 to 1, were able to anticipate the surge in inflation.

Yet in July 2021, one of us (Hanke) and John Greenwood were the first and only economists to accurately predict our inflation debacle. They wrote in the Wall Street Journal on July 21, 2021, that the “year-over-year inflation rate will be at least 6% and possibly as high as 9%.”

How were they able to hit the bullseye, while the “experts” at the Fed dropped the ball? Because Hanke and Greenwood used the Quantity Theory of Money, a theory which states that there’s a strong relationship between the growth in the money supply and inflation.

But, without offering a scintilla of evidence, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and the blind oracles at the Fed, as well as the chattering classes in Washington and elsewhere, have gone out of their way to cancel the Quantity Theory of Money.

Indeed, in an interview at the Cato Institute in September, Powell said that “Monetary aggregates don’t play an important role in our formulation of policy. And we don’t think they are generally a good way to think about policy or inflation.” Interestingly, Powell is doing nothing more than following the lead of President Biden, who boasted in 2020 that the dean of monetarism, Milton Friedman, “isn’t running the show anymore.”

To rein in what has become the Fed’s persistent inflation, it thinks that increased interest rates, coupled with quantitative tightening (read: a shrinkage in the Fed’s balance sheet), are just what the doctor ordered.

Not surprisingly, the Federal Open Market Committee just hiked the federal funds rate again by 0.75 basis points. This is nothing more than misguided monetary policy. As Friedman put it, “Monetary policy is not about interest rates; it is about the growth of the quantity of money.”

So, let’s take a look at what the Fed is ignoring: the money supply. As it turns out, back in March 2022, the Fed switched the “printing presses” into reverse.

As a result, the money supply measured by M2 has contracted by 1.1% since its peak in March, something that’s been unprecedented since 1948, the last time a sustained money supply contraction occurred. Prior to 1948, the only notable sustained contractions of the money supply occurred in 1929-32 and 1937. In those cases, when the money supply contracted, the economy slumped.

Since the Fed has indicated that it will continue shrinking its balance sheet at a rapid pace, we can expect a continued contraction. This means that, thanks to the Fed’s incompetence, a U.S. recession for 2023 is baked in the cake.

But, you wouldn’t know it by listening to the sweet nothings coming out of the White House.

Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese tells us that the U.S. has the “strength and resilience” to avoid a recession. Like the Fed, it’s clear that the White House has also cancelled the Quantity Theory of Money and has suicidally turned a blind eye to the money supply.

"US Needs Afghanistan Watchdog, Experts Say, After Biden Admin Obstructs Accountability Efforts","The Biden administration is stonewalling the independent Afghanistan watchdog organization authorized by Congress in 2008, experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Executive agencies argued that their efforts fall outside of SIGAR’s mandate, but experts disagreed, saying the organization is vital for accountability.

“The bottom line is that institutions don’t like to be held accountable, but the American people deserve oversight,” Adam Weinstein, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft who served in Afghanistan as a U.S. Marine, told the DCNF.

The U.S. still needs the Afghanistan watchdog organization despite recent Biden administration efforts to thwart ongoing investigations into the White House’s military withdrawal and ongoing assistance to the country, experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The watchdog’s latest quarterly report alleged the Biden administration agencies refused to comply with requests for information, threatening to nullify the organization’s mission to provide oversight of past and ongoing reconstruction projects. However, the Special Investigator General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, will remain vital until the U.S. ceases sending aid to the Taliban-controlled country, experts told the DCNF.

“The Biden administration is attempting to bypass SIGAR, without a doubt,” Foundation for Defense of Democracies senior fellow Bill Roggio told the DCNF, adding that Biden’s ongoing push to reengage with Afghanistan is “politically unpopular, so it’s tempting to hide.”

The administration is “invested in continuing to cover up the true costs of their disastrous withdrawal last year. This could be an important stepping off point for hearings and investigations by the new Congress,” Simone Ledeen, former senior U.S. Treasury representative to NATO’s International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, said to the DCNF.

Executive agencies, particularly the Treasury Department and United States Agency for International Development (USAID), refused to provide requested documents related to $1.1 billion in humanitarian aid distributed to Afghanistan since the Biden administration’s withdrawal in Aug. 2021, SIGAR claimed in the report. The State Department complied with a limited number of requests, concealing key details.

Congress authorized SIGAR in 2008 to account for waste, fraud and abuse relating to millions in aid sent to rebuild Afghan society during the U.S.’ 20-year war against the Taliban.

The executive agencies’ decision to obstruct the desired information release violates SIGAR’s congressional mandate and undermines the American people’s interests, watchdog head John Sopko said in the preface to the report. (RELATED: The US Military Now Has Troops In Ukraine To Track Billions Of Donated Weapons)

The agencies are “only going to release information that makes them look good, and they’re going to hide information that they don’t like,” Daniel Davis, a researcher at Defense Priorities who served in Afghanistan and blew the whistle on senior military leaders’ misrepresentation of the war’s progress, told the DCNF. “No matter what the reality was, the message to all the American people would get would be, ‘This is great, it’s going good, everything’s working and it’s a success,’ and we’ll have no way to independently verify that.”

Top Republican lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee on Monday called on SIGAR to shed further light on State Department and USAID obstruction efforts in a letter. Among other things, the lawmakers requested SIGAR come forth with comments it claimed to have received from a State Department official that the agency prohibited staff from communicating with investigators without approval from the State Department’s legal advisers.

“The Biden Administration is seeking to avoid transparency, and therefore, accountability for its deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan,” Ranking Member James Comer and National Security Subcommittee head Glenn Grothman wrote in the letter.



“The Biden Administration’s ongoing obstruction is unacceptable and potentially illegal,” the lawmakers added.

SIGAR is complying with the requests made in the letter, a SIGAR spokesperson told the DCNF.

“Treasury has complied with all legal requirements and shared information with SIGAR,” a Treasury Department spokesperson told the DCNF.

A USAID spokesperson argued that any donations since fall outside the realm of “reconstruction” assistance SIGAR was stood up to monitor.

“Nonetheless, since August, USAID has continued to cooperate and provide information to SIGAR, with upwards of 25 evaluations, audits and other engagements,” the spokesperson said.

As part of the 2022 budget process, SIGAR requested an expansion of its mandate from “reconstruction” to “reconstruction, humanitarian, and other development assistance” for Afghanistan, a State Department spokesperson told the DCNF.

“That expansion has not been enacted into law and, as such, activities involving humanitarian and development assistance remain outside SIGAR’s current mandate,” the spokesperson said.

Adam Weinstein, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft who served in Afghanistan as a U.S. Marine, told the DCNF he did not believe the Biden administration had pressed on an organized campaign to nullify SIGAR; however, “the bottom line is that institutions don’t like to be held accountable, but the American people deserve oversight.”

“I’m sure you can keep working and find productive ways to spend the taxpayer dollar and find out about the stuff and put it on paper for a long time to come. The problem is not so much [Sopko] or the statute or his mission; it’s the fact that nobody really cares,” Gil Barndollar, a senior fellow at Defense Priorities who also deployed to Afghanistan as a Marine, told the DCNF.



Barndollar said he harbored concerns the Republicans in Congress, particularly if they achieve a majority in either house, will wield SIGAR’s post-withdrawal findings to stir up opposition to the Biden administration.

Congress also created the Afghanistan War Commission in 2021, a bipartisan coalition tasked to review the decisions in the 20 years leading up to the Afghanistan withdrawal, legislated through the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act.

However, SIGAR should continue to hold the administration accountable as long as the U.S. is contributing financially to Afghanistan, multiple experts told the DCNF.

“I think there is still a lot for SIGAR to dig into,” said Weinstein. “Shutting it down now would be akin to sweeping a lot of waste, incompetence, and corruption under the rug. Furthermore, it is still looking into current events.”

The Biden administration plans to return billions in frozen assets through a special Swiss-based “Afghan Fund” for eventual transfer to the Afghan Central Bank, according to a joint statement from the U.S. Treasury Department and State Department. Officials have expressed concern the Taliban would seize the funds the U.S. says belong to the Afghan people.

SIGAR is “vitally important because that’s our only advocate, if you will, to find out what the hell’s going on” with U.S. aid to Afghanistan, said Davis.

The White House did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.

"US Should Break Dependence On China And Prepare For Conflict, Congress’ China Watcher Says","The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission urged Congress cut off some economic ties with China and develop a better strategy for engaging in a potential conflict.

The Commission’s report, released Tuesday, sounded the alarm over China’s at times unfair advantages in military and technological advances over the U.S.

“There remains a gap between America’s growing recognition of the challenges China presents and our responses to date in dealing with them,” the Commission said.

The U.S. should break off some economic ties with China and equip its military for a potential conflict, according to the review committee tasked by Congress with tracking the Chinese threat to the U.S.



The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s (USCC) annual report to Congress found that the U.S. military remains dangerously dependent on China, whose heightened military activity and exploitative trade practices have sparked concern in Congress of a possible conflict. The bipartisan review committee’s 785 page report advocates the U.S. take steps to distance itself from the Chinese economy, crack down on Chinese technology theft and overhaul Department of Defense (DOD) practices to bolster war readiness.

China’s doubling down on a “relentless” arms buildup, intimidation of neighbors in the Indo-Pacific and persistent attempts to steal sensitive U.S. military technology has “increased the challenge China poses to the security, prosperity, and shared values of the United States and its democratic allies and partners,” the USCC report said.

“There remains a gap between America’s growing recognition of the challenges China presents and our responses to date in dealing with them,” they added.

President Joe Biden raised concerns of Beijing’s military activity in a meeting with Chinese General Secretary Xi Jinping Monday at the G20 summit in Bali, after the Chinese foreign ministry revealed it was helping Cambodia upgrade a naval base, Reuters reported. USCC pointed to the naval base as an example of China’s subtle military expansion into the Indo-Pacific.

China’s attempts to establish footholds of control in developing countries through the Belt and Road Initiative can involve construction of military bases, allowing China to deploy its military closer to U.S. allies.

Dangerous encounters between Chinese ships and Western naval vessels in international waters have become more frequent as a result of Beijing’s aggression, the report said. Further, China has learned from the global response to Russia’s war in Ukraine, responding with measures to protect supply chains from vulnerability to Western sanctions and shore up internal capacity to produce weapons.

All that would further China’s advantage if it decides to invade Taiwan, USCC claimed.

At the same time, the U.S. military has fallen short of the level of modernization and efficiency it would require to effectively prosecute a conflict with China, the report found.

The U.S. deficit in advanced technology relative to China deepened through August 2022, the report found. Much of the gap came from China’s illicit appropriation of U.S. defense technology through espionage, smuggling networks and policies that require U.S. companies operating in China provide a certain measure of access to Chinese officials, according to the report.

In addition, China’s monopoly over critical elements, such as antimony, has crippled the U.S. defense industrial bases’ ability to source materials for weapons and equipment outside Chinese supply chains.

The Pentagon’s funding procedures stifle competition from small businesses in favor of the large defense contractors, “reducing resilience to interference from and dependencies on China,” the report found.

The report’s 39 recommendations include asking for a comprehensive review of U.S. force posture and industrial base capacity to meet the challenge of a war with China.

The USCC also urges Congress to direct DOD to produce a classified report detailing whether the U.S. could reasonably implement a full energy blockade against China in the event of a conflict. It also suggests carving out an executive authority, allowing the president to order companies to divest from China in response to specific Chinese actions identified as national security threats.

Another potential policy involves plans for joint defense spending with Taiwan, a recommendation the White House may already be acting on.

“China’s increasing belligerence toward Taiwan and the brutal realities of conflict in Europe … have highlighted the challenges of deterring a determined aggressor and the importance of maintaining both the standing military capabilities and the defense industrial capacity necessary to defeat aggression should deterrence fail,” the report authors said.

"‘Rome Is Burning’: Afghan Gov’t Was Misled By US Officials And Ignored Signs Of America’s Exit, Report Alleges","U.S. officials sent mixed messages to the Afghan government regarding the Biden administration’s intent to carry out a complete military withdrawal, a watchdog report alleged.

Instead of preparing to deal with the Taliban alone, Afghan government officials held parties and inconsequential legislative discussions in the weeks and months leading up to the U.S. withdrawal, the watchdog found.

The Afghan government collapsed on Aug. 15 after the Taliban took over the country’s capital city, just weeks before the full withdrawal.

“They had no situational awareness and some of it is our fault. And a lot of it is their fault as well,” Bill Roggio, managing editor of The Long War Journal told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Some U.S. officials misled Afghan officials on the Biden administration’s planned exit from Afghanistan in 2021, who subsequently ignored signs of the coming withdrawal, a government watchdog report alleged.

While senior U.S. government officials involved in peace negotiations accepted the Biden administration’s withdrawal policy and took steps to execute it, other staff members at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul who disagreed with the policy sought to isolate and silence the compliant officials, the Special Investigator General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) found in a Wednesday report. Consequently, Afghan officials heard contradictory messages from the State Department that only encouraged an unwillingness to countenance a potential withdrawal and led to the government’s precipitous collapse in August 2021.

“They had no situational awareness and some of it is our fault. And a lot of it is their fault as well,” Bill Roggio, managing editor of The Long War Journal and a leading commentator on U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: Docs Reveal Biden Admin Was Warned About Rapid Afghan Air Force Collapse)

Afghan officials chose to listen only to U.S. officials “who were giving them more optimistic scenarios,” former Acting Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan (SRAP) Laurel Miller told SIGAR.

Instead of preparing to accept a politically legitimate Taliban or defend Kabul, Afghan government officials held parties and inconsequential legislative discussions in the weeks and months leading up to the U.S. withdrawal, SIGAR found.

The embassy staff who opposed withdrawal “based their opposition to the withdrawal decision on an idealized vision of advancing the rights of Afghan women,” SIGAR said, citing a senior U.S. official. These officials grounded their policy in the goals of a small number of individuals whose perspective did not reflect that of Afghan society writ large.

The revelations are the result of a months-long effort by SIGAR, at the direction of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, to produce a report exposing the reasons for the Afghan government’s dissolution and why 20 years of U.S. state building efforts failed to produce a viable democratic government.

Afghan officials’ behavior mirrored “Nero fiddling while Rome is burning,” International Rescue Committee Afghanistan Country Director Vicki Aken told SIGAR.

Mixed messaging emanated from high levels of the U.S. government, not only from the State Department but from the Department of Defense and the White House, Roggio told the DCNF.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken promised at an April 2021 press conference in Kabul that “even when our troops come home, our partnership with Afghanistan will continue. Our security partnership will endure.”

In addition, the Department of Defense did not anticipate the Afghan army and government would fall to the Taliban as quickly as it did, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley later claimed.

Roggio cited conversations with Afghan officials close to former president of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan at the time of the collapse, Ashraf Ghani, who assured him the Americans did not intend to pull out.

Taliban started imposing the toughest restrictions on women, girls, freedom of speech/media & dozens other basic human rights. They demolished all the achievements of last 20 years & are taking #Afghanistan back to the medieval ages. Rescue Afghanistan & defend the humanity. https://t.co/NG4UuW2Frx — Kabir Haqmal (@Haqmal) November 10, 2022

Ghani reshuffled military leadership in the final year of his administration to place loyal individuals in top postings, SIGAR said. His action disrupted the military’s command structure, preventing it from effectively mobilizing against the Taliban.

Ghani’s actions further reflect his lack of understanding that the U.S. would leave and that his government teetered on the edge of collapse, Roggio told the DCNF.

“He was more concerned about a coup than he was about the Taliban,” Roggio said.

The Taliban rapidly gained ground, even after the Biden administration persuaded Ghani to roll out a new security strategy in July 2021, a plan intended to “improve security within 6 months,” SIGAR said. The Taliban already controlled half of Afghanistan’s districts, at least six border crossings and much of the country’s highways system.

Afghan officials in turn attempted to deceive U.S. policymakers of their ability to withstand the Taliban, SIGAR said.

“I was surprised how much fake information came out from official government sources,” former Al Jazeera correspondent Charlotte Bellis told SIGAR.

Ghani’s flight to Uzbekistan on Aug. 15, 2021 marked the dissolution of the Afghan government, one day after the Taliban entered Kabul and two weeks before the U.S. military exit on Aug. 30, SIGAR said.

The Department of State referred the DCNF to their brief comments to SIGAR, included in the report.

“The standard by which the US government succeeded or failed in its political objectives in Afghanistan needs to be wholly reconsidered in this report,” the State Department said.

The White House and the Department of Defense did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.

‘Writing On The Wall’: Here’s Why Top US Universities May Be Pulling Out Of High-Profile Ranking System,"Top law schools may be pulling out of national rankings in order to keep a focus on diversity on campus over academic qualifications of its students, experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Yale and Harvard Law school pulled out of the U.S. News & Report because the institutions feel that the rankings fail to reward schools who take more diverse students with lower test scores.

“This allows them to continue race-conscious admissions by other means. Already, we see schools embracing this workaround. These top law schools probably have that in mind as they back out of the U.S. News & World Report rankings. Ranking requires clear, objective standards, and if law schools hope to go test-optional, the ranking system presents an obvious problem,” John Sailer, fellow at the National Association of Scholars, told the DCNF.

Top law school universities may be pulling out of one of the most high-profile ranking systems in order to drop standardized testing requirements and keep a focus on diversity, experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

On Wednesday, Yale and Harvard Law school pulled out of the U.S. News & World Report saying that the “flawed” rankings fail to reward schools which help students who come from “low-income backgrounds” and have lower test scores. The schools may be dropping out of the rankings ahead of the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on affirmative action because they plan to deemphasize standardized tests in the admissions process and preserve diversity, but do not want to fall in the rankings process, experts told the DCNF. (RELATED: Colleges Chose Diversity Over Merit. Now, They’re Getting Neither)

“If affirmative action falls, we can expect to see a lot of educational institutions drop objective standards from their admissions practices,” John Sailer, fellow at the National Association of Scholars, told the DCNF. “This allows them to continue race-conscious admissions by other means. Already, we see schools embracing this workaround. These top law schools probably have that in mind as they back out of the U.S. News & World Report rankings. Ranking requires clear, objective standards, and if law schools hope to go test-optional, the ranking system presents an obvious problem.”

In October, the Supreme Court showed favor towards ruling against the use of race-conscious admissions policies after hearing oral arguments against Harvard University and the University of North Carolina’s use of affirmative action in their admissions processes. The universities argue that they need to use race-based admissions policies to increase diversity on campus.

Pulling out of the U.S. News & World Report allows the law schools to focus less on academic requirements and more on diversity without dropping in the rankings, Mark Perry, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, which focuses on “defending human dignity,” told the DCNF.

“There is now widespread speculation that if ‘affirmative discrimination’ and racial preferences are outlawed by the Supreme Court, law schools, medical schools, STEM programs and undergraduate programs at elite schools will overhaul their admissions criteria to maintain the racial diversity on their campuses that has become much more important than the academic credentials and abilities of their students,” Perry told the DCNF. “So given that student diversity is now more important than student merit and abilities, it would make sense that the top law schools are pulling out of the U.S. News & World Report rankings.”

In November, Penn Medicine announced the incoming of its “largest and most diverse” intern class with 27% of its interns being either Black, Hispanic, Latino, Native American or Pacific Islander, according to Penn Medicine News. The school said the increase comes after it implemented a “three-pronged approach” to put an emphasis on recruiting diverse interns and students.

Perry told the DCNF that other universities, such as the law schools, will follow the medical school’s approach, valuing diversity over academic qualifications.

“Although this is an example from a top medical school and not a law school, I think it’s a good example of how professional and graduate schools and programs today (medical school, law school, MBA programs, STEM programs like engineering and computer science, etc.) place a greater emphasis of the diversity of their students than the academic qualifications of their students,” Perry told the DCNF. “Therefore, in the new era of wokeness and allegiance to the holy trinity of diversity, inclusion and equity, it would make sense that the top law schools like Yale, Harvard and UC-Berkeley, just like Penn Medicine, would much rather brag about the increasing diversity of their students than their falling LSAT scores and GPAs.”

A drop in emphasis on standardized tests for law schools has already begun; on Nov. 18, the American Bar Association voted to no longer require the Law School Admissions Test after feedback from a public comment period suggested that dropping the testing requirement would increase diversity. The Clinical Legal Education Association, a group focused on promoting justice and diversity within the legal foundation, said dropping the testing requirement lets law schools focus on “the persistent lack of racial diversity” at their institution.

“Yale Law School and Harvard Law School see the writing on the wall,” Devon Westhill, President of the Center for Equal Opportunity, a group which focuses on promoting “colorblind equal opportunity,” told the DCNF. “As many have predicted, the Supreme Court will outlaw explicit race preferences in admissions and schools that want to continue to racially balance their campuses are devising ways to rejigger their admissions processes to maintain their racial spoils system in a legal, race-neutral way. One such mechanism would be to place less emphasis on standardized tests which, on average, black and Hispanic applicants – preferred races – lag behind other applicants like white and Asian Americans – non-preferred races.”

“These schools recognize they would experience plummeting rankings since academic credentials of incoming students are heavily weighted by U.S. News & World Report,” Westhill continued. “The clever move is to withdraw from the rankings system to avoid the many problems that would flow from a diminished ranking.”

Yale Law School and Harvard Law School did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

US Finalizing Plans To Send Advanced Patriot Missile Defense System To Ukraine: REPORT,"The Pentagon wants to send the advanced Patriot air defense system to Ukraine, and although Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has yet to offer his signature, two US officials and a senior administration official familiar with the plans told CNN the secretary’s approval is expected.

The Pentagon could send a request to President Joe Biden’s desk for final authorization and announce the transfer as soon as this week, the three officials told CNN. Ukraine has entreated the U.S. for months to supply the powerful, but logistically complicated, Patriot air defense system as heavy Russian shelling decimates Ukrainian cities, but the Biden administration has thus far delayed fulfilling those requests.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “emphasized the importance of capable air defense” and “called on President Biden to do everything possible to help protect the civilian population of Ukraine and its critical infrastructure,” Kyiv said in its readout of the conversation between the two leaders, according to The Guardian. (RELATED: US Modified Crucial Weapons To Prevent Ukraine From Striking Russia: REPORT)

The advanced long-range air defense system promises to be the most effective to date donated in Ukraine’s defense, able to intercept Russian ballistic and cruise missiles that in recent weeks have destroyed large portions of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, according to CNN. The system could help to secure the airspace of North American Treaty Organization (NATO) members in Eastern Europe, officials also told the outlet.

Lockheed Martin produces the Patriot battery, which is comprised of a radar, power generation equipment, computers, a control station and as many as eight launchers, each carrying four missiles. Transporting one or more of the systems Ukraine will be a logistically challenging task, and the U.S. will have to follow up with months of intensive training support for Ukrainian troops learning to operate the system.

U.S. Army soldiers stationed in Grafenwoehr, Germany will train rotating Ukrainian troops, CNN reported, citing officials. The “reality of what is going on the ground” finally persuaded the Biden administration to favor providing the system to Ukraine.

So far, the U.S. provided mid-range National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) for Ukraine some time after October and plans to send additional systems as part of “longer-term” preparations for the embattled country’s defense, according to Reuters.

Secretary of State Anthony Blinken told CNN in November the U.S. is “very focused” on providing air defense for Ukraine.

“And we’re working to make sure that the Ukrainians get those systems as quickly as possible but also as effectively as possible, making sure that they are trained on them, making sure they have the ability to maintain them and all of that has to come together and it is,” Blinken said, according to CNN.

The Department of Defense spokesperson Lt Col Garron J. Garn told the Daily Caller News Foundation the Pentagon had nothing to announce regarding a potential transfer of Patriot missiles to Ukraine.

‘We Couldn’t Do It’: US Plan To Track Weapons To Kyiv Depends On Ukrainian Troops,"While the U.S. announced a new plan to monitor weapons aid to Ukraine in October, it is relying heavily on Ukrainian personnel to self-report whether donated U.S. weapons and equipment reach their intended destination, Politico reported.

The U.S. charged State Department and non-combat Department of Defense personnel at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv to monitor weapons end use for the $20 billion in security assistance given to Ukraine as of Dec. 9. However, a significant portion of the plan involves tasking Ukrainian soldiers with inspecting aid at destinations closer to the front lines and using photos of weapons uploaded to a secure blockchain to verify end use, Politico reported, citing a Sept. 6 State Department cable seen by the outlet.

The 9-page cable signed by U.S. Ambassador Bridget Brink documents the challenges for a limited number of U.S. personnel, whose movements are heavily restricted for security reasons, in preventing U.S. weapons donations from ending up in the hands of traffickers, according to Politico.

“Above all, kinetic activity and active combat between Ukrainian and Russian forces create an environment in which standard verification measures are sometimes impracticable or impossible,” the cable stated. (RELATED: Rep. Comer Provides Laundry List Of Items For Oversight Once Republicans Take The House Majority)

Instead, the Department of Defense (DOD) planned in September to transfer much of the responsibility for end use monitoring to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, allowing the troops to “conduct its own inspections,” according to Politico. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency’s more intensive verification requirements include documenting serial numbers for smaller items like Switchblade drones and night-vision equipment, the cable stated.

“End-use monitoring is really complex right now,” DOD Inspector General spokesperson Megan Reed told Politico.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will require photo evidence at times, “particularly in hard to reach areas,” the cable revealed, according to Politico. The agency also contracted Deloitte, a prominent management consulting firm, to provide third-party “review” services and “identify gaps,” a common practice for USAID in other conflict monitoring zones.

In addition, the U.S. intends to establish Monitoring, Evaluation and Audit Services for Ukraine Reporting (MEASURE), which includes a three-year contract with a U.S. firm “establish an in-country presence to undertake remote and in-person monitoring with site visits as possible,” the cable stated.

Democratic Rep. Sarah Jacobs of California advocated for establishing a separate inspector general dedicated to the Ukraine crisis but highlighted the difficulties of monitoring weapons in a denied area.

“We couldn’t do it now,” she told Politico. “We don’t have enough mobility within the country to really be able to do it.”

“The end-use monitoring regime we have in place, in general, was designed to make sure the Soviet Union did not steal our trade secrets, which is not the same as making sure our weapons don’t get used for things we do not intend them to get used for,” Jacobs added.

The DOD did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Biden Admin Investigating How US Tech Wound Up In Iranian Suicide Drones Hitting Ukraine,"The U.S. initiated a far-reaching probe after researchers found U.S.-made components in some of the hundreds of Iranian-made drones Russia is using to attack Ukraine, CNN reported, citing multiple officials familiar with the effort.

Despite stringent sanctions on Iranian businesses and export controls on U.S. technology, researchers analyzing remains of the Iranian drones on the battlefield identified the kinds of advanced microelectronics the strict sanctions regime intends to block Iran from acquiring. The White House Security Council convened representatives from the Defense, State, Justice, Commerce and Treasury Departments, for an “all hands on deck” effort to expose Iranian sanctions evasion, CNN reported, citing an official.

The task force is part of a new “holistic approach” to negotiating Iran policy, a senior administration official told CNN. In recent weeks, Iran has deepened support for Russia’s war effort in Ukraine, backed a brutal crackdown on Iranian protesters and expanding its nuclear program after President Joe Biden declared a potential nuclear deal “dead.” (RELATED: Iranian Troops In Crimea Supported Russian Drone Strikes, US Official Says)

UK-based investigative firm Conflict Armament Research (CAR) examined one Iranian-made Shahed-131 drone, two Shahed-136 models and one Mohajer-6 in November, discovering that more than 82% of parts originated in parts manufactured in the U.S. CAR did not identify the manufacturers.

Additionally, Ukraine’s Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (NAKO) found that at least half of more than 200 technical components retrieved from remains of shot-down Iranian drones could be traced to U.S. firms and a third to firms in Japan, the WSJ first reported in November, citing Ukrainian military intelligence from April verified in the report.

NAKO’s investigation traced drone parts to Oregon-based Sierra-Olympic Technologies and Arizona-based Microchip Technology, but both companies denied selling their products to Iranian buyers.

However, Dallas-based Texas Instruments is likely one source, whose processors were found in some drones, according to Ukrainian intelligence and a U.S. official familiar with the investigation, CNN reported. Also under review is Canada’s Bombardier Recreational Products for drone engines.

Both companies have condemned the apparently illegal end use of their products, CNN reported.

“TI is not selling any products into Russia, Belarus or Iran,” a spokesperson for Texas Instruments (TI) told CNN.

“TI complies with applicable laws and regulations in the countries where we operate, and partners with law enforcement organizations as necessary and appropriate. Additionally, we do not support or condone the use of our products in applications they weren’t designed for,” the spokesperson told the outlet.

Ukraine and Russia “are considering the establishment of a joint production line for lethal drones in Russia, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said earlier in December, according to The Hill.

The National Security Council did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

US Strike Kills 6 Terrorists In Somalia,"American military forces killed six militants in what U.S. Africa Command described as a “self-defense strike” in Somalia on Friday.

“The command’s initial assessment is the strike killed six al-Shabaab terrorists and that no civilians were injured or killed,” Africa Command (AFRICOM) said. Friday’s strike took place at the request of the Somali government in support of the Somali National Army in their fight against with the terrorist group, according to the statement.

U.S. military involvement in Somalia took a turn when former President Donald Trump ordered the withdrawal of most U.S. forces from Somalia in 2020, leaving behind a small contingent to support the country’s government in its fight against al-Shabaab. President Joe Biden, however, reversed U.S. posture in the African nation with a deployment of additional U.S. troops in May. (RELATED: US Helicopter Raid Takes Out ISIS Leaders In Middle East)

U.S. Africa Command announced a similar strike last month that killed al-Shabaab terrorists in a remote part of Syria. The U.S. military also conducted an air strike in September that killed 27 militants, according to Reuters. The United States’ “kinetic actions” against the terrorist group aim to support Somalia’s efforts to disrupt terrorist operations within its borders, AFRICOM said.

"Chinese Invasion Of Taiwan Would Devastate US And Allies, Simulation Finds","The U.S., its allies and China would suffer devastating consequences in a scenario where the U.S. helps Taiwan fend off an invading force in 2026, a prominent think tank found in one of the most extensive war games ever conducted, CNN reported Monday.

The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based think tank, ran two dozen iterations of the war game to find out whether a Chinese invasion in 2026 would succeed, and at what cost to those involved, CNN reported. While Beijing would likely fail in its campaign for forced reunification with Taiwan, CSIS found in a report to be released Monday, the ensuing war would lay waste to both Chinese and U.S. militaries and cause thousands of casualties.

“The United States and Japan lose dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and thousands of service members. Such losses would damage the U.S. global position for many years,” the report said, according to CNN. (RELATED: White House Does A Double Take After Biden Says US Troops Would Defend Taiwan If China Attacks)

With 24 distinct iterations, the project aimed to provide a broader and more transparent look at what a Chinese invasion would look like, according to CNN.

“There’s no unclassified war game out there looking at the U.S.-China conflict,” Mark Cancian, one of three project leaders and a senior adviser at CSIS, told CNN. “Of the games that are unclassified, they’re usually only done once or twice.”

China claims Taiwan exists within its territorial boundaries and has pledged to “reunify” with the self-governing island by force if necessary, a move the U.S. sees as threatening a key ally as well as America’s ability to project power. Analysts and top U.S. officials have warned of imminent violence against Taiwan.

In the scenario, enemy fire would kill 3,200 troops in three weeks of combat and sink at least two of the U.S.’ 11 aircraft carriers, massive, nuclear-equipped vessels that display American power across the globe, according to CNN.

The report found China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), the largest navy on the planet which is rapidly modernizing, would lay in “shambles,” according to CNN. China would lose up to 10,000 troops and a large portion of its navy.

War gamers found that Taiwan’s military would remain intact, but war would scourge the island of basic infrastructure, unable to support normal economic activity and its army would suffer 3,500 casualties, CNN reported.

For the U.S. to thwart a Chinese invasion, the report found that Taiwan’s ground-based forces needed to be strong enough to block PLAN landings, while the U.S. required basing support in Japan and the ability to strike PLAN ships “en masse” from a distance, according to CNN. Taiwan also required a robust military, fully armed with Western weapons, before China struck, unlike in Ukraine where the West has maintained a months-long flow of weapons to Ukraine since Russia launched a large-scale invasion.

“Once the war begins, it’s impossible to get any troops or supplies onto Taiwan,” Cancian told CNN.

The Pentagon and the Chinese Embassy did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

"Chinese Invasion Of Taiwan Would Devastate US And Allies, Simulation Finds","The U.S., its allies and China would suffer devastating consequences in a scenario where the U.S. helps Taiwan fend off an invading force in 2026, a prominent think tank found in one of the most extensive war games ever conducted, CNN reported Monday.

The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based think tank, ran two dozen iterations of the war game to find out whether a Chinese invasion in 2026 would succeed, and at what cost to those involved, CNN reported. While Beijing would likely fail in its campaign for forced reunification with Taiwan, CSIS found in a report to be released Monday, the ensuing war would lay waste to both Chinese and U.S. militaries and cause thousands of casualties.

“The United States and Japan lose dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and thousands of service members. Such losses would damage the U.S. global position for many years,” the report said, according to CNN. (RELATED: White House Does A Double Take After Biden Says US Troops Would Defend Taiwan If China Attacks)

With 24 distinct iterations, the project aimed to provide a broader and more transparent look at what a Chinese invasion would look like, according to CNN.

“There’s no unclassified war game out there looking at the U.S.-China conflict,” Mark Cancian, one of three project leaders and a senior adviser at CSIS, told CNN. “Of the games that are unclassified, they’re usually only done once or twice.”

China claims Taiwan exists within its territorial boundaries and has pledged to “reunify” with the self-governing island by force if necessary, a move the U.S. sees as threatening a key ally as well as America’s ability to project power. Analysts and top U.S. officials have warned of imminent violence against Taiwan.

In the scenario, enemy fire would kill 3,200 troops in three weeks of combat and sink at least two of the U.S.’ 11 aircraft carriers, massive, nuclear-equipped vessels that display American power across the globe, according to CNN.

The report found China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), the largest navy on the planet which is rapidly modernizing, would lay in “shambles,” according to CNN. China would lose up to 10,000 troops and a large portion of its navy.

War gamers found that Taiwan’s military would remain intact, but war would scourge the island of basic infrastructure, unable to support normal economic activity and its army would suffer 3,500 casualties, CNN reported.

Putin’s war in Ukraine has no indication of ending soon, offering a tonic to thoughts major war a bygone relic especially naval warfare, which the Chinese military is certainly studying relative a potential war in Taiwan.

US Army Explains How To Respond When A Soldier Questions Showering With ‘A Female Who Has Male Genitalia’,"Transgender soldiers will be held to the same standards as personnel who serve in their own sex and use the same facilities, including showers, according to Army training materials first revealed in The Wall Street Journal.

Scenarios depicted in the training materials address how to deal with transgender servicemembers who have not undergone sex change surgery using open-bay showers or respond when a member confirms “his” pregnancy.



“Understand that Soldiers who have transitioned gender may remain susceptible to medical conditions associated with their birth gender,” the materials advise.

The U.S. Army has prepared extensive guidance for how to integrate transgender soldiers into its ranks, including instructions for group showers and how to respond to pregnant men, newly revealed training documents show.

President Joe Biden restored an Obama-era directive codifying service for many transgender individuals shortly after taking office in 2021 amid competing judgements about the influence of gender-related psychological issues and medical procedures on a person’s fitness for service. While the number of transgender individuals currently serving is likely small, the training materials, dated August 2021, imagine a variety of problems officers and soldiers might encounter related to transgender members.

One slide in the “Tier Two” training materials addresses how an officer should respond when a soldier approaches “to discuss his newly confirmed pregnancy.” The training materials, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, come in three versions, with Tier One aimed at staff, Tier Two focused on commanders and Tier Three directed at individual units and soldiers.

“Understand that Soldiers who have transitioned gender may remain susceptible to medical conditions associated with their birth gender,” the materials advise. (RELATED: Dems Block GOP Effort To Probe Extent Of Gender Ideology In The Military)

Soldiers have to accept living conditions with little or no privacy, including in open-bay showers, where women might find themselves bathing alongside “a female who has male genitalia” or vice versa.



“Soldiers must accept living conditions that are often austere, primitive and characterized by little or no privacy,” the slide reads. Commanders can install new privacy features or adjust showering schedules, but no transgender-only spaces are permitted, according to the guidance.

While the Army will pay for a transgender soldier’s gender transition surgery, it won’t provide additional funding to add curtains or shower hooks inside stalls, according to materials labeled “special staff training.”



“Transgender soldiers are not expected to modify or adjust their behavior based on the fact that they do not ‘match’ other soldiers,” one slide in the Tier Three training packet reads. Transgender soldiers will be held to the same standards as others in their claimed gender and will be discharged if medical conditions “related to their gender identity” impede their ability to serve.

In another “vignette,” as the guidance calls them, officers are presented with a scenario involving a soldier transitioning to become female and who is on an Army-prescribed medical plan that includes hormone treatments and is expected to take six months.

“After five months, however, it becomes increasingly difficult for the soldier to meet male body composition standards,” the slide reads. The solution: Commanders are authorized to push back the soldier’s test date or give the soldier extended leave.



The soldier’s medical regime and inability to meet gender-based physical requirements “should be treated as any other medical issues would be treated,” the slide states. “The soldier is responsible to continue to meet all male standards until the gender marker is changed in DEERS,” the personnel records system.

Soldiers are permitted to request an exception to policy and adopt alternative fitness standards to those associated with their official pre-transition gender, the slides say.

Still another vignette describes how a soldier “assigned male at birth” and diagnosed with gender dysphoria, a disqualifying condition under the Trump administration, might have his “medically necessary” gender reassignment surgery disrupted by his deployment schedule.

Brigade commanders have the authority to decide whether a soldier’s gender transition surgery can be delayed until after a deployment or confine the soldier to domestic roles when the soldier would ordinarily deploy, “after balancing the needs of the Soldier and the needs of the army.”



“A transgender Soldier whose ability to serve is adversely affected by a medical condition related to his or her gender identity must be treated, for purposes of separation and retention, in a manner consistent with any other Soldier whose ability to serve is similarly affected,” another slide says, addressing a scenario where a soldier encounters complications from taxpayer-funded sex reassignment surgery.



“Medical complications from cross-sex hormones and surgery are very common,” Joseph Burgo, a clinical psychologist and adviser to gender advocacy organization Genspect, explained to the Daily Caller News Foundation.



There is no clear data on the number of transgender people currently serving, but a 2016 RAND study pegged the total at between 1,320 and 6,630 active duty servicemembers in the military. A panel of experts commissioned by the Trump administration found that allowing transgender individuals with or without a history of gender dysphoria to serve as their preferred sex could undermine readiness and provoke division, according to a 2019 memo, while RAND argued the health care and readiness impacts would be minimal.

“It is very much a gender affirmative policy in that it accepts at face value a person’s declared gender identity without question,” Burgo said, referring to the Army’s transgender rules.

The Army did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment. The Department of Defense referred the DCNF to the Army.

US Ramps Up Training For Ukrainian Military Aimed At Large-Scale Offensive Operations,"The U.S. began training Ukrainian troops in Germany on long-distance attack methods Sunday in a new and escalated training program designed to help Ukraine beat back Russia from occupied territory, according to The Associated Press.

Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley said the goal of the program is to get roughly 500 Ukrainian troops back on the battlefield, trained to perform complex maneuvers with combined arms, artillery and ground forces, some time before the spring rains, the AP reported. Waiting at the Grafenwoehr Army base in Germany is an array of weapons systems and equipment bound for Ukraine and members of the U.S. Army Europe Africa’s 7th Army Training Command.

“This support is really important for Ukraine to be able to defend itself,” Milley said, according to the AP. “And we’re hoping to be able to pull this together here in short order.” (RELATED: Pentagon Brings Ukrainian Troops To The US For Patriot Missile Training)

Prior U.S. support focused on meeting Ukraine’s immediate needs on the battlefield and providing to 3,100 troops on operating and maintaining howitzers, High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) and other weapons, according to the AP. Ukrainian troops rotated to nearby NATO countries to receive training from the U.S. and allies on a variety of weapons. The U.S. announced the upgraded training program in mid-December with an expanded focus on teaching the Ukrainians how to conduct attacks with different kinds of capabilities at once, using specialized Western equipment, according to Reuters. “Combined arms maneuver training is a logical next step in our ongoing training efforts,” Pentagon Press Secretary Brig. Gen Pat Ryder said, Ukrainian soldiers of the 47th brigade began to master the Bradley M2 😉😉 pic.twitter.com/G2mF0NcZZ5 — NOËL 🇪🇺 🇺🇦 (@NOELreports) January 15, 2023 U.S. special operations and Army National Guard forces have trained thousands of Ukrainian troops within the country since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, including on the type of combined arms training the new regime plans to incorporate, according to the AP. However, U.S. military personnel evacuated after Russia’s invasion. Milley plans to visit the troops in Grafenwoehr Monday to inspect the new program, the AP reported. Training begins as European allies have upgraded the capabilities of weapons destined for Ukraine, according to The New York Times. The United Kingdom approved a delivery of 14 Challenger 2 tanks, the first Western-made main battle tanks to head to Ukraine after the U.S. and France each announced new deliveries of heavy infantry fighting vehicles and light tanks. Just weeks before the U.K. announcement, Western countries had shied away from offering heavy weaponry to Ukraine for fear of triggering an escalation from Russia, even as Ukraine begged for tanks, the NYT reported. “We are becoming bolder, less risk reverse — less spooked by Putin’s rhetoric that any serious Western involvement could have repercussions,” Tobias Ellwood, chair of Britain’s Defense Select Committee said, according to the NYT. Russia over the weekend launched a volley of cruise and ballistic missiles, which are more difficult for Ukrainian air defenses to intercept, the AP reported. Analysts warned that Russia is preparing to fight a major long-lasting conventional war. “These tanks burn well and will continue to burn,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov said, according to state-run TASS news agency.

"US Shies Away From Sending Tanks, Long-Range Weapons In Upcoming Aid Package: REPORT","The U.S. plans to announce a major new assistance package for Ukraine at a Friday meeting of Western defense ministers, notably absent of main battle tanks and long-range weapons as pressure mounts for the West to supply heavy weaponry, Politico reported, citing anonymous U.S. officials.

Although previous aid packages omitted some hard-hitting weapons and equipment over fears of potentially triggering Russian President Vladimir Putin to retaliate against North American Treaty Organization (NATO) members, hesitance to include the Army’s 60-ton M1 Abrams battle tank stems from concerns about logistics, one official told Politico. The formal announcement, which is expected at a regular NATO ministerial meeting in Germany on Friday, comes as the U.S. and Germany are facing increasing pressure from Ukraine and other allies to send tanks, Voice of America reported.

The United Kingdom said it would send 14 Challenger 2 tanks on Monday, according to VOA, a decision the U.S. supports, an official told Politico. The Biden administration has also helped facilitate the transfer of Soviet-made tanks from the Czech Republic to Ukraine. (RELATED: The US Is Moving Hundreds Of Thousands Of Ammo Rounds Out Of Israel To Support Ukraine)

“We believe the provision of modern tanks will significantly help and improve the Ukrainians’ ability to fight where they are fighting now and fight more effectively going forward,” National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Wednesday, according to Politico.

Friday’s package will probably include Strykers, an eight-wheeled armored fighting vehicle, weeks after the U.S. announced 50 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, the official told Politico.

The package could also include ground-launched Small Diameter Bombs, which have a range of 100 miles, two of the officials said, according to Politico. Reuters reported in November that the Pentagon was entertaining a Boeing proposal to produce the bombs, one of roughly half a dozen programs the U.S. is considering to sustain weapons transfers to Ukraine.

However, the people said the package will not include Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), weapons that Ukraine could use to strike Moscow, two of the people told Politico,

“The current handwringing and hesitation by the Biden administration and some of our European allies in providing critical weapon systems to Ukraine stinks of the weak policies of 2021,” House GOP Reps. Mike Rogers of Alabama and Michael McCaul of Texas, who chair the armed services and foreign affairs committees, respectively, said in a statement.

“While those policies failed to deter this conflict, the current indecision and self-deterrence will prolong it – costing Ukrainian lives,” they added.

Germany said Wednesday it would not approve deliveries of Leopards from its own stocks or those of European allies unless the U.S. also agrees to supply American tanks, according to The Wall Street Journal. Other European governments have pledged to deliver German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, but doing so requires prior approval from Berlin, the outlet reported.

“This is a pivotal moment in the war and the need for a significant increase in support for Ukraine,” NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, Reuters reported.

EXCLUSIVE: Rep. Allen To Introduce Legislation Targeting Chinese Military Access To U.S. Research Funding,"Georgia Republican Rep. Rick Allen is introducing legislation to close loopholes exploited by Chinese military firms to access federal research grants.

Allen’s legislation would prohibit the National Science Foundation (NSF) from providing grants to any individual or entity affiliated with or related to a Chinese military company. The bill is known as the American Science First Act and seeks to prevent the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from exploiting research funded by U.S. taxpayers.

“The American Science First Act takes concrete steps to combat the CCP’s persistent efforts to steal American intellectual property and use it against us,” Allen told the Daily Caller. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Rep. Gooden Calls For Investigation Into Foreign Donations, Gifts Contributed To Biden Penn Center)

“Currently, Chinese military companies could exploit loopholes to gain access to research funding paid for by the United States. When the American people send their hard-earned tax dollars to Washington, they deserve to know, with certainty, that those funds will not be used to further the military interests of Communist China,” Allen added.

On Oct. 5, the Department of Defense (DOD) published a list on of 60 Chinese military companies operating in the U.S. directly or indirectly. According to the DOD, the firms support the modernization goals of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) while appearing to be civilian entities.

The NSF has an annual operating budget of $9.5 billion and funds “approximately 25% of all federally supported basic research conducted by America’s colleges and universities,” according to the NSF website. The website also describes the foundation’s goals as advancing “knowledge to sustain global leadership” and serving as “a primary driver of the U.S. economy.”

With its establishment today, the Select Committee on China will investigate the CCP for: ✔️Producing the components of deadly fentanyl

✔️Deceptive trade practices

✔️Buying U.S. farmland

✔️Intellectual property theft

✔️Spread of propaganda

✔️Supply chain dominance …and more. — House Republicans (@HouseGOP) January 10, 2023

US Quietly Boosts Military Training For Taiwan: REPORT,"The U.S. has secretly upgraded the National Guard’s training program for Taiwanese troops as concerns over China’s designs for the self-governing island continue to mount, Nikkei reported.

The training, not previously known, began some time before the spring of 2022 in an attempt to increase the island’s deterrent effect against a possible Chinese invasion and improve U.S.-Taiwan cooperation, sources familiar told Nikkei. While the exact scope and duration of the expanded training mission in Taiwan remain unclear, training of this sort has proven effective in enhancing U.S. partners’ abilities to defend against attackers.

Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen previously hinted at the possible National Guard mission, saying in May 2022 that the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) was “proactively planning cooperation between the U.S. National Guard and Taiwan’s defense forces,” Reuters reported. Congress’ defense bill for 2022 required a briefing from DOD on the feasibility of increasing U.S. military cooperation with Taiwan.

China lambasted the subtle announcement as “collusion,” claiming that the U.S. planned to instruct Taiwanese forces in urban warfare tactics to potentially trap China’s military in a grinding war of attrition. (RELATED: US To Bulk Up Pacific Military Presence As China Eyes Taiwan)

However, the new training began prior to Tsai’s comment, sources told Nikkei; National Guard units from multiple states, including Hawaii, appear to be stationed in Taiwan, the sources said. Having contingents from multiple states sets Taiwan’s training program apart from other National Guard overseas operations, one of the sources explained.

“We don’t have a comment on specific operations, engagements or training, but I would highlight that our support for, and defense relationship with, Taiwan remains aligned against the current threat posed by the People’s Republic of China,” a DOD spokesperson told Nikkei. “Our commitment to Taiwan is rock-solid and contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region.”

The National Guard runs state and federal partnership programs with more than 80 governments around the world and resumed training missions for Ukrainian troops in neighboring countries in May of 2022 after a brief suspension during the initial months of Russia’s invasion, according to the National Guard Association of the U.S.

U.S. military forces have conducted training and equipping missions in Taiwan in the past; U.S. officials revealed in October 2021 that a U.S. Marine contingent and special operations group had been secretly stationed in Taipei for at least a year, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Ukraine’s example contributed to Tsai’s decision in December to lengthen the period of mandatory military service for Taiwanese citizens. Tsai said Taiwanese officials noted the determination and level of training displayed by Ukrainian troops in repelling Russian forces, and that the island may have to exhibit similar qualities to fight against China’s much larger air and naval force, the WSJ reported.

Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s requests for comment.

Here’s How Long It Will Take To Replenish US Weapons Stocks Sent To Ukraine,"The U.S. will not be able to restock inventories of critical munitions sent to Ukraine for years, even as some stockpiles have become nearly depleted, the Center for Strategic and International Studies found.

The U.S. has provided 1.1 million rounds of 155mm ammunition to Ukraine as of Thursday, according to the Pentagon.

“Fortunately, in this year’s NDAA, the Armed Services Committees included critical audit provisions for this funding, including one that will provide quarterly reports on the production of the US munitions industrial base,” Wisconsin Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Even at emergency production rates, it will take several years before the U.S. is able to restock supplies of critical munitions sent to Ukraine, according to a recent analysis conducted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington, D.C. based think tank.

The U.S. has sent millions of rounds of ammunition of various kinds to Ukraine, according to a Thursday fact sheet from the Department of Defense (DOD), which has resulted in severe deficits in some cases. Only one of the six weapons where stockpiles have fallen dangerously low is projected to reach normal levels within five years, assuming no further deliveries to Ukraine, leaving the U.S. scrambling for alternatives, Mark Cancian, a former artillery officer and Pentagon acquisition official, found in a report published in CSIS.

“Longer term, there will be some competition between Taiwan’s needs and rebuilding US stockpiles,” Cancian told the Daily Caller News Foundation, as the U.S. pledges to help the island fend off Chinese aggression. “That’s why increased munitions production is so important.”

“Most inventories, though not all, will take many years to replace. For most items, there are workarounds, but there may be a crisis brewing over artillery ammunition,” Cancian wrote. (RELATED: US Shies Away From Sending Tanks, Long-Range Weapons In Upcoming Aid Package: REPORT)

For example, the U.S. has provided 1.1 million rounds of 155mm ammunition, a widely-used explosive shell, to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the fact sheet shows.

At the regular production rate of 93,000 rounds annually, the industrial base would never be able to replenish 155mm projectiles because of the number consumed in standard military training and maintenance operations, the CSIS report said. The base can surge to a rate of 240,000 rounds each year, but even then it would take five years before inventories of 155mm would be fully rebuilt.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged in May that DOD will not allow domestic inventories of “critical” munitions to fall below minimum levels needed for national security, according to Defense News. Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh repeated that promise on Thursday.

Army acquisition czar Doug Bush said in September the service planned to triple 155mm production over the next “couple” of years with support from Congress, Task and Purpose reported. The Army held an “Industry Day” on Tuesday to provide arms manufacturing companies with an overview of the army’s requirements for accelerating production of 155mm projectiles and the need to expand production capacity, a notice shows.

The U.S. has pulled hundreds of thousands of the 155mm shells from stockpiles operated by U.S. military units in Israel and routed them to Ukraine. Additional equipment of an unspecified nature may be transferred out of U.S. forces in Korea, Reuters reported Thursday.

“The Ukrainians will never run out of ammunition,” Cancian told the Daily Caller News Foundation. Supply for lighter weapons, like rifles and machine guns, could continue indefinitely, but “artillery ammunition,” the foundation of ground warfare, “has been the most difficult,” he added.

To make up for shortages, the U.S. has begun substituting some weapons that may be slightly less appropriate to the type of warfare Ukraine is conducting and buying artillery from other countries, Cancian explained to the DCNF.



GPS-guided 155 mm munitions are also at risk, according to the analysis. Recent production rates of 1,000 per year mean it could take seven years to refill U.S. inventories, or four years at an accelerated production rate.

At the recent rate of production, it will take eight years to replenish U.S. stocks of Javelins; surge production rates could shorten the timeline to five and one-half years, according to the CSIS analysis. Javelin stocks have become so strained that DOD suspended further deliveries to Ukraine to avoid undercutting plans for dealing with possible conflicts elsewhere.

Stinger missiles could take even longer, up to 18 years, corresponding with decreasing demand within DOD for the munition.

Cancian predicted the inventory of High Mobility Artillery Rockets System (HIMARS) could be restocked within three years. However, part of the reason for the more comfortable production margin is that the U.S. has donated so few — just 20 as of Jan. 6 — relative to Ukraine’s needs, Cancian wrote.

Thursday’s defense package did not include any additional HIMARS, Stingers or Javelins, according to a release.

Meanwhile, Ukraine is firing artillery at a rate of roughly 90,000 rounds per month, officials told The New York Times in November.

Russia’s industrial base, while dwarfed by that of the collective West, has already shifted to wartime footing, The Wall Street Journal reported. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that “we should not underestimate Russia” as Moscow works to build up its own munitions stores and appears to be planning a mass mobilization.

Congress granted DOD the authority to streamline the purchasing process by allowing the Pentagon to make contracts that extend for multiple years and eliminating some restrictions in the defense bill for 2023, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

“Fortunately, in this year’s NDAA, the Armed Services Committees included critical audit provisions for this funding, including one that will provide quarterly reports on the production of the US munitions industrial base,” Wisconsin Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher told the DCNF.

A trilateral inspector general (IG) body, composed of the IGs from DOD, the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, released a full strategy to monitor the United States’ Ukraine response, including how it balances between supporting Ukraine and maintaining supplies for its own needs, on Wednesday.

What the IGs cannot evaluate, however, is the way Ukraine determines worthwhile targets and positions weapons to launch, Cancian told the DCNF. The more ammunition Ukrainian forces have access to at any one time, the more fires they can launch at targets that become “progressively lower priority.” DOD did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

REPORT: US Defense Industrial Base Not Prepared For War With China,"The U.S. defense industrial base is not prepared for a protracted war with China in the Taiwan Strait, according to a new think tank report.

The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) found in its report that some U.S. munitions, such as long-range precision-guided munitions, would run out in less than a week of conflict in the Taiwan Strait. (RELATED: US Quietly Boosts Military Training For Taiwan: REPORT)

The munitions shortfalls demonstrate that the U.S. defense industrial base lacks the capacity for a major war as China continues to invest in munitions and weapons systems six times faster than the U.S., the report says.

new from me: the Ukraine conflict is exposing the strategic peril in which the US finds itself according to a new ⁦@CSIS⁩ study which says the US defense industrial base is woefully unprepared to fight China and the US bureaucracy is *sluggish https://t.co/tp4JY2g6ZJ — Gordon Lubold (@glubold) January 23, 2023

U.S. assistance to Ukraine has depleted supply of weapons such as Stinger surface-to-air missiles, 155mm howitzers and ammunition, and Javelin anti-tank missile systems, CSIS notes. The quantity of javelins sent to Ukraine as of August 2022 represented seven years of production based on fiscal year (FY) 2022 rates and the Stingers sent to Ukraine are roughly equal to 20 years worth of production, according to CSIS.

U.S. military support has enabled the Ukrainians to deter Russian aggression and demonstrates how conflict between major powers is likely to be protracted and industrial if deterrence fails, CSIS says. The U.S. has been slow to replenish its weapons stocks and it is likely to take years for the defense industrial base to produce and deliver critical weapons systems that have been used up, the CSIS report says.

The report also highlights outdated contracting procedures and bureaucracy that make deterrence more difficult and suggests streamlining them for wartime footing, according to CSIS.

“The U.S. military services have underinvested in weapons systems and munitions for a conventional war, and the DoD’s acquisition system faces challenges in creating the incentives for industry to invest in sufficient stockpiles of key weapons systems,” the report warns.

“The U.S. Department of Defense, in coordination with Congress, should develop a plan now that involves taking steps to streamline and improve production, acquisitions, replenishment, Foreign Military Sales, ITAR, and other policies and procedures,” the report specifies.

CSIS Senior Vice President Seth Jones conducted the report based on CSIS war games, interviews with dozens of national security officials, publicly available data and other CSIS analysis. “The bottom line is the defense industrial base, in my judgment, is not prepared for the security environment that now exists,” Jones said to The Wall Street Journal.

US Captures Two ISIS Militants In Syria,"U.S. forces in Syria captured two Islamic State (ISIS) militants during a raid with Syrian partner militias, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a Sunday statement.

CENTCOM fighters and partner troops from an unnamed Syrian resistance group raided an unspecified location in eastern Syria on Saturday with combined helicopter and ground assault units, the statement said. The roughly 900 U.S. forces have continued to strike at ISIS forces persisting in Syria, usually in concert with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), according to Politico.

“This operation reaffirms CENTCOM’s steadfast commitment to the region and the enduring defeat of ISIS,” CENTCOM spokesperson Col. Joe Buccino said in the statement. “The capture will disrupt the terrorist organization’s ability to further plot and carry out attacks that threaten regional security and stability.” (RELATED: The Islamic State Is Back – But Its Focus Has Shifted)

The captured ISIS-Syria members Abdallah Hamid Muslih al-Maddad, also known as Abu Hamza al-Suri, and Husam Hamid al-Muslih al-Maddad, al-Khayr are described as ISIS facilitators, and the latter also served as a logistician, according to the statement. U.S. forces also captured one unnamed associate, while a civilian received minor injuries during the course of the raid.

The injured civilian received medical treatment at a nearby facility, accompanied by a family member and an SDF escort, the statement said. He was later released back to his family.

The raid came a day after three attack drones struck a garrison in Syria housing both U.S. troops and members of the Syrian Free Army partner force, injuring two of the resistance fighters but no American troops, according to a statement. CENTCOM did not attribute the attacks but warned that such incidents jeopardize the ongoing fight against ISIS.

U.S.-Syria coalition partners captured an ISIS member described as a “provincial media and security operative” during a Jan. 18 a helicopter raid in eastern Syria, according to a statement.

“ISIS represents a threat to our partners and to the people of Iraq and Syria and beyond,” Buccino said in the statement Saturday. “Our mission to defeat ISIS alongside our [SDF] partners continues.”

U.S. and Syrian partners conducted 108 joint operations in Syria throughout 2022, capturing 215 ISIS militants and killing an additional 466 when solo U.S. operations are counted, according to a year-end summary from CENTCOM.

“Our local partners — the Syrian Democratic Forces and the Iraqi Security Forces — have and continue to play a critical role ensuring the enduring defeat of ISIS,” the summary said.

CENTCOM commanders hailed the skill and determination of Syrian militias to root out and apprehend or kill ISIS operatives, the summary showed. Militants continue to target the al-Hol refugee camp and the more than two dozen detention centers housing 10,000 captured ISIS fighters, which SDF forces are responsible for securing.

Top Chinese Nuclear Research Lab Bought US Chips Despite Export Ban: REPORT,"China’s top nuclear weapons research institute managed to obtain American-made semiconductors despite export rules banning the transfer of U.S. technology to organizations associated with the Chinese military, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.

The China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP), which developed China’s first hydrogen bomb, has purchased American chips at least 12 times in the past two and a half years, the WSJ reported, citing procurement documents seen by the outlet. Although the U.S. blacklisted the academy in 1997, it has circumvented U.S. sanctions by obtaining the advanced chips from third-party sellers, according to the WSJ.

Companies including Intel and Nvidia manufacture the semiconductors in question, which have broad applications in datacenters and personal computers, according to the WSJ. CAEP acquired the chips through the purchase of computer systems used to study computational fluid dynamics, a field of research that involves modeling nuclear explosions. (RELATED: China Recruited Scientists Who Worked At Top US National Security Lab, Report Says)

The Commerce Department further expanded sanctions on CAEP in 2020, prohibiting the institution from obtaining items produced in the U.S. over concerns of its association with China’s military.

The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security also banned sales of equipment that can be used to manufacture the latest generations of semiconductors, measuring 10 nanometers and below, in 2020. Then, in October, it banned U.S. chipmakers from exporting chips to China with applications in AI and supercomputers, the WSJ reported.

At least 34 research papers CAEP published referenced the use of American semiconductors in research for purposes such as analyzing data and generating algorithms, according to the WSJ’s review. Of those, seven could translate to measures used to maintain nuclear stockpiles, experts told the outlet.

The Biden administration has doubled down on long-running exports to prevent Chinese military companies and institutions from accessing sensitive or highly advanced U.S. technology, including types of semiconductors and manufacturing equipment, according to the WSJ. The more sophisticated chips can power artificial intelligence machines and supercomputers underpinning much of today’s weapons and warfighting tactics.

CAEP obtained chips with transistors ranging from 7 nanometers to 14 nm, the former of which represents a sophistication level a Chinese semiconductor firm was discovered to have achieved in July, TechInsights found, and are still difficult for China to produce on a large scale, according to the WSJ. A narrower transistor width allows the chip to process data at greater speeds, according to Bloomberg.

None of the chips CAEP purchased represented the advanced versions available from U.S. companies since 2020, according to the WSJ.

Nvidia told the outlet the chips found in CAEP’s possession were commercially available, all-purpose graphics chips used in millions of personal computers worldwide. Intel said it complies with U.S. export restrictions.

However, those restrictions are “insanely difficult to enforce,” trade lawyer and former Commerce Department official Kevin Wolf told the WSJ.

The Treasury Department and the National Security Council did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

"US Defense Employees In Japan Struggle For Health Care After DOD Scaled Down Services, Failed To Tell Tokyo","Pentagon leaders failed to notify Tokyo it was restricting health care options at military bases for thousands of Department of Defense (DOD) civilian employees, Stars and Stripes reported Monday.

The Pentagon scaled down on-base medical facilities to deal with urgent or acute medical events only as of Jan. 1, telling thousands of non-military employees on DOD bases in Japan to seek care for chronic, long-term conditions within Japan’s health care system, Stars and Stripes reported. However, the U.S. never officially communicated the plan to Japanese authorities, leaving DOD civilians struggling to access routine medical care, individuals with knowledge of the matter told the outlet.

“We have not been specifically contacted by the U.S. side and we are not aware of the matter,” a spokesman for Japan’s ministry of foreign affairs told the outlet on Jan. 24. A ministry of defense spokesperson likewise said the ministry was not aware of the situation. (RELATED: Japan Reverses Course, Announces Largest Military Buildup Since WWII Amid Rising China Threat)

An official at Yokosuka Kyosai Hospital near Yokosuka Naval Base, the homeport of the U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet, said he learned of the policy from a Stars and Stripes inquiry in 2022 and as of Wednesday had yet to hear official word of the policy.

Japan is not obligated to provide health care to U.S. military personnel according to the status of forces agreement allowing U.S. armed forces to occupy Japanese territory.

“I can see that it’s difficult, particularly in Japan, most often because of a language barrier and they are thrown into a different health care environment, and I can see their struggle,” NTT Medical Center Tokyo Director Dr. Ryu Sasae told the outlet, adding that he learned of the policy change through unofficial channels.

Civilian employees scramble to claim appointment slots in family medicine, gynecology, pediatrics and internal medicine at DOD hospitals each morning, the outlet reported.

Defense Health Agency (DHA) Indo-Pacific regional director Army Maj. Gen. Joseph Heck advised DOD civilians to “have a plan in place” for alternative health care options in October, according to Stars and Stripes. On Jan. 1, military medical facilities limited capacity for serving DOD civilian employees to only space-available, same-day appointments.

“Treatment on a space available basis does not allow for continuous management of chronic health problems,” Heck said in a memo dated Dec. 9, the outlet reported.

U.S. Forces Japan “did recently notify” the government of Japan but could not confirm whether or how the government conveyed the DHA policy change to local hospitals, Gunnery Sgt. Jonathan Wright told Stars and Stripes Friday.

“The notification was made recently rather than prior to the effective date as its implementation across the medical treatment facilities in Japan was an evolving process, and as such we wanted to make official notifications with as much accuracy as possible and not cause confusion,” he wrote.

Here’s How The Chinese Responded When A US Spy Plane Neared Chinese Air Space,"Amid criticism that the Biden administration is demonstrating cowardice by not shooting down the Chinese surveillance balloon floating over the U.S., Americans are reminded how China responded when a U.S. spy plane neared Chinese airspace in 2001.

The Department of Defense (DoD) announced Thursday it was tracking a high-altitude suspected Chinese surveillance balloon the appears to be collecting data on sensitive U.S. sites over Montana. Montana is home to the Malmstrom Air Force Base, which houses Minuteman III nuclear missiles. Authorities have not ruled out shooting down the plane but have not indicated they plan to.

While President Joe Biden hesitates to show force, according to some on the right, when the tables were turned the Chinese did not hesitate to nearly take out a U.S. spy plane.

A U.S. Navy spy plane was conducting a routine surveillance mission just 50 miles southeast of China’s Hainan Island when a Chinese fighter jet intercepted the plane, forcing Americans to make an emergency landing in China, according to The New York Times. (RELATED: Trump’s Defense Sec. Pushes Back Against Claim Chinese Balloon Flew During Trump Admin)

The mid-air crash occurred in international waters shortly after the U.S.’s EP-3E Aries II aircraft departed from an air base in Japan. Then-Commander in Chief of the United States Pacific Command Adm. Dennis Blair said the Chinese planes had begun closely tailing the military aircraft months before the incident, the outlet reported.

The American aircraft intercepted a message from China’s Lingshui air base indicating two Chinese F-8 fighter jets were nearby. Suddenly one of the Chinese fighter jets approached the U.S. aircraft from the left and flew just 10 feet away from the plane’s wing, according to The Intercept. The Chinese pilot, Wang Wei, allegedly saluted the American crew before falling back 100 feet, the outlet reported. Wei again got dangerously close to the aircraft before mouthing something to the American crew before falling back, according to the report.

On a third attempt by Wei to communicate with Americans his plane got caught in one of the EP-3E propellers and caused his F-8 to split in half, The Intercept reported. The jet fell into the sea. American pilot, Navy Lt. Shane Osborn, managed to stabilize the U.S. aircraft.

Due to the damage, however, Osborn was forced to land in Chinese territory, prompting all crew onboard to try and destroy as much data as possible, the outlet noted. The plane was met with Chinese soldiers who held guns and shouted orders before the Americans were taken to military barracks at Lingshui.

U.S. diplomats were prohibited from meeting with the crew until three days after the collision.

Chinese authorities detained all 24 on board and held them for 11 days during which they underwent intense interrogations.

US Downs Chinese Spy Balloon,"The U.S. took down a Chinese spy balloon Saturday afternoon after the craft had traversed the continental U.S. over several days, the Associated Press reported.



The Pentagon was tracking the suspected Chinese spy balloon Saturday as it moved eastward across the Carolinas and over the Atlantic Ocean, The Wall Street Journal and the AP reported, citing officials and specialists familiar with the craft’s flight path. U.S. military jets were seen flying near the balloon and recovery vessels identified in the waters below, as footage of the operation appeared to depict an explosion before the balloon began falling toward the water, according to the AP.

“This afternoon, at the direction of President Biden, U.S. fighter aircraft assigned to U.S. Northern Command successfully brought down the high altitude surveillance balloon launched by and belonging to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) over the water off the coast of South Carolina in U.S. airspace,” Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told the Daily Caller News Foundation in a statement. (RELATED: Pentagon Confirms Reports Of Second Chinese Spy Balloon)

President Joe Biden had ordered the Pentagon to take action against the balloon, which the U.S. believes was spying on “strategic sites” in the U.S., as soon as it was safe to do so, according to the statement. The Pentagon “developed options to take down the balloon safely over our territorial waters, while closely monitoring its path and intelligence collection activities.”

“We’re gonna take care of it,” President Joe Biden told reporters earlier on Saturday, according to the WSJ.

In the lead up to the operation, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered a ground stop at airports in Wilmington, N.C., Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Charleston, S.C., blocking off airspace over North and South Carolina “to support the Department of Defense in a national security effort,” it said in a statement.

A U.S. official told the WSJ that destroying the balloon was an active consideration earlier on Saturday. The Pentagon had previously said all options were being considered but attempted to down the balloon in a way that would allow for the collection of as much of the debris as possible, according to the AP.

President Joe Biden was briefed regarding the surveillance balloon and requested military options, but Austin, after convening a meeting of senior leadership Wednesday, recommended against shooting it down to protect the safety of those who may fall in the path of debris. The balloon had a “limited value” to China for intelligence collection did not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground, officials said.

The balloon, which China claimed it intended to use for meteorological purposes only and was blown severely off course, had exhibited a flight pattern covering several “sensitive” U.S. sites and was traveling at an altitude of roughly 60,000 feet, defense officials said. Defense officials said it carried a surveillance payload and in total was the size of three school buses, the AP reported.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed his planned trip to China after the Department of Defense (DOD) disclosed knowledge of the suspected surveillance craft.

The Chinese Embassy to the U.S. did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

"‘Awareness Gap:’ US Failed To Detect Previous Chinese Spy Balloon Incursions Until After The Fact, General Says","North America Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), a combined U.S.-Canada airspace warning and defense organization, did not recognize previous instances of Chinese surveillance balloons entering U.S. territory, NORAD and U.S. Northern Command chief Gen. Glen VanHerck confirmed Monday.

Previous Chinese spy balloon incursions went unnoticed until after the craft had exited U.S. airspace, Biden administration officials, speaking anonymously, said Sunday, according to The Wall Street Journal. The intelligence community had retroactively identified the existence of three suspected Chinese spy balloons entering U.S. territory under former President Donald Trump and once at the beginning of the Biden administration, VanHerck confirmed in a briefing Monday.

“Every day as a NORAD commander, it’s my responsibility to detect threats to North America,” VanHerck said. “We did not detect those threats, and that’s a domain awareness gap that we have to figure out.”

The intelligence community “after the fact” assessed balloon threats through “additional means of collection,” he said. Intelligence agencies alerted NORAD of balloons that had previously approached or transited North America, according to VanHerck, but the general did not say when those assessments were completed.

However, some Trump administration national security officials have publicly denied knowledge of previous alleged Chinese surveillance balloons intruding on U.S. territory. (RELATED: Trump Officials Offer Inconsistent Explanations About Prior Chinese Spy Balloons)

All three national security advisers under Trump — John Bolton, H.R. McMaster and Robert O’Brien — said they had no knowledge of balloon incursions, according to the WSJ.

“I had no knowledge of any incursions into U.S. airspace as national security adviser, either during my time as national security adviser or before I got there, nor was I briefed on any China issues like this,” O’Brien said.

“It never happened,” former acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Richard Grenell told Newsmax, adding that he has declined the Biden administration’s offer of a post-facto briefing on the apparent earlier incursions.

“As to the alleged three instances of China flying surveillance balloons over the U.S. during the Trump administration, I noted that Mr. Trump has denied the claim,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Monday.

NORAD did detect the most recent balloon as it approached Alaska and first penetrated U.S. airspace, VanHerck said.

“It was my assessment that this balloon did not present a physical military threat to North America,” the general said in answer to a question on why the U.S. did not down the balloon over Alaska. “Therefore I could not take immediate action because it was not demonstrating hostile acts or hostile intent.”

NORAD was granted special authorities to collect intelligence on the balloon as it traversed U.S. territory, he added. The Air Force finally shot down the balloon on Saturday off the coast of South Carolina into shallow waters, allowing the military to retrieve sections of the craft’s surveillance equipment.

The U.S. military has established a 1,500 meter by 1,500 meter estimated collection plane where they are gathering debris from the craft, VanHerck said. The balloon portion was estimated at 200 feet in height and carried a surveillance payload roughly the size of a jetliner, weighing several thousand pounds.

US Oil Giant Turns Attention To Africa Amid Biden Crackdown On Russia,"U.S. oil giant Chevron has restarted talks with the Algerian government to close an energy exploration deal as the company looks to replace Russian oil, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.

Although U.S. companies have scaled down their activity in both the Middle East and Africa due to political concerns, sanctions on Russian oil and gas supplies have prompted Chevron to make the regions a priority, according to the WSJ. Chevron had previously signed a memorandum of understanding with Algerian state-run gas firm Sonatarch to engage in oil and gas exploration in 2020, but progress had largely stalled until the past two months. (RELATED: Back To Petroleum: BP Is Scaling Back Its Green Investments Amid Disappointing Performance)

“Algeria holds a world-class petroleum system with significant potential for conventional and unconventional oil-and-gas exploration,” a Chevron spokeswoman told the WSJ. The same spokeswoman declined to give the WSJ any details on Chevron’s business opportunities, but noted the company had reached an agreement with the Algerian government to access data regarding three of its largest natural gas reservoirs.

Chevron, which shattered its yearly profits record in 2022 after oil prices skyrocketed, has invested heavily in U.S. shale and intends to take advantage of the technology it has developed for that purpose in Algeria, the WSJ reported. The company has spoken with several Algerian officials and hired consultants to evaluate the country’s resources, which are estimated to be the third-largest recoverable source of shale in the world.

“The region needs gas, both regionally in the Middle East, but also then obviously options to try to get that gas into Europe,” CEO Mike Wirth told analysts in a yearly report in January, the WSJ reported.

Chevron did not immediately respond to a Daily Caller News Foundation request for comment.

Ro Khanna Favors ‘Forced Sale’ Of TikTok To US Company,"Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California said Monday he was in favor of a “forced sale” of the Chinese-owned social media app TikTok to an American company during a Monday appearance on CNBC.

“I believe there should be a forced sale to an American company. You can’t just ban something that millions of young people are using,” Khanna told CNBC host Joe Kernan. “But the issues are very serious about who’s collecting this data, is it being used to manipulate information to many American young people?” (RELATED: Rep. Adam Schiff Fundraises On China-Owned TikTok After Getting Booted From Intel Committee)

TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a China-based company that reportedly requires employees to attend monthly meetings to study Chinese Community Party policies, CNN reported. The company’s executives refused to stop sending data to China, where employees of ByteDance reportedly access the information, during a September hearing.

WATCH:

The United States Air Force shot down a Chinese spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina Saturday. The balloon, which China claimed was a civilian meteorological research platform, drifted over states where bases housing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and strategic bombers like the B-2 Spirit, are located.

The Department of Defense confirmed a second balloon, similar to the one shot down off South Carolina, was flying over Latin America Friday.

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas banned TikTok and a number of other apps, most tied to China, from government devices Monday, calling the apps a security threat.

“The security risks associated with the use of TikTok on devices used to conduct the important business of our state must not be underestimated or ignored,” Abbot said in a statement. “Owned by a Chinese company that employs Chinese Communist Party members, TikTok harvests significant amounts of data from a user’s device.”

The House of Representatives and Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly of Kansas also issued bans on the Chinese-owned social media app.

“We’re sorry to see the unintended consequences of these rushed TikTok bans—policies that will do nothing to advance cybersecurity— beginning to impact universities’ ability to share information, recruit students, and build communities around athletic teams, student groups, campus publications, and more,” a spokesperson for TikTok told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

US Notches Record Trade Deficit In 2022 — Thanks Partly To China,"The U.S. trade deficit increased to its highest recorded level in 2022, thanks in part to a surging trade deficit with China.

The U.S. registered a roughly $948.1 billion goods and services deficit for the year, including a $382.9 billion goods deficit to China, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) revealed Tuesday. This 12.2% surge over 2021 marks an all-time U.S. trade deficit record, The Wall Street Journal reported. (RELATED: White House Sends Out Error-Laden Economy ‘Fact Sheet’ On Eve Of SOTU)

The yearly goods deficit with China increased by around $29.4 billion in 2022 and far outpaced that with any other country: the U.S. reached yearly deficits of about $203.9 billion and $130.6 billion with the European Union and Mexico respectively, recording a $76.2 billion surplus with South and Central America, based on BEA data.

U.S. exports fell by approximately $2.2 billion in December compared to November, coinciding with a $4.2 billion imports surge, the statistics indicate. However, the December goods deficit to China was $3.0 billion higher than during the previous month.

China experienced one of its worst economic growth years in decades and its first-ever population decline since 1961 in 2022, Reuters reported. General Administration of Customs statistics indicated the country’s overall exports sank 9.9% in December, according to CNN.

The U.S. trade deficit rose as the Federal Reserve hiked its target federal-funds interest rate several times in 2022. That trend has continued into 2023, with a 0.25% interest rate increase Wednesday.

US Conducts Nuclear Missile Test Launch,"The U.S. launched an unarmed but nuclear-capable Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Thursday night in what the Pentagon characterized as a display of the U.S.’ effective nuclear deterrent against hostile foreign powers.

The Minuteman III missile successfully took off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California at 11:09 p.m, according to a statement. While the Air Force stressed that such launches have occurred hundreds of times in the past and are not correlated with ongoing world events, it takes place amid recent news of Chinese and North Korean nuclear buildup that could threaten America’s defenses and ability to deter future attacks.

“These test launches demonstrate the readiness of U.S. nuclear forces and provide confidence in the lethality and effectiveness of the nation’s nuclear deterrent,” Col. Bryan Titus, Space Launch Delta 30 vice commander and launch decision authority, said in the statement. (RELATED: US Accuses Russia Of Violating Major Nuclear Treaty Amid Tension Over Ukraine)

The head of U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) notified Congress on Jan. 26 that China’s construction of ground-based ICBM launchers had exceeded those operated by the U.S., The Wall Street Journal reported. Many of those silos are empty, and the U.S.’ total nuclear arsenal, including air, land and sea-based capabilities, is still much larger than China’s, officials said.

However, the news highlighted China’s rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal and concurrent U.S. efforts to modernize its nuclear triad. The Pentagon intends to replace the Minuteman III ICBMs with the LG-35A Sentinel by 2029, the Air Force said.

Thursday’s ICBM launch was months in the works and involved planning from the Department of Defense, Department of Energy and STRATCOM, according to the Air Force.

“A test launch displays the heart of our deterrence mission on the world’s stage, assuring our nation and its allies that our weapons are capable and our Airmen are ready and willing to defend peace across the globe at a moment’s notice,” Gen. Thomas A. Bussiere, Air Force Global Strike Command commander, said.

North Korea showed off a massively expanded intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) arsenal capable of ferrying nuclear warheads to the U.S. in a Wednesday-night parade. North Korea had never displayed that many nuclear-capable missiles at once, signaling the country’s resolve to achieve “tremendous nuclear strike capability,” state media said, and overpower U.S. defenses, according to the WSJ.

Photos of the parade demonstrated potential further advancements, including launch vehicles specified for solid-fueled ICBMs that adversaries could struggle to identify and intercept, Reuters reported. The vehicles indicate North Korea may be preparing to test the advanced missiles, analysts said.

The U.S. operates 44 ground-based interceptors on its western coastline intended to destroy incoming IBCMs, according to the Missile Defense Agency. However, if North Korea could fit four warheads on each missile, it could potentially overwhelm U.S. defenses.

In addition to working on upgrades to aging nuclear capabilities, the U.S. has made efforts to deepen military cooperation with South Korea and Japan to ward off potential aggression from perceived threats from China and North Korea, Politico reported.

JOSH HAMMER: Where Do US-China Relations Stand After The Spy Balloon Fiasco?,"The utterly humiliating saga of a high-altitude Chinese surveillance “balloon” successfully traversing the entire North American continent, only to be shot down off the South Carolina coast after completing its intelligence-gathering voyage, ought to serve as a wake-up call for America’s decadent ruling class.

At Newsweek, Paul du Quenoy sagely compared the affair to the young West German pilot Mathias Rust’s successful 1987 landing of his small Cessna just outside Moscow’s Red Square, a similarly “irreparable blight” wherein a “sclerotic empire’s air defense systems stood powerless at the sight of an airborne foreign intruder.” (RELATED: DEROY MURDOCK: China’s Dominance In One Market Could Literally Be The Death Of Us. Here’s How)

That comparison is damning, but proper. True, a different and less senile commander in chief might have — and should have — responded in swifter and more decisive fashion, but the sheer fact of the matter is that America’s geopolitical arch-foe felt emboldened to act as it did. The relevant question now presented to America’s ruling class is whether it has the humility to soberly acknowledge the fallen state of U.S.-China relations and to chart a path forward that best secures the national interest of our ailing and war-weary republic.

As Sohrab Ahmari chronicled in his most recent column for The American Conservative, post-Cold War U.S. foreign policy vis-a-vis China has typically fallen into one of two categorical buckets: “integrationism” and “confrontationism.” But as Ahmari notes, in “horseshoe theory” of politics fashion, these two schools of thought on U.S.-China relations actually share a great deal in common with one another.

The reason for that is simple: The “let China join the World Trade Organization”-style economic integrationists and the “defend Taiwan at all costs”-style foreign policy confrontationists both share an underlying conceit that we still live in a unipolar global moment of American geopolitical, economic, military and cultural hegemony.

That is a delusion, as this column argued nearly a year ago, after the Russo-Ukrainian War flared up. The unipolar moment of unquestioned American hegemony that briefly existed in the aftermath of the Cold War is, in fact, now over.

Whatever our issues may be with the Beijing regime and the regnant Communist Party of China — and I have many — it is simply undeniable at this juncture that China is a great power, with an intimidating nuclear arsenal and a sprawling “Belt and Road Initiative” of global economic clout. This necessarily demands a hard-headed, “great power competition”-inspired geostrategy. As this same column nearly a year ago put it: “We must reconcile ourselves … to the inevitability of China’s continual rise and the likely return of a new Cold War-resemblant global chessboard.”

The era of globalism is over; the imperative now is to decouple, reshore and renationalize. Moreover, to help undermine “Belt and Road,” the U.S. can try to enter strategic bilateral trade deals with nations that might otherwise fall to Beijing’s economic predations. The economic realm, more so than any other area, is where an ailing and decadent U.S. can still make a dent and make the Chinese Politburo feel pain — while also buttressing America’s own economic hand, in line with the national developmentalist tradition.

But in the area of foreign policy and national security, the imperative is to be sober, realistic and restrained. True, a worthier commander in chief than the doddering dolt from Delaware would have shot the Chinese surveillance balloon out of the sky the moment it crossed over into sovereign U.S. airspace. But to secure the territorial integrity of American airspace is one thing; to seek to project militaristic strength within the territorial sphere of influence of a fellow great power — again, no matter how noxious to our sensibilities such a great power may be — is something else entirely.

For example, as much as we may ardently desire preventing Beijing from swallowing up comparatively free and economically critical Taiwan — news flash: only 100 miles east of the Chinese mainland —one sober conclusion to draw from the end of the unipolar moment is the obvious geographical reality that Taiwan sits comfortably within China’s broader sphere of influence.

In this sense, the twin imperatives of “economic hawkishness” and foreign policy realism dovetail nicely: the foreseeability of China’s exertion of pressure on Taiwan, and its possible full invasion and absorption of the island, ought to galvanize the U.S. to expedite the reshoring and redevelopment of its lagging semiconductor industry. The recently passed CHIPS Act, though imperfect, was a worthy (if ham-fisted) first step in this direction.

America’s ruling class, which is all too frequently entangled in an economic bed with China, far too often approaches these matters with an unhealthy dose of wistfulness. It is always far easier, alas, to act as one wishes the world to be, and not as it is. But if our self-regarding elites care about one thing, it is surely their own standing and, ultimately, their own survival.

Here’s hoping they sober up on the Chinese challenge faster than the Soviets did after their own “airborne foreign intruder” incident of 1987.

US Jet Shoots Down Second High-Altitude Object Over Canada,"UPDATE: This story has been updated to include a statement from the Department of Defense (DOD).

A U.S. fighter jet shot down a second unidentified flying object over Canada on Saturday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement.

Trudeau spoke with President Joe Biden this afternoon after North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), which is responsible for joint U.S.-Canada aerospace warning and defense, identified the object in Canadian airspace, the leader said in a statement. Canadian and U.S. jets mobilized to intercept the object, and at Trudeau’s order and Biden’s authorization it was downed by a U.S. F-22 jet, U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) Press Secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder confirmed in a statement.

“A U.S. F-22 shot down the object in Canadian territory using an AIM 9X missile following close coordination between U.S. and Canadian authorities, to include a call today between Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III and Minister of Defence Anita Anand,” Ryder said. (RELATED: US Conducts Nuclear Missile Test Launch)

The object was shot down at 3:41 p.m. Eastern Standard Time over central Yukon at an altitude of 40,000 feet, Anand said. The object is believed to be “cylindrical in shape” and smaller than the Chinese spy balloon downed off the coast of South Carolina but “potentially similar,” she added.

The Canadian military will recover the debris from the object, Trudeau added. The FBI and Canadian Royal Mounted Police will cooperate to help both countries learn more about the object, Ryder said.

NORAD had identified an object traversing Alaskan territory Friday evening, Ryder said. Two F-22 aircraft monitored the object, “tracking it closely and taking time to characterize the nature of the object,” as it crossed into sovereign Canadian airspace Saturday, when two Canadian jets joined the sortie.

“U.S. military aircraft are currently operating from Alaska and Canada in support of [NORAD] activities. NORAD confirms that we have positively identified a high-altitude airborne object over Northern Canada,” the command said in a statement earlier Friday, CNN reported.

NORAD did not provide further details on activities or the object in question.

I ordered the take down of an unidentified object that violated Canadian airspace. @NORADCommand shot down the object over the Yukon. Canadian and U.S. aircraft were scrambled, and a U.S. F-22 successfully fired at the object. — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) February 11, 2023

The event happened roughly one day after U.S. jets assigned to U.S. Northern Command took down a high-altitude object off the northern coast of Alaska at Biden’s order. U.S. officials said the object was traveling at an altitude of 40,000 feet and could therefore pose a threat to commercial air traffic, justifying a military response.

The object was first spotted on Feb. 9 and tracked as it entered U.S. airspace and traveled in a northeasterly direction, according to Ryder.

NORAD said in a statement Saturday that recovery efforts for the object were ongoing as the icy conditions permitted.

China Claims US ‘High-Altitude Balloons’ Entered Chinese Airspace More Than 10 Times Since 2022,"The People’s Republic of China (PRC) claimed that multiple U.S. “high-altitude balloons” violated China’s airspace in the last year.

While demanding that the U.S. should “change its ways,” China’s foreign minister, Wang Wenbin, claimed that U.S. “high-altitude balloons” trespassed into China’s airspace more than 10 times since January 2022, yet declined to provide additional details during a press conference in Beijing on Monday, according to the report. China’s allegation comes a little over a week after the U.S. Air Force shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the coast of the Carolinas on Feb. 4 which had floated over the continental U.S. in the preceding days. (RELATED: Biden Appointed Member Of Alleged Chinese Communist Front Group To Rep US Business In Asia)

“Any claim that the U.S. government operates surveillance balloons over the PRC is false,” Adrienne Watson, National Security Council spokesperson, tweeted Monday.

“It is China that has a high-altitude surveillance balloon program for intelligence collection, that it has used to violate the sovereignty of the U.S. and over 40 countries across five continents,” she continued.

In addition to the suspected Chinese spy balloon, the U.S. military has since downed three additional unidentified aircraft flying over North America including a “high-altitude airborne object” on Feb. 10 discovered off Alaska’s north coast, a “cylindrical” aircraft over Canada on Feb. 11 and an “octagonal” object flying over Lake Huron on Feb. 12.

“It’s unlikely that the most recent three unidentified objects belong to China as they flew at much lower altitudes compared to the Chinese high-altitude balloon,” Lu Xiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), told Chinese state-run media outlet Global Times on Monday.

“Judging from the altitude, they are completely different types of objects,” Lu said.

Yet, CASS is controlled by the State Council of the Chinese Communist Party, according to Chinese government records, and “many” CASS personnel allegedly covertly work for Chinese intelligence agencies, such as the Ministry of State Security, Alex Joske, former Chinese intelligence analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, wrote in “Spies and Lies.”

Palestinian School Backed By US Gov Celebrated Terrorist Who Murdered 7 At Synagogue,"A Palestinian school backed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) held a ceremony celebrating the deaths of seven Israelis killed at a Jerusalem synagogue in January, according to the school’s Facebook post.

Omariya Secondary School for Girls in Qalqilya, Palestine, was established in 2009 via funding from USAID, according to the school’s Facebook profile, and has a “computer center,” “fashion design studio,” “scientific laboratory” and 29 teachers. The school held a ceremony on Jan. 30 commemorating the “hero Khairy Alqum” who killed seven Israelis in a terror attack on Jan. 27, according to a Facebook post.

“A distinguished view of the students of the Cultural Club, a stand in solidarity with our people in Jenin camp, and a lamentation for our martyrs and hero Khairy Alqum,” the post read, according to a Facebook translation.

In pictures taken of the event, the students and teachers could be seen outside the school with a USAID placard on one of the school walls, according to the post.

USAID sponsored initiatives at the school under the Local Government and Structural program (LGI), according to a USAID report from 2013 to 2014, and sponsored more initiatives from 2014 to 2015 under the “Let’s Change It” project. The school participated in the Female Role Models Initiative that aimed to promote “leadership skills, and worked on projects promoting women’s leadership and potential in their communities,” according to the report.

USAID did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s multiple requests for comment.

Khairy Alqum, a Palestinian from Eastern Jerusalem, opened fire in a Jewish synagogue on Jan. 27, killing 7 people. Alqum was killed after Israeli police arrived on scene and chased him down.

The event was not the first time the school celebrated terrorists; in December 2022, students and teachers alike cheered for the release of Karim Younes, a Palestinian terrorist that killed an IDF soldier in 1980. Earlier that year, the school showed pictures of terrorist Ibrahim Al Nabulsi, who carried out multiple attacks against Jews and Israelis and was later killed by the Israel Defense Forces, during a graduation ceremony, according to posts from the school’s social media.

The initial post was first reported by Israeli journalist Ishay Fridman on Twitter, who has extensively covered Palestinian schools that celebrate the acts of terrorists and even the terrorists themselves.

“Last week we published about the brainwashing that is carried out in Palestinian educational institutions where students and teachers praise the terrorist from the Neve Ya’akov attack,” Fridman wrote on Twitter. “This week we will publish that part of this activity is done under the auspices of American funding.”

NGO Monitor, a watchdog aiming to hold nongovernmental organizations accountable, published a report in 2021 documenting American funding that was allegedly being used to support and promote Palestinian terrorism. The report titled “USAID-funded Palestinian NGOs: Introducing Children to Convicted Terrorists” found that from 2015-2019, three different NGOs involved in educational programs supporting Palestinian terrorists were given millions of dollars by USAID.

Many of these programs, according to the report, introduced children to terrorism.

“In practice, as shown below, a number of USAID sub-grantees ran programs that introduced children to convicted terrorists, presented convicted terrorists as role models, and publicly demonstrated support for terrorists and terrorist organizations,” the report read.

The report criticized USAID’s process of vetting NGOs who requested funding and found that the agency did not have “mandatory language about anti-terror requirements” or ways to verify that “sub-grantees had procedures in place to meet these requirements.” Additionally, even when sub-grantees were vetted it was often “incomplete or conducted” after the money had been approved.

A spokesperson for the White House directed the DCNF to the State Department and USAID when asked for comment, while the State Department declined to comment.

LIPSMAN: The Costly Fumble That Has The US Playing Defense On The World Stage,"In American football, when a player fumbles the ball, his team loses the chance to advance across the field. Even worse, the power dynamic of the whole game shifts if the opposing team gains possession of the ball. The failed withdrawal from Afghanistan was a costly fumble not just for the U.S. but also for the Afghan people. Lives were lost, diplomatic relations deteriorated, and China gained an ally. We knew $7.1B in U.S.-funded military equipment that was left behind fell into the hands of the Taliban.

Americans should know that the fall of Afghanistan has had major geopolitical implications far beyond the borders of this devastated Middle Eastern country. The U.S. cannot afford to ignore these implications. Figuratively speaking, we have to recover the ball, so we aren’t stuck playing defense against an increasingly aggressive Russia and China.

The U.S. government along with the State and Commerce Departments are sticklers when it comes to exporting military equipment to other countries, especially those that are on the Countries of Concern (CoC) list. However, following the botched withdrawal, much of that advanced military equipment and weapons did not make it back to the United States. The Taliban seized on this opportunity to use the equipment for other conflicts across the globe.

Regardless of your views on U.S. military aid to Ukraine, we have a bigger concern with what type of U.S. military equipment may be in Russia’s arsenal. We know that Russia has become even closer with Afghanistan, specifically the Taliban, after the U.S. withdrawal a year and a half ago. Even though some deny that the Taliban are providing weapons to Russia, we can’t help but wonder if the recruited Afghan soldiers brought their own U.S. military equipment to the fight against Ukraine.

But it’s not just Russia that is benefiting from these weapons; the Taliban are diversifying their outreach into other parts of the world. NBC News reported that U.S. weapons surfaced in Kashmir, a highly contested South Asian region between Pakistan and India. This is significant, as the U.S. already has an unstable relationship with Pakistan, in part because the U.S. is building coalitions and partnerships with their adversary, India. This is driving Pakistan closer to China.

In The Chinese Military Power – 2022 report, China calls out Pakistan as their international partner. The Foreign Affairs Minister of Pakistan, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, has called China its second home. Furthermore, in recent days, the Financial Times reported a potential financial crisis in Pakistan due to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suspending disbursements of a $7 billion assistance package which was halted last year. Coincidently, this comes right before Pakistan’s elections, where the current prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, is being challenged by former ousted prime minister, Imran Khan, who is widely popular among Pakistanis and is outspokenly anti-America.

While the U.S. continues to stumble over itself on the global stage with weak foreign affairs and relations policies, China continues to build up its circle of allies. We need a long-term strategy that includes increased diplomatic and economic pressures. We must strengthen our alliances across the world, especially in key countries. And most importantly, we need to hold our adversaries accountable for their actions.

Sometimes in a football game, the highlight reel shows how key plays changed the dynamic and direction of the whole game. The fall of Afghanistan was a key moment in the global power game — and a bad one for the United States. Our rivals are effectively capitalizing on our catastrophic exit from the country, and we seem to have no effective response. Our leadership — and the American people — need to fully take stock of how our failure in Afghanistan shifted momentum globally. We must avoid fumbles like this in the future, and implement a winning strategy instead.

US Recovered Possible Spying Equipment From Downed Chinese Balloon,"The U.S. said Monday it has recovered key intelligence-collecting sensors from the Chinese spy balloon downed in the Atlantic Ocean on Feb. 4, Reuters reported.

For nine days, the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard have worked to pull debris from the craft — both the balloon portion and the surveillance equipment that was described as roughly the size of three school buses — from shallow waters off the coast of South Carolina. The U.S. military shot down the balloon, which the Department of Defense (DOD) is confident serves as a Chinese surveillance tool, on Feb. 4 after it transited much of North America and hovered over “sensitive sites,” officials said.

“Crews have been able to recover significant debris from the site, including all of the priority sensor and electronics pieces identified as well as large sections of the structure,” the U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) said in a statement, according to Reuters. (RELATED: The Navy Quietly Reshuffled The Super Bowl Flyover Team To All-Female Aviators)

After equipment is extracted from the ocean, the FBI is responsible for analyzing the equipment to discover its purpose and capabilities. The balloon’s “payload,” or the actual surveillance portion carrying possible photography and sensing equipment, broke apart at some point, an official told CBS News.

U.S. officials have indicated with confidence that the balloon, first disclosed to the public on Feb. 2, belonged to the People’s Republic of China and was being used to spy on the U.S. as a component of a broader Chinese intelligence campaign. However, they have declined to connect the latest incidents to the first spy balloon, which was much larger and traveling at higher altitudes, consistent with previous balloon sightings.

The U.S. shot down an object over Alaska on Friday, one in Canadian airspace on Saturday and another on Sunday that splashed down in Lake Huron.

“What we’re seeing is very, very small objects that produce a very, very low radar cross-section,” Gen. Glen VanHerck, commander of North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and NORTHCOM, told reporters Sunday night. That’s distinct from the spy balloon and makes the object more difficult for pilots whizzing through the sky to spot.

The first missile fired at the object over Lake Huron missed, requiring a second shot, an official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

The U.S. has yet to recover debris from the other three unknown objects downed over the weekend after penetrating North American airspace, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said after touching down in Brussels for a regular North American Treaty Organization (NATO) meeting on Ukraine aid.

“As we have said, we do not assess that the recent objects pose any direct threat to the people on the ground and we will continue to focus on confirming their nature and purpose,” Austin said.

“We don’t know if they were actually collecting intelligence,” he continued. The U.S. military recommended they be removed from the skies “out of an abundance of caution” to protect commercial traffic in U.S. airspace and prevent the possibility of adversaries gathering information on U.S. military sites. “We want to make sure that we have the ability to examine what these things are and potentially what they were doing.”

US Establishes ‘Interagency Team’ To Study UFOs,"The U.S. has established an “interagency team” to further study “unidentified aerial objects,” after detecting and shooting down several in recent weeks, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby announced Monday.

“The president, through his national security advisor, has today directed an interagency team to study the broader policy implications for detection, analysis, and disposition of unidentified aerial objects that pose either safety or security risks,” Kirby said at a White House press conference.

Biden also “directed the secretary of state, the secretary of defense, and the director of national intelligence to engage with their relevant counterparts to share information and to try to gain their perspectives” and “instructed the Intelligence Community to take a broad look at the phenomenon of unidentified aerial objects,” Kirby added. (RELATED: ‘Sank To The Bottom Of The Atlantic’: Kirby Says He Doesn’t Know When All Chinese Spy Balloon Debris Will Be Recovered)

On Feb. 4, the Air Force downed a Chinese spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina after it had spent the previous week floating across the continental United States. Biden’s military advisers suggested that firing on the balloon when it was over the water would be the safest way to destroy it, and divers have not yet recovered all the balloon materials that sank to the “bottom of the Atlantic,” Kirby said.

“They were able to take things off the surface … some of the balloon fabric,” he added. “They have been able to recover some, not all, of the payload that sank to the bottom of the Atlantic. It’s in about 45 feet of water. Weather conditions are pretty tough off the coast right now.”

Military aircraft shot three more objects out of the sky after the Chinese balloon — one over Alaska, one over Canada and one over Lake Huron. The U.S. has not located the debris from any of these objects and does not know where they came from, and what they were, Kirby said.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/14/us-interagency-team-study-ufos-chinese-balloon/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjevojKobP9AhUks1YBHYXsC1g4RhAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw1vTnlQbbWjNaeEap6Jlykx,2023-02-14
"US Teachers Are Peddling Same ‘Woke Ideologies’ Taught In North Korean Classrooms, Defector Says","A defector from North Korea said Tuesday “woke ideologies” taught in American classrooms are no different from those taught in the classrooms in her home country.

“When I came to America, having no idea, I thought somehow this was a free country where individuals can have different thoughts and opinions. When I started university at Columbia University, I couldn’t believe because they were exactly saying the same things that my North Korean teachers told me in the North Korean classroom,” Yeonmi Park, author of the book “While Time Remains: A North Korean Defector’s Search for Freedom in America,” told Fox News host Sandra Smith. (RELATED: Teachers, CRT Advocate Discuss How To Sneak Teaching About ‘White Privilege’ Past ‘Trump Country’ Parents)

WATCH:

“They said all the problems that we have in the world is because of the greedy capitalism and also the Western civilization and white man,” Park, who defected from North Korea in 2007, said. “That was the exact same thing that my North Korean teachers told me, that all the evils was because of USA and capitalism.”

The contents of school curricula became a hot-button political issue in 2021 as parents protested the use of Critical Race Theory, which holds that America is fundamentally racist, and teaches people to view every social interaction and person in terms of race.

Columbia promoted a course that allowed students to “critically engage with whiteness” in September 2021, months after Park called her experience at the Ivy League school “complete madness.” Judicial Watch said in June that materials obtained through the Freedom of Information Act showed that West Point was teaching Critical Race Theory, while the Air Force Academy hosted a seminar on “transgender visibility” in September.

“At Columbia, professors are saying the only solution to all these problems is a communist revolution, we need to dismantle the system in the name of equity,” Park said.

British Energy Giant BP To Spend $1.3 Billion Buying Footing Into US Fuel Center Market,"London-listed energy company, BP, announced Thursday it will spend over $1 billion to acquire a top U.S. full-service travel center network.

BP will buy TravelCenters of America (TA), which boasts 280 locations across 44 U.S. states, in a $1.3 billion all-cash deal that will give the energy giant “growth opportunities for 4 of bp’s 5 transition growth engines,” according to the company’s press release.

The five strategic transition growth engines for BP include convenience, EV charging, biofuels, renewable natural gas (RNG) and hydrogen, the company stated. BP said it hopes purchasing TA will give the company an instant boost in its “convenience” category nationwide due to “TA’s strategically-located network of highway sites” that will combine with its “predominantly off-highway convenience and mobility business.”

BP currently has over 8,000 off-highway locations, chairman and president of BP America, Dave Lawler, said in the company’s press release.

“These travel centers, which average around 25 acres, offer a full range of facilities for vehicles and fleet trucks, including more than 600 full-service and quick service restaurants, as well as truck maintenance and repair services,” according to the company. “Around 70% of TA’s total gross margin is generated by its convenience services business, almost double bp’s global convenience gross margin.”

The energy company is seeking to significantly grow investments in its convenience category related to bioenergy and electric vehicle (EV) charging, aiming to put half of its cumulative $55-65 billion investment into these transition growth engines from 2023-2030, according to the press release.

BP announced Wednesday it plans to invest $1 billion into increasing its ability to offer EV charging stations globally by 2030. (RELATED: Americans Getting Poorer As Real Disposable Income Plummets Over A Trillion Dollars In 2022)

“This is bp’s strategy in action. We are doing exactly what we said we would, leaning into our transition growth engines. This deal will grow our convenience and mobility footprint across the US and grow earnings with attractive returns. Over time, it will allow us to advance four of our five strategic transition growth engines. By enabling growth in EV charging, biofuels and RNG and later hydrogen, we can help our customers decarbonize their fleets. It’s a compelling combination,” BP CEO Bernard Looney said in the press release.

Trump’s Intelligence Community Knew About Suspicious Balloons In US Airspace,"A small group of Pentagon intelligence officials under former President Donald Trump were aware of suspicious objects invading U.S. airspace but did not reach definitive conclusions and never reported the incidents to the White House, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing former U.S. government officials.

Revelations could explain how the Department of Defense (DOD) under President Joe Biden tracked sightings of what are now assessed as Chinese spy balloons back to the Trump administration, a claim former high level Trump officials have disputed or denied. While some officials under Trump suspected China had fielded the flying objects, the assessment, reached in the summer of 2020, was inconclusive and therefore not shared widely across the U.S. government, the former officials told the WSJ.

The intelligence “never got to be assertive,” one of the officials told the WSJ. As a result, the Pentagon’s intelligence agency could not attribute the objects to a Chinese spying program. (RELATED: The Chinese Spy Balloon May Have Accidentally Flown Over The US Mainland. GOP Lawmakers Say It Doesn’t Matter)

Intelligence analysts suspected China had been using the balloons to test radar jamming technology over sensitive U.S. military sites, the WSJ reported.

However, those objects, now thought to be balloons, were much smaller, flew at lower altitudes and logged fewer flight hours than the known Chinese surveillance balloon shot down off the coast of South Carolina, the officials told the WSJ.

The Pentagon detected aerial objects over U.S. Navy installations in Coronado, California, Norfolk, Virginia and Guam, the officials told the outlet. In addition, unlike the latest known incident, where the Chinese surveillance airship floated across the entire North American continent from Alaska to South Carolina, these suspected balloons hovered over U.S. territory only briefly.

Numerous DOD sources and intelligence assets collected data on the balloon overflights, the officials told the WSJ. However, agencies are not mandated to share that kind of specialized information and often do not, they added.

Mark Esper, a former secretary of defense under Trump, previously told the WSJ he did not recall receiving a briefing on the unidentified aerial objects.

Biden administration defense officials said the Pentagon had retroactively identified balloons that transited sensitive U.S. sites under the Trump administration and associated them with a broader Chinese surveillance program. At the time, however, the balloons entered U.S. airspace undetected, they said.

A Pentagon spokesperson confirmed to the WSJ that DOD analysts were aware of the possible balloons and had been tracking incidents but never divulged the intelligence to senior leadership.

The Biden administration’ Office of the Director of National Intelligence briefed former top Trump officials, including former national security advisers Robert O’Brien and John Bolton, former deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe on Wednesday, the WSJ reported.

O’Brien told the WSJ the surveillance balloon downed on Feb. 4 exhibited notably distinct characteristics from prior sightings.

"US Abandons Search For Unidentified Aerial Objects Shot Down Over Alaska, Lake Huron","The U.S. military abandoned its search for the two mysterious airborne objects downed within U.S. airspace roughly one week ago, having found no debris, U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said in a statement Friday night.

Arctic conditions and instability caused by sea ice contributed to the decision to call off the military and FBI’s search for the object shot down on Feb. 10 in Deadhorse, Alaska, despite employing a variety of search capabilities, the statement said. Surface searches and underwater scanning likewise failed to turn up any evidence of debris related to the object an F-22 fighter jet shot down over Lake Huron just two days later.

“The U.S. military, federal agencies, and Canadian partners conducted systematic searches of each area using a variety of capabilities, including airborne imagery and sensors, surface sensors and inspections, and subsurface scans,” the joint command said. (RELATED: The Chinese Spy Balloon May Have Accidentally Flown Over The US Mainland. GOP Lawmakers Say It Doesn’t Matter)

However, searches “did not locate debris,” the statement added.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin concurred with the recommendation to discontinue the search, according to NORTHCOM/NORAD. Air and maritime safety perimeters established around the search areas were also lifted.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police also halted efforts to locate debris from the object shot down over Canadian airspace on Feb. 11, saying the area where remains of the object had the “highest probability” of crashing down to earth did not yield search results.

“Given the snowfall that has occurred, the decreasing probability the object will be found and the current belief the object is not tied to a scenario that justifies extraordinary search efforts, the RCMP is terminating the search,” the force said in a statement Friday.

President Joe Biden said Thursday the intelligence community believes the most likely explanation for the objects terminated in quick succession over U.S. airspace are benign and of civilian origin. They could have been research balloons or recreational, he said, and are unrelated to the known Chinese spy balloon that floated over the North American airspace for several days.

The spy balloon was much larger and traveling at altitudes at least 20,000 feet higher than the remaining three objects.

“I gave the order to take down these objects due to hazards to civilian commercial air traffic, and because we could not rule out the surveillance risk of sensitive facilities,” Biden said.

At least one organization has come forth with a possible explanation for one of the objects. The Northern Illinois Bottlecap Balloon Brigade, a hobby group, says one of their globetrotting balloons mysteriously disappeared in Alaska the same day NORAD shot down an object in the same area, Aviation Week reported.

Also on Friday, the military completed recovery operations for the Chinese spy craft downed on Feb. 4 in waters near the coast of South Carolina and transferred the retrieved equipment to an FBI lab for analysis. Preliminary analysis suggests the balloon carried a “sensor” thought to be connected to China’s global surveillance operations.

North Korea Launches Missile Ahead Of Planned US-South Korea Nuclear Drills,"North Korea fired a long-range missile Saturday as the United States and South Korea move forward with annual nuclear drills designed to counter the growing threat posed by the communist country, officials say.

Japanese and South Korean military officials reported the launch, revealing that the missile reached a maximum altitude of 5,700 kilometers and traveled a distance of 900 kilometers before landing within Japan’s exclusive economic zone, approximately 125 miles west of Japan’s Oshima Island, The Associated Press reported.

The missile launch, the second of the year, comes one day after North Korea threatened action against the United States and South Korea in the wake of an announcement that the two countries would be undergoing a series of planned military exercises, the outlet stated. (RELATED: US Is Racing To Achieve Atomic Supremacy Over Its Key Foes As ‘Second Nuclear Age’ Begins, Experts Say)

In a “unprecedentedly persistent, strong” rebuke following the announcement, North Korea accused the United States Friday of escalating tension between the two rival nations, Reuters reported.

“If it is the U.S. option to show its muscle and counter everything with muscle, the same is true of the [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] option,” the North Korean ministry said in a statement the outlet reported. ‘In case the U.S. and South Korea carry into practice their already-announced plan for military drills which the DPRK … regards as preparations for an aggression war, they will face unprecedentedly persistent and strong counteractions,” the statement continued.

The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command assured that the missile launch did not present “an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, or territory, or to our allies,” but will continue to monitor the situation, calling on North Korea to “refrain from any further unlawful and destabilizing acts,” The AP reported.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/18/north-korea-launches-missile-after-threat/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjCyvPIobP9AhVxilYBHecNDsg4KBAWegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw1prPHuk4OpI4J-H8gJMBD9,2023-02-18
US Notified Russia Of Biden’s Ukraine Visit Hours Before Trip,"The White House notified Russia that President Joe Biden would be traveling to Ukraine, but kept the Monday trip a secret from Americans until Biden arrived to Kyiv.

“We did notify the Russians that President Biden would be traveling to Kyiv. We did so some hours before his departure for deconfliction purposes,” National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Monday.

“This was a historic visit, unprecedented in modern times, to have the president United States visit the capital of the country of war, where the United States military does not control the critical infrastructure,” Sullivan added.

Sullivan did not disclose how Russian officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, responded to the news.

Biden arrived in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Monday morning local time. Leading up to the visit, the White House had publicly denied that Biden would be making a stop in Ukraine during his trip to Poland to mark the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The president was considering visiting Ukraine, but only made the final decision on Friday after consulting with his national security advisers, CNN reported.

The team trailing with Biden was “extremely small” and included “a handful of his closest aides, small medical team, photographer, and the security package,” Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told reporters.

Biden was in Ukraine for around five hours, and met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Mariinsky Palace in Kyiv. (RELATED: Biden Travels To Ukraine Unannounced)

In joint remarks with Zelenskyy, Biden announced $500 million in additional aid to Ukraine, including artillery ammunition, Javelin missiles and air surveillance radars. More details about the package will be released in the coming days, and the U.S. will issue additional sanctions on “elites and companies” that are contributing to Russia’s war, Biden said.

“One year later, Kyiv stands. And Ukraine stands. Democracy stands,” Biden said, while speaking about the significance of the one-year anniversary of the war.

In Poland on Tuesday, Biden is set to meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda to discuss bilateral cooperation and will address America’s leading role in providing assistance to Ukraine.

North Korea Issues Explosive Response To US Bomber Drills,"North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea Monday morning in a tit-for-tat response to U.S. and South Korean military drills featuring the B-1B bomber, according to media reports.

North Korea’s second test launch of ballistic weapons in three days prompted Japan to call for an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting, The Associated Press reported. Pyongyang conducted the first test firing of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) since the new year on Saturday, which state media characterized as a response to increasingly “serious” military threats from the U.S. and South Korea and proof of North Korea’s ability to strike enemies with a nuclear weapon, according to state-controlled media outlet KCNA.

“As expected, the way the fools think and play in every occasion is incurring laughter of the world,” Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, said in a statement. (RELATED: US Is Racing To Achieve Atomic Supremacy Over Its Key Foes As ‘Second Nuclear Age’ Begins, Experts Say)

South Korea’s military first detected the ballistic missile launches early Monday morning, and Japan said both missiles splashed down in waters outside its exclusive economic zone, the AP reported. However, the distances traveled, up to 245 miles according to KCNA, suggest that South Korea is within range.

The surprise short-range missile launches Monday are a response to “movement of U.S. forces strategic strike means” — referring to the bomber aircraft — around the Pacific, Kim said. “We will take corresponding counteraction if it is judged to be any direct or indirect threat.”

“The enemies are persistently resorting to such military demonstrations, not concealing that the air drill was done in response to the ICBM launching drill by the DPRK on Feb. 18,” KCNA said.

U.S., Japanese and South Korean militaries staged last-second military drills Sunday in response to Pyongyang’s ICBM test the day prior, the AP reported. As part of the joint drills, the U.S. demonstrated F-15 fighter jets and the supersonic B-1B bomber, which can carry a large conventional weapons payload.

Joint drills between the U.S. and South Korea have grown more intense in recent years as North Korea’s nuclear program continues to expand, the AP reported.

North Korea conducted a record number of missile tests in 2022, including ICBM launches. State media portrayed many of those launches as practice runs for a future invasion of South Korea.

Pyongyang has threatened an “unprecedentedly” powerful response to planned nuclear drills between the U.S. and South Korea, which the country sees as preparation for an invasion, according to the AP.



The closed country showed off a massively expanded intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) arsenal capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the U.S. in an annual Wednesday-night parade. Featured in the parade were at least 11 of North Korea’s most up-to-date Hwasong-17 ICBMs — the most ever displayed at once — and a mock-up of a more advanced version that can deploy faster and evade detection, state media photos showed, according to The Wall Street Journal.

"Biden Meets With Polish President, Says US ‘Needs Poland And NATO As Much As Poland And NATO Need The United States’","President Joe Biden met with Polish President Andrzej Duda on Tuesday in Poland ahead of the one-year anniversary of Russia’s war on Ukraine.

The two leaders, seated at the Presidential Palace in Warsaw, spoke about U.S.-Polish bilateral relations and their joint commitment to Ukraine and NATO.

“The United States needs Poland and NATO as much as Poland and NATO need the United States,” Biden said. “I would argue a year later that NATO is stronger than it’s ever been.”

Duda thanked Biden for traveling to Ukraine on Monday, calling it a “very strategic and very political move” that “boosted the morale” of the defenders of the Ukrainians. The president made an unannounced trip to Kyiv and travelled in secret for 10 hours via train to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the capital.

Biden visiting Poland is a “sign that the free world had not forgotten,” and a “visible sign that Poland is safe and secure” despite Russia’s war on Ukraine being miles away. (RELATED: Inside Look Into Crossing The Border To War-Torn Ukraine)

Poland has been a leading contributor of military aid to Ukraine and has accepted nearly 10 million Ukrainians across its border amid the refugee crisis. Biden spoke with Duda in March on his first trip to Poland after the war, and also visited U.S. troops stationed in the country.

During this trip, Biden thanked Duda for accepting so many refugees, expressed optimism for working together on future challenges, and highlighted plans to build nuclear power plants in Poland to secure energy outside of Russia.

Biden Says US Does ‘Not Seek To Control Or Destroy’ Russia During Speech In Poland,"President Joe Biden delivered remarks on America’s commitment to Ukraine and NATO in Warsaw, Poland, on Tuesday, pledging to keep the U.S. at the forefront for the battle for democracy.

Biden condemned Russia for launching a war on Ukraine, noted America’s commitment to providing aid and to NATO, and chastised autocrats, especially Russian President Vladimir Putin, for not allowing their citizens to live free.

Since Russia launched a war on Ukraine on Feb. 24, “the democracy of the world has grown stronger, not weaker, but the autocrats of the world have grown weaker, not stronger,” Biden said. “Knowing what you stand for is most important, and knowing who stands with you makes all the difference.”

“Autocrats only understand one word: no; no; no!” the president continued. “Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia.”

He noted the atrocities that Russia has committed in the war, which is nearing its one-year anniversary, and celebrated that Ukraine has fought back before addressing the Russian people.

“Tonight, I speak once more to the people of Russia. The United States and the nations of Europe do not seek to control or destroy Russia. The West was not planning to attack Russia, as Putin said today. Millions of Russian citizens who only want to live in peace with their neighbors are not the enemy,” Biden said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered his state of the nation speech hours before Biden’s remarks, blaming Ukraine and the West for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Putin announced Russia would be suspending its participation in the New START Treaty and claimed Western countries are attacking Russia’s “culture,” Al Jazeera reported.

“We did not set the speech up as some kind of head-to-head. This is not a rhetorical contest with anyone else,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.

Biden’s trip to Poland is “important for the American people” because “what is at stake here is more than just the success and survival of the nation of Ukraine, but the rules-based international order, fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the fundamental values of independence, democracy, freedom that matters so much to everyday American people,” Sullivan told reporters before Biden’s speech.

Before his remarks, Biden met with Polish President Andrzej Duda and spoke about U.S.-Polish commitments to Ukraine and NATO. (RELATED: Biden Meets With Polish President, Says US ‘Needs Poland And NATO As Much As Poland And NATO Need The United States’)

“The United States needs Poland and NATO as much as Poland and NATO need the United States,” Biden said. “I would argue a year later that NATO is stronger than it’s ever been.”

Putin Abandons Landmark Nuclear Arms Treaty With US After Biden Visits Ukraine,"Moscow will pause participation in a 2011 nuclear arms control treaty with the U.S., the only agreement between two great powers limiting nuclear weapons arsenals, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Tuesday after President Joe Biden paid a historic visit to Kyiv.

The U.S. in January had accused Russia of failing to abide by a 2011 treaty known as New START, which places mutually agreed-upon caps on the varieties and amounts of nuclear warheads and delivery weapons each country can maintain. Russia was blocking U.S. teams that, as part of the treaty provisions, are allowed to conduct regular inspections of each other’s weapons sites and is the only treaty that limits the world’s largest nuclear arsenals, according to CNN.

“They want to deal us a strategic defeat and are meddling with our nuclear facilities. In this context, I have to declare today that Russia is suspending its participation in the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Arms,” Putin told a government assembly in a state of the nation speech Tuesday, according to The Wall Street Journal. (RELATED: The Pentagon Is Sounding The Alarm On China’s Massive Nuclear Build-Out, But Experts Disagree About How To Respond)

The State Department in a report to Congress in January said Russia had rejected attempts to discuss noncompliance concerns along with thwarting inspections, the first time the U.S. has alleged noncompliance with the 2011 agreement, according to the WSJ.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Putin’s decision “is both really unfortunate and very irresponsible,” the WSJ reported.

“But of course, we remain ready to talk about strategic arms limitations at any time with Russia, irrespective of anything else going on in the world or in our relationship,” he added, according to the WSJ. “I think it matters that we continue to act responsibly in this area.”

Putin warned that he would consider testing nuclear weapons if the U.S. chooses to do so in the address, saying some in Washington were discussing conducting nuclear tests, according to Reuters. He blamed the West for using the “special military operation” in Ukraine as an excuse to destroy Russia and said Moscow would achieve its goals.

Former President Barack Obama negotiated the agreement after a prior arms control treaty with Russia, known as START I, expired.

The Biden administration hoped to maintain New START as Russia continues what the administration has consistently referred to as an “unprovoked invasion” of Ukraine, according to the WSJ. In 2021, the administration renewed the agreement and it is set to expire on Feb. 4, 2026.

“No matter what else is happening in the world, the United States is ready to pursue critical arms control measures,” a National Security Council spokesperson told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Biden met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Monday, the first since the war began in February of 2022, where he pledged $500 million in additional aid for Ukraine.

The White House and Department of Defense did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

It’s The 43rd Anniversary Of US Hockey Pulling Off The Most Monumental Upset In Sports History Against The USSR,"Happy anniversary, America!

February 22, 2023, marks 43 years since the United States pulled off the greatest upset in the history of sports, defeating the Soviet Union in a 1980 Winter Olympics hockey game that was far more than just a “game.”

We all know the story: A group of disorganized college kids eventually got their act together to roll through the Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, eventually facing off against what was the Soviet hockey powerhouse in a medal round game with intense Cold War overtones.

At the time, there was a huge gap between the U.S.S.R. hockey program and the rest of the world. Nobody could match their dynastic power. When the two met up that night, everybody was expecting U.S. coach Herb Brooks & Co. to get completely smashed.

Instead, the United States of America shocked the world.

I wasn’t even born at the time, so I didn’t get to see the “Miracle on Ice” when it happened. I was first introduced to this moment when the “Miracle” movie came out in 2004 — I was in middle school at the time, and I immediately fell in love with the story.

Since then, I’ve easily seen this movie 1,000 times:

Man, I’m totally going to have to watch this movie tonight after work. The problem is, however, my wife has been on a “Sopranos” kick as of late and has been binge-watching the shit out of it. (RELATED: Virginia Tech Students Lose Their Absolute Sh*t Over Free Bacon)

US Natural Gas Prices Reach Lowest Since 2020,"U.S. natural gas on Tuesday reached its lowest price since September of 2020.

After being adjusted for inflation, a surplus in production resulted in futures falling below $2. Prices fell 10% to a low of $2.06 British Thermal units (BTU) on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest price since September 2020 and a 79% decrease in value from August 2022.

Tuesday marked the one-year anniversary since Russia invaded Ukraine. The invasion sent massive spikes in prices across many industries as it became clear Europe would not be able to purchase goods from Russia. The Biden administration then placed numerous sanctions on Russia with hopes to hinder the economy, which sent the value of natural gas skyrocketing.

Mild temperatures have also sent ripples in the demand for natural gas this winter especially in regions that once anticipated snow are not seeing any. Many local economies built up their preserve in anticipation of a cold winter but have not needed to rely on their extensive supply, Chesapeake CEO Nick Dell’Osso told Market Insider.

"‘Tipping Point’: US To Expand Troop Presence In Taiwan In Bid To Fend Off Chinese Invasion, Officials Say","The U.S. military is planning to quadruple its troop presence in Taiwan for training missions, the latest in a series of Pentagon plans to deter a Chinese invasion, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing anonymous U.S. officials.

In coming months, the U.S. will send between 100 and 200 troops compared to about 30 a year ago to expand a secret training program with the Taiwanese military, officials told the WSJ. The plan would entail the largest deployment of American forces to the island in decades as the U.S. government hopes to equip Taiwan with the capabilities to defend itself from a potential Chinese invasion without provoking further aggression, the officials said.

“One of the difficult things to determine is what really is objectionable to China,” one of the officials told the WSJ. “We don’t think at the levels that we’re engaged in and are likely to remain engaged in the near future that we are anywhere close to a tipping point for China, but that’s a question that is constantly being evaluated and looked at specifically with every decision involving support to Taiwan.”

The scaled-up program will involve training Taiwanese troops on U.S. weapons systems and and complex military maneuvers, the officials told the WSJ. They declined to offer further details. (RELATED: ‘Setting The Theater’: US, Allies Are Preparing For Conflict In The Pacific)

Pentagon officials have planned an expansion of the training program for months as China’s saber-rattling against Taiwan grows ever more severe. In 2022, Beijing conducted the largest ever military drills near the island and sent sorties of People’s Liberation Army ships and aircraft into Taiwanese territory at a record pace.

While the U.S. military doesn’t see an invasion coming in the immediate future, top officials warn that it is not a matter of if, but when, China attempt to “reunify” with the self-ruling island.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine instilled a sense of urgency in Taiwanese and U.S. officials to invest in Taiwan’s “porcupine” strategy. Officials wager that providing Taiwan with robust weapons and tactical expertise would render an assault on the island too risky for Beijing, according to the WSJ.

“We just need to be moving heaven and earth to arm Taiwan to the teeth before it’s too late,” Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, who chairs the new House Select Committee on China, said Wednesday after returning from a trip to Taiwan, Politico reported.

Well said, @RepGallagher! We thank the chair of the newly established #US🇺🇸 House special committee on #China for sharing his firsthand observations after a 4-day #Taiwan🇹🇼 trip. The free world must take the right steps for freedom & democracy to reign!

The White House, Pentagon and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command declined to comment to WSJ about the plans.

Previous deployments consisted of U.S. Marines and special operations forces and fluctuated by only a handful, the officials told the WSJ.

The Michigan National Guard is currently conducting regular training exercises with Taiwan’s military, including with a squad of Taiwanese troops at Camp Grayling in northern Michigan, people familiar with the training told the WSJ.

“I would highlight that our support for, and defense relationship with, Taiwan remains aligned against the current threat posed by the People’s Republic of China,” Army Lt. Col. Marty Meiners, a Pentagon spokesman, told the WSJ.

‘We Always Have What We Need’: Blinken Dismisses Report Of ‘Low Stockpiles’ As US Funnels Weapons To Ukraine,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken defended the amount of military aid the United States provided Ukraine, Friday, even after being questioned about depleted stockpiles.

“David Martin reported just last night that we have low stockpiles in some key areas, and if there were a conflict we’d run out of, for example, air-to-ship missiles very quickly,” “CBS Mornings” co-host Tony Dokoupil told Blinken. (RELATED: Major Defense Contractor BAE Systems Reports Record-Shattering Year Thanks To Western Aid For Ukraine)

War games conducted by the Department of Defense showed that the United States military could run short of munitions, notably the AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile, CBS News reported. Experts told CBS that Ukraine’s monthly expenditures exceeded the annual productions of some weapons.

WATCH:

“I can tell you that the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Chair of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley, are extremely vigilant about making sure that whatever happens, we always have what we need to defend ourselves, wherever — wherever it’s needed,” Blinken said.

Russia invaded Ukraine Feb. 24, launching a massive attack across the latter country. The United States has sent over $100 billion in aid to Ukraine, and announced in January they would send 31 M1 Abrams main battle tanks following a December announcement that a battery of MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missiles would be provided to that country.

“These weapons have had a real effect on Russia’s military. Russia’s got about 80% of its ground forces committed to Ukraine,” Blinken said. “They are taking terrible losses, terrible losses in in personnel. Public accounts, 200,000 killed or wounded, and then their own tanks, their own weaponry, is being destroyed by the Ukrainians.”

"US Shells Out $2 Billion In Weapons For Ukraine, One Year Into War","The U.S. announced billions in long-term military aid for Ukraine Friday morning as the war entered its second year.

The nearly-$2 billion package features advanced drones, including the Switchblade 600 Kamikaze drone, and electronic warfare detection equipment, the Pentagon said in a statement Friday. It also includes 155 mm artillery rounds and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems munitions in undefined quantities, an unusual move given that previous assistance packages have generally specified the amount of munitions supplied.

One year after Russia launched the invasion, “Ukraine’s brave defenders have not wavered, and neither has our commitment to support them for as long as it takes,” U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in a statement.

Austin urged allies to remain “clear-eyed” about the stakes of the war, calling it the most urgent threat to face Europe since World War II.

“Difficult times may lie ahead,” Austin warned.

New assistance comes from a DOD authority allowing the Biden administration to order weapons directly off the production line instead of drawing from existing U.S. stockpiles, as has defined much of U.S. aid to Ukraine.

U.S. stockpiles of 155 mm rounds have fallen to critical levels, and it’s unclear how long it will take for the weapons industry to fill both orders for Ukraine and existing orders meant to backfill American stocks.

The U.S. has committed $32 billion in security assistance alone to Ukraine since the war began, Austin said.

The U.S. cracked down numerous companies — including those based in China — thought to be assisting Russia’s war effort as the conflict in Ukraine begins its second year, The Wall Street Journal reported. The sanctions package, announced in coordination with Group of Seven allies on Friday, names more than 200 individuals and entities tied to Russia’s defense sector as well as 90 companies helping Russia evade sanctions and restock its depleting weapons stores.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen at the G7 meeting said the U.S. is preparing an additional $10 billion in economic assistance for Ukraine, Reuters reported.

Russia is increasingly reliant on partners to supply goods sourced from Western companies before the war, as the U.S. and allies levied sanctions criminalizing business dealings with more and more Russian entities, according to the WSJ.

Yellen also said the U.S. has warned Chinese officials and companies against helping Russia evade sanctions, according to the WSJ. The threats come as Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. has information that China is considering a move to permit its companies to directly transfer lethal aid, like weapons, to Russia.

However, the U.S. has not said what those consequences might be.

The U.K. joined the sanctions effort Friday, placing export bans on “every item Ukraine has found Russia using on the battlefield to date” aimed at “undermining Putin’s military machine,” according to a press release.

European Union member countries also plan to block more than $11 billion in Russian imports of goods including products that have both military and commercial applications, the WSJ reported.
