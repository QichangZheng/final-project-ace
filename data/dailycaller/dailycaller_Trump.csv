"Peter Thiel On Obama, Bush, Drudge, Trump And More","Libertarian tech mogul Peter Thiel is a big fan of Ron Paul and Matt Drudge — not so much of Donald Trump and Thomas Friedman.

In the final segment of The Daily Caller’s extensive interview with the Paypal founder about his new book “Zero To One: Notes On Startups, Or How To Build The Future,” among other topics, TheDC asked Thiel to give his impression of various notable American personalities in politics and the media.

About former Republican Texas Rep. Ron Paul, whose campaign for president Thiel financially supported in 2012, he said Paul was “very courageous in trying to move the Republican Party in a somewhat more socially liberal and fiscally conservative direction.”

Calling himself “dangerously addicted” to the Drudge Report, Thiel praised Internet media mogul Matt Drudge for “transform[ing] the media industry massively in the ‘90s.”

As for real estate billionaire and perennial faux presidential candidate Donald Trump, Thiel quipped that he was “sort of symptomatic of everything that is wrong with New York City.”

Of New York Times column Tom Friedman, Thiel said, “It’s important to read Friedman because you want to know exactly what the conventional wisdom says.”

Thiel also shared his thoughts on President Barack Obama and former President George W. Bush, but you’ll have to watch the video to see what he said.

"‘Jesus? He’s A Loser’: Secret, Super Authentic Trump Speech LEAKED","The Daily Caller has obtained an exclusive advance copy of a speech Donald Trump will deliver in the near future. Those words are presented here, without comment, for you, the reader:

I’ll tell you what I think. I raised $125,000 for one of His hospitals. That’s a lot of money. I supported Him, He lost. He let us down. But, ya know, He lost. So I never liked Him much after that, ’cause I don’t like losers. He’s a savior? He’s a savior because he was captured. He got crucified. I like saviors that weren’t crucified, OK? I hate to tell you: Jesus? He’s a loser.

I hate to tell ya: When I look at Him, I see a man who knows a trade — he’s a carpenter, I know, I hire a lot of carpenters, I build a lot of buildings. But Jesus didn’t make anything of that. He’s poor; he died poor. I look at that, and that tells me he’s lazy. No vision. Didn’t care. Loser.

And this loser was hanging around with other losers while the Romans laughed at them. Fishermen, call girls, a bunch of bureaucrats. Failures who couldn’t make a deal; no business sense, no original ideas. All losers.

So he had magical powers? So does he use them to make a deal? Does he build golf courses all over the world? Does he take on Caesar’s Palace? No. He gives out food and health care for free. It’s welfare; a loser feeding other losers.

I mean, he got out-dealed by Pontius Pilate, a loser if I ever saw one. But I feel bad for Pilate. He’s stupid. And fat. And later on he killed himself because he was a loser.

Fine. Blame Judas. But you know what? Jesus hired Judas as a senior vice apostle. Would I hire him for my campaign? I only hire winners. Judas wouldn’t get a job as a bus boy at a Trump hotel. He’d be fired before he hit the ground. And if he got by, I’d fire him and then I’d fire the manager who hired him. That’s called taking responsibility.

Did Judas even make a good deal? Thirty pieces of silver? That’s peanuts. It shows you how worthless these guys were. Can’t make a deal.

Look at me. I went to a top school. Got top marks. I’m very smart. I’m very rich. I’m very proud of myself and I’m very rich. I’m worth many billions of gold pieces. I’m very rich. And you know what? I don’t need the money. I hate to tell it to ya, I don’t. But I have the money because I make the deals. So, I would’ve paid 15 silver pieces for Jesus. And the Romans are laughing at us. So you know what? I’d make the Romans pay me. I’d say you bring me Jesus and then I’d make them pay for it. I’d get on the phone and make them pay for it. They’re laughing at us.

You know a prophet I respect? Moses. Smart. Won. Got things done. Knew how to deal. Pharaoh was laughing at him. So Moses got pharaoh to give him all his slaves, then he destroyed pharaoh’s army when he tried to go back on the deal. Built a wall of water, made pharaoh pay for it. Winner. Very smart. Probably very rich.

Thank you. Thank you very much.

POLL: Rand Paul And Chris Christie More Unpopular Than Donald Trump,"Forty percent of Iowa Republican voters say they have an unfavorable opinion of Donald Trump, according to a Public Policy Polling survey released Monday. But the are two other Republican presidential candidates who are more unpopular with GOP primary voters.

According to the poll, 45 percent of voters have an unfavorable opinion of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul while 44 percent don’t like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Trump, Paul and Christie got the most feisty in last week’s Republican debate.

Paul sparred with both Trump and Christie during the televised showdown.

“He buys and sells politicians of all stripes!” Paul said of Trump at the beginning of the debate.

“I don’t think you heard me,” Trump said dismissively of Paul at one point. “You’re having a hard time tonight.”

Arguing over the NSA during the debate, Paul also took a swing at Christie: “I don’t trust President Obama with our records. I know you gave him a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, go right ahead.”

Christie told Paul at one point: “Senator, you know, when you’re sitting in a subcommittee, just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that.”

In terms of popularity, former neurosurgeon Ben Carson is the most popular of all the Republicans, according to the PPP poll, with 69 percent of Republican saying they have have a favorable impression.

Trump: ‘I Love The Idea Of Campaign Finance Reform’ [VIDEO],"Donald Trump called federal campaign finance laws a “shame” and a “disgrace” on Friday and indicated for the first time that he would support laws to reform the campaign finance system.

“I love the idea of campaign finance reform,” Trump said during a press conference in New Hampshire.

As he’s done in the past, Trump slammed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as a “puppet” and accused him of being beholden to donors his campaign and super-PAC donors. But the real estate billionaire went further by indicating he would support additional legislation to regulate campaign finance.

“One of the things you should do is everybody should be known. If somebody gives a million or two million or five million it should be known,” Trump said, while decrying rules prohibiting PACs from coordinating with campaigns as “nonsense.”

PACs have “millions of dollars raised, $100 million raised, and they don’t coordinate with the other people?” he asked incredulously.

“I mean, Bush puts his best friend in there. They don’t talk?” he continued.

“Come on. We’re not babies. It’s a shame. It’s a disgrace.”

Trump also referenced Citizens United, the conservative non-profit group that won a 2010 Supreme Court case which allowed non-profit groups to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns.

Trump said that while he is friends with Citizens United president David Bossie, he opposes the Supreme Court ruling in the group’s favor.

“It’s not a great decision for me…because I’m putting up my own money,” Trump said.

Trump has not given a hard dollar figure for how much he’s willing to spend on his campaign. When he first announced his candidacy in June, he said he’s willing to spend “whatever it takes.”

Trump Shuts Down Reporter: I’ll Use ‘Anchor Baby’,"Donald Trump got into a testy exchange with a reporter Wednesday night, saying that he would continue to use the term “anchor baby” regardless of whether some find it offensive.

The comments came during a press conference prior to a town hall event in Derry, New Hampshire. A reporter asked Trump whether his claim to have a “big heart” was consistent with using “anchor baby” to describe children of illegal immigrants.

“You said that you have a big heart, and that you’re not mean-spirited. Are you aware that the term ‘anchor baby,’ that’s an offensive term? People find that hurtful,” the reporter said.

“You mean it’s not politically correct, and yet everybody uses it?” Trump replied. “You know what? Give me a different term.”

The reporter proposed “the American-born childs [sic] of undocumented immigrants.”

Trump had none of it.

“You want me to use that? Okay. I’ll use the word ‘anchor baby.'”

Trump isn’t the only GOP candidate willing to use the term. Also on Wednesday, Jeb Bush said on Bill Bennett’s radio program “Morning in America” that as president he would work for “better enforcement so that you don’t have these, you know, ‘anchor babies,’ as they’re described, coming into the country.”

The remark drew a rebuke from Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton:

Trump And O’Reilly Spar Over Foreign Policy With China: Trump ‘Would Get Him A McDonald’s Hamburger’ [VIDEO],"Donald Trump criticized President Obama for inviting Chinese President Xi Jinping to a state dinner later in September, saying, “I would get him a McDonald’s hamburger and say’You will get down to work because you can’t continue to devalue [your currency].'”

Trump, appearing on “The O’Reilly Factor” Monday, got in a feisty debate with Bill O’Reilly over who exactly is responsible for “sucking out” American jobs. Trump blamed the president of China, while O’Reilly blamed U.S. companies.

Bill O’Reilly: Two people coming to the United States of note in September, the Pope, okay, and the president of China is coming, a man named Xi Jinping. Do you know him? I have never heard who he is. But he is the president…

Donald Trump: Very smart.

O’Reilly: He is coming over. He is getting a big dinner free at the White House and addressing the U.N. If you were president of would you be throwing him a dinner?

Trump: I would not be throwing him a dinner, we’ve had this conversation. I would get him a McDonald’s hamburger and say ‘You will get down to work because you can’t continue to devalue.’ You know, we will give him a state dinner and what he has done is sucked all of our jobs and he has sucked the money right out of our country.

O’Reilly: Again, he hasn’t done it. U.S. companies do it. They’re doing it.

Trump: No, it’s our system.

O’Reilly: So, you would be confrontational with the Chinese? You are saying look,’I’m not giving you a dinner, here is a Big Mac’? Is that what you are going to do?

Trump: I would give them probably a double sized Big Mac. Look, it’s not so much the companies. It’s our government that allowed China to do that to us.

O’Reilly: I don’t buy that for a second. Trump: I do 100%, Bill.

O’Reilly: Our companies, they want as much money as they can. They go to Mexico. Our government let’s them do it but this is a free nation. So they want to go and do it, you can’t stop them.

Trump: Bill, our government, our government should have stopped China from devaluing.

O’Reilly: They can’t. Trump: They never even bring them up.

O’Reilly: How? Trump: Do you know how they can?

O’Reilly: Yeah, how?

Trump: Very simply, Bill, it’s so simple, they put a tariff on Chinese goods. You know, China …

O’Reilly: Alright. Then you have got a trade war.

Trump: You have to, you have to do that and then you bring it back to normal. You have no choice. You do that. Our government doesn’t even, and by the way, China does it to us. Do you think that we sell to China without a tariff? They call it a tariff. I call it a tax.

O’Reilly: There is no question the imbalance, there is no question the imbalance is that way.

Trump: Do you know what the big imbalance is? Intelligence. Their leaders are intelligent. Ours aren’t. We don’t know what we are doing. We had to do this and it should have taken place a long time ago, and you wouldn’t have this bubble right now, Bill.

O’Reilly: Okay, so I’m not going to get Xi Jinping and you together. I was going to take you both out to dinner but I’m not doing that because I think it might be bloody.

Trump: I’d get along with him very well. I think we would get along. I get along very well.

O’Reilly: I know, just like Putin and the Chinese, you would be vacationing in the Yellow Sea with them.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2015/08/24/trump-and-oreilly-spar-over-foreign-policy-with-china-trump-would-get-him-a-mcdonalds-hamburger-video/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi0y5Td_rP9AhVNGFkFHXL1BIw4WhAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw06HIY93-4-wXSgJed1fOtG,2015-08-24
Trump Appears To Have Heavily Plagiarized Op-Ed From Carson,"An op-ed penned this month by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and published online appears to be blatantly plagiarized from an article written days earlier under former rival Ben Carson’s name, The Daily Caller has determined.

The similar op-eds were written on the topic of America’s territories and commonwealths.

Both pieces appear under the by-lines of the candidates. Carson’s piece, published Feb. 26, was published in the Marianas Variety in the Northern Mariana Islands.

Trump’s op-ed — published in the Pacific Daily News in Guam, part of the USA Today Network — was published 12 days later on March 9.

In some cases, full sentences and phrases — word-for-word — are lifted from Carson’s. In others, some words and phrases are changed and added.

Take the opening lines of both pieces as an example.

Carson’s piece begins: “MANY Americans do not appreciate the patriotism exhibited by our brothers and sisters in the Territories of American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.”

Here’s how Trump’s piece beings (with the exact wording from Carson’s piece bolded): “Throughout the history of our nation, the patriotism exhibited by our brothers and sisters in the Territories of American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands has often gone unacknowledged.”

At another point, Trump’s op-ed uses, word-for-word, two identical sentences from Carson’s article: “Medical care in the American territories and commonwealths has historically lagged far behind the continental states, and Obamacare has only made the situation worse. Good health is an essential part of a thriving society and economy, and citizens of the territories and commonwealths deserve policies that work.”

Carson dropped out of the Republican race for president after a disappointing finish in the March 1 SEC primary. Ahead of Florida’s primary, the former neurosurgeon endorsed Trump last week.

Reached by phone, Carson adviser Armstrong Williams declined to comment other than to reference some of Carson’s old campaign staffers and say: “There’s no question they’re working for Mr. Trump now.”

The Saipan Tribune, a local news outlet in the Northern Mariana Islands, reported that a local Republican named Jason Osborne, who worked for Carson before joining Trump’s team, was involved in crafting the op-ed.

“Plagiarizing ideas, when you accept those ideas, isn’t plagiarism, it’s just flattery,” Osborne told the outlet.

The Daily Caller has reached out to Trump’s campaign.

Media Outraged After Trump Tricks Them To Cover Endorsements From Military Heroes,"WASHINGTON — The media showed up to the presidential ballroom of the new Trump International Hotel on Friday morning expecting Donald Trump to take questions about whether he still questions President Obama’s birthplace.

Instead, they got more than a half hour of a variety of military heroes — generals, medal of honor recipients and a gold star wife — expressing support for the Republican nominee. And it all aired live on the cable news networks.

Before the event, Trump tweeted: “I am now going to the brand new Trump International, Hotel D.C. for a major statement.” That was interpreted by the press to mean he was going to address “birther” questions.

That’s because on Thursday, Trump declined to tell the Washington Post if he still questioned whether Obama is an American citizen. But later Thursday night — after his comment took off in the media — Trump’s campaign released a statement saying: “Having successfully obtained President Obama’s birth certificate when others could not, Mr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States.”

Realizing Trump was not using the occasion to address that subject — and instead focus it on the military — many in the press were not happy — and vented about it on Twitter.

Trump’s campaign announced the endorsement of 44 new military flag officers, saying that brings the number up to 164 now.

“I am grateful for the growing support of highly respected retired generals and admirals who have been so successful in defending our country,” Trump said.

At the very end of the campaign event, Trump finally addressed the topic the media was there to hear. “Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it.”

“President Barack Obama was born in the United States,” Trump said. “Period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong again.”

Many reporters, some standing on chairs, began shouting questions over the applause from the guests in attendance. But Trump, having accomplished what he wanted, took none.

The Friendship Between Trump And A Billionaire Pedophile That Nobody Wants To Talk About,"While Donald Trump deals with the aftermath of lewd comments he made about women back in 2005, the public still has not gotten any real answers about at least another potentially problematic aspect of Trump’s history: his past friendship with billionaire and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

Trump’s friendship with Epstein has been largely untouched in the mainstream press, and those around Trump have been reluctant to provide details on the nature of the two billionaires’ relationship.

Epstein, who reportedly ran a sex ring where he trafficked young girls to his elite circle of friends, served time in jail for soliciting an underage prostitute and has reached out of court settlements with 17 of his then-underage victims. He’s been the subject of an almost endless string of court cases. (For a deeper look at Epstein’s abuse of underage girls, see this 2010 piece from The Daily Beast.)

That Trump’s friendship with Epstein has been given what largely amounts to a pass from the media may be due in part to Epstein’s more prominent ties to Bill Clinton and Britain’s Prince Andrew.

Epstein’s ties to Clinton and Prince Andrew have largely overshadowed his ties to Trump.

Clinton allies have yet to makes Trump’s Epstein ties a campaign issue.

Then again, any attacks on Trump over his ties to Epstein would almost certainly guarantee that Trump would bring up Clinton’s own documented Epstein ties, including flight logs showing that Clinton took at least 26 trips on Epstein’s infamous private sex plane, dubbed the “Lolita Express.”

To the extent that Trump’s representatives have been asked about his ties to Epstein, they’ve tried to downplay the two billionaires’ relationship.

Last January, Trump attorney Alan Garten told Vice News that his client had “no relationship” with Epstein.

In a statement to The Daily Caller on Sunday, Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said that “Mr. Trump only knows [Epstein] socially through the Mar-a-Lago Club, one of the finest private clubs in the world.”

But Trump talked up his friendship with Epstein before the latter’s arrest and public fall from grace.

“I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York Magazine for a 2002 profile of Epstein. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”

Similarly, a 2003 Vanity Fair profile of Epstein named Trump as one of the “businessmen who dine with him at his home,” and several other articles have pegged Trump and Epstein as friends.

And when FBI investigators looked through Epstein’s private address book, they found 14 different phone numbers for Trump, including numbers for his security guard and houseman. Epstein also had numbers for Trump’s daughter Ivanka and his ex-wife Ivana.

When put under oath, Epstein admitted that he had “socialized” with Trump. But Epstein chose to exercise his Fifth Amendment rights when asked: “Have you ever socialized with Donald Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18?” Epstein similarly pleaded the fifth when asked about his relationship to Bill Clinton.

Trump rode on Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane at least once, according to the deposition of Mark Epstein, Jeffrey’s brother. That number pales, however, in comparison to Bill’s 26 trips on the “Lolita Express.”

In June, Trump was accused in a lawsuit of raping one of Epstein’s 13-year-old sex workers. Trump’s attorney has called the lawsuit a “publicity stunt.” The case is scheduled for a hearing in mid-December, after the election.

A week later, The Daily Beast ran a story titled “The Billionaire Pedophile Who Could Bring Down Donald Trump And Hillary Clinton.”

A month after the lawsuit surfaced, the Huffington Post ran an opinion article titled “Why The New Child Rape Case Filed Against Donald Trump Should Not Be Ignored.”

That article, however, focused more on Trump’s past behavior with women, largely ignoring his friendship with Epstein. The author of the story, NBC legal analyst Lisa Bloom, left out altogether Clinton’s ties to Epstein.

Outside of the smattering of articles mentioning the lawsuit, Trump’s relationship with Epstein has yet to receive any consistent press coverage during the 2016 election. Clinton’s ties, too, have yet to be seriously discussed so far this election.

Trump’s Brutally Honest Castro Statement Proves He’s No Obama,"President-elect Donald Trump called now deceased former Cuban president Fidel Castro a “brutal dictator” whose legacy represents decades of death and oppression.

That’s a stark contrast from President Barack Obama’s statement on the passing of the long-time Cuban overlord.

“Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades,” Trump said in a statement released on the news of Castro’s death Saturday.

“Fidel Castro’s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights,” Trump said.

“While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve,” Trump said.

“Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty,” Trump said. “I join the many Cuban Americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign, including the Brigade 2506 Veterans Association that endorsed me, with the hope of one day soon seeing a free Cuba.”

Trump won overwhelming support from Cuban-Americans during the 2016 election for his opposition to Obama’s normalization of relations with the Castro regime.

Obama’s statement on Castro’s passing was one of sorrow and arguably obscured Castro’s record of oppression and murder.

“At this time of Fidel Castro’s passing, we extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people. We know that this moment fills Cubans – in Cuba and in the United States – with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation,” Obama said in a statement put out by the White House.

“History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him,” Obama said.

“For nearly six decades, the relationship between the United States and Cuba was marked by discord and profound political disagreements,” he said. “During my presidency, we have worked hard to put the past behind us, pursuing a future in which the relationship between our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbors and friends – bonds of family, culture, commerce, and common humanity. This engagement includes the contributions of Cuban Americans, who have done so much for our country and who care deeply about their loved ones in Cuba.”

Castro passed away at the age of 90 after years of being in poor health. Castro came to power in 1959 as part of a communist revolution and only stepped aside in 2006. Castro’s brother Raul now runs things in Cuba.

Castro is blamed for killing thousands of people during his rise to power in the late 1950s. The Cuba Archive Project documented more than 9,200 people who were killed by the Castro regime, while the group’s president says as many as 78,000 were killed trying to flee Castro’s communism.

Trump To Immediately Sign As Many As 200 Executive Orders [VIDEO],"President-elect Donald Trump will sign as many as 200 executive orders targeting a wide range of Obama administration policies, according to Fox News judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano.

Napolitano told Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum Wednesday night that, based on his conversations with the president-elect, Trump could sign hundreds of regulations on his third full day in office. The judge did not say what policies were being targeted by the incoming administration.

Trump has hinted he would, for example, work to repeal “job killing” energy regulations his first day in office. Trump’s also said he’d repeal Obama-era executive orders on immigration, and he pledged to begin dismantling the Affordable Care Act.

The Trump transition team told reporters Wednesday Trump would issue just “four to five” executive orders on Friday after he’s sworn in.

“He’s got a few of them, probably in the area of four to five, that we’re looking at on Friday,” said incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer.

“Some of it is logistical things that you have to do in terms of government operations. Then there are some other ones that I expect him to sign with regards to some other issues that have been on his priority list,” Spicer said.

But Trump will need Congress to repeal major Obama administration regulations. Congress can vote to remove some administration rules using the Congressional Review Act. Regulatory experts have identified at least 150 regulations Trump could work with Congress to repeal.

Republican lawmakers are pushing legislation making it easier to repeal last-minute “midnight” regulations from federal agencies, and a bill mandating costly regulations get congressional approval before becoming law.

Report: Trump Isn’t Happy With How Sean Spicer Dresses,"President Donald Trump is not a fan of press secretary Sean Spicer’s fashion sense.

A source told Axios reporter Jonathan Swan that Trump isn’t happy with how Spicer wears his suits. “Doesn’t the guy own a dark suit?” Trump reportedly asked a senior aide.

As noted by Axios, Spicer recently switched to wearing a darker suit.

Spicer has caught flack for the way he dresses in the media, too. GQ ran a story Monday titled “Fact: Sean Spicer’s Suit Is Bad.”

Problems with Spicer’s suit, according to GQ, include: “It’s too big” and “The suit is sitting back on his shoulders instead of flush against the back of his shirt collar.”

Trump is known to want his aides to have a certain “look” and reportedly eliminated cabinet contenders based on appearances.

Former UN ambassador John Bolton’s mustache and Sen. Bob Corker’s height were reportedly contributing factors in each being passed over for secretary of state.

Trump Fires Acting AG Who Refused To Enforce Refugee Order,"President Donald Trump dismissed acting Attorney General Sally Yates on Monday night, after she ordered government lawyers not to defend his executive order on refugees.

In a brazen act of defiance that cost her the post, Yates said she could not enforce a policy that is not “wise or just.” Yates is an Obama-appointee who was serving as acting AG pending the confirmation of Sen. Jeff Sessions.

“The acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s office said in a statement. “This order was approved as to form and legality by the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel.”

“It is time to get serious about protecting our country. Calling for tougher vetting for individuals traveling from seven dangerous places is not extreme. It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country,” the statement added.

The president has designated Dana Boente, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as acting AG in the interim.

“I am honored to serve President Trump in this role until Senator Sessions is confirmed,” Boente said in the statement. “I will defend and enforce the laws of our country to ensure that our people and our nation are protected.”

The Federal Vacancies Act authorizes the president to replace one Senate-confirmed officer with another, as professor Josh Blackman of South Texas College of Law explains on his blog. Boente was confirmed as U.S. attorney by the Senate in 2015.

"Trump Pushes For Massive Budget, Staff Cuts At EPA","President Donald Trump will ask Congress to cut the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) budget 24 percent, or nearly $2 billion, according to sources familiar with the budget plans.

The White House sent draft budget plans to agency heads Monday, detailing billions of dollars in cuts to a wide range of federal programs. Cuts to EPA and other agencies will fund a $54 billion increase in defense spending.

A source informed of the budget plans told E&E News Trump will push for a nearly $2 billion cut to EPA’s $8.1 billion budget. A source told Politico Trump also “proposed reducing EPA’s 15,000-strong workforce to 12,000, a level not seen since the mid-1980s.”

“You’re going to have to make reductions,” Myron Ebell, director of global warming and energy policy at the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), told The Daily Caller News Foundation.

“There’s going to have to be some serious thought here,” said Ebell, who headed Trump’s EPA transition team. “They’re going to have to figure out to make these cuts.”

Trump’s plan to cut EPA’ budget 24 percent mirrors recommendations given to him by the agency transition team. That plan advised cuts outside of state and tribal grants, which make up about 43 percent of EPA’s budget.

In that case, EPA will have to cut 24 percent from its $4.6 billion budget for federal programs, payroll and contracts. That‘s effectively a 42 percent budget cut once state and tribal grants are excluded.

Ebell said Trump will likely cut EPA climate programs, like he promised on the campaign trail, but could also end up laying off agency staffers in D.C. or reduce the size of field offices. Top officials told Axios to expect “massive, transformational cuts, particularly to climate-change programs.”

“Businesses have to do this all the time,” Ebell said.“The federal government never has to undergo this market discipline.”

Trump promised to abolish President Barack Obama’s “Climate Action Plan,” refocusing the EPA towards clean air and water regulations.

EPA had more than 15,300 employees and a budget of more than $8.1 billion in 2016. About half of EPA staff work at regional offices across the country, even though more than 90 percent of EPA programs are administered by state agencies.

The Trump administration has said the budget figures sent to agency heads is not the full budget. The White house hopes to have a full budget put together by May

“This is not a full-blown budget,” Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, told reporters Monday.

Mulvaney stressed current agency budgets plans were top-line numbers and don’t include entitlements or other programs that will be addressed later.

Mulvaney said the budget reflected Trump’s promises of rebuilding the military, securing the border, taking care of veterans and increasing school choice

“We are taking his words and turning them into policies and dollars,” Mulvaney said.

The EPA did not respond to TheDCNF by the time of publication.

Nonprofits Angry About Trump’s Budget Cuts Hid The $179 Million They Took From The EPA,"Six nonprofit groups that criticized President Donald Trump’s proposed budget cuts failed to mention the nearly $179 million in Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) grants they’ve received since 2009, according to a Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group (TheDCNF) analysis of federal spending data.

The agency has funded thousands of such groups since former President Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration, but TheDCNF focused only on six of the largest nonprofit recipients in its analysis of grant data compiled by the watchdog Open The Books.

(Table: Ethan Barton/Daily Caller News Foundation)

Those nonprofits also received additional funding from other federal agencies across the government. It’s possible some or all of these groups will see their federal funding slashed or eliminated all together if Trump’s budget proposal is approved.

The six nonprofits have varying missions and represent EPA’s widespread use of taxpayer funds to advance the environmental agency’s legislative, public relations and regulatory agenda. For example, the largest recipient – Senior Service America Inc. – provides low-paying jobs to senior citizens. (RELATED: Six Fed-Funded Non-Profits Are ‘Scandals Waiting To Happen’)

Not surprisingly, Trump’s proposed budget cuts “would be absolutely devastating,” Senior Service America research manager Bob Harootyan told NBC News on March 16. The group has taken more than $533 million from federal agencies, including EPA, since 2009, mostly through a Department of Labor program Trump has proposed to eliminate.

Additionally, 99.6 percent of Senior Service America’s revenue in 2015 was government funded, according to the group’s 990 tax form.

The remaining five groups analyzed advocate for aggressive EPA regulatory action to ensure clean water, clean air, conservation and support for environmental science research. They, like Senior Service America, railed against Trump’s proposed budget cuts, but omitted the fact that they received millions in federal funding.

“Rather than making public health a priority, it places the health and safety of all Americans at risk,” American Lung Association President and CEO Harold P. Wimmer claimed in a statement, for example.

Wimmer listed ways he believes the budget cuts would hurt the country, but hid the fact that his organization and its local affiliates have taken $16.3 million in EPA funding since Obama’s inauguration, TheDCNF’s analysis found.

The remaining four nonprofits made similar criticisms in statements while neglecting to publicize their financial stake in the budget cuts.

Meanwhile, it’s likely that state agencies – typically among the largest EPA grant recipients – gave the nonprofits and their state and regional affiliates additional funds, which were not included in TheDCNF’s analysis.

The American Lung Association of the Southwest, for example, received just over $386,000 from federal agencies in fiscal year 2015. But the group reported that it received more than $1.9 million in government grants, according to its 990 tax form, meaning more than $1.5 million likely came from state and local grants.

It would be nearly impossible to calculate how many non-federal government grants were awarded to the groups and their dozens of affiliates.

The Environmental Council of the States – an association of state environmental agency chiefs and a recipient of nearly $13.7 million from the EPA – even addressed concerns over cuts to state agencies.

“[T]he cuts to the core state programmatic grants are untenable,” the group’s president and Minnesota Pollution Control Agency Commissioner, John Linc Stine, said in a statement. The Environmental Council of the States also published a report on March 15 showing states operate 96 percent of the federal environmental programs and the EPA provides 27 percent of the funds for state environmental agency budgets on average.

Stine didn’t mention the nearly $13.7 million her organization took in EPA grants.

“Our concern with the president’s budget have to do with the cuts to” an EPA grant program that awards funds to state and tribal environmental agencies, the council’s Executive Director Alexandra Dunn told TheDCNF, adding that the council only receives a minimal funding from that program.

“We do not know how our funding will be affected going forward,” she continued.

American Association for the Advancement of Science CEO Rush Holt said through a spokesman that “like many nonprofit organizations, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) receives funding from a variety of sources — including philanthropic sources, federal agencies, publishing revenue and membership dues — to advance educational and public activities.”

“AAAS is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that has worked for 169 years to advance science and serve society. We don’t hesitate to speak on issues that may impede the advancement of science to benefit all people.”

"Trump Signs Sweeping Order To Dismantle Obama Climate Policies, Promote ‘Energy Independence’","President Donald Trump signed an executive order to rescind a slew of Obama administration policies aimed at tackling global warming and promote “energy independence.”

“The miners told me about the attacks on their jobs and their livelihoods,” Trump told those gathered at Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) headquarters where he signed the executive order Tuesday, also thanking career employees at EPA and coal miners who attended the signing.

“My administration is putting an end to the war on coal,” Trump said.

The order asks EPA to review major regulations limiting carbon dioxide emissions from new and existing power plants, the Clean Power Plan (CPP). The order also repeals Obama-era global warming directives.

The CPP aimed to cut CO2 emissions from existing power plants 32 percent by 2030. It also limited emissions from new power plants, which effectively banned new coal plants from being built.

The Supreme Court issued a stay against implementing the CPP last year after more than two dozen states sued to have the rule overturned. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt was part of that lawsuit while attorney general of Oklahoma.

Pruitt has been making the rounds with media outlets to promote Trump’s “energy independence” order. Pruitt stressed the administration aims to be pro-energy and pro-environment.

“It’s going to create jobs in the oil and gas sector,” Pruitt told Fox News Tuesday morning. “For too long, over the last several years, you’ve had certain industries, certain sectors of our economy that were within the cross-hairs of the EPA.”

“That is not going to happen anymore,” Pruitt said.

Trump’s “energy independence” order goes beyond EPA. The president is also asking the Interior Department to end a moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands.

EPA and Interior will also be ordered to review regulations on oil and natural gas drilling. EPA will review regulations on methane emissions from new oil and natural gas systems , and Interior will review rules for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands.

Trump will also scrap Obama administration directives to federal agencies, including the “social cost of carbon” estimate and a guidance on how officials should consider global warming when approving infrastructure projects under the National Environmental Policy Act.

The order also rescinds several other Obama executive actions and policies on global warming, including a 2013 strategy documents put out by the White House. An Obama order requiring the U.S. military to take global warming into account in national security assessments will also be rescinded.

Finally, Trump’s order requires federal agencies to review all rules already on the books that could hinder energy development within the next 180 days. Trump promised to get rid of “job-killing” energy regulations on energy production when taking office.

One thing Trump’s order won’t include is a condemnation of the Paris climate agreement that went into effect last year. Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner intervened to have language critical of the United Nations agreement stripped from the order, according to administration sources.

Democrats and environmentalists have opposed Trump’s efforts to roll back global warming regulations limiting coal production. Many activist groups plan on suing the Trump administration to slow down the regulatory rollback.

“Scott Pruitt and the president’s other minions must follow the rule of law,” wrote David Doniger, a lobbyist at the Natural Resource Defense Council who helped write the “blueprint” for the CPP.

“They can tear down these regulations only using the same legal process it took to build them. Their final decisions must pass muster in the courts,” Doniger wrote in a blog post.

Critics also say rescinding EPA regulations will do little if anything to bring back coal job, which Trump promised on the campaign trail. The coal industry has been in decline for years due to competitively-priced natural gas and federal regulations.

While all the jobs may not come back, Trump’s definitely brought optimism back to coal country.

Murray Energy CEO Bob Murray said while Trump won’t be able to bring coal mining jobs back — largely due to automation — he can “level the playing field” for the coal industry.

“We have to get the government out of the manipulation of the energy markets,” Murray told The Guardian.

Candidate Trump Promised To Terminate DACA. President Trump Says DREAMers Should ‘Rest Easy’,"Donald Trump said immigrants who were granted amnesty through Barack Obama’s 2012 immigration executive action Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals should “rest easy” about his immigration policies.

On the trail, Trump promised to “immediately terminate” DACA, which protects hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children from deportation, but he changed his tune in an interview with the Associated Press Friday when he said the administration is “not after the dreamers.”

“We are after the criminals,” Trump said. “That is our policy.”

His comment Friday differs vastly from what he said on the campaign trail. (RELATED: Rep. King Floats Suing Trump Over Immigration Flip)

“We will immediately terminate President Obama’s two illegal executive amnesties, in which he defied federal law and the constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants,” Trump said during a speech in Phoenix in August. “In a Trump Administration, all immigration laws will be enforced. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But, unlike this Administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement — and ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs.”

“Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation — that is what it means to have laws and to have a country.”

Skeptics may have seen this shift in the president’s policy coming, especially as DACA went unmentioned when the president cracked down on illegal immigration in February and because his communications team has avoided giving a direct answer when asked multiples times when the president would end DACA. (RELATED: Why Hasn’t Trump Followed Through On His Promise To Get Rid Of The H1B Visa And DACA Programs?)

In December, Trump softened his tone on the program.

“We’re going to work something out that’s going to make people happy and proud,” then president-elect Trump told Time magazine in an interview. “They got brought here at a very young age, they’ve worked here, they’ve gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they’re in never-never land because they don’t know what’s going to happen.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2017/04/21/candidate-trump-promised-to-terminate-daca-president-trump-says-dreamers-should-rest-easy/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjC54Lb_rP9AhXMF1kFHXBfCTk4PBAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw0z-BAzxpEt2PFBFDH1Q9dU,2017-04-21
Trump Announces US Withdrawal From The Paris Climate Accord,"President Donald Trump has made good on his campaign promise to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, undoing a crowning achievement of the Obama administration.

Trump promised to “cancel” the Paris Agreement on the campaign trail, but his own White House was split on the issue. The president already issued executive orders to roll back Obama-era global warming regulations.

The White House said that the Paris Agreement was poorly negotiated by the Obama administration and did not put American workers first. White House aides said the administration would withdraw from the Paris accord using the process laid out in the agreement.

Under this process, the U.S. wouldn’t fully withdraw until November 2019 — more than two years from now.

“President Trump has done the right thing by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement,” Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance (AEA) who headed Trump’s Energy Department transition team, told The Daily Caller News Foundation.

Trump’s announcement came after European leaders pleaded with him to stay in the Paris Agreement at the G7 conference in late May. However Trump could not be swayed, as reports surfaced in the wake of the G7 meeting the president had decided to withdraw from the Paris accord.

“He should be commended for recognizing it was a bad deal for American workers and would have caused continued harm to those around the world who suffer from energy poverty,” Pyle said. “Despite an intense lobbying effort from corporations, green lobbyists, U.N. bureaucrats, and the Al Gore’s of the world, Trump stood firm on his commitment to resetting our energy and environmental policies.”

Most Republicans and conservative groups opposed staying in the Paris Agreement, saying it posed a legal risk to Trump’s deregulatory efforts and sent mixed signals to the rest of the world. They also argued that staying in the agreement without Senate approval set a bad constitutional precedent.

President Barack Obama joined the Paris Agreement in 2016 without Senate approval, pledging to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.

White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, general counsel Don McGahn and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt were the leading voices in the administration calling for a Paris withdrawal.

“Thanks to President Trump, we will never have Paris,” AEA’s Pyle said.

Advisers Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner and Gary Cohn favored staying in the Paris Agreement. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Energy Secretary Rick Perry also favored staying in the agreement.

The pro-Paris crowd argued that Trump should stay in the agreement for diplomatic reasons. They also said since the Paris Agreement was not legally binding, it would have no effect on Trump’s domestic agenda — a point contested by Paris opponents.

Trump reportedly told several confidantes that he would be withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, sources told Axios Monday. The report came after Europeans spent days urging Trump to stay in the deal.

Democratic lawmakers also urged Trump to stay in the deal in May, bolstering calls from corporate America and even some major energy companies to stay in the agreement.

Environmentalists were furious with Trump’s decision, but it’s likely they would have also been unhappy at Trump staying in the deal with a weaker commitment to fight global warming.

“There should be no question: the U.S. must fulfill its international commitments in full,” Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said in a statement.

“Exploiting the flexibility of the Paris Agreement to reduce our commitment, or even pulling us out, would be a disaster for the United States, provoking international blowback, harming our global leadership role, and threatening the health and safety of all families in this country,” Brune said.

Conservative groups, including AEA, made a final plea to Trump in late May to keep his campaign promise to withdraw from the Paris accords. Republican lawmakers and attorneys general added their voices to calls to ditch the Paris Agreement, arguing that a failure to withdraw would imperil Trump’s agenda.

The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) has been one of the most vocal opponents of the deal, launching an ad campaign and petition to hold Trump to his campaign promise.

CEI senior fellows Chris Horner and Marlo Lewis published a paper early May calling on Trump to submit the Paris Agreement to the Senate for approval as required by the U.S. Constitution.

“The Agreement endangers America’s capacity for self-government,” their paper reads. “It empowers one administration to make legislative commitments for decades to come, without congressional authorization, and regardless of the outcome of future elections.”

Trump To Abolish Obama’s Green Legacy By Boosting Coal And Nuclear Projects,"President Donald Trump announced he’s lifting Obama-era policies preventing the financing of overseas coal plants, along with reviewing policies hindering nuclear energy.

“We will begin to revive and expand our nuclear energy sector, which I’m so happy about, which produces clean, renewable and emissions-free energy,” Trump said during a speech Wednesday. “A complete review of U.S. nuclear energy policy will help us find new ways to revitalize this crucial energy resource.”

Trump will encourage the World Bank to finance coal plants in developing nations, and his administration will begin a comprehensive review of U.S. nuclear power policy. The administration is expected to push a permanent nuclear waste repository in Yucca Mountain, Nevada.

Environmentalists began attacking the policy shift before Trump had even announced it.

“The nuclear industry’s promises of revival have proven nothing less than an extremely expensive fool’s errand,” Damon Moglen, senior strategic adviser of the environmental group Friends of the Earth, said in a press statement. “By calling for more nuclear energy, Trump must be reliving his affection for bankruptcy and poor investment opportunity. The future is about renewable energy.”

Trump has already signed resolutions to repeal 13 major regulations to eliminate 4.3 million hours of paperwork and $36.2 billion in compliance costs.

Coal and nuclear power provided about 30 and 20 percent of all electricity generated in the U.S. in the year 2016 respectively, according to data from Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Trump Backs ‘Comprehensive Immigration’ Reform,"President Donald Trump indicated he may support amnesty when talking to reporters aboard Air Force One Wednesday night.

The president was asked about Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly’s comments to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that President Obama’s amnesty for illegal immigrants who arrived as minors, DACA, might be terminated due to legal challenges from Republican states.

“It’s a decision that I make and it’s a decision that’s very very hard to make. I really understand the situation now,” President Trump replied. “I understand the situation very well. What I’d like to do is a comprehensive immigration plan. But our country and political forces are not ready yet.”

“Comprehensive immigration reform” is used in modern American politics as a euphemism for giving illegal immigrants currently in the U.S. a path to legal status or citizenship.

During his run for the presidency, Trump took a hardline stance on immigration and pledged to deport all 12 million or so illegal immigrants in the country. He also said he would “immediately” end DACA.

However, he has reneged on this promise, and in his first few months in office nearly 100,000 illegal immigrants benefited from the amnesty program.

Trump added, “There are two sides of a story. It’s always tough.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2017/07/13/trump-backs-comprehensive-immigration-plan/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwib6a7a_rP9AhX3FVkFHfGXCTo4MhAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw0jTlm9z15HLJqUjVdF55wH,2017-07-13
Legal Experts Skeptical Trump Can Unilaterally Subsidize Appalachian Coal,"West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice believes President Donald Trump can unilaterally set up a subsidy program for Appalachian coal through an executive order, but legal experts are unsure of where such authority would come from.

“The basic constitutional principle is that the President cannot spend money unless it is authorized by congressional statute, and Congress has appropriated funds that year for the program,” University of California-Berkeley law professor John Yoo told The Daily Caller News Foundation.

Justice’s proposal that Trump create a $4.5 billion program to subsidize utilities for every ton of Appalachian coal they burn is already causing a stir among Republicans. And it’s unclear how this would work without congressional appropriations.

Justice believes Trump can set up a program on his own, but his office did not respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation when asked for more specifics on what authority the president could rely on.

“I’m not sure how the executive could come up with 4.5 billion based on Article II authority,” Will Yeatman, a senior fellow at the libertarian Competitive enterprise Institute, told TheDCNF.

“I don’t see any details, but presumably the argument is based on the president’s inherent national security authority,” Yeatman said.

Appalachian producers have been hardest hit by the coal industry’s downturn. Their coal is much more expensive to mine than western coal in the Powder River Basin, and increased competition from low natural gas prices have curbed utilities’ appetite for coal.

Add to that Obama administration environmental regulations that most utilities played a role in closing coal plants. Trump promised to lift the regulatory weight off the coal industry, and has already taken steps to roll back Obama-era rules.

Justice wants Trump to go even further and subsidize Appalachian coal.

“There could be existing statutes that provide for subsidies for industries that are harmed by unfair trade competition or that are advancing innovative techniques for energy development,” said Yoo, who worked in the Bush administration Justice Department and was a major proponent of the “unitary executive” theory of government.

“The program you mention, however, doesn’t seem to fall within these categories,” Yoo said. “If no existing statute exists creating the program, then President Trump will have to ask Congress for new funds this upcoming year.”

Justice, who switched party affiliations from Democrat to Republican, recently told reporters Trump was “really interested” in the subsidy plan to pay utilities $15 for every ton of Appalachian coal for electricity.

Western state Republicans have come out against the plan, saying it would be government picking winners and losers. Appalachian Republican lawmakers have largely been silent on the issue, and it’s unclear how much support the proposed subsidy would get in Congress.

“Ultimately, I’d imagine that Congress would have to pass this,” Yeatman said.

It’s High Time Barron Trump Starts Dressing Like He’s In the White House,"I’ve been on the Barron Trump train from the start, but it’s about time the president’s son starts dressing the part.

Barron is the youngest son of Donald Trump and the only child the president shares with Melania Trump. Time and time again Barron has proved that he’s just a normal 11-year-old kid, despite the fact that his dad is the President of the United States and he lives in the White House. One thing that isn’t normal though is the way he dresses when he joins his parents for a public appearance.

Barron was returning to the White House from New Jersey on Sunday and while the president and first lady traveled in their Sunday best, young Barron looked like he was hopping on Air Force One for a trip to the movie theater. (11 Times Barron Trump Proved He’s A Normal 11-Year-Old Kid)

Think about how many times your parents forced you to dress up when you were a kid for a special occasion. No matter how hard you resisted, it was inevitable, you weren’t leaving the house until you had your tie tied, your shirt tucked in nice and neat with your hair combed, and a blazer on.

That’s not how it goes for the president’s youngest child.

Donald Trump and Melania always depart the White House looking their best. The president wore a fine tailored suit and Melania wore an elegant dress just as jaw-dropping as the last. But then Barron steps out in a t-shirt, khaki shorts and some suede loafers. (VIDEO: Barron Trump Snaps A Pic Of Marine One)

What am I missing here? Is Barron just better than I ever was at rebelling against my parents? Yeah, I’d put the blazer and tie on and comb my hair and all that, but as soon as my mom turned her head you better believe I was messing my hair up and loosening my tie. Hell I might even undo a couple buttons on my shirt if I was feeling like a real badass.

Barron doesn’t have to worry about all that, but he should. His dad is always looking dapper and his mom has become a worldwide fashion icon since becoming first lady. The youngest Trump doesn’t have any responsibilities as the president’s son, but the least he could do is dress the part when he steps out in public.

Correction: An earlier version of this piece stated that Barron was returning to Washington, DC from Arizona, not New Jersey.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2017/08/21/its-high-time-barron-trump-starts-dressing-like-hes-in-the-white-house/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiPwtPX_rP9AhVmRTABHTJ0BFc4ChAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw0A_4WYI6Q6mq4yeMEzLywN,2017-08-21
Trump Suggests Revoking Licenses For ‘Partisan’ Network News Outlets,"President Trump doubled down on his attack on so-called “fake news,” suggesting the possibility of revoking licenses for “partisan” network news outlets.

“Network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked. Not fair to public!” Trump tweeted Wednesday night.

Network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked. Not fair to public! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2017

That was Trump’s second tweet on the subject. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump floated the idea of challenging the license for NBC News after the network reported that the Republican had called for increasing the size of the U.S. nuclear arsenal ten-fold.

Trump blasted the report, tweeting: “With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!”

With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2017

Despite Trump’s rhetoric, any attempt to take NBC News or other networks off the air would be nearly impossible. That’s because only local affiliates of the major news networks have licenses. NBC, CBS, ABC and other networks do not operate with licenses.

Trump’s Sentencing Commission Nominees Show He May Not Be That Angry At Jeff Sessions,"President Donald Trump announced four nominees to the U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) Thursday, three of whom are advocates of Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ tough-on-crime policies.

Trump and Sessions appeared to have a falling out Wednesday when the president called his handling of the FISA investigation “disgraceful.” Sessions then pushed back against the insult, saying he was presiding over the Department of Justice (DOJ) and its investigations in a constitutional manner. Trump was allowed to nominate three Republicans and one Democrat to the USSC, and all three Republicans – Judge Henry Hudson, William Graham Otis, and Judge William Pryor – are Sessions allies.

Of particular note is Judge Hudson, known colloquially in Virginia as Henry “Hang ’em High” Hudson. Sessions recommended Hudson for the USSC in August 2017 and has now gotten his wish.

Hudson had also been a candidate for FBI director after former Director James Comey’s removal, and he has a consistently conservative record, ruling in 2010 that parts of the Affordable Care Act were unconstitutional. Hudson’s main purpose on the commission would be to push for mandatory minimum sentencing. Sessions already issued an order to federal prosecutors in spring 2017 to pursue the harshest possible sentences in every case.

Under former President Barack Obama, the USSC had reduced sentencing for drug offenders, allowing more than 30,000 to apply for shortened sentences. This was not an uncommon move, however, as states across the country pursued soft-sentencing reform under Obama and many have continued to do so under the Trump administration.

According to Holly Harris, executive director of the Justice Action Network, Sessions has been the singular obstacle to criminal justice reform in the Trump administration.

“The rest of the administration is headed in the right direction on criminal justice reform,” Harris told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “I think he [Trump] is learning about what is really ‘tough on crime’ and what actually lowers recidivism rather than just the traditional lock ’em up and throw away the key.”

Trump’s son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner leads the administration’s justice reform efforts and has repeatedly butted heads with Sessions. The two appeared to reach a compromise in January in which the administration would back prison reform but hold off on sentencing reform.

Trump supported that theory in January when he declared prison reform a top priority during his State of the Union address but didn’t mention sentencing. The White House also signaled Wednesday that wouldn’t support Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley’s sentencing reform bill because the administration doesn’t believe the votes are there, The Hill reported.

“The sentencing reform part still does not have a pathway forward to getting done,” a senior White House official said. “And so what we see now is an environment where the prison reform does have enough support to get done. And we think that by maybe doing this in smaller bits and pushing the prison reform now, we think this has a better chance of getting done.”

Now, Trump’s appointment of the three Sessions allies to the USSC only further implies that Sessions is having his way on sentencing reform for now.

"Trump Defends Tariffs: ‘If You Don’t Have Steel, You Don’t Have A Country’","President Donald Trump defended his Thursday announcement of a 20 percent tariff on imported steel with a Friday morning tweet.

We must protect our country and our workers. Our steel industry is in bad shape. IF YOU DON’T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON’T HAVE A COUNTRY! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2018

Trump made the shock announcement of tariffs on steel and aluminum Thursday afternoon after his aides furiously tried to stop him. Critics accused Trump of embarking the U.S. on a trade war and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped approximately 400 points on the news.

Earlier Friday morning, the president defended his tariffs even if they do start a trade war saying:

When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2018

Trump has long believed in the utility of tariff’s and protecting the U.S. steel industry. “We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer,” he said in his Thursday announcement.

Reuters Poll: Black Male Approval For Trump Doubles In One Week,"Black male support for President Donald Trump doubled in just one week, according to a Reuters poll on presidential approval.

A poll taken on April 22, 2018 had Trump’s approval rating among black men at 11 percent, while the same poll on April 29, 2018 pegged the approval rating at 22 percent. It should be noted that Reuters only sampled slightly under 200 black males each week and slightly under 3,000 people overall.

Trump experienced a similar jump in approval among black people overall, spiking from 8.9 percent on April 22 to 16.5 percent on April 29.

Black males were also far more likely to say that they had “mixed feelings” about the president. On the 22nd, 1.5 percent said they had mixed feelings, while 7.1 percent said the same on the 29th.

The results are interesting given the recent transformation of Kanye West, who posted a picture of himself wearing a Make America Great Again hat on his Twitter account last week.

The Definitive List Of Media Screw-Ups On The Trump-Russia Story,"The major correction issued by NBC Thursday on a story about wiretaps and Michael Cohen was just another reminder of the many media mistakes on the Russian collusion story.

NBC initially claimed that federal investigators were listening in on Cohen’s phone calls, but it turns out they had what’s called a “pen register warrant,” which means they could see who Cohen spoke to on the phone but could not hear what was said. (RELATED: MSNBC Issues HUGE Correction To Michael Cohen ‘Wiretap’ Story)

Unfortunately for the press, the obsession to prove collusion has dampened their journalistic abilities, leading to a seemingly endless list of corrections, retraction, and apologies.

We’ve compiled a list of some of the worst media screwups when it comes to Russia.

1. CNN Accuses Don Jr. Of Wikileaks Collusion

Last December, CNN’s Manu Raju reported that Wikileaks emailed Donald Trump Jr. to give him access to stolen documents a full ten days before they were released to the public.

Unfortunately for CNN, it turns out their sources gave them the wrong date. Don Jr. actually received an email with access to the stolen docs on Sept. 14, 2016, after they had already been released publicly.

2. ABC Tanks Stock Market With Fake Flynn News

ABC was forced to suspend Brian Ross after he falsely reported that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was prepared to testify that then-candidate Donald Trump ordered him to make contact with the Russians.

The stock market dropped a few hundred points at the news — but it turned out to be fake.

ABC clarified that Flynn was actually prepared to testify that Trump asked him to contact Russia while the administration was transitioning into office. Pretty standard preparation for an incoming president.

3. The Mooch Is NOT Under Investigation

CNN earns another spot on this list for their shoddy reporting about former Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci. In June, CNN relied on a single unnamed source to claim that Scaramucci was under investigation for a meeting he took with a Russian banker prior to Trump’s inauguration.

The Mooch denied the story and CNN later gave him a much-deserved apology. Oh… and three CNN employees resigned over the botched piece.

4. Bloomberg’s Dirty Deutsche Bank Scoop

Bloomberg initially reported in December that special counsel Robert Mueller had “zeroed in” on Trump by subpoenaing Deutsche Bank records for the incoming-president and his family.

Bloomberg later admitted that Mueller was looking for records relating to “people affiliated” with Trump.

5. Sessions Exonerated

Last May, CNN was sure that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had botched protocol when he didn’t list meetings he had with the Russian ambassador on his security clearance forms. To CNN and other establishment media outlets, this was proof that Sessions was hiding something related to Russia.

A little over six months later, CNN quietly walked back the scandal, explaining the FBI sent emails informing Sessions’ aide that he did not need to disclose the meetings on his forms because they were carried out in the course of his duties as a senator.

6. Russians Aren’t Just Hacking The Election — They’re Hacking Our Power Grid

The Washington Post claimed in January 2017 that Russians were hacking the U.S. power grid through a company in Vermont, only to change the story to say that only one laptop was infiltrated. It turns out that one laptop was never even connected to the power grid.

7. Republicans Funded The Dossier!

A number of news outlets have consistently claimed that Republicans initially paid for the anti-Trump Steele dossier, failing to note that Steele wasn’t even contracted by Fusion GPS until after the GOP donors pulled funding. The Republican donors say they paid Fusion for standard opposition research and that they have zero connection to the controversial dossier.

The media has perpetuated this falsehood so consistently that even former FBI director James Comey was confused, repeating the lie in an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier.

8. CNN’s Gets Comey Prediction Wildly Wrong

Prior to former FBI director James Comey’s congressional testimony last June, CNN asserted that Comey was prepared to contradict a key claim by President Trump — that Comey told him he was not under investigation.

Sadly for them, Comey’s prepared testimony was released with the line, “During our one-on-one meeting at Trump Tower…I offered that assurance [that he was not under investigation].”

9. The ’17 Intel Agencies’ Lie

The media perpetuated a false claim from presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for months, insisting that all 17 intelligence agencies agree that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. The New York Times, for example, rated that claim as true only to later say the exact opposite.

Only four intelligence agencies ultimately deemed Russia responsible for meddling because the other 13 have no business making judgments on the claim. As NYT succinctly explained, “the rest were doing other work.”

10. Manafort Notes Are A Nothing Burger

NBC botched its big scoop claiming that Paul Manafort’s notes from a meeting with a Russian lawyer included the word “donations” near a reference to the Republican National Committee.

Turns out that not only did the word “donations” not appear in Manafort’s notes, but the word “donor” didn’t either. POLITICO had to correct the NBC report, leaving the legacy network looking awfully embarrassed.

BONUS: Did Cohen Go To Prague?

Questions are being raised about a recent McClatchy report that states special counsel Robert Mueller has evidence Michael Cohen visited Prague in the summer of 2016. The story would be huge because it would seem to corroborate the portion of the Steele dossier claiming Cohen visited Prague at that time to meet with a Kremlin official.

However, no other outlets have confirmed the report and even anti-Trumpers are questioning its sourcing. (RELATED: Here’s Why You Should Be Skeptical Of That Michael Cohen Prague Story)

TEARS IN TEHRAN: Trump Pulls US Out Of Iran Nuclear Deal,"President Donald Trump is withdrawing the U.S. from the 2015 Iranian nuclear agreement, he announced Tuesday.

Trump signed a memorandum to reimpose devastating economic sanctions on Iran in a bid to force the regime back to the negotiating table for a new agreement. The president has long railed against the 2015 nuclear agreement noting its lack of perpetual ban on a nuclear program and how it fails to address the Islamic Republic’s malign activity across the middle east.

“This was a horrible deal that should never, ever have been made,” Trump declared.

National Security Advisor John Bolton continued to reporters, “We’re out of the deal.”

The new deal the president will seek would not have a similar “sunset clause” which ceases restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program and would also address the regime’s ballistic missile program. Iran has continued to test and deploy ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads, despite signing the deal.

The White House released a list of demands following the president’s speech:

Never have an ICBM, cease developing any nuclear-capable missiles, and stop proliferating ballistic missiles to others.

Cease its support for terrorists, extremists, and regional proxies, such as Hizballah, Hamas, the Taliban, and al-Qa’ida.

End its publicly declared quest to destroy Israel.

Stop its threats to freedom of navigation, especially in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea.

Cease escalating the Yemen conflict and destabilizing the region by proliferating weapons to the Houthis.

End its cyber-attacks against the United States and our allies, including Israel.

Stop its grievous human rights abuses, shown most recently in the regime’s crackdown against widespread protests by Iranian citizens.

Stop its unjust detention of foreigners, including United States citizens.

Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif however has indicated his government may not be willing to negotiate any follow on agreement with the U.S. if Trump withdraws. “If Trump makes this mistake and scraps the JCPOA (Iran’s nuclear deal) as an international achievement, he will later have to accept the rights of the Iranians under a worse situation,” he said Tuesday.

The decision was not well received by European signatories to the deal who mounted a last ditch effort to convince the President not to withdraw. Two European heads of state and the British Foreign Secretary visited Washington in the span of two weeks to instead convince Trump to keep the agreement and attempt to negotiate a follow on agreement.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2018/05/08/donald-trump-pulls-us-out-of-iran-nuclear-deal/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjlufXY_rP9AhW7KlkFHZ5uAw04HhAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw0seR_T3nKt8sJrA1MB5RrR,2018-05-08
Cambridge Professor Spied On Trump Campaign Advisers,"A top-secret CIA and FBI source who spied on two Trump campaign advisers and initiated contact with a third was all but outed Friday night.

The New York Times and The Washington Post provided a detailed description of the source in articles published Friday night, but did not identify him by name, citing concerns about his physical safety.

But the reports match up exactly with a Cambridge University professor first described in a Daily Caller News Foundation report from March. That professor, Stefan Halper, contacted Trump advisers Carter Page, George Papadopoulos and Sam Clovis during the 2016 campaign. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: A London Meeting Aroused George Papadopoulos’s Suspicions)

President Donald Trump commented Friday on the existence of an informant, who he asserted was “implanted” on the campaign “for political purposes.”

“Reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign for president,” Trump tweeted on Friday. “It took place very early on, and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a ‘hot’ Fake News story. If true — all time biggest political scandal!” (RELATED: With Leaks, DOJ Provides Clues About Secret Trump Campaign Informant)

Democrats, liberal pundits and some news outlets blasted Trump’s statement, saying there was no evidence that the FBI planted a spy inside the campaign. He was also accused of coordinating with House Republicans to expose the identity of the source, who has long provided information to the FBI and CIA. The source has also provided information for the Russia investigation both before and after Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s appointment on May 17, 2017.

But instead of a GOP-orchestrated exposure, it appears that Halper was essentially outed through leaks from the Justice Department or FBI.

The use of an informant is sure to raise questions on Capitol Hill as well as with Trump supporters. It remains unclear when Halper began conducting surveillance on the Trump team, whether he was paid, and whether he was directed by the FBI, CIA or both.

What exactly prompted the surveillance campaign is also a mystery. Page had been on the FBI’s radar since 2013 when he cooperated with the FBI for its investigation of a Russian spy ring in New York City. One of the Russian operatives met with Page. Page shared some of his academic research with the operative, and said nothing of substance was exchanged.

Page and Papadopoulos joined the campaign together on March 21, 2016. Weeks later, top officials at the FBI and Justice Department considered whether to warn the Trump campaign about Page because of the Russian spy ring case as well as about Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who is now indicted over his lobbying work for a Ukrainian political party.

Then-FBI Director James Comey and then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch decided against briefing the Trump team, according to a recent report from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. U.S. officials did not want to offer the warnings for fear of alerting any Russian agents that were circling around the Trump associates, according to various reports.

The government appears instead to have opted for old-fashioned human-on-human spying.

Halper, a veteran of three Republican administrations, first made contact with Page in mid-July 2016 at a conference held at Cambridge. They stayed in regular contact for the next 14 months, Page told TheDCNF.

Page also made multiple visits to Halper’s farm in Virginia. The pair also met in Washington, D.C. and maintained contact through email.

Page told TheDCNF that he did not believe at the time of their encounters that Halper was keeping tabs on him. But Page did say that during their first meeting at the Cambridge conference, Halper said that he had known then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort for years. And during an encounter later in the summer, Page and Halper discussed a letter that then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid had sent to the FBI accusing Page of being a Russian agent. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Cambridge Prof With MI6, CIA Ties Met With Trump Campaign Adviser During Campaign, Beyond)

Page said he recalled that Halper rolled his eyes at the suggestion.

Contact between Halper and Page ended in September 2017, around the time a surveillance warrant that had been taken out against Page was set to expire.

Halper, 73, reached out to Clovis and Papadopoulos within days of each other in August and September 2016.

He reached out to Clovis first, offering to provide the campaign with foreign policy advice. Halper, who worked in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan White Houses, is a well regarded foreign policy expert. He and Clovis met for coffee on Aug. 31 or Sept. 1. That was their only meeting, although Halper sent Clovis a note congratulating him after Trump’s election win.

As TheDCNF reported back in March, Halper contacted Papadopoulos through email on Sept. 2, 2016, offering to fly him to London to discuss writing a policy paper about energy issues in Turkey, Israel and Cyprus. Halper offered to pay $3,000 for the paper.

Papadopoulos made the trip and had dinner multiple times with Halper and a Turkish woman described as his assistant. Sources familiar with Papadopoulos’s version of their meetings said Halper randomly asked Papadopoulos whether he knew about Democratic National Committee emails that had been hacked and leaked by Russians.

Papadopoulos strongly denied the allegation, sources familiar with his version of the exchange have told TheDCNF. Halper grew agitated and pressed Papadopoulos on the topic. Papadopoulos believes that Halper was recording him during some of their interactions, sources said.

Halper’s assistant, who is named Azra Turk, brought up Russians and emails over drinks with Papadopoulos. Turk also flirted heavily with Papadopoulos and attempted to meet him in Chicago, where he lives, a source told TheDCNF.

Turk recently shut down her phone. Halper has not responded to numerous requests for comment over the past two months. The FBI, Justice Department and CIA declined comment for this article.

Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with another professor who discussed Clinton emails. On April 26, 2016, a Maltese professor named Joseph Mifsud told Papadopoulos during a meeting in London that he had learned that the Russian government had access to Clinton emails.

Two weeks later, on May 10, 2016, Papadopoulos met at a London wine room with Alexander Downer, the Australian High Commissioner to the U.K. An Australian diplomat named Erika Thompson introduced Papadopoulos to Downer. An Israeli diplomat named Christian Cantor introduced Papadopoulos to Thompson.

Downer reportedly told the FBI that Papadopoulos mentioned stolen Clinton emails during that meeting. That information was what the FBI claims sparked the opening of a counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign. That investigation, nicknamed “Crossfire Hurricane,” started on July 31, 2016.

Halper is not a prominent public figure, but he is well known in foreign policy circles. Some information about his links to CIA and MI6 as well as the British intelligence service is available in the public domain. He is the son-in-law of Ray Cline, a legendary CIA officer who was the agency’s top analyst during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Halper also served on former President George H.W. Bush’s failed 1980 presidential campaign. He worked with a team of former CIA officers on an opposition research team. Halper would go to work on the Reagan campaign. There he was involved in a small scandal called Debategate, in which a small cadre of Reagan aides obtained debate notes from former President Jimmy Carter. Halper denied wrongdoing.

In recent years, Halper has worked closely with Sir Richard Dearlove, the former chief of MI6. They are both partners at the Cambridge Security Initiative, an intelligence consulting group that lists “UK and US government agencies” among its clients.

Halper and Dearlove were in the news in December 2016 when they threatened to resign from the Cambridge Intelligence Seminar over what they said were pervasive Russian ties.

Here Are The 17 Prisoners Trump Has Freed Since He Took Office,"Since President Donald Trump took office, his administration has secured the release of 17 prisoners foreign governments had detained.

“We’ve had 17 released, and we’re very proud of that record. Very proud. And we have others coming,” Trump said Saturday evening as he welcomed home Joshua Holt, an American citizen who had been detained in Venezuela for two years without trial. (RELATED: Trump Spotlights 17 Americans Released From Overseas Prisons Since Beginning Of Administration)

Unlike his predecessor, the president has managed to bring these prisoners home without freeing terrorists or paying millions of dollars in suspected ransom payments.

Sabrina De Sousa:

Portuguese-American Sabrina De Sousa, a former CIA agent, was arrested and detained in Portugal in 2015 after being convicted in absentia in 2009 of kidnapping. De Sousa was sentenced to four years in prison for her alleged involvement in the kidnapping of radical Muslim cleric Osama Mustafa Hassan Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, in Milan, Italy, in 2003. Although De Sousa argued she played no part in the abduction, failed appeals had her on the fast track to becoming the first American intelligence official to serve jail time for a role in former President George W. Bush’s administration’s “War on Terror.”

But before she could be extradited to Italy in February 2017 to serve her sentence, Trump’s administration intervened on her behalf, securing a pardon and De Sousa’s freedom in March of the same year.

Aya Hijazi and her husband Mohamed Hassanein:

During a period of particular unrest in Egypt, authorities raided a non-governmental organization dedicated to helping street children in 2014 and arrested Egyptian-American Aya Hijazi, her husband and five other activists on false charges of human trafficking, kidnapping and rape.

Not long after Trump met Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in April 2017, an Egyptian court cleared all seven detainees of all charges. The president personally sent a U.S. government plane to Cairo to retrieve Hijazi and her husband, and he greeted them both at the White House upon their long-awaited return to the U.S. (RELATED: Obama Could Never Get An American Aid Worker Released. Through Quiet Negotiation And A Change In Tactic, Trump Freed Her)

Sandy Phan-Gillis:

China arrested Texas businesswoman Sandy Phan-Gillis in 2015 on charges of espionage and held her for two years without a public trial. Her husband, Jeff Gillis, insisted the allegations were “absolutely false.” He pleaded with the Obama administration to bring her home. While the administration pressed Beijing on the issue, it was ultimately unable to secure her release.

Following a meeting between former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with Chinese leadership in March 2017 and a summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Mar-a-Lago in April 2018, Phan-Gillis was finally freed from prison.

China sentenced her to three and a half years in prison but deported her before she could serve any additional jail time.

Otto Warmbier:

University of Virginia student Otto Warmbier was arrested for allegedly pilfering a propaganda poster while on a tour of North Korea in January 2016. The young student was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for his crimes at a tearful show trial in March that same year.

Through a series of back-channel negotiations with Pyongyang, Trump’s administration managed to secure Warmbier’s release in June 2017. But his return home was bitter sweet, as the Cincinnati native returned in a coma after having suffered a traumatic brain injury — details of which remain unclear. Warmbier passed away just one week after his release. (RELATED: Comatose American College Student Released By North Korea Has Died)

Both the president and the Warmbier Family have suggested the outcome might have been different if the previous administration had acted more quickly to save the now-deceased student.

Joshua Boyle, Caitlan Coleman and their three children:

Canadian-American couple Joshua Boyle and Caitlan Coleman were kidnapped in 2012 while backpacking through Afghanistan and held captive by the Haqqani network for five years. The Haqqani network, an offshoot of the Taliban, demanded the release of prisoners in exchange for the hostages — a demand that was not met. Coleman had three children during her and her husband’s time in captivity.

In October 2017, the U.S. pressured Pakistan into rescuing the family after they were spotted near the border. Pakistani authorities were able to recover the five captives, and the family returned to North America last fall.

Numerous questions continue to surround the captives, particularly Boyle.

UCLA basketball players LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill:

During a team trip to Hangzhou, China, in November 2017, three players — Li Angelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill — were arrested and detained for shoplifting at a local Louis Vuitton department store, stealing sunglasses. For their alleged crimes, the players were reportedly facing up to 10 years in Chinese prison, but Trump intervened. During the president’s first state visit to China, Trump brought up the issue in talks with Chinese President Xi, who promised to look into the situation.

The Chinese leader assured Trump the three players would be “treated fairly and expeditiously,” and the three players were freed shortly thereafter.

“I would like to thank President Trump and the United States government for the help they provided,” Ball said in a statement upon his return to the U.S. “I am grateful to be back home, and I will never make a mistake like this again. I am extremely sorry for those that I let down.” (RELATED: UCLA Basketball Players Thank Trump)

Kim Dong-Chul, Kim Hak-Song and Kim Sang-Duk:

Kim Dong-Chul, a businessman and purported Christian missionary, was arrested in North Korea in 2015 on charges of espionage. He was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor for his crimes. Kim Hak-Song and Kim Sang-Duk were professors at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology before they were arrested in May and April 2017 respectively for unspecified hostile acts.

Trump’s administration secured the release of these three prisoners during Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s second trip to North Korea in early May. The three men received a heroes welcome when they returned home. (RELATED: Trump: Pompeo Secures Release Of American Hostages In North Korea)

Joshua Holt:

Joshua Holt, a 26-year-old Utah native, and his Venezuelan wife, Thamy, along with their daughter, returned to the U.S. Saturday evening for a tearful reunion with Holt’s mother and father. Holt was arrested on charges of espionage when he traveled to Venezuela in June 2016 to marry Thamy.

President Trump announced his administration had secured Holt’s release Saturday morning. (RELATED: American Held Prisoner In Venezuela Finally Reunited With His Family)

More On The Way…

“We have others coming. We’re in the midst of some very big negotiations to get others out. In most cases, they’re Americans, but we can try and help other countries too, where there’s injustice. So we’ve been working very hard on it,” Trump said Saturday evening, making references to four Americans held captive in Iran and a North Carolina pastor held hostage in Turkey.

Trump Says Anti-Kavanaugh Protestors Are ‘An Embarrassment To The Country’,"President Donald Trump criticized protestors who interrupted his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing Tuesday in an exclusive Oval Office interview with The Daily Caller.

“I’m amazed that people allow the interruptions to continue,” Trump said of the multiple protestors who interrupted the first day of the proceedings, adding, “There [are] some people that just keep screaming.”

“In the old days, we used to throw them out. Today, I guess they just keep screaming.”

The first day of Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing was interrupted on numerous occasions by protestors throughout the room, with dozens arrested by Capitol Police. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Trump Says He Doesn’t See Himself Shutting Down Government Before Midterms)

Trump praised Senator Orrin Hatch’s condemnation of the protestors from the hearing, adding, “I don’t know why they don’t take care of a situation like that. I think it’s embarrassing for the country to allow protestors. You don’t even know what side the protestors are on.”

“Get them thrown out of here, my God.” –@OrrinHatch on protestors in the hearing room #kavanaugh — Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) September 4, 2018

“To allow somebody to stand up and scream from the top of their lungs — and nobody does anything about it — is, frankly … I think it is an embarrassment.” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Trump Says He Won’t Be Watching Neil Armstrong Movie After American Flag Snub)",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2018/09/04/trump-kavanaugh-protestors/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiosL7c_rP9AhVYLFkFHSkqCx44UBAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw2-4OhTzROmPAbw6HBsKbom,2018-09-04
EXCLUSIVE: Trump Says ‘Conflicted’ Mueller Is Leading ‘An Illegal Investigation’,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said Tuesday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is heading up “an illegal investigation” rife with conflicts of interest, including for Mueller himself.

Trump made the remarks during a wide-ranging exclusive Oval Office interview with The Daily Caller.

Asked whether Mueller’s expansive investigation would interfere in the 2018 election, the president dismissed the whole inquiry as “illegal.”

“I view it as an illegal investigation. It should have never been started. It should have never been allowed to start. You know, I’m not a target of this investigation, just in case you don’t realize.”

That’s also what former FBI Director James Comey told Trump multiple times in early 2017, before the president fired him, prompting Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to appoint Mueller as special counsel. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Trump Says Bob Woodward Has ‘A Lot Of Credibility Problems’)

The president ticked off the “many reasons” he considers the investigation illegal.

“Number one, there was no crime,” Trump said. “Number two, everybody was conflicted, including Mueller.”

“There were tremendous conflicts here.”

Among the conflicts Trump has cited, the president had interviewed Mueller for the FBI director role just days before the latter man’s appointment as special counsel.

“Sitting right in that chair,” Trump gestured from the Resolute Desk. “I liked him, but I didn’t give him the job.” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Trump Says He Doesn’t See Himself Shutting Down Government Before Midterms)

“I had a business dispute with Mueller before that. I had a real business dispute,” Trump said. The president’s claims of a business dispute reportedly revolve around decade-old golf fees.

“And he’s Comey’s best friend,” Trump insisted. “I could give you a hundred pictures of him and Comey hugging and kissing each other.”

“And then somebody from his law firm came out and said I can’t believe they picked Mueller. He hates the President. He hates the president,” Trump added.

“So that’s four things. That’s four.”

The president then moved on to what he views as clear conflicts of interest among Mueller’s staff. “You know, I call them the 17 angry Democrats,” Trump explained.

“It’s incredible when you look at [Andrew] Weismann and all these people. Some of the people worked for the Hillary Clinton Foundation. It’s an incredible thing.”

Jeannie Rhee, a lawyer on Mueller’s team, reportedly represented Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation in two separate 2015 cases.

“Honestly, people are very angry about it,” the president continued. “People that love our country are very angry about it.”

“So I consider it to be an illegal investigation. It should have never been allowed to have happened.”

EXCLUSIVE: Trump Prepped Lawsuit Against NBC Over ‘Access Hollywood’ Tape,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump attacked NBC’s journalistic credibility and called into question the authenticity and legality of the “Access Hollywood” tape leaked during the 2016 election, in an exclusive Oval Office interview with The Daily Caller Tuesday.

The remarks came up in a conversation about NBC’s handling of Ronan Farrow’s Harvey Weinstein reporting. Trump attacked NBC for allegedly quashing its journalists’ attempts to expose sexual assault and harrassment by the movie mogul. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Trump Says Sex Abuse Scandal Is ‘Devastating For Catholic Church’)

“I consider it to be worse than CNN with Harvey Weinstein,” he told TheDC.

The president added, “NBC is very dishonest in its reporting of me.”

Trump also would not call for the dismissal of NBC chairman Andy Lack or an outright removal of the company’s license, but he said, “he runs an organization which as far as its reporting on me is very dishonest.”

He addressed the issue first on Twitter Tuesday morning. (RELATED: Trump Says Bob Woodward Has ‘A Lot Of Credibility Problems’)

“NBC FAKE NEWS, which is under intense scrutiny over their killing the Harvey Weinstein story, is now fumbling around making excuses for their probably highly unethical conduct,” he tweeted. “I have long criticized NBC and their journalistic standards-worse than even CNN. Look at their license?”

The president also declared that there are multiple unanswered questions about the “Access Hollywood” tape released during the 2016 presidential campaign.

“That tape was, there are even questions about this tape,” Trump said, adding that there are also “real questions about that whole process.”

“I had a lawsuit prepared, a lawsuit that was prepared to be filed against NBC because they leaked that tape,” the president revealed.

Trump speculated that NBC leaked the tape to The Washington Post saying “they gave it to the Washington Post because they couldn’t put it out there themselves cause they would’ve had tremendous liability so they gave it to the Washington Post to put out.”

He continued: “I had a lawyer hired to bring a suit right after the election ended, but one problem arose. I won the election.”

Trump continued that because of his win, he would not have been able to sue for damages.

“What were the damages? I won the election.”

EXCLUSIVE: Trump Says He Won’t Be Watching Neil Armstrong Movie After American Flag Snub,"President Donald Trump said during an exclusive Oval Office interview with The Daily Caller that he will not be watching a new film on Neil Armstrong and the Apollo 11 mission to the moon after the film’s director decided not to show the planting of the American flag.

The film, “First Man,” starring Ryan Gosling, has come under fire in recent days for deliberately leaving out a scene showing Armstrong planting the American flag on the surface of the moon. “I think this was widely regarded in the end as a human achievement [and] that’s how we chose to view it,” Gosling said.

“It’s unfortunate,” Trump said when asked about the decision, adding “it’s almost like they’re embarrassed at the achievement coming from America, I think it’s a terrible thing.” The president continued, “when you think of Neil Armstrong and when you think of the landing on the moon, you think about the American flag.” (RELATED: Trump Says Anti-Kavanaugh Protestors Are ‘An Embarrassment To The Country’)

“For that reason, I wouldn’t even want to watch the movie,” Trump said of the film.

EXCLUSIVE: Trump Says Bob Woodward Has ‘A Lot Of Credibility Problems’,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump addressed newly released excerpts from Bob Woodward’s book on his administration, denying some specific allegations and accusing the author of credibility issues, in an exclusive Oval Office interview with The Daily Caller.

“It’s just another bad book. He’s had a lot of credibility problems,” Trump declared, adding, “I probably would have preferred to speak to him, but maybe not. I think it probably wouldn’t have made a difference in the book. He wanted to write the book a certain way.”

“It’s just nasty stuff. I never spoke to him. Maybe I wasn’t given messages that he called. I probably would have spoken to him if he’d called, if he’d gotten through. For some reason I didn’t get messages on it.”

Trump specifically denied that senior aides, such as former National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, were removing papers from his desk, saying “that’s false,” that “it’s just made up” and that “there was nobody taking anything from me.”

The president speculated that the statements could have come from “disgruntled employees or just made up.” (RELATED: Trump Had Prepped NBC Lawsuit Over ‘Access Hollywood’ Tape — Then He Won The Election)

“It could be just made up by the author,” he said.

The president pointed to a newly released statement from White House chief of staff John Kelly, who denied making disparaging remarks about his boss.

“The idea I ever called the President an idiot is not true,” Kelly said. “As I stated back in May and still firmly stand behind: ‘I spend more time with the President than anyone else, and we have an incredibly candid and strong relationship. He always knows where I stand, and he and I both know this story is total BS. I’m committed to the President, his agenda, and our country. This is another pathetic attempt to smear people close to President Trump and distract from the administration’s many successes.” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Trump Critical, But Says Nike’s Kaepernick Deal ‘Is What This Country Is All About’)

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also addressed the book in a statement, saying, “This book is nothing more than fabricated stories, many by former disgruntled employees, told to make the President look bad. While it is not always pretty, and rare that the press actually covers it, President Trump has broken through the bureaucratic process to deliver unprecedented successes for the American people.”

Full Transcript Of Trump’s Oval Office Interview With The Daily Caller,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump sat for an exclusive Oval Office interview Tuesday with The Daily Caller’s Saagar Enjeti and Vince Coglianese for approximately 38 minutes.

The transcript is as follows:

THE DAILY CALLER: “So you have been batting almost 1000 on primary endorsements. You have to be pretty proud of that.”

POTUS: “And the one I didn’t get was Friess, I was asked to do that, by my son Don, and I did it but I did it — I was asked the morning of — and by the time I did it I guess 70 percent, almost 70 percent of the vote was already cast. So, I don’t consider that to be, maybe I’ll take a quarter of a loss on that one. But I think it’s 48 and a quarter, it’s 48-1 which is pretty good, right? Pretty good.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Could you give us some insight into what goes into how you pick somebody to endorse?”

POTUS: “It’s very much my gut instinct coupled with a lot of talented people that I have that know where these people have come from over the last two years. For instance, sometimes I’ll have a nasty never-Trumper and every once in a while it’s recoverable but generally speaking if somebody is that much opposed. Now if somebody is opposed, that’s one thing, if they’re that much opposed to a tune of coming up with the never-Trumper type stigma, it’s rare that I’ll get involved.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Sir, what win are you most proud of so far?”

POTUS: “I think we have a lot of them. The Republican governor of Georgia, he was down 10, and I endorsed him, and I think he won 70-30. He won by 40 points. I did that endorsement at the request and I liked him a lot. First of all, I have to really respect the candidate, I have to like the candidate, otherwise I’m just not going to get involved. But he’s currently running as you know, he won the race against the man that was favored. But I did that for Sunny Purdue. But when I did it he was down about 10 points. And he ended up winning by 70-30. He won by 40 points, so that means he picked up 50. I mean, there are a lot of them. I would say of the list of 48 victories, I would say that close to half of them were races that could’ve been lost. I think the one in Ohio was a great victory, because when I get involved I don’t have the percentages, but he was very, very down. And he ended up winning by 1,800 votes. I would say Kansas is a good example. The governor of Kansas was running against somebody that’s always been, you know Kris who’s always been very strong Trump, right from the beginning. And you know he’s the governor of Kansas he’s running against. Kris is a good man, so I endorsed him, and he won.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Yeah, close one.”

POTUS: “Close one, but he won. He was down 11. He was down 11 when I endorsed him with about a week, with about three days left, and he ended up winning. Donovan on Staten Island. He was down ten and won by 24 points.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Right.”

POTUS: “Or thereabouts. That was a surprise because he was going to, you know, he was expected to lose. I endorsed him. He won by a lot. As you know he was expected to lose against the previous congressman, right? He followed him. I guess the one they talk about the most is Florida because he was at 3, don’t forget when I endorsed him, he was at 3. I put out two tweets. I put one out where I say he’s really good, blah, blah, blah, but that wasn’t an endorsement. That was when he was at 3. A lot of people don’t view that, they view the endorsement. Then a few months later and he went from 3 to — so he was at 3, with little money but a great guy and brilliant education. You know, he went to Harvard, Yale — great, terrific student, very smart guy. Just a very impressive guy, I’ve always liked him — Ron DeSantis. But he was at 3 and he went up to in the 20s with just not an endorsement. And then the endorsement, I mean —.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “And he took off.”

POTUS: “Well, the one who lost, who was expected to be the governor of Florida for the last four years. You know, they thought he had $21 million in the bank and his poll numbers were into the 20s and 30s. And Ron hadn’t really started much of the fundraising yet. And he was at 3. So then he went up from 3 to in the 20s. And then he started fundraising and did very well. And then he went from the 20s to win by 20 points. And that seems to be the one that people are most impressed with.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Yes, they felt the impact of the endorsement.”

POTUS: “I could go on for an hour, but there were many of people that were way behind that ended up winning.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “We do have a lot of different questions for you on a bunch of different subjects that I know you want to talk about. One that I want to make sure to get out of the way earlier is about this new Woodward book. There are a bunch of allegations in it about senior aides stealing documents from the desk. Right here.”

POTUS: “That’s false. You know the deal was, that it’s false. Made up. Disgruntled employees or just made up, could just be made up by the author. That was on the South Korean trade deal, which I’ve completed just recently. And we’re going to be signing it, I think we’ll be signing it during United Nations week in a couple of weeks in New York. The deal was done, it’s an incredible deal. It was a terrible deal. But it was a Hillary Clinton deal where we lost hundreds of thousands of jobs. And I voided the agreement, made a new one and there’s a good example, that wasn’t having to do with North Korea, that had to do with just the South, with the Korean deal on trade. And that deal, I got it completed, and it went from a horrible deal to a deal that’s good for the United States and hopefully good for South Korea. That was a one-way horror show. There was nobody taking anything from it. I mean, nothing. I can tell you that deal went relatively smoothly along.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “So the Woodward book is falsehoods, you think.”

POTUS: “Well, it’s just nasty stuff. I never spoke to him, and maybe I wasn’t given messages that he called. I probably would’ve spoken to him if he got through, but he was, for some reason I did not get messages on it. I’ll tell you, General Kelly just put out a statement that his statement was totally false — he never made it. He put it out a little while ago, you’ll get it from Sarah. But I did have something done for you guys cause I figured you may.”

BILL SHINE: “Sir, right on top of the little.”

POTUS: “Oh, good, thank you. I just had this made up. This doesn’t even, no president in history has done what I’ve done in two years. The other side is going crazy, they are lunatics. And here’s a list of things that I’ve done that you guys can have. I just had it made up for you because you guys have always been fair. Kelly has said that it’s a false statement. Many of the people have said they’re false statements. It’s just another bad book, and you know he’s had a lot of credibility problems, Woodward, as you know, you’ve seen it. He’s had a lot of credibility problems. I wish I could’ve — I probably would’ve preferred to speak to him, but maybe not. I think it probably wouldn’t have made any difference in the book. He wanted to write a book a certain way.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Can we turn to culture, Mr. President?”

POTUS: “You guys do understand what I mean, though — it’s terrible what they can write. They can write anything they want. They can say anything they want. And honestly, it’s a shame. It’s really a shame. Go ahead.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “So with Nike, you know they decided to feature Colin Kaepernick in its ads for the 30 anniversary. You’ve been really tough on the NFL kneelers. What message do you think Nike is sending to the country with this?”

POTUS: “I think it’s a terrible message. I have Nike is a tenant of mine. They pay me a lot of rent. But I think it’s a terrible, horrible message that they’re sending. And the purpose of them doing it, you know, maybe there is a reason for them doing it. But I think as far as sending a message, I think it’s a terrible message and a message that shouldn’t be sent. There’s no reason for it.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Sure. Did you see the news about the Neil Armstrong movie? That they won’t be showing the scenes.”

POTUS: “Yes.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Could you give us your thoughts on that? Do you think that’s upsetting?”

POTUS: “I think it’s very unfortunate. It’s almost like they’re proud of, it’s almost like they’re embarrassed at the achievement coming from America. I think it’s a terrible thing.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Hollywood’s an American industry. You would think.”

POTUS: “Well, I really believe when, ’cause when you think of Neil Armstrong and when you think about the landing on the moon, you think about the American flag. And I understand they don’t do it. So for that reason I wouldn’t even want to watch the movie.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Do you think other people should go see the movie?”

POTUS: “That’s up to them. It really is, that’s up to them. I don’t want to get into the world of boycotts. Same thing with Nike. I wouldn’t say you don’t buy Nike because of the Colin Kaepernick. I mean, look, as much as I disagree, as an example, with the Colin Kaepernick endorsement, in another way, I wouldn’t have done it. In another way, it is what this country is all about, that you have certain freedoms to do things that other people may think you shouldn’t do. So you know, I personally am on a different side of it, you guys are probably too, I’m on a different side of it.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “So you just mentioned Colin Kaepernick. I want to ask you about Kanye West. So he said last week, he did a radio show in Chicago, and he said last week, that you, the president, would like black people to like you and that you’ll do the things that are necessary to make that happen. Is that a mission of yours?”

POTUS: “I would like that to happen, and I think it has happened. You know, I did actually a lot better than people thought with African-American voters or probably I wouldn’t be sitting behind this desk. But now my numbers are much higher than they were, and Kanye West was a part of it. And so is Tiger.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “So you credit them with your approval rating there?”

POTUS: “No, I credit more, I do, I think that helped, and I also credit the fact that African-American unemployment is the lowest level in the history of this country. Homeownership is up for African-Americans — way up, every category. They’re doing better than they did with the past administration or the Democrats. And I actually think my next run because of that will be a lot easier. Don’t forget, when I used to say, when I used to read off crime statistics and education statistics, how bad education was in black communities and all of the horrible statistics, homeownerships statistics, when I used to call that out and I’d say ‘what do you have to lose by voting for me’ because they’ve always voted for Democrats. I mean essentially almost 100 percent. I say what do you have to lose? Now I go up and say ‘listen here’s what I’ve done.’ Your unemployment is the lowest it’s ever been and then I go point after point after point. I don’t know how anyone beats that message. That’s a tough message to beat. I don’t know if you guys agree. So before I went up with a promise, but it’s a promise. Now I’m going up with real stuff.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “And you’ve kept that promise?”

POTUS: “Yeah, I mean, not only there how about with everybody? Strongest economy the country’s ever had. We have the best economy the country’s ever had and it’s getting better. I think your next numbers are going to be even better. So the 4.1 gets up to 4.2, gets re-adjusted to 4.2 and you know, when you think — I think we have tremendous potential to go upward. And the trade deals are going to be a big part of it. And military protection is going to be a big part. I mean, I’m criticized in this crazy book about military protection — well they’re right. I think it’s horrible what’s happening to the United States. We’re protecting immensely wealthy countries and they’re not paying us for the protection. I say, why are we protecting you when you’re very wealthy and you wouldn’t be here for two weeks if it wasn’t for us? Why aren’t we being reimbursed for this massive cost? Fully reimbursed — for this massive cost that we’re taking care of.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Do you feel alone in that view? Do you feel like you have support inside the administration?”

POTUS: “Amazingly alone. Amazingly. A lot of generals don’t understand it, a lot of people don’t understand it. Amazingly alone. But I’ve gotten many converts over the last period of a year. But I started off amazingly alone. Once you say it three or four times people start to say ‘wow he’s right about that.’ I mean, I could go country after country, but I won’t embarrass them. But immensely wealthy countries, where they’re paying a fraction of what it’s costing us to protect them. And without us they wouldn’t even be there.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “It seems like the theme here is that in Washington it’s not often somebody comes along and sort of rethinks what everybody already believes. In Washington, despite the bipartisan differences, everyone has the same momentum, they’re all headed in the same direction. And you feel like you’re coming in —”

POTUS: “Well, your question was so good because nobody has ever asked me that. It’s almost like you sort of understood the situation better, does everyone agree with you on that? Because you guys are probably sitting there saying, but then you’re saying but you have to go through this incredible layer of people.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “You’re challenging the conventional wisdom.”

POTUS: “Yeah, I mean and I say to myself ‘OK, you have a country, it’s immensely wealthy, we’re guarding it. We’re spending tremendous amounts, billions of dollars to guard and they’re not reimbursing us. Why? I’ll be honest, I’ve asked countries, I’ve said, you’ve got to reimburse us. First, they don’t even understand the question. Within five minutes, they agree.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Can you give us an example?”

POTUS: “They actually, no, but you’ll be seeing things come out. I’ll talk to you. They actually can’t believe they’ve gotten away with it for so long. I had one guy say ‘we knew you were going to be asking.’ Like they can’t believe it took so long. These are really wealthy — there are actually many of them. But these are really wealthy, really successful. They spend very little, I’ll give you an example, is NATO. So we’re paying anywhere from 70-90 percent the cost of NATO to guard Europe. OK? Against Russia. We’re spending — you know, mostly against Russia. So, we’re spending 70-90 percent. Now a lot of people think, ‘oh it’s great for us.’ It’s great for Europe. OK? It’s not great for us. It’s great for Europe. And that’s OK. But they got to pay their share. So, I went there and I had a very successful meeting. And I was able to get them to spend big, last year, just with a low key meeting they paid $43 billion more. OK? As Stoltenberg said. This year it’s much more than that. They’ve gone way up. But you know, I don’t know if you’ve looked, NATO spending was going this way — people weren’t paying, you know why, cause no one was really asking. Our past presidents would go in, they’d make a little speech, ‘hey we’d like you to pay your bills’ and they’d leave and that would be the last thing. Ask, you may want to call him, but ask Stoltenberg what he thinks because he’s my biggest fan in a sense cause he can’t believe what’s happened. Now these countries are paying. One of the best meetings, one of the most successful meetings I had was with President Putin. But the press, it was fake news. It was a great meeting. We had a great meeting. It’s good if we get along with Russia, not bad. And it’s good if we get along with China and now we’re in very much of a trade situation with them. But we can’t allow them to take $500 billion out of our country every year. With Russia we had a very good meeting, but if you read the papers, it’s just all fake news. You know, we talked about Syria, we talked about Ukraine, we talked about Israel and protecting Israel. We had a great meeting and then I guess they wanted me to get into a boxing match with him on the podium. It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Have you talked to Russia in the past few days about Syria?”

POTUS: “Well, you saw what I put out, right?”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Yes.”

POTUS: “I better not, I won’t say. I won’t say. But I don’t like it. You know, it was very interesting, I was at a meeting in Indiana, and a woman was there, we had a one closed room meeting with people from the state. And a woman was telling me about this happening, this was a couple of weeks ago, and said we have a chance, she was Syrian, she was from Syria, and she said ‘I think they’re going to kill millions of people.’ And I said, ‘no, that won’t happen because the world is watching. And she explained, she was from the area, she said she thinks her family is going to be killed. I went out and then yesterday I read a big story about it, and I said, you know that woman is potentially right. But by my putting out that message I think maybe it’s going to send a signal. I mean we’re going to see, but it’s a terrible thing. There are a lot of bad things going on in the world, that I can say.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Sir, can we ask you –?”

BILL SHINE: “Last question.”

POTUS: “Let them have it, these guys have been great. Let them have a few more.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Sir, do you think you’re going to be declassifying the FISA documents that have been targeting your campaign?”

POTUS: “Will I declassify them?”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Will you be declassifying them?”

POTUS: “Well, we’re looking at it very seriously right now because the things that have gone on are so bad, so bad. I mean they were surveilling my campaign. If that happened on the other foot, they would’ve considered that treasonous. They would’ve considered that spying at the highest level. Can you imagine if we were doing that to Obama instead of Obama and his people doing that to us? Everybody would’ve been in jail for the next 500 years. OK? Can you believe it, where they paid this guy millions of dollars, it turned out? If you look at all of the things that are happening.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Sir, do you think, since Mueller has passed the Sept. 1 deadline now, do you think he’s interfering in the election?”

POTUS: “Well, I view it as an illegal investigation. It should’ve never been started. It should’ve never been allowed to start. You know, I’m not the target of this investigation, just in case you don’t realize. But I view it as being illegal for many reasons. Some of which are that, number one there was no crime and number two everybody was conflicted, including Mueller. There were, I mean tremendous conflicts here, you know the conflicts, you’ve heard the conflicts.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Speaking of one which you cited, I’d like to know, you said you interviewed Mueller for FBI director.”

POTUS: “Sitting right in that chair.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “What did you think during the interview?”

POTUS: “I liked him, but I didn’t give him the job?”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Why?”

POTUS: “But I had a business dispute with Mueller before that. I had a real business dispute. And he’s Comey’s best friend. And I could give you 100 pictures of him and Comey hugging and kissing each other. You know, he’s Comey’s best friend. How can you possibly have a man who is that, and then somebody from his law firm came out and said, ‘I can’t believe they picked Mueller. He hates the president. He hates the president.’ So that’s four things, that’s four, then you have the conflicts of the people — you know I call them the 17 angry Democrats, I guess they’re being lowered down now. It’s incredible when you look at Weissman and all these people. Some of the people work for the Hillary Clinton foundation. It’s an incredible thing. Honestly, people are very angry about it. People that love our country are very angry about it. So, I consider it to be an illegal investigation. It should’ve never been allowed to have happened.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “I want to ask you about social media companies ’cause you’ve expressed a lot of concern about censorship by social media companies to the point that you were defending CNN’s right to have a place to speak on these social media companies because you were defending the principle of it. Are you worried that these companies will interfere in the election?”

POTUS: “Well, I think they already have. I mean, the true interference in the last election was that — if you look at all, virtually all of those companies are super liberal companies. They were in favor of Hillary Clinton. Now maybe I did a better job because I’m good with the Twitter and I’m good at social media, but the truth is they were all on Hillary Clinton side, and if you look at what was going on with Facebook and with Google and all of it, they were very much on her side. And that’s a real situation. When I say, though, when you start, when you start getting into it, it can also reverberate that the others, it could switch the other way some day, I don’t know, maybe someday it will. That’s why I use the CNN situation. I’d rather have CNN’s voice, as fake news as it is, I’d rather have the CNN voice, like for instance I watched this thing play out today on NBC, which I consider to be worse than CNN in a certain way. Even though I made them a lot of money with ‘The Apprentice’ — a lot of money. But I consider it to be probably worse than CNN with Harvey Weinstein and what’s going on there.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “So you think their license should be pulled because of the Weinstein story?”

POTUS: “No, but I know you have to get licensed, and I can tell you that CNN — that ABC, most of them, but that NBC is very dishonest in its reporting of me. Very dishonest in its reporting of me. So, if they’re dishonest of me, now I think they’re more dishonest of me than they would be of most people because most people they don’t care about, but they are very dishonest.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Well, the allegation here of course is that senior leadership was meddling in their ability to do journalism, and if other reports are to be believed, NBC leadership also leaked the Access Hollywood tape during the campaign.”

POTUS: “A lot of people say that what they did — OK, so I had a lawsuit prepared, I had a lawsuit that was prepared to be filed against NBC because they leaked that tape. First of all, that was done, that tape was, there are even questions about this tape, there’s many things going on. But it was also done in a dressing room — real questions about that whole process. And they gave it to the Washington Post because they couldn’t put it out there themselves ’cause they would’ve had tremendous liability so they gave it to the Washington Post to put out. OK. I had a lawyer hired to bring a suit right after the election ended. But one problem arose — I won the election. OK, and they were going to say, ‘what was your damages?’ The damages was I lost the election, but now I won the election. So what were the damages? I won the election. I was going to sue because what they did — that was done in the dressing room. You know those trailers are really luxury, beautiful, actually. That was done in a trailer. It ruined Billy Bush’s career. And that was done in a trailer secretly. That was illegal what they did.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “But is this part of a pattern of sort of corrupt behavior by NBC?”

POTUS: “Well, not only NBC, I think the media, large segments of the, not all, large segments of the media are corrupt. Absolutely.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “What about Andy Lack, do you think he should go?”

POTUS: “Well, he runs an organization that as far as its reporting on me is very dishonest. They’re very dishonest. I can do something good and they’ll make it as bad as possible. No matter what I do. If I do something that’s really good, they’ll make it as bad as they can make it. If I do something bad, it’s like you know, it’s like I should get the electric chair. It’s incredible.

THE DAILY CALLER: “Just this weekend, Chuck Todd wrote a piece saying that it’s time for the press to ‘Fight back against people who challenge their credibility,’ and Chuck Todd of course an MSNBC and NBC —”

POTUS: “Sleepy Eyes.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Ha, what do you think of that? The idea that they’d fight back.”

POTUS: “He’s Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd. He covers me very dishonestly, I mean you watch his show, it’s like he gets angry at people if they say I’ve done a good job. And they won’t appear on the show again. You look at these panels of people, the worst are the panels. You look at this guy Dowd on ABC, I don’t even know who the hell he is.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Matthew Dowd.”

POTUS: “He’s just horrendous, he’s supposed to be a Republican. You know, it’s always rough when they say Republican and then they go into — and my people say, ‘Geez he’s a Republican, how can he be that way?'”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Ana Navarro comes to mind.”

POTUS: “Ana Navarro, she’s sick. I mean, she’s sick. The hatred. I never met Ana Navarro. I met Dowd once, he came right into the Oval Office like about a year ago, walked in, could not have been nicer, I said ‘hello,’ just a quick — he was in the White House. You were there, I think, Sarah. We said a quick hello and that was it. And he was gone. Couldn’t have been nicer. But before that, brutal, but I watched him a week ago and the level of hatred is beyond anything normal that I can imagine.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Can I ask you about the Kavanaugh hearing today?”

POTUS: “Yeah.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Democrats have put on quite a show, have you kept up with it?”

POTUS: “A good show or a bad show?”

THE DAILY CALLER: “I’ll leave that up to you, sir.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Have you seen some of it? It’s been a lot of protests and interrrupting.”

POTUS: “I’m amazed that people allow the interruption to continue. You know, there are some people that just keep screaming at the same people. In the old days we used to throw them out. Today I guess they just keep screaming. I thought Sen. Hatch was good because he was very indignant at the interruptions by a woman that was up there that just kept going on and on. I don’t know why they don’t, why they don’t take care of a situation like that because it’s terrible. I think it’s embarrassing for the country to allow protesters, you don’t even know which side the protesters were on. But to allow someone to stand up and scream from the top of their lungs and nobody does anything about it is frankly — I think it’s an embarrassment. I think, well it’s really early stages, but I think the Democrats are grasping at straws, that looks like to me. It’s incredible how bipartisan everything, when you look at how the opposite, I mean, when you look at how the level of division between the two sides, it’s sort of incredible.

THE DAILY CALLER: “Several Democrats who want to run for president, potentially in 2020 are on the Judiciary Committee, people like Cory Booker and Kamala Harris — do you think they’re sort of auditioning for the role right now?”

POTUS: “Yeah, I mean, I hope they are, ’cause I’d love to run against them. So far I don’t see anybody — I saw John Kerry is looking, I like that very much. He’s the father of the Iran deal.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Joe Biden.”

POTUS: “I’d love Joe Biden, sleepy Joe. I’d love Joe Biden to run. It looks like they’re going to have a lot of people lining up, but so far, and I’m an honest guy, I’ll let you know if there’s anybody I see that could be trouble. But so far, I’m not seeing it. I think they’re using this hearing as an audition for the presidency.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “The other big fight for Congress is the government spending because they have to handle a government spending bill in September.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Where are we on a shutdown, specifically on immigration?”

POTUS: “Well, I want to keep, I don’t like the idea of shutdowns. We’ve already started the wall. We’ve gotten $3.2 billion for the wall. We’ve done a lot of work on the wall. San Diego is completing now the whole, a big chunk of — we’re putting it in the worst areas where we really need it the most. Ultimately I can do it all in one year, I’d like to get the funding, the full funding, but we have done a lot of work. People don’t realize that. I’ve done it very quietly. The press isn’t picking it up. We’ve done a lot of work on the wall. And it’s really, really good work. Border security is a very important issue. I don’t see even myself or anybody else closing down the country right now.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Maybe after the midterms?”

POTUS: “I think that after midterms, we’re going to have a very serious discussion because we want border security, we have to have it. It’s going to be a big part of — it is a big part of this country. We have to have border security.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Are you disappointed that you had to scale back from 100 percent prosecution for border crossers because of the family separation coverage?”

POTUS: “Look, what I say is this, if you’re going to come into the country illegally, that’s why our numbers good despite horrible laws. We have horrible laws, but our numbers are good in terms of keeping our country safe. There’s gotta be a price to pay. There’s gotta be a price to pay, and there is a price to pay. You know we’re very tough on people crossing the borders illegally. And you know Obama had the same policy of separation. You know, people don’t realize half the pictures were taken of separation were taken where, most of the pictures, that pictures in ’14 of kids separated from their parents. That was all Obama. People don’t say it but Obama had the same law that I did and they separated parents from children. I think you guys understand that.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Yes, very much so.”

POTUS: “You like these people, don’t you? Do you want to give them one more question? Go ahead.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “Sir, if you could tell us a little about any of your thoughts on the allegations of sexual abuse right now within the Catholic Church? I think it’s an important issue for the country.”

POTUS: “It’s so sad to watch.”

THE DAILY CALLER: “And how do you think the Pope is handling it?”

POTUS: “It’s so sad to watch. The numbers, the length of time, you know, going back 70 years. I think it’s having a really negative impact on the Catholic Church. I think it’s very sad, to me it’s one of the sadder stories ’cause I respect so much the Catholic Church. And to me it’s a very sad story. The Pope is handling it, I guess, the best anyone can handle it. How is he going to handle it?”

THE DAILY CALLER: “What about leadership here in the U.S.? Are you disappointed in them? Do you think they should go?”

POTUS: “Well, I’m surprised at McCarrick. Everyone knew him and so incredible to see these things. It’s devastating for the Catholic Church.”

EXCLUSIVE: Trump Accuses Social Media Companies Of Interfering On Hillary’s Behalf,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump accused social media companies of interfering in both the 2016 and 2018 presidential elections, in an exclusive Oval Office interview with The Daily Caller.

“I think they already have,” Trump said of social media companies interference in the 2018 presidential election. The president pivoted to 2016 saying “I mean the true interference in the last election was that — if you look at all, virtually all of those companies are super liberal companies in favor of Hillary Clinton.”

“Maybe I did a better job because I’m good with the Twitter and I’m good at social media, but the truth is they were all on Hillary Clinton’s side, and if you look at what was going on with Facebook and with Google and all of it, they were very much on her side,” Trump continued.

He cautioned companies not to maintain a bias because it could one day be used against political causes that they prefer. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Trump Critical, But Says Nike’s Kaepernick Deal ‘Is What This Country Is All About’)

Trump has railed against social media and tech companies in recent days, particularly Google. He has accused the company of censoring conservative news but has brushed off regulation, saying he just wants fairness.

“I think that Google and Facebook and Twitter, I think they treat conservatives and Republicans very unfairly. I could tell you that I have personal experience,” he recently said publicly.

Google has denied any alleged bias in its search results saying its “search” function is not used to set a political agenda, and we don’t bias our results toward any political ideology,” adding, “We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.” (RELATED: The Kingmaker: Trump Reveals How He Picks Who To Endorse)",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2018/09/05/trump-social-media-interference-election/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiosL7c_rP9AhVYLFkFHSkqCx44UBAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw2HtWCs0KoFPWroPYsbxE9Z,2018-09-05
Report: Rosenstein Discussed Wearing A Wire In Meetings With Trump,"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record President Donald Trump and volunteered to recruit cabinet officials to potentially remove the Republican from office, according to a bombshell report from The New York Times.

Rosenstein made the remarks in meetings with Department of Justice and FBI officials shortly after the May 9, 2017 firing of James Comey as FBI director, The Times reported Friday. Rosenstein took part in Comey’s ouster, writing a letter recommending that he be fired because of his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

According to The Times:

Mr. Rosenstein made the remarks about secretly recording Mr. Trump and about the 25th Amendment in meetings and conversations with other Justice Department and F.B.I. officials. Several people described the episodes, insisting on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The people were briefed either on the events themselves or on memos written by F.B.I. officials, including Andrew G. McCabe, then the acting bureau director, that documented Mr. Rosenstein’s actions and comments.

Rosenstein, who is overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, also reportedly told McCabe that he could potentially persuade Attorney General Jeff Sessions and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. (RELATED: Trump Must Fire Rod Rosenstein Immediately)

Rosenstein disputed The Times’ reporting, calling it “inaccurate and factually incorrect.”

“I will not further comment on a story based on anonymous sources who are obviously biased against the department and are advancing their own personal agenda,” he said. “But let me be clear about this: Based on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.”

The 25th Amendment allows the vice president and a majority of cabinet officials to remove a president from office if they are determined to be “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.”

The Justice Department provided a statement from someone who was present during Rosenstein’s remarks about wearing a wire. The official said that Rosenstein was being sarcastic when he made the comment. But The Times cited other sources who said Rosenstein stated that he was serious about recording Trump and suggested other FBI officials could wear a wire.

Trump Flips The Script On Declassifying FBI Documents,"President Donald Trump reversed course on declassifying documents relating to the 2016 FBI and DOJ investigation of his campaign and instead will refer them to the DOJ inspector general in a Friday tweet.

I met with the DOJ concerning the declassification of various UNREDACTED documents. They agreed to release them but stated that so doing may have a perceived negative impact on the Russia probe. Also, key Allies’ called to ask not to release. Therefore, the Inspector General….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 21, 2018

….has been asked to review these documents on an expedited basis. I believe he will move quickly on this (and hopefully other things which he is looking at). In the end I can always declassify if it proves necessary. Speed is very important to me – and everyone! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 21, 2018

Trump ordered the documents released Monday with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying:

“The President has directed the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice (including the FBI) to provide for the immediate declassification of the following materials: 1. pages 10–12 and 17–34 of the June 2017 application to the FISA court in the matter of Carter W. Page; 2. all FBI reports of interviews with Bruce G. Ohr prepared in connection with the Russia investigation; and 3. all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all Carter Page FISA applications.”

Sanders continued, “In addition, President Donald J. Trump has directed the Department of Justice (including the FBI) to publicly release all text messages relating to the Russia investigation, without redaction, of James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page and Bruce Ohr.”

The move is a blow to conservative lawmakers who have long alleged that the documents will reveal widespread abuse of the FISA system by the highest levels of the FBI during the 2016 campaign.

Trump: No Plans To Fire Rod Rosenstein,"President Donald Trump told reporters he has no plans to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein during a planned conversation with him Monday aboard Air Force One.

“I get along very well with him,” Trump told reporters of Rosenstein while departing for a trip to Florida, adding that he does not plan to fire him.

Rosenstein will join Trump as he travels to Orlando, Florida, to address a conference of the nation’s police chiefs. The deputy attorney general’s position became precarious in late September after alleged comments that he floated the idea of wearing a wire into the Oval Office and attempted to wrangle a cabal of cabinet officials to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.

Trump has put off any meeting with Rosenstein as the confirmation battle for Judge Brett Kavanaugh continued in the U.S. Senate. The president noted that Rosenstein called him after The New York Times story was published to deny the report. (RELATED: House Freedom Caucus To Rosenstein: Testify Or Resign)

Rosenstein and Trump have long had a tense relationship after the deputy attorney general appointed special counsel Robert Mueller to his position. Trump has attacked Rosenstein as a political actor, complicit in what he sees as “a witch hunt,” and for his failure to reign in Mueller’s investigation.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2018/10/08/trump-no-plans-fire-rod-rosenstein/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjlufXY_rP9AhW7KlkFHZ5uAw04HhAWegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw2lY_7gR0UU50m1Z9fnQm-J,2018-10-08
Trump Reacts To Elizabeth Warren DNA Test Results,"President Donald Trump reacted to Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren’s release of her DNA test results, while departing for areas affected by Hurricane Michael.

“Who cares?” Trump declared when asked about Warren’s test results reportedly showing she is somewhere between 1/32 to 1/512 Native American. When asked whether he would continue his pledge to donate 1 million dollars to charity if she could prove her ancestry, Trump replied “I didn’t say that, you better read it again.”

The president added that he hopes Warren runs for president saying, “I think she would be very easy. I hope that she is running. I do not think she would be difficult at all.”

“She will destroy the country. She will make our country into Venezuela,” he continued. “With that being said I don’t want to say bad things about her because I hope she would be one of the people that would get through the process. Going to be a long process for the Democrats.”

Warren shared the results of her DNA test with the Boston Globe, which was conducted by a Stanford researcher.

“The results strongly support the existence of an unadmixed Native American ancestor,” the researcher said in a summary of Warren’s ancestry findings, adding that the ancestor was likely in her genealogy “in the range of 6-10 generations ago.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2018/10/15/trump-reacts-warren-dna-test-results/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjgsdjb_rP9AhX3FVkFHV4KCsM4RhAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw3eZG2CZjvlDCcB6DBteo41,2018-10-15
FBI Acknowledges Using Multiple Informants In Investigation Of Trump Campaign Aide,"The U.S. government revealed Friday that it used multiple informants to obtain information against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

In court filings, government officials also revealed confidential human sources were paid for their work.

The FBI relied heavily on an uncorroborated dossier to obtain warrants to spy on Page.

The U.S. government revealed in court filings Friday that the FBI used multiple confidential informants, including some who were paid for their information, as part of its investigation into former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

“The FBI has protected information that would identify the identities of other confidential sources who provided information or intelligence to the FBI” as well as “information provided by those sources,” wrote David M. Hardy, the head of the FBI’s Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS), in court papers submitted Friday.

Hardy and Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys submitted the filings in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit for the FBI’s four applications for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants against Page. The DOJ released heavily redacted copies of the four FISA warrant applications on June 20, but USA Today reporter Brad Heath has sued for full copies of the documents.

Hardy’s declaration acknowledged that the confidential sources used by the FBI were in addition to Christopher Steele, the former British spy who authored the infamous anti-Trump dossier.

“This includes nonpublic information about and provided by Christopher Steele, as well as information about and provided by other confidential sources, all of whom were provided express assurances of confidentiality,” Hardy wrote, referring to information disclosed in the four FISA applications.

Steele, who is referred to as Source #1, met multiple times with FBI agents during the 2016 campaign. The bureau relied heavily on his dossier in its applications to spy on Page.

Republicans have raised questions about the FBI’s reliance on the dossier given that the salacious 35-page report remains largely unverified. An internal analysis conducted by the FBI expressed only “medium confidence” in the dossier, and Steele himself has said he has only “fifty-fifty” confidence in one of the dossier’s most dramatic allegations about Trump. (RELATED: FBI Had Only ‘Medium Confidence’ In Steele Dossier)

Steele alleges in the unverified dossier that Page was the Trump campaign’s back channel to the Kremlin. Page vehemently denies the allegations and no information has surfaced to date to support the claim.

The FBI’s use of multiple confidential sources is not a surprise, but the disclosure is the first time that the government has acknowledged using sources beyond Steele, who was hired to investigate Trump by the Democrat-connected opposition research firm, Fusion GPS.

DOJ lawyers argued in their filings that disclosing the previously redacted information would expose sources and methods used in its investigation, as well as impede ongoing investigations related to Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

Another FBI informant, Stefan Halper, is known to have met with Page, though the government has yet to officially acknowledge his involvement in the investigation.

As The Daily Caller News Foundation first reported, Halper, a former University of Cambridge professor, met during the campaign with Page and two other Trump campaign aides, George Papadopoulos and Carter Page. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: A Cambridge Professor With CIA, MI6 Ties Met With Trump Adviser During Campaign, Beyond)

Page and Halper remained in contact through September 2017, the same month the fourth FISA warrant expired against Page.

The DOJ filings indicate that other informants were used beyond Steele and Halper, but the documents do not shed light on how many were used.

Hardy also revealed the FBI paid CHSs that provided information for the investigation.

“The FBI protected specific information about payments to CHSs on two pages of each FISA application,” the declaration reads.

Government lawyers said the payment information is being withheld because disclosing specific payment amounts and dates could “suggest the relative volume of information provided by a particular CHS.” That disclosure could potentially tip the source’s targets off and allow them to “take countermeasures, destroy or fabricate evidence, or otherwise act in a way to thwart the FBI’s activities.”

Steele was reportedly not paid by the FBI as part of his investigation of Trump.

According to news reports, the FBI offered to pay Steele $50,000 to continue his investigation into Trump, but that deal fell apart after Steele had unauthorized contacts with the press. The FBI cut ties with Steele on Nov. 1, 2016. DOJ official Bruce Ohr served as the FBI’s unofficial back channel to Steele through May 2017.

Trump: Does Facebook Fake News Filter Mean CNN Will Go Out Of Business?,"President Donald Trump took a jab at frequent rival CNN in a Sunday evening tweet questioning whether Facebook news quality filters will put the organization out of business.

Facebook has just stated that they are setting up a system to “purge” themselves of Fake News. Does that mean CNN will finally be put out of business? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2018

Trump’s tweet appears to have been sparked by a Fox News segment which aired Sunday morning highlighting the Facebook’s efforts to quell false political news heading into the 2018 midterm elections.

Facebook revealed to The New York Times that it has a team of nearly 20 people whose tasks will include monitoring and deleting potentially false political information posted to appear as news.

Facebook has received significant criticism for its handling of the 2016 presidential election in which Russian intelligence agents utilized its platform to post hyper-partisan content beneficial to both parties aimed at widening political divides in the U.S.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2018/10/21/trump-trolls-cnn/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjgqqfY_rP9AhV-QzABHRuTDJg4FBAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw0h6Kj8bGAWawxrX8LdZMhT,2018-10-21
Trump To Cut Aid Off To Central America For Failure To Stop Caravan,"President Donald Trump announced in a Monday tweet that he will spearhead efforts to cut off or reduce foreign aid to Central American countries for failure to stop a caravan of their citizens bound for the U.S.

Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S. We will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2018

Trump’s threat should come as no surprise to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, as he warned repeatedly on Twitter of this impending consequence in previous weeks. The three countries combined draw nearly 600 million dollars in U.S. foreign aid, according to USAID.

The United States has strongly informed the President of Honduras that if the large Caravan of people heading to the U.S. is not stopped and brought back to Honduras, no more money or aid will be given to Honduras, effective immediately! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2018

The caravan has swelled to nearly 5,000 people as it entered Mexico via Guatemala. The majority of the caravan consists of Central Americans who wish to gain entry to the U.S. by claiming asylum upon arrival and have not crossed into Mexico.

Trump is now castigating the Mexican government for its own apparent failure or unwillingness to stop the U.S.-bound caravan. The president has declared a “national emergency” and said he will alert the U.S. Border Patrol and military. He has threatened previously to seal the entire U.S.-Mexico border if the caravan continues unmolested.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2018/10/22/trump-cut-aid-central-america-caravan/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiPwtPX_rP9AhVmRTABHTJ0BFc4ChAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw3XDco8RHKso-yIj_32HYhh,2018-10-22
"Unfake The News: No, WAPO! Synagogue Shooting Was NOT Trump’s Fault","In the wake of last Saturday’s mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, some in the mainstream press are blaming not just the alleged shooter, but also — you guessed it — President Donald Trump.

In a front page story in The Washington Post, one of the nation’s leading newspapers gave a platform for “critics” who made the claim that the president’s criticisms of George Soros might be contributing to antisemitism—because the billionaire donor just so happens to be Jewish.

‘Jobs Not Mobs’ — Latest Trump Campaign Ad Lays Out 2 Striking Visions For America,"President Trump posted the GOP’s latest campaign ad on Wednesday, just six days ahead of Tuesday’s midterm elections.

Using a series of striking visuals, the 1:25-minute ad juxtaposes a vision for America that consists of a strong economy and low unemployment rate with angry mobs and attacks on conservatives.

WATCH:

“JOBSNOTMOBS! VOTE REPUBLICAN NOW!!” Trump tweeted along with the clip.

“We have two choices on November 6,” reads the screen as the video begins with a vision for “The GOP’s America.” News clips from MSNBC and other networks show aspects of the economic boom of late, including low unemployment and growth in jobs and GDP.

Then, after a quick video of Trump pumping his fist, the video switches to “the Left’s America,” which includes shots of Antifa, Maxine Waters, Eric Holder, and others.

“That’s when civility can start again,” says Hillary Clinton as the video ends with the words “Jobs not mobs.” (RELATED: Trump Campaign’s New Ad: We Can’t Go Back)

Group Of Migrants Not Yet At US Border Sue Trump For Allegedly Violating Their Constitutional Rights,"The U.S. border isn’t in sight, but 12 caravan migrants filed a lawsuit Thursday against President Donald Trump for supposed violation of their constitutional rights.

As Fox News reports, the lawsuit also names the Department of Homeland Security and cites Trump’s vow to send the illegals back where they came from with the backing of military force as a violation of the Fifth Amendment that states, “no person … shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” (RELATED:Report: There Are Four Migrant Caravans Headed For The US Border)

The 12 from Honduras allege in their lawsuit, filed in Washington’s U.S. District Court, that some aren’t aware of the “well-documented human rights crisis” that is affecting Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. The plaintiffs also say they have been denied access to the Administrative Procedure Act and the Declaratory Judgement Act.

The plaintiffs are particularly concerned about how Trump has affected public opinion by employing tactics of “fear and hysteria,” specifically suggesting there are MS-13 gang members and other criminal elements traveling with the caravan, Fox reports.

A Reuters report detailed how some of the migrants are armed with guns and Molotov cocktails that could presumably be used against U.S. border patrol or army personnel. Another migrant confessed to a reporter that he had been convicted of attempted murder, but hopes he can obtain a pardon in the U.S.

At least one migrant died in clashes with the Mexican border patrol and the Associated Press has noted the abduction of a child. (RELATED: US Border Patrol Warns Texans About Militias Stopping Migrant Caravan)

Vice President Mike Pence has said that the President of Honduras told him Venezuela was funding the caravan phenomenon. Pence has also expressed his conviction that Middle Easterners are also part of the migrant force, an allegation Trump has echoed.

On Wednesday, Trump announced that his administration is ready to send 15,000 troops to the Texas border to reinforce border patrol and National Guard troops already there. Initial reports said 5,000 members of the military were going to be tasked with providing such assistance.

"Trump Opens Door To Declassifying Russia Docs, And His Acting Attorney General Could Be On Board","President Trump is “very seriously” considering whether to declassify a slew of FBI and Justice Department records related to the Russia investigation, he said Wednesday. That controversial proposal, which Trump has toyed with for months, may have a backer in Matthew Whitaker, the acting attorney general.

“Declassification, we’re looking at very seriously,” Trump told reporters in a press conference on Wednesday, just before Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced to resign.

Whitaker, who served as Sessions’ chief of staff, will take over as acting attorney general. In that role, he will oversee the special counsel’s investigation into Trump associates’ links to Russia. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had directed the investigation because Sessions recused himself due to contacts he had with Russians while working on the Trump campaign.

According to Fox News’s Catherine Herridge, Whitaker has worked quietly behind the scenes in support of the push to declassify the Russia documents.

Catherine Herridge reports on acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker @ShepNewsTeam https://t.co/SfA26v0ock pic.twitter.com/H9kTj0p2hs — Fox News (@FoxNews) November 7, 2018

Trump announced on Sept. 17 that he was ordering the Justice Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence to begin the process of declassifying 21 pages from an FBI application for a surveillance warrant against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. (RELATED: Trump Orders Declassification Of Russia Probe Documents)

Trump also called for the declassification of FBI notes from interviews used to obtain the surveillance warrant. He also urged the release of FBI interviews with Bruce Ohr, the Justice Department official who serve as a back channel to Christopher Steele, the author of the Democrat-funded dossier. The FBI relied heavily on the unverified dossier to obtain the spy warrants on Page.

Trump faced heavy backlash from his declassification push. Democrats accused him of meddling with the special counsel’s investigation and of putting confidential FBI sources at risk.

Trump retracted the declassification on Sept. 21, claiming that two foreign allies asked him not to release the documents. Trump allies in Congress suggested that Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray pressured Trump not to release the documents. Some White House attorneys also counseled against releasing the records.

But Trump suggested Wednesday that with the midterms behind him, he is against considering declassification.

“It’s amazing how people on the other side just don’t want those documents declassified,” Trump said in his press conference.

“We’re looking at it carefully. I certainly wanted to wait until after the midterms.”

Full Transcript Of Trump’s Oval Office Interview With The Daily Caller,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump sat for an exclusive Oval Office interview Wednesday with The Daily Caller’s Saagar Enjeti and Benny Johnson for approximately 31 minutes.

WATCH:

The transcript is as follows:

THE DAILY CALLER: Let’s get the news of the day out at the top. There’s all of these things that are being discussed about the chief of staff [John Kelly], about Kirstjen Nielsen. Why are you disappointed in the DHS secretary and is John Kelly going to be staying in his job right now?

POTUS: So, you know, always in an administration after the midterms you make changes, so, I’m looking at things and I’ve got a lot of options. A lot of people want to come in. A lot of politicians that have had very successful careers that are very good want to come in. So I’m looking at things — haven’t made a decision yet. I will be making a decision on Homeland shortly.

But I have not made decisions yet. But I will be making changes on various things. Overall, I have a very good cabinet. I think our cabinet’s great.

You know, you’re talking about a few names, you’re not talking about many.

Uh, we’ve been doing incredibly on trade deals and trade with my whole staff of traders, because that’s what they are. What we’ve done on trade deals is incredible — with Mexico, with Canada, with South Korea — taking deals that were horrible and making great deals. And now we’re in the midst of China and others.

But we have a great cabinet, we have — we’ll see, uh, there will be some changes made before the end of the year.

THE DAILY CALLER: Sure. Could you tell us where your thinking is currently on the attorney general position? I know you’re happy with Matthew Whitaker, do you have any names? Chris Christie —

POTUS: Matthew Whitaker is a very respected man. He’s — and he’s, very importantly, he’s respected within DOJ. I heard he got a very good decision, I haven’t seen it. Kellyanne, did I hear that?

WHITE HOUSE ADVISER KELLYANNE CONWAY: 20 pages.

POTUS: A 20-page?

THE DAILY CALLER: It just came out right before this, sir.

POTUS: Well, I heard it was a very strong opinion. Uh, which is good. But [Whitaker] is just somebody that’s very respected.

I knew him only as he pertained, you know, as he was with Jeff Sessions. And, you know, look, as far as I’m concerned this is an investigation that should have never been brought. It should have never been had.

It’s something that should have never been brought. It’s an illegal investigation. And you know, it’s very interesting because when you talk about not Senate confirmed, well, Mueller’s not Senate confirmed.

THE DAILY CALLER: Right.

POTUS: He’s heading this whole big thing, he’s not Senate confirmed.

So anyway, I have a lot of respect for Matt Whitaker, based primarily on reputation. And I think he’s really — I think a lot of people are starting to come out very much in favor of him during this period of time.

THE DAILY CALLER: What about who will eventually replace him, sir?

POTUS: Well, I’m looking at a lot of people. I have been called by so many people wanting that job. We have some great people. In the meantime, I think Matt’s going to do a fantastic job.

THE DAILY CALLER: Banning Jim Acosta. Taking his White House credentials. His hard pass. Is this going to be something that happens with repeated nature inside of the White House? Who you feel are disrespecting the White House, sir.

POTUS: Your world has changed quite a bit and you have grandstanders much more than you did before. He’s just a grandstander. He’s just an average guy who’s a grandstander. And he’s got the guts to stand up and, you know, and shout.

It’s primarily led by CNN because they pay him to do that. CNN is low on the ratings now, relative to Fox and others, and they’re doing very poorly actually. But because of me — the age of Trump — because of me, they’re doing better than they’ve done but they’re doing very poorly in compared to others. Very very poorly. And, um, and getting worse.

They’ve lost a tremendous amount of credibility and, you know, Jim Acosta’s just somebody that gets up and grandstands. He doesn’t even know what he’s asking half of the time. So, we’ll see how the court case goes. It’s today.

THE DAILY CALLER: Are you confident that you’re going to win the court case?

POTUS: I don’t know, I think that we should. Certainly, you shouldn’t be able to go up into a White House and, on principle, it’s very disrespectful to the rest of the press. You were actually getting up to do a question.

THE DAILY CALLER: That’s right, sir.

POTUS: — And this guy’s screaming. And I kept saying to you, ‘come on,’ you didn’t give me much help. I kept saying, ‘give me the question already.’ But, you know, he just screamed and, you know, you knew it because you’re standing, you didn’t know what to do, and I understand that.

He was very rude to the young lady. I won’t, I won’t even — who knows. Who knows. Certainly, he didn’t act very respectful to the press. He’s actually more disrespectful, I think, to the rest of the media. Because he gets up and grandstands and he wants to ask three or four questions and everyone else is, you know, you’re trying to get one question in and the room was packed with a couple of hundred people that want to ask questions.

So, I think he’s very disrespectful to the media, I think he’s very disrespectful to the office, and I think he’s bad for the public. You know, when I say that the fake news is the enemy of the people, it really is. A lot of the animosity that we have in our country is because of fake news. They’re so angry at the news. They get it. You guys are at my rallies all the time, you see the anger when I mention the words ‘fake news’ and they turn around. And they use CNN because they — it just sort of works for them I guess.

But it’s ABC, it’s — NBC is maybe worse than anybody. I mean, NBC’s a total fraud as far as I’m concerned. Their news is disgusting. But I think NBC is as bad as anybody. You look at — and CBS — you look at what’s going on with the fake news and the people get it.

Now they get it — you know they had a very high approval rating before I became president and I think it’s actually a great achievement of mine. Their approval rating now is down as low as just about anybody. And much lower than your president. I actually have good approval ratings, which nobody ever writes. I was at 51, I guess, with Rasmussen the other day.

So I will say that I really think that when you have guys like Acosta, I think they’re bad for the country. Because they show how fake it all is. And it’s a grandstander, and we’ll see how the court rules. You know, then they talk, ‘Oh, freedom of the press.’ But can you really have — is it freedom of the press? It’s actually the opposite. Is it freedom of the press when somebody comes in and starts screaming questions and won’t sit down after having answered a couple of them? And then won’t sit down and then I can’t ask you guys because he’s standing — I don’t think that’s freedom of the press, I actually think that’s the opposite.

THE DAILY CALLER: Which is an important follow-up question, why this administration? This doesn’t seem to be the norm. It certainly wasn’t the norm in previous administrations, that reporters behave in this capacity.

POTUS: Well, I think they behaved badly. I remember Sam Donaldson was terrible at two presidents, and, you know, we tend to forget. I think that now it’s become, with cable television, playing such a role, although, you know, cable television was supposed to be a dying medium. And because of me it’s now hotter than it’s ever been. But someday I won’t be here and it will die like you’ve never seen. And so will The New York Times — will die — and every one of them will just be dead.

I mean, look, I remember picking up before I announced for president, I picked up The New York Times and I said to somebody, ‘Boy, this paper is dead, look at it.’ The paper was dead. It was like a leaflet that you hand out at the supermarket, and now it’s a vibrant paper.

But you look at the stories, many of the stories on the front page are about me. You know, all my life I told this story, had stories on the front page. A few, not a big deal. Which wasn’t bad, you know, maybe seven, but, you know, a few. And, you know, now if I have a few each day it’s surprisingly low.

But it has made a big difference.

THE DAILY CALLER: Sir, I do want to turn to policy.

POTUS: That’s why I always joke when I say they’ll all be endorsing me. Cause I don’t know what happens to their business after I’m gone.

THE DAILY CALLER: Sir, right now, in 2010 we saw several pieces of major legislation passed in a lame-duck Congress. What can we expect your and the Republican agenda to be in this Congress? Is it going to be an immigration fix? What about criminal justice reform? What are the two to three things you’re looking at?

POTUS: We’re working on many things. Criminal justice reform we’re working on very hard. We have a meeting today, do you know about that? We have a meeting today.

THE DAILY CALLER: We heard about that.

POTUS: Get these two in, alright? I think we have a chance at that. We should be able to fix health care. We should be able —

THE DAILY CALLER: Just one second, sir, on that criminal justice bill. Is that the Jared Kushner-backed bill that you want to focus on?

POTUS: The answer is I’m looking at it very closely, okay? I am. It’s a good thing. You know, Texas is backing it, if you look at Mississippi and Georgia and a lot of other places, they believe in it, those governors, and they’re conservative people. Rick Perry’s a big fan.

You know, a lot of people are backing it. Look at the people that are backing it. Even, you know, like Mike Lee, he votes against a lot of things and we respect Mike and Mike is backing it. We have a lot of people that are backing this.

THE DAILY CALLER: What about immigration, sir? Are you willing to shut down the government if you don’t get a certain set of policies?

POTUS: I may be. I may be. I’ll have to see how it plays out. But I may very well be willing to shut down the government.

I think it’s horrible what’s happening and, you know, building the wall, it’s in smaller stages, we can build it very quickly. I’m building the wall in smaller stages and we moved the military there, we put up barbed wire, we did all sorts of things. You have to have a barrier. You have to have a barrier.

Look, we have a chance of, they can do presidential harassment, put very simply, and I’ll be very good at handling that and I think I’ll be better than anybody in the history of this office. And in a certain way I look forward to it because I actually think it’s good for me politically, because everyone knows it’s pure harassment. Just like the witch hunt, the Mueller witch hunt. It’s pure harassment. It’s horrible. It’s horrible that they’re allowed to get away with it.

Again, not Senate confirmed but, you know. You have 17 people — half, many of them worked for Hillary Clinton, some on the Foundation. The Hillary Clinton Foundation. I mean, you think of it.

So, I think we’ll do very well if they want to play the presidential harassment game. If they play the presidential harassment game I don’t think anything’s going to be done ’cause why would I do that, okay? If they want to get things done I think it will be fantastic, I think we can get a lot done.

I think we can almost get more done because they’re gonna want to prove something, too. So if they wanna do health care, we can do health care. There a very good fixes to health care that could solve a lot of problems. We’ve really, you know, terminated a lot of the Obamacare, as it was referred to. But we could do a new health care bill that would be fantastic that could take everybody’s — that could incorporate good pieces of everybody’s good ideas.

So there’s a chance at that, there’s a great chance at comprehensive immigration reform. If they wanna do it, they wanna do it, they wanna do it right. And there’s a good chance at doing things that maybe you couldn’t do.

Don’t forget, I didn’t really have a majority. I had one senator. And I had a few Republicans in the House. You know, a very small number. Um, and now the pressure’s on them because they’ve gotta come to me with things.

Hey, the beauty is, and I’ve said this, you heard me at the news conference, I don’t know if you agree with me — let’s say I won with two Republicans or three. I’d have to make deals with Republicans. I’d have guys coming to me, you know, out of that group there’ll be people. Let’s not say they’re good or bad but they’re people: ‘well I don’t want to do this.’ Well, I’m gonna have three or more. I mean, literally, unless I had like a 25 majority, you know, something substantial, they would come to me and they would say, ‘well, I don’t like it.’ You wouldn’t even be able to get something through there. It would be too close.

Where I am now, when they have a small majority, I can sit back and say, ‘hey.’ And the beauty is when it gets passed, when we pass things, we’ll get it passed in the Senate, which now we can’t because we need 10 Democrat votes. Because we’ll have Democrats and I’ll be able to get enough Republicans to pass.

But the beauty is, the beauty is that we actually have something that can work much better than it worked before, because before it was politically very difficult for a lot of people.

THE DAILY CALLER: While we’re on the subject of Congress, I do want to get — does Kevin McCarthy have your full endorsement in the speaker’s race?

POTUS: Well, I didn’t endorse because I stay out of it, but I like Kevin a lot and I like Jim [Jordan] a lot. I like both of ’em.

THE DAILY CALLER: How would you like them to work it out?

POTUS: Who else is running, nobody, right?

THE DAILY CALLER: That’s all there is right now.

POTUS: Well, I like both of ’em a lot. I think Jim is a fantastic guy and I think Kevin’s a fantastic guy. They’re very different but Kevin is a very political person, which is good. He’s a very honorable guy, and I think he’s gonna do great, and it looks like, you know, he’ll probably get it.

THE DAILY CALLER: Would you like to see Jim on the ranking member on Judiciary?

POTUS: I would like to see Jim in a high position ’cause he deserves it. He’s fantastic, but I haven’t gotten into the endorsement or not. I just like both of ’em too much, too much to get very much involved. It’s something I shouldn’t be involved in. But Jim is a fantastic guy and Kevin is a fantastic guy and they’re very different and they complement each other.

THE DAILY CALLER: Broward County election commissioner Brenda Snipes is in violation of Florida law. She’s in violation of Florida reporting laws, she’s in violation of a judge’s order. She’s also reportedly mixed in illegal ballots with legal ballots and asked for them to be counted. Is she behaving criminally and should she be removed?

POTUS: Look, you know, the bottom line — it’s, she’s a disaster. You look at her past, she’s a disaster. Even with me. I won Florida and, you remember? That area, Broward, didn’t come in. It didn’t come in. I think Palm Beach was like — they wouldn’t call Florida, I won. Then it got to a point where I won by enough that all the votes of the people that lived there would, you know, in other words — you can only put in so many votes, although she may change that system.

You can only put in a number of people that are registered voters or live there. Now they’re, I guess they were trying to take illegal voters but these are — I’ve been saying, this is a problem all over the country, by the way. This is what I’ve been saying.

This is a problem in California that’s so bad of illegals voting. This is a California problem and if you notice, almost every race — I was watching today — out of like 11 races that are in question they’re gonna win all of them.

The Republicans don’t win and that’s because of potentially illegal votes, which is what I’ve been saying for a long time. I have no doubt about it. And I’ve seen it, I’ve had friends talk about it when people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It’s really a disgrace what’s going on.

The disgrace is that, voter ID. If you buy, you know, a box of cereal, if you do anything, you have a voter ID.

Well, over here, the only thing you don’t is if you’re a voter of the United States. A voter in the United States of America. I think it’s a disgrace what’s going on. Really a disgrace. And they try to shame everybody by calling them racist or calling them something, anything they can think of, when you say you want voter ID. But voter ID is a very important thing.

If you look at what happened in New Hampshire, where thousands of people came up and voted from a very liberal part of Massachusetts and they came up in buses and they voted. I said, ‘what’s going on over here,’ my people said, ‘you won New Hampshire easily except they have tremendous numbers of buses coming up.’ They’re pouring up by the hundreds, buses of people getting out, voting. Then they’re supposed to go back within 90 days. And of the people that are supposed to go back, almost none of them do. In other words, they go back after the vote is over. They go back — and I think it’s like three percent — I mean, almost nobody goes back to show that, you know, that they were allowed to vote. And so what do you do? Recall the election. Recall the election. I mean, there, you should be able to recall the election.

THE DAILY CALLER: You think they should call Florida right now, sir?

POTUS: Uh, I think they should’ve called Florida election evening. Well, many votes were added to that, and, you know what’s going on. And now they have mixed them up. You said it better than I did. They mixed the votes up and now you can’t find the ones that were put in, they just put ’em into a batch.

When they call this woman incompetent, they’re wrong. She’s very competent but in a bad way.

THE DAILY CALLER: Should she be removed from office?

POTUS: Oh, she should have been removed — I think she should have been removed in the middle of this mix-up.

THE DAILY CALLER: How do you prevent this in 2020? From happening when you run for re-election?

POTUS: First thing you do is fire her and her cronies. You get ’em out of — you get ’em out. And it should have been done, I mean, if there’s anything really that I would be — because, again, in the 2016 election, you guys remember, remember how long it took to get Florida?

THE DAILY CALLER: It took a long time.

POTUS: Had I not been winning Florida by more than they could — I mean, you can’t produce — if you have a million people, you can’t give 1,200,000 votes, okay? So actually, what happened is they went with fairly accurate numbers because whether I won by 10 votes or by half a million votes it didn’t matter.

But I had, fortunately, enough votes, and they were sitting there waiting. They said, ‘Broward County is not reporting.’ This went on for hours.

WHITE HOUSE ADVISER KELLYANNE CONWAY: The Panhandle came in an hour later.

POTUS: Well, the Panhandle was so devastating to Crooked Hillary, that, frankly, it didn’t make any difference, okay? Because the Panhandle was so — it was like 98 percent. That thing came in, then all of a sudden Broward came in. And I won by, you know, I won by a lot of votes. I call it four Yankee Stadiums.

THE DAILY CALLER: Sir, as a resident of both D.C. and New York City, what do you think about Amazon’s relocation and the decision of both Virginia and New York to give billions of subsidies to Amazon. Do you support that?

POTUS: I think they’re paying a very big price. I think that it was a competition. I know all about those competitions, I’ve been in those competitions, you know, and it’s a lot of people, a lot of cities who are competing for it. They took the best deals.

THE DAILY CALLER: So you support the cities giving them tax breaks?

POTUS: Well, I think they’re giving up a lot. They’re very expensive deals. Only time will tell. Maybe Amazon will have massive competition and they won’t be the same company in five years, in which case it will be a big mistake.

You know, Amazon could have — I see Walmart is doing very well and others are building sites. I think that’s going to be a very competitive business someday, Amazon. And I’m not sure that size necessarily helps when you get —

THE DAILY CALLER: Do you still think they’re cheating the U.S. postal system?

POTUS: Oh, I think they’re getting the bargain of the century. I think that Amazon’s getting — and that’s why I’ve asked for a review of that. And others too, you know, not just Amazon. There are classes of companies that are getting the bargain and I think that — I may be wrong about this, you’ll check — but I think the contract they signed with Amazon was a closed contract. You can’t even see it. It was a sealed contract.

No, I think Amazon has the bargain of the century with the U.S. Post Office, which is losing a fortune.

THE DAILY CALLER: Tucker Carlson had his house attacked, he had a mob outside of his house while his wife was home. They cracked the door — what is this violence? Where does it come from? Do you have a message for Tucker and his family?

POTUS: I do, I spoke to Tucker and I think Tucker’s a great guy and I think it’s terrible, they were actually trying to break down the door.

THE DAILY CALLER: How do you think the police should handle Antifa, generally?

POTUS: These people, like the Antifa you’re talking about, the Antifa — they better hope that the opposition to Antifa decides not to mobilize. Because if they do, they’re much tougher. Much stronger. Potentially much more violent. And Antifa’s going to be in big trouble. But so far they haven’t done that, and that’s a good thing.

But they better hope that the other side doesn’t mobilize, you understand what I’m saying. Because if you look, the other side is the military, it’s the police, it’s a lot of very strong, a lot of very tough people. Tougher than them. And smarter than them. And they’re sitting back and watching and they’re getting angrier and angrier.

THE DAILY CALLER: What’s your takeaway from the 2018 election and what do you think that means for 2020 for you?

POTUS: I think I did very well. Because if you look at — Obama was 60-something odd House seats and lost seven Senate seats. So we picked up three or four Senate seats depending on how it all goes — it’s a big pickup. In fact, they say in 80 years I think the presidential party’s only picked up two Senate seats, I picked up three. I mean, assuming that they don’t do any further shenanigans in Florida.

Almost picked up Tester. Almost picked up, you know, if you look — and that was somebody that wasn’t even in play. And that was another one at the very last moment, all of a sudden, that was over. Almost picked up Arizona and that was another one that I question, I have to question that more strongly than our candidate, a wonderful person. But she didn’t question strongly, so I’m not going to, but I think that was very odd the way that all happened in Arizona. But we picked up — I mean, it looked like we picked up five. But probably three. It’s a lot.

I think this — if I didn’t go around, and you were there, you saw the crowd — in the history of politics, and I say this proudly, I wasn’t even running. In the history of politics nobody’s ever gotten crowds like that or close because you were in those stadiums and those arenas, but outside you had many more times — you know, in Houston we had 109,000 people sign up for 22,000 seats. We actually took ads saying, ‘please don’t come’ and that helped Ted Cruz a lot.

So if you look at Ted Cruz, and you look at some of the people that won, they wouldn’t have won without my helping them. And then you look at the new senators, you look at Indiana, Donnelly was not going to happen. Nobody said Donnelly was going to lose. Nobody said — even look at a case of a congressman. I couldn’t help too many congressmen because I don’t have that much time. The only congressman I went for was Andy Barr and that was in Kentucky, Mitch was there but he wasn’t running, and Rand Paul was there. Good guy, Rand Paul, by the way. And he was there, and the only congressman — I specifically went, there was no senator running in Kentucky, it was Andy Barr, and he won nicely. And he was down 10 and he won his race.

Every place I went, look at Georgia, I’m assuming he wins. That’s another one now they’re trying to play around with the votes. Honestly, it’s a disgrace what’s going on. Oprah went, Obama went, and Michelle Obama went. They went, and they spent a lot of time, and I went and did a rally, and the real number was probably 55,000 people, cause, you know, were you there in Georgia?

THE DAILY CALLER: Not Georgia, sir.

POTUS: Because we had a hangar, another hangar holding 18,000 at the top of the hangar. These are massive, like 747 hangars. It went way back, and he won. And everybody said he wasn’t going to win. But they had Obama, Mrs. Obama and Oprah. Oprah spent three days there and every place I went, we won or came real close with areas, like, as an example, Tester.

Tester, nobody wanted even to contest it. Well, look at what happened in North Dakota with Heidi. Heidi, they said don’t contest. One year ago when we were looking, they all said don’t contest Heidi, she can’t be beat. She lost by a lot. I went there three or four times.

I mean, the truth is, every place I went, we either won or did well or did really well. If I didn’t go, if I didn’t do those stops — I did 31 stops in 30 days or something like that. If I didn’t do those stops, I think we would’ve lost 10 Senate seats, seven to 10 Senate seats, and we would’ve lost 60 to 70 House seats or more.

By doing the stops, then again a lot of times I’d have the congressmen in the room, so they wouldn’t be the prime focus but I’d get up and I’d be able to talk about them for a couple of minutes apiece, right? If I didn’t do the stops — and I’ve been thanked by a lot of Republicans — if I didn’t do those stops we would definitely not have control of the Senate. It would be a question, so what are we up, three? Two or three. We would be down five or six or seven. And they know that. Nobody has ever had a greater impact.

Well, I’ll give you another. You take Georgia. He was 10 points down when I endorsed him, he ended up winning by 40 points in the primary. He’s now in, but he was 10 points down. It was 70 to 30, something like that, 70-30 or 70-40, maybe 70-40. But it was an easy win.

Take DeSantis. Ron DeSantis was a three, had no money. He was running against in the Republican primary, who was at 31 and he had $21 million cash in the bank. The Department of Agriculture, right? Nice guy, too. But I didn’t know him so I don’t feel guilty. I endorsed DeSantis. I endorsed DeSantis and he won by 20 points. Okay, it wasn’t even a race. And his opponent, who I spoke to afterward because he is a nice guy, he said, ‘I’ve never seen anything like it.’ He said, ‘you endorsed him, the race was over.’

There’s never been an impact — I don’t say it braggingly. I mean, it’s hard for me to say it because I’d rather have them say it but they don’t say it very well. No, there’s never been a story, nobody ever writes it.

But you take a look at the races that I was involved in, I had a massive impact. Then they said, ‘well, DeSantis is not gonna make it in Florida, he’s never gonna get elected.’ So I went down and made a speech, he got elected, he won. Now they’re trying to take votes away from him, it’s a disgrace what’s going on, but it looks like he’s gonna be good and hopefully, Rick [Scott] is gonna be good. Maybe the machines are bad, now the machines are all smokey, they’re all — it’s crazy. Honestly, it’s a disgrace.

Georgia, what they’re doing is a disgrace, and Florida, what they’re doing to the two people — no, to the three. Look at what they’re doing, how about the agriculture guy. He was leading all night long and then he ends up losing by 5,000 votes because nobody was watching that one. That’s a very important position in Florida, right? Pretty impressive if I do say so myself.

EXCLUSIVE: President Trump Calls For Brenda Snipes To Be Fired,"President Donald Trump believes that embattled Broward County Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes is a “disgrace” and should be fired.

The president spoke to The Daily Caller in an exclusive, wide-ranging interview Wednesday at the White House. The president did not mince words when asked about Snipes and the Florida recount.

Snipes has come under fire by media and elected Republicans for multiple irregularities in her vote reporting. After the Florida Senate race was called for Republican Gov. Rick Scott on election night, election supervisors in Broward and Palm Beach counties were still adding votes to their tally, in violation of Florida reporting law. In the subsequent days, Snipes defied a judge’s order to submit “over-voted” and “under-voted” absentee ballots for public review and admitted to “accidentally” mixing illegal ballots in with good ones. The illegal ballots “cannot be identified” now, according to Snipes.

TheDC asked the president specifically if he considers this behavior illegal and what Snipes’ future in her role as an election official should be.

“She’s a disaster,” Trump said.

He pointed to Snipes’ past alleged election illegality, which included destroying ballots and opening ballots illegally.

“You look at her past, she’s a disaster,” Trump said, “Even with me. I won Florida and — you remember? That area, Broward, didn’t come in,” Trump said of Broward County and Snipes. “You can only put in so many votes, although she may change that system.”

“When they call this woman incompetent, they’re wrong,” Trump said of Snipes. “She’s very competent but in a bad way.”

When asked directly by TheDC if Snipes should be removed from office, Trump said, “Oh, she should have been removed — I think she should have been removed in the middle of this mix-up.”

Scott has considered removing Snipes.

Trump went on to say they should have called Florida during the evening of the election. “Well, many votes were added to that, and you know what’s going on. And now they have mixed them up. They mixed the votes up and now you can’t find the ones that were put in, they just put ’em in to a batch.”

The president also renewed his call for national voter ID laws and decried illegal voting.

“The Republicans don’t win and that’s because of potentially illegal votes,” Trump complained. “When people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It’s really a disgrace what’s going on.”

“If you buy a box of cereal — you have a voter ID,” Trump continued. “They try to shame everybody by calling them racist, or calling them something, anything they can think of, when you say you want voter ID. But voter ID is a very important thing.”

When asked about how to prevent a repeat situation in the 2020 presidential election, Trump bluntly said Snipes needed to go, along with her “cronies.”

“First thing you do is fire her and her cronies. You get ’em out,” Trump said, recalling his own election night in 2016. “Remember how long it took to get Florida? But I had, fortunately, enough votes, and they were sitting there waiting. They said, ‘Broward County is not reporting.’ This went on for hours.”

Trump continued, “The panhandle was so devastating to ‘Crooked Hillary’ — that thing came in, then all of a sudden Broward came in. And I won by, you know, I won by a lot of votes. I call it four Yankee stadiums.”

Election workers in Florida are attempting to meet a 3:00 p.m. deadline on Thursday to finish their statewide recount for the Senate and gubernatorial races.

EXCLUSIVE: Trump Not Sure On Beating CNN Lawsuit — Calls Acosta ‘Bad For The Country’,"President Donald Trump expressed hope but was not certain that his White House would prevail in a lawsuit filed by CNN regarding the revoking of reporter Jim Acosta’s press credentials, as he told The Daily Caller in an exclusive Oval Office interview.

When asked specifically whether he expected his White House to prevail in the lawsuit brought by CNN, he told TheDC, “I don’t know, we should … We’ll see how the court rules. Is it freedom of the press when somebody comes in and starts screaming questions and won’t sit down?”

CNN filed suit against the White House Tuesday morning in DC District Court. It claims the revocation of Acosta’s press pass violates their First and Fifth Amendment rights. CNN’s lawsuit alleges that “Acosta’s ability to perform his duties as CNN’s Chief White House correspondent is effectively eliminated.”

“If left unchallenged, the actions of the White House would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials,” the suit adds.

The White House revoked Acosta’s credentials last week claiming that he laid hands on an intern after refusing to surrender the microphone during a press conference. (RELATED: CNN Sues The White House Over Jim Acosta’s Revoked Press Credentials)

The president continued in an extended riff that believed strongly that Acosta’s refusal to give up the mike and general “grandstanding” was unfair to the rest of the White House press corps. “Jim Acosta is just somebody who gets up and grandstands, he doesn’t even know what he’s asking you half of the time.”

Of Acosta’s alleged kerfuffle with a White House intern, Trump said, “He was very rude to the young lady,” but the president focused his ire on the CNN reporter’s style of journalism.

The president continued, “I really think that when you have guys like Acosta, I think they’re bad for the country … He’s just an average guy who’s a grandstander who’s got the guts to stand up and shout.”

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders dismissed CNN’s lawsuit after it was filed Tuesday saying in a statement:

The White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional. The First Amendment is not served when a single reporter, of more than 150 present, attempts to monopolize the floor. If there is no check on this type of behavior it impedes the ability of the President, the White House staff, and members of the media to conduct business.

"EXCLUSIVE: Trump Gives Amazon Credit, Says ‘They Took The Best Deal’","President Donald Trump acknowledged the advantage of Amazon’s major benefits packages from Crystal City, Virginia, and Long Island City in Queens, New York, for deciding to place two major facilities in both places during an exclusive Oval Office interview with The Daily Caller.

“I think they’re paying a very big price,” Trump said of Arlington and New York City’s decision, but added, “It was a competition. I know all about those competitions. I’ve been in those competitions — a lot of cities were competing for it. They took the best deals, you know?”

Amazon announced Tuesday it would locate two major facilities in Crystal City and New York City, with 25,000 employees assigned to each. Amazon received billions of dollars in subsidies from both cities to build their new facilities.

New York alone will offer nearly $1.5 billion in subsidies to Amazon with Virginia offering approximately $500 million. The subsidies are contingent on Amazon delivering a promised number of jobs to the region. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Trump Calls Acosta ‘Bad For The Country’)

The president continued on both cities decisions, saying, “They’re giving up a lot; they’re expensive deals. Only time will tell. Maybe Amazon will have massive competition and they won’t be the same company in five years in which case it would be a big mistake.”

Trump said of Amazon’s online e-commerce business, “I think it’s going to be a very competitive business someday.”

When asked whether he continues to believe Amazon was taking advantage of the U.S. postal system, Trump replied, “I think they’re getting the bargain of the century, I think that’s why I’ve asked for a review of [Amazon’s impact on the U.S. postal system].”

The president stressed that it wasn’t just Amazon he believed was taking advantage of the postal system, saying, “There are classes of companies that are getting the bargain.”

EXCLUSIVE: Trump Says Decision On Nielsen Happening ‘Shortly’,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump expects to make a decision on the future of his Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen “shortly,” he told The Daily Caller in an exclusive Oval Office interview Wednesday.

Asked specifically about the possible departures of his chief of staff John Kelly and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Trump replied, “Always in an administration after the midterms we make changes.”

“We’re looking at a lot of options,” he continued. “A lot of people want to come in, a lot of politicians who have had very successful careers want to come in.”

“I’m looking at things. I haven’t made a decision yet,” Trump continued. “I will be making a decision on homeland shortly. I have not made decisions yet. I will be making changes on various things.”

“Overall, I think our cabinet is great,” he said. “They’re talking about a few names — they’re talking about many.”

Reports of Kelly and Nielsen’s possible departures widely circulated Tuesday. Sources familiar with the process told TheDC Tuesday they expect Nielsen to depart the administration in the coming weeks and that replacements were already being actively considered.

A source close to Kelly, however, told TheDC that Kelly currently “has no plans to leave” and believes there “are a group of people” undertaking a “concerted effort to oust him.” Kelly is currently attempting to save Nielsen’s job, a protege he believes is being unfairly targeted by the president.

Kelly is particularly frustrated because he believes Nielsen is acting to the best of her lawful ability as DHS secretary to execute the president’s immigration vision. Nielsen’s lawful constraints have hampered her ability to aggressively stem the rapid flow of illegal immigrants across the southern U.S. border, which has drawn the president’s ire.

A spokesman for Nielsen told The Daily Caller Wednesday she intends to continue to implement Trump’s agenda as secretary.

“The Secretary is honored to lead the men and women of DHS and is committed to implementing the President’s security-focused agenda to protect Americans from all threats and will continue to do so,” said DHS press secretary Tyler Houlton.

Trump Says He Will Submit Answers To Mueller Next Week,"President Donald Trump said Saturday that he will present his written responses to questions from special counsel Robert Mueller next week.

“They’re all done,” Trump told reporters, according to a White House pool report.

Trump’s legal team has negotiated for months over what topics Trump will respond to and whether he is willing to take part in a sit-down interview with prosecutors.

“We haven’t even talked about it,” Trump said when asked if he is willing to have a face-to-face interview with Mueller’s team.

Trump appears to have made progress on the questions since Friday, when he said that he and his legal team were still working on responses. The Republican said that he continued to be on the lookout for perjury traps in the questions. (RELATED: Trump Works On Mueller Answers, Avoiding ‘Perjury Traps’)

“I’m sure they are tripped up because they like to catch people with questions … You have to answer carefully with people who have bad intentions,” he said.

Trump’s lawyers have said that they are willing to let Trump respond to questions in writing about possible collusion between the Russian government and campaign. But they have asserted that questions about potential obstruction of justice regarding the firing of James Comey as FBI director are off limits.

Trump has vehemently denied that he or members of his campaign conspired with the Russian government to influence the 2016 election.

Trump has insisted that he had the executive authority to fire Comey for any reason he saw fit. Prosecutors are reportedly investigating whether Trump attempted to derail the Russia probe by firing Comey. His ouster, on May 9, 2017, led Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to appoint Mueller as special counsel.

Mueller’s team has reportedly started writing its final report of the investigation.

Trump Says There’s ‘No Reason’ For Him To Listen To Khashoggi Tape,"President Donald Trump said in a Sunday interview with Fox News’ Chris Wallace that he has been fully briefed on a recording that purports to hold part of the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but he declined to listen himself because it’s a “suffering tape.”

“We have the tape. I don’t want to hear the tape. No reason for me to hear the tape,” Trump said of the audio recording that Turkey claims is strong evidence that contradicts Saudi Arabia’s stated role in Khashoggi’s death.

“Why don’t you want to hear it, sir?” Wallace asked the president.

“Because it’s a suffering tape, it’s a terrible tape,” Trump answered. “I’ve been fully briefed on it, there’s no reason for me to hear it, in fact I said to the people ‘should I?’ They said, ‘you really shouldn’t, there’s no reason.'”

“I know exactly – I know everything that went on in the tape without having to hear it,” he added.

WATCH:

CIA Director Gina Haspel has also heard the tape, in which someone reportedly says “tell your boss,” a reference investigators believe directly links Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to The Washington Post contributor’s death.

After weeks of speculation from global leaders suggesting the order to kill Khashoggi, who’s writings were often critical of the crown prince and the kingdom, came from the top levels of the Saudi government, the CIA concluded Friday that they are confident that bin Salman did order the murder.

“It was very violent, very vicious and terrible,” Trump added about the audio recordings.

Wallace asked Trump if he believes bin Salman lied to him when he told the president he had no involvement in Khashoggi’s death. (RELATED: 5 Of Khashoggi’s Accused Killers Facing The Death Penalty As Saudi Arabia Says Crown Prince Had Nothing To Do With It)

“I don’t – I don’t know, you know, who could really know?” Trump responded. “But I can say this: He’s got many people now that say he had no knowledge.”

“Do you live with [bin Salman’s claims] because you need him?” Wallace asked.

“Well, will anybody really know?” Trump answered.

“You saw we put on very heavy sanctions, massive sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia,” the president continued. “But at the same time, we do have an ally, and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good.”

Trump Submits Russia Responses To Mueller,"President Donald Trump and his attorneys have submitted responses to Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of the investigation into possible collusion between Trump associates and the Russian government.

“The President today answered written questions submitted by The Special Counsel’s Office,” Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said in a statement to reporters. “The questions presented dealt with issues regarding the Russia-related topics of the inquiry. The President responded in writing.”

In providing responses to Mueller, Trump and his legal team seemingly ended a months-long standoff with Mueller and his team over the format, quantity and subject matter of the questions. Trump and his legal team pushed to answer questions only about possible campaign collusion, which Trump insists did not occur.

Trump and his attorneys resisted answering questions about possible obstruction of justice related to the firing of James Comey as FBI director. (RELATED: Mueller Expected To Make Moves After The Midterms — Here’s What He Could Do)

Mueller is reportedly close to wrapping up his investigation, which began on May 17, 2017. Prosecutors have started writing a report of the investigation, which would likely be submitted to the Justice Department. If submitted soon, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker would decide whether to accept any recommendations submitted by Mueller’s team.

Democrats have called for Whitaker to recuse himself from the Mueller probe or be replaced as acting attorney general because of his past comments criticizing the investigation.

Democrats Will Use US Climate Report Against Trump In Court,"Democrats will likely use the latest federal global warming report against Trump administration in court.

“We’ll use every piece of that report that we can,” said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra.

Environmentalists and trial lawyers can also be expected to seize upon the report’s alarmist findings.

President Donald Trump can expect Democrats to use the latest National Climate Assessment (NCA) in lawsuits against his administration’s “energy dominance” agenda.

“We’ll use every piece of that report that we can,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra told The Washington Post in an interview Tuesday, referring to lawsuits against the Trump administration.

Becerra, a Democrat, has filed nearly two dozen lawsuits to stop the Trump administration from rolling back Obama-era energy and environment policies, including suing to stop the building of a U.S.-Mexico border wall on environmental grounds. (RELATED: Why Is The US Climate Report So Alarmist? That’s What Obama Wanted)

California is not alone. The Golden State generally leads coalitions of other Democratic-controlled states to oppose Trump administration policies. Becerra, for example, led a group of 17 states suing to keep the Trump from undoing Obama-era fuel economy standards.

Becerra and others see the NCA, released on Nov. 23, as another tool to use in court. The NCA made dire predictions about future global warming, including rising seas, higher temperatures and slower economic growth — though the most headline-grabbing claims relied on extreme climate projections that experts questioned.

“It is not a matter of resisting,” Becerra told WaPo. “It is a matter of doing what we are doing. and as long as we are doing it according to the law, don’t get in our way.”

It’s not just Democratic attorneys general who will likely use the NCA in court. Environmental groups suing the Trump administration will likely cite the report, and trial lawyers teaming up with cities to sue energy companies may also cite its findings.

“This report will be used in court in significant ways,” Richard Revesz, an environmental law expert at New York University, told The New York Times on Sunday.

Environmental groups have filed dozens of lawsuits against Trump administration policies. The group Earthjustice has alone filed 115 lawsuits against the administration, aiming to stop regulatory rollbacks, energy permitting and demanding government records.

“This report will weaken the Trump administration’s legal case for undoing climate change regulations, and it strengthens the hands of those who go to court to fight them,” longtime climate activist and Princeton University geoscientist Michael Oppenheimer told The Times on the NCA’s release.

On the other hand, the study may also be used by environmental lawyers bringing suit on behalf of 21 youths against the Trump administration over global warming. The three-year-old litigation, now sitting in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, asserts Americans have a right to a “stable climate.”

“I can imagine a lawyer for the Trump administration being asked by a federal judge, ‘How can the federal government acknowledge the seriousness of the problem, and then set aside the rules that protect the American people from the problem?’” Revesz told The Times.

“And they might squirm around coming up with an answer,” Revesz said.

Cities litigating climate claims may also seize on the report’s dire predictions to extract billions of dollars from energy companies because the latest NCA has a regional focus.

A handful of local governments teamed up with trial lawyers to sue energy companies, including major oil companies ExxonMobil and BP, for damages from sea level rise and extreme weather allegedly made worse by global warming.

Judges have so far tossed out claims brought by several localities, including Oakland, California; San Francisco and New York City. Those judges ruled global warming was an issue for Congress, not the courts, to solve.

"Trump: Cohen ‘Lying, A Weak Person’","President Donald Trump accused his former attorney Michael Cohen of lying to special counsel Robert Mueller for a reduced sentence in a blistering statement Thursday morning while departing for the G20 summit in Argentina.

“He’s lying very simply to get a reduced sentence,” Trump declared, explaining his view that “he was convicted with a fairly long-term sentence on things totally unrelated to the trump organization. Having to do with mortgages and having to do with cheating the IRS.”

The president continued, “He was given a fairly long jail sentence, and he’s a weak person, and by being weak — unlike other people that you watch — he’s a weak person, and what he’s trying to to is get a reduced sentence. So he’s lying about a project that everybody knew about.” (RELATED: Michael Cohen Pleads Guilty To Charge In Mueller Probe)

Trump’s reaction comes as Cohen pleads guilty in court to lying to Congress about a Trump Tower Moscow project the Trump Organization was involved in 2015 and 2016.

Rudy Giuliani released a statement Thursday that reads: “BREAKING NEWS ALERT: Michael Cohen is a liar.”

Cohen is revising his testimony to say that the Moscow deal was pursued into the summer of 2016. Trump brushed off this claim noting that even if the deal was pursued to this point it was not illegal to run his business while he was running for president.

Schiff Says Trump May ‘Face The Very Real Prospect Of Jail Time’,"The congressman expected to become the new chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is predicting dark days ahead for President Donald Trump, including potential jail time.

Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California was on “Face the Nation” to discuss revelations this week from federal prosecutors in Manhattan who are investigating alleged Russian collusion by the Trump campaign. (RELATED: Micheal Cohen Pleaded Guilty To Lying To Congress But Not About The Steele Dossier)

WATCH:

Although prosecutors suggested Trump may have violated some campaign finance reform regulations, they didn’t charge the president with any illegal activity. That didn’t matter to Schiff, who has had an acrimonious relationship with the president. Trump recently created a new nickname for the congressman: “little Adam Schitt.” (RELATED: Rep. Adam Schiff Says When He Takes Over, Russia Probe Will Target Money Laundering)

“There’s the very real prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office, the Justice Department may indict him; that he may be the first president in quite some time to face the very real prospect of jail time,” Schiff told “Face the Nation.” He did not specify about the jail time, but cited comments from the report that “the rich and powerful seem to live by different rules” and the prosecutor’s contention that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen should face incarceration.

Schiff repeatedly referred to the report as “pretty breathtaking” but cautioned that he was not yet ready to advocate for Trump’s impeachment, saying, “I think we have to wait until we have the full picture. Is a crime directed and coordinated by the president which helped him to attain office sufficient to remove him from that office?”

The congressman also commented on Trump’s selection for attorney general, William Barr. Although Schiff admitted that “there is no question about [his] qualifications,” he was concerned about alleged “bias and judgement” arising from reported comments that Barr has made about former FBI Director James Comey. Schiff said that Barr considers it “perfectly fine for a president to recommend prosecution of his political rivals.”

"I’m A Senior Trump Official, And I Hope A Long Shutdown Smokes Out The Resistance","The Daily Caller is taking the rare step of publishing this anonymous op-ed at the request of the author, a senior official in the Trump administration whose identity is known to us and whose career would be jeopardized by its disclosure. We believe publishing this essay anonymously is the only way to deliver an important perspective to our readers. We invite you to submit a question about the essay or our vetting process here.

As one of the senior officials working without a paycheck, a few words of advice for the president’s next move at shuttered government agencies: lock the doors, sell the furniture, and cut them down.

Federal employees are starting to feel the strain of the shutdown. I am one of them. But for the sake of our nation, I hope it lasts a very long time, till the government is changed and can never return to its previous form.

The lapse in appropriations is more than a battle over a wall. It is an opportunity to strip wasteful government agencies for good.

On an average day, roughly 15 percent of the employees around me are exceptional patriots serving their country. I wish I could give competitive salaries to them and no one else. But 80 percent feel no pressure to produce results. If they don’t feel like doing what they are told, they don’t.

Why would they? We can’t fire them. They avoid attention, plan their weekend, schedule vacation, their second job, their next position — some do this in the same position for more than a decade. (RELATED: diGenova and Toensing: Judge Napolitano Is Wrong On The Law and The Facts)

They do nothing that warrants punishment and nothing of external value. That is their workday: errands for the sake of errands — administering, refining, following and collaborating on process. “Process is your friend” is what delusional civil servants tell themselves. Even senior officials must gain approval from every rank across their department, other agencies and work units for basic administrative chores.

Process is what we serve, process keeps us safe, process is our core value. It takes a lot of people to maintain the process. Process provides jobs. In fact, there are process experts and certified process managers who protect the process. Then there are the 5 percent with moxie (career managers). At any given time they can change, clarify or add to the process — even to distort or block policy counsel for the president.

Saboteurs peddling opinion as research, tasking their staff on pet projects or pitching wasteful grants to their friends. Most of my career colleagues actively work against the president’s agenda. This means I typically spend about 15 percent of my time on the president’s agenda and 85 percent of my time trying to stop sabotage, and we have no power to get rid of them. Until the shutdown. (RELATED: Former FBI Chief: Only Wray Can Repair FBI After Disgraces of Comey, McCabe and Strzok)

Due to the lack of funding, many federal agencies are now operating more effectively from the top down on a fraction of their workforce, with only select essential personnel serving national security tasks. One might think this is how government should function, but bureaucracies operate from the bottom up — a collective of self-generated ideas. Ideas become initiatives, formalize into offices, they seek funds from Congress and become bureaus or sub-agencies, and maybe one day grow to be their own independent agency, like ours. The nature of a big administrative bureaucracy is to grow to serve itself. I watch it and fight it daily.

When the agency is full, employees held liable for poor performance respond with threats, lawsuits, complaints and process in at least a dozen offices, taking years of mounting paperwork with no fear of accountability, extending their careers, while no real work is done. Do we succumb to such extortion? Yes. We pay them settlements, we waive bad reviews, and we promote them.

Many government agencies have adopted the position that more complaints are good because it shows inclusion in, you guessed it, the process. When complaints come, it is cheaper to pay them off than to hold public servants accountable. The result: People accused of serious offenses are not charged, and self-proclaimed victims are paid by you, the American taxpayer.

The message to federal supervisors is clear. Maintain the status quo, or face allegations. Many federal employees truly believe that doing tasks more efficiently and cutting out waste, by closing troubled programs instead of expanding them, “is morally wrong,” as one cried to me.

I get it. These are their pets. It is tough to put them down and let go, and many resist. This phenomenon was best summed up by a colleague who said, “The goal in government is to do nothing. If you try to get things done, that’s when you will run into trouble.” (RELATED: If Ginsburg Retires, Democrats Have A Trump Card — Packing The Supreme Court)

But President Trump can end this abuse. Senior officials can reprioritize during an extended shutdown, focus on valuable results and weed out the saboteurs. We do not want most employees to return, because we are working better without them. Sure, we empathize with families making tough financial decisions, like mine, and just like private citizens who have to find other work and bring competitive value every day, while paying more than a third of their salary in federal taxes.

President Trump has created more jobs in the private sector than the furloughed federal workforce. Now that we are shut down, not only are we identifying and eliminating much of the sabotage and waste, but we are finally working on the president’s agenda.

President Trump does not need Congress to address the border emergency, and yes, it is an emergency. Billions upon billions of hard-earned tax dollars are still being dumped into foreign aid programs every year that do nothing for America’s interest or national security. The president does not need congressional funding to deconstruct abusive agencies who work against his agenda. This is a chance to effect real change, and his leverage grows stronger every day the shutdown lasts.

The president should add to his demands, including a vote on all of his political nominees in the Senate. Send the career appointees back. Many are in the 5 percent of saboteurs and resistance leaders. (RELATED: New Facts Indicate Mueller Destroyed Evidence, Obstructed Justice)

A word of caution: To be a victory, this shutdown must be different than those of the past and should achieve lasting disruption with two major changes, or it will hurt the president.

The first thing we need out of this is better security, particularly at the southern border. Our founders envisioned a free market night watchman state, not the bungled bloated bureaucracy our government has become. But we have to keep the uniformed officers paid, which is an emergency. Ideally, continue a resolution to pay the essential employees only, if they are truly working on national security. Furloughed employees should find other work, never return and not be paid.

Secondly, we need savings for taxpayers. If this fight is merely rhetorical bickering with Nancy Pelosi, we all lose, especially the president. But if it proves that government is better when smaller, focusing only on essential functions that serve Americans, then President Trump will achieve something great that Reagan was only bold enough to dream.

The president’s instincts are right. Most Americans will not miss non-essential government functions. A referendum to end government plunder must happen. Wasteful government agencies are fighting for relevance but they will lose. Now is the time to deliver historic change by cutting them down forever.

EXCLUSIVE: Trump Says He Will Leave Mueller Report Decision To DOJ,"President Donald Trump said he will leave decisions on how to handle the Mueller report to the Justice Department, he tells The Daily Caller in an exclusive Oval Office interview.

Asked explicitly whether he would sign off, the president said, “They’ll have to make their decision within the Justice Department. They will make the decision as to what they do.”

Trump also said he had not spoken to Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker about the impending end of the Mueller investigation, declaring flatly, “I never spoke to him about that…I would say that after almost two years, it certainly should be.”

Trump noted that he let the probe continue, despite having the right to end it if he chose, saying, “I could have taken a much different stance, I could have gotten involved in this…I could have terminated everything, I could have ended everything. I’ve chosen to stay out of it…but I had the right to…I had the right to end everything…many people thought that’s what I should do.”

TRANSCRIPT:

The Daily Caller: Speaking of that, sir, Matt Whitaker came out I think a couple of days ago. He said that the Mueller probe seems to be wrapping up, generally. Has he communicated that to you?

Trump: No. No, I haven’t spoken to him about that. I would say that I think after almost two years it certainly should be. Process crimes or process, you know, questions. The answer is different than what you thought it might be and some people say they lost their memory or a lack of memory, which a lot of people can understand that too.

No, I never spoke to him about that.

The Daily Caller: So Whitaker or whoever is heading as the attorney general at the time will get to make a decision about releasing the report that Mueller sends him —

Trump: I don’t know what —

The Daily Caller: Is that the kind of thing you’ll sign off on if and when it comes to that decision?

Trump: They’ll have to make their decision within the Justice Department. They will make the decision as to what they do. I could’ve taken a much different stance, I could’ve gotten involved in this, I could’ve terminated everything. I could’ve ended everything. I’ve chosen to stay out of it. But I had the right to, as you know, I had the right, if I wanted to, to end everything. I could’ve just said, ‘that’s enough.’ Many people thought that’s what I should do.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2019/01/30/exclusive-trump-leave-mueller-report-doj/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjgqqfY_rP9AhV-QzABHRuTDJg4FBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw3UOtifjikZaPruRwKTl7_l,2019-01-30
EXCLUSIVE: Trump Rips Virginia Democrats’ Abortion Comments,"President Donald Trump harshly criticized Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and Democratic Virginia Delegate Kathy Tran’s advocacy of late-term abortion, in an exclusive Oval Office interview with The Daily Caller.

“I’m surprised that he did that, I’ve met him a number of times,” Trump said, noting that he saw a video of Tran discussing the bill earlier that morning, but hadn’t yet heard Northam’s remarks.

“I thought it was terrible,” Trump said of Tran’s statements, adding, “Do you remember when I said Hillary Clinton was willing to rip the baby out of the womb? That’s what it is, that’s what they’re doing, it’s terrible.” (RELATED: Senator Sasse Tells Virginia Governor To ‘Get The Hell Out Of Public Office’ Over Abortion Remarks)

Trump’s comments come after a bill was introduced in Virginia that would effectively allow women to terminate a pregnancy up until the moment of birth.

Northam described the new late-term abortion legislation in a Wednesday interview, saying, “If a mother is in labor…the infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated, if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians & mother.”

Trump continued, reflecting on both Northam and Tran’s comments. “This is going to lift up the whole pro-life movement like maybe it’s never been lifted up before. The pro-life movement is very much a 50-50, it’s a very 50-50 issue, actually it’s gained a point or two over the years.” (RELATED: OPINION: ‘Gosnell’ Is A Sobering Depiction Of Evil Hidden In Plain Sight)

Trump’s order will create a Cabinet-level task force headed by VA Sec. Robert Wilkie to work across the federal government to reduce veteran suicide rates, reported USA Today. The initiative is named the “Presidents’ Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide,” or the PREVENTS Initiative.

WATCH:

Suicide rates among young veterans ages 18 to 34 have been climbing. The suicide rate for younger veterans rose from 40.4 suicide deaths per 100,000 in 2015 to 45 per 100,000 in 2016, according to the VA annual report on the issue in September 2018.

A Government Accountability Office report released to the public in December 2018 found “VA’s [suicide prevention] outreach activities dropped off in 2017 and 2018, and the office responsible for these activities lacked consistent leadership.”

The PREVENTS Initiative is designed to encourage private sector involvement and will likely offer grants to state and local governments to work on the issue, reported USA Today.

The VA named veteran suicide its highest clinical priority in 2018 and published a multi-year plan to address it.

News about the alarming veteran suicide rate came in tandem with the U.S. suicide rate hitting a 50-year record in 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, contributing to a lower life expectancy for Americans that’s part of a larger downward trend.

"Trump Campaign Consulted Justice Kennedy About Supreme Court Picks, Book Reveals","Lawyers assisting President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign spoke with retired Justice Anthony Kennedy as they compiled a list of possible nominees to the Supreme Court, a new book reveals.

Kennedy served as a reference for several candidates the campaign considered adding to its list.

Both of Trump’s Supreme Court appointees clerked for Kennedy after graduating from law school.

Lawyers associated with the Trump campaign consulted retired Justice Anthony Kennedy while compiling a list of prospective Supreme Court nominees during the 2016 presidential campaign, portions of a new book obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation reveal.

Kennedy, who was then serving on the Supreme Court, served as a reference for several candidates the campaign vetted for its list, authors Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino report in the book, “Justice on Trial.”

“The team talked to judges for whom candidates had clerked and to those who had clerked with them. McGahn was particularly interested in what candidates had been like in their mid-twenties, the stage of life when he believed most people’s views solidified,” the authors wrote. “Justice Kennedy was eager to help, offering the names of at least six former clerks who were in his ‘top five.’ Kavanaugh was one of them.”

“While Kennedy called his other clerks good or excellent, he tended to describe Kavanaugh as brilliant,” the authors add.

Hemingway and Severino elsewhere report that Kennedy shared his retirement plans with the White House via an intermediary in the Department of Justice. In cloak-and-dagger style, the justice slipped away from a tour of the National Gallery of Art to meet at a nearby cafe with Assistant Attorney General Steve Engel, who clerked for Kennedy during the high court’s 2001-2002 term. Engel relayed Kennedy’s intentions to the White House counsel’s office, which set a private meeting between Kennedy and President Donald Trump for June 27, 2018.

Clerks are generally recent law school graduates in their mid- to late-20s who serve in a judge’s chambers for one year. In that capacity, they provide counsel and administrative assistance for their judge. The campaign, eager to avoid the so-called “stealth nominees” that plagued past Republican presidents, sought individuals who could speak to that period of a candidate’s professional development, believing it is especially probative of a person’s substantive legal views. (RELATED: New Book On Kavanaugh Confirmation Has Incendiary Details About Christine Blasey Ford)

The campaign solicited input from several figures in the conservative legal movement as it compiled its list, the authors report. Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, furnished names for Trump advisors, as did the Heritage Foundation’s John Malcolm. Don McGahn, then a lawyer in private practice at Jones Day, vetted contenders with his law firm colleague James Burnham.

Jones Day represented the Trump presidential campaign and sent at least dozen lawyers into senior administration positions. McGahn would go on to shepherd two Supreme Court nominations as White House counsel, while Burnham leads the federal programs section at the Department of Justice.

The list began to take definitive form in March 2016, when McGahn brokered a summit with Trump and movement conservative leaders in the Washington offices of Jones Day. Leo arrived at the meeting with a preliminary list of names, which he shared with Trump during a private consultation which followed the meeting. Malcolm produced a list of eight names March 30.

The campaign published a list featuring 11 names at President Donald Trump’s urging May 18, 2016. Another 10 candidates were added to the list in October 2016. Trump promised to pick his first Supreme Court nominee from that “definitive” list of candidates.

Another Kennedy clerk who appeared on the Trump campaign’s list was Justice Neil Gorsuch, who succeeded the late Justice Antonin Scalia in April 2017.

Hemingway and Severino interviewed more than 100 people for the book, including the president, seniors members of the administration, justices of the Supreme Court and members of Congress.

Justice Kennedy declined to comment through the Supreme Court Public Information Office.

Trump Lawyer: Video Shows Ex-Campaign Staffer Lied About Forcible Kiss,"A former Trump campaign staffer sued President Trump in February, accusing him of forcibly kissing her on the campaign trail in August 2016.

But Trump’s lawyers released cellphone video of the incident, which they say shows that the ex-staffer, Alva Johnson, was lying.

The 15-second video shows Trump lightly kissing Johnson on the cheek while the pair are among a group of people on a campaign RV in Florida.

President Donald Trump’s lawyers released a 15-second video Wednesday they say shows that a former Trump campaign staffer lied when she claimed the Republican forcibly kissed her on the campaign trail in 2016.

Alva Johnson, who worked on the campaign’s voter outreach team, sued Trump on Feb. 25 for battery and discrimination based on her race and gender. Johnson, who is black, said Trump forcibly kissed her in a campaign RV during a stop in Florida on Aug. 24, 2016.

Charles Harder, a personal attorney for Trump, said cellphone footage of the exchange debunks Johnson’s salacious claim.

“The Video proves that Plaintiff has no legitimate claim for battery. It also proves that Plaintiff and her counsel have lied repeatedly to this Court,” wrote Harder, whose court filing Wednesday seeks to block Johnson’s request to depose Trump.

Politico first reported on the Harder filing.

In the initial suit, Johnson alleged that Trump “grasped her hand and did not let go.”

“[H]e tightened his grip on Ms. Johnson’s hand and leaned towards her. He moved close enough that she could feel his breath on her skin,” the lawsuit reads.

Johnson said she “suddenly realized that Defendant Trump was trying to kiss her on the mouth, and attempted to avoid this by turning her head to the right. Defendant Trump kissed her anyway, and the kiss landed on the corner of her mouth.” (RELATED: ‘Absurd’ – White House Pushes Back On Allegation Trump Kissed Her On The Lips)

Johnson’s story was picked up by numerous news outlets, including The Washington Post and New Yorker. MSNBC’s Chris Hayes also interviewed an emotional Johnson a day after the lawsuit was filed.

Hayes drew comparisons between Johnson’s allegations and the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape released on Oct. 7, 2016 that shows Trump speaking of grabbing women by the genitals and forcibly kissing them.

WATCH:

Harder said that video taken of the Johnson-Trump exchange shows “an innocent moment between a dedicated campaign staffer and the candidate for whom she was working.”

The video, which was recorded by Brian Hayes, a campaign volunteer, shows Trump among a group that included Johnson, campaign workers, law enforcement officers and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.

As Trump appears to be speaking to an unidentified man, Johnson is heard off camera telling Trump that she had been “away from my family for eight months for you.”

Trump turns toward Johnson and places his hands on her shoulders, while kissing her lightly on her right cheek.

Johnson smiled and said, “Eight months for you.”

“We’re going to get you in the White House and I’ll see you in February,” she adds.

Johnson, who sought a job in the Trump White House, confirmed during a deposition Monday that the incident on video is the one she described in her lawsuit.

The video demonstrates that Johnson was not attacked and did not feel threatened by Trump, Harder said.

“If Plaintiff had been attacked, as she alleges, one would expect a far different response than telling him she’ll help him get elected President of the United States,” said Harder. “That is the response of a person who is moved in a positive way by her candidate’s show of appreciation and recognition of her dedicated service to his campaign.”

Johnson’s lawyer disputed Harder’s assertion that the video exonerates Trump.

“We are gratified and pleased that we finally have proof what Ms. Johnson has been alleging in this lawsuit,” Hassan Zavareei, a lawyer for Johnson, told Politico. “It is basically exactly what Ms. Johnson has been saying.”

He said besides a few small differences, the video is “basically identical” to what Johnson described in her suit.

He acknowledged the exchange with Trump did not “look dramatic,” but added, “That does not mean it wasn’t a serious battery.”

“It’s a battery because she didn’t want it to happen,” Zavareei said. “It’s not an appropriate thing to do to another person.”

"Joaquin Castro Posts Names, Employers Of Trump Donors","Democratic Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro on Monday tweeted the names and employers of 44 San Antonio residents who donated the federal maximum to President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign.

Castro, whose district includes much of San Antonio, claimed the donors “are fueling a campaign of hate that labels Hispanic immigrants as ‘invaders.'” Castro is the twin brother of Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro and chairs his presidential campaign.

Sad to see so many San Antonians as 2019 maximum donors to Donald Trump — the owner of ⁦@BillMillerBarBQ⁩, owner of the ⁦@HistoricPearl, realtor Phyllis Browning, etc⁩. Their contributions are fueling a campaign of hate that labels Hispanic immigrants as ‘invaders.’ pic.twitter.com/YT85IBF19u — Joaquin Castro (@Castro4Congress) August 6, 2019

“Sad to see so many San Antonians as 2019 maximum donors to Donald Trump,” the congressman wrote, proceeding to name local businesses whose owners gave the maximum to Trump’s campaign. Eleven of the 44 donors shown in Rep. Castro’s post listed their employment as “retired.”

Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh is demanding Castro delete the post.

“Democrats want to talk about inciting violence? This naming of private citizens and their employers is reckless and irresponsible. He is endangering the safety of people he is supposed to be representing,” Murtaugh told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

“No one should be targeted for exercising their First Amendment rights or for their political beliefs. He should delete the tweet, apologize, and his brother’s campaign should disavow it,” Murtaugh continued. (RELATED: A Mob Showed Up At Tucker Carlson’s House And Ordered Him To ‘Leave Town’)

Murtaugh added that the campaign reported Castro’s tweet to Twitter for “targeted harassment.”

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise was harshly critical of Rep. Castro as well, warning the Democratic congressman: “This isn’t a game. It’s dangerous, and lives are at stake. I know this firsthand.”

The names and employers of campaign donors are publicly available in Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings, but publishing lists of opposing donors in the area and their places of employment, is outside the norm for members of the House of Representatives.

Neither Castro’s presidential campaign nor Rep. Castro’s congressional office returned requests for comment.

Castro later doubled down on his decision to publish the list, comparing it to media coverage of large campaign donors.

Trump Phone Call Transcript Appears To Undercut Two ‘Bombshell’ Reports About Whistleblower Complaint,"A rough transcript of President Donald Trump’s phone call appears to undercut two major news stories that helped fuel interest in a whistleblower complaint against him.

The Washington Post reported Trump made a “promise” to the Ukrainian president during a phone call central to the complaint. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump “repeatedly pressed” for an investigation into Joe Biden’s son.

A rough transcript of the call released Wednesday by the White House contains no indication of a “promise.” It also shows Trump mentioned the Bidens only during one part of their 30-minute conversation.

One of the stories that sparked interest in a whistleblower complaint against President Donald Trump was a Washington Post report Sept. 18 that he made a “promise” to a foreign leader, now known to be Ukraine’s president.

Speculation over the mysterious whistleblower complaint reached a fever pitch Friday when The Wall Street Journal reported that in a July 25 phone call, Trump “repeatedly pressed” the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Joe Biden’s son’s business dealings in Ukraine.

The stories helped escalate a standoff over the whistleblower complaint that has fueled Democrats’ calls for impeachment, but they appear to be inaccurate, at least based on a memo detailing the Trump-Zelensky call that the White House released Wednesday.

The memo, which is a rough transcript of the call, shows Trump did not make a promise to Zelensky, nor is there a threat to withhold aid to Ukraine, or an indication that Trump “repeatedly” pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden’s son, Hunter. (RELATED: Here’s A Transcript Of Trump’s Call With Ukraine’s President)

It is not clear how the newspapers obtained the information about the whistleblower complaint. The stories relied on two former U.S. intelligence officials and others familiar with the matter.

The whistleblower, who has not been identified, did not have direct knowledge of the phone call that undergirds the complaint, according to press reports and the Justice Department. Justice Department lawyers said in an opinion released Wednesday that the whistleblower relied on “hearsay” from other White House officials who allegedly expressed concerns about what Trump said in the call.

To be sure, there is plenty in the five-page transcript for Democrats to use to fuel their push for impeachment. The Intelligence Community Inspector General found the whistleblower complaint “credible” and “urgent,” and referred it to the Justice Department officials for possible investigation into whether Trump illegally solicited election help from a foreign country.

The Justice Department declined to open an investigation. But Democrats and liberal media pundits asserted after the White House released the phone call transcript that it shows Trump made an implicit quid pro quo by asking Zelensky for a “favor” during a discussion of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

“I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,” Trump told Zelensky after the Ukrainian mentioned he was preparing to purchase Javelin defense systems from the U.S.

“I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people … The server, they say Ukraine has it,” added Trump, referring to the cybersecurity firm that investigated Russian hacks of the DNC’s computer systems.

“Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”

Trump then said that he would have Attorney General William Barr contact Zelensky’s aides, telling Zelensky that “I would like you to get to the bottom of it.”

The Justice Department released a statement Wednesday saying Barr was unaware of the phone call until it was referred to the agency in the whistleblower complaint earlier in September.

Trump also emphasized U.S. support for Ukraine, and compared the assistance favorably to that provided by Germany and France, according to the call memo.

The document shows that Zelensky was who first brought up Rudy Giuliani, the Trump lawyer who has led an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. Trump brought up the Bidens later in the conversation, and only mentioned them during one segment of the call, at least according to the released transcript.

“The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it,” said Trump, adding that, “It sounds horrible to me.”

Trump appeared to be referring to Giuliani’s assertion that when Joe Biden was vice president, he pressured Ukraine’s president at the time, Petro Poroshenko, to fire a prosecutor who was considering an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company that paid $50,000 a month to Hunter Biden as a director.

Biden bragged in January 2018 that he forced Poroshenko to fire the prosecutor in exchange for $1 billion in loan assistance from the U.S.

Giuliani and other Trump allies have said Biden’s remarks show he used his position of power to help his son avoid investigation. But there is no evidence so far that Biden was aware that Burisma Holdings was under threat of investigation.

Whether or not the Biden allegation is legitimate, WaPo and TheWSJ’s reports about what the whistleblower alleged appear inconsistent with the White House memo.

The second paragraph of WaPo story reads:

Trump’s interaction with the foreign leader included a “promise” that was regarded as so troubling that it prompted an official in the U.S. intelligence community to file a formal whistleblower complaint with the inspector general for the intelligence community, said the former officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

And the lead of TheWSJ’s story reads:

President Trump in a July phone call repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden’s son, according to people familiar with the matter, urging Volodymyr Zelensky about eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani on a probe that could hamper Mr. Trump’s potential 2020 opponent.

A spokesman for TheWSJ said in a statement that the paper is standing by its story.

“The call record released today is not a word-by-word transcript, and while we do not know the totality of the conversation, this record clearly shows multiple references to Mr. Giuliani and a proposed investigation, which supports our earlier reporting,” Steve Severinghaus told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Greg Miller, the lead reporter on the Post story, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

GORKA: My Exclusive Interview With President Donald Trump,"The following is excerpted from Dr. Sebastian Gorka’s new book, “The War for America’s Soul” (Regnery Publishing, 2019).

DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA: As a child of parents who escaped Communism, I was very moved when you told Congress that America would never be a socialist country. Did you ever think that any American president would have to say such a thing to Congress?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I never did. I never thought it would be part of the dialogue. I am happy to report that I don’t think that it will be lasting very long. Our country is doing better than it has ever done economically, with the stock market and 401Ks — and I’m not just talking about people of wealth, I’m talking about people who haven’t had a job in years and now have jobs. We have the greatest number of jobs that we’ve ever had, almost 160 million, the stock market today just hit another all-time high — all three markets — and people are great. So I think that it would be very surprising to me if that debate carries forward much longer. I hope it won’t, but it could very well be a big dialogue, a big part of the election, but we’re talking about not so very far away. Can you imagine that Sebastian, like seventeen months? Can you imagine that? Time flies!

GORKA: It does!

TRUMP: Amazing

GORKA: Back when I served as your deputy assistant for strategy —

TRUMP: And did a great job. You really did a great job!

GORKA: Thank you. In this room, it was just the two of us, May or June of 2017. You said to me, “Sebastian, they’ll never find anything because there isn’t anything,” in regard to Russian collusion.

TRUMP: It’s true.

GORKA: Since then, you have been vindicated by Congress, twice, and now by the Department of Justice with the close of the Mueller investigation. Yet on the left, many still refuse to give up their Russian delusions. Presumably, this is a positive factor for you in 2020 and for the broader “make America great again” agenda. Is it good that they’re constantly beating this dead horse? Is it a good thing for you, Mr. President?

TRUMP: Look, it was so preposterous that at the beginning, I didn’t even take it seriously. When I first heard about “Russia and the Trump administration,” I literally didn’t even take it seriously, but then I saw that they’ll do anything to win. They’ll say anything they have to say. And if you had told me that it could lead to a special counsel, with all that that entails, I would have said, “That’s an impossibility.” But we won, there was no collusion. The problem is I think they could have made that determination in the first two days. I also think that a special counsel never should have been appointed. It’s disgraceful for our country. But we handled it properly. I gave a level of transparency that’s never been given in the history of our country before, ever. And I did that for a reason. I did that: number one, I thought it was important, and number two, I knew there was nothing there. (RELATED: If Barr Fails To Move On Comey’s Cabal, Get Ready For Special Counsel Peter Strzok)

GORKA: When I was last here to see you, I was in the White House Press Briefing Room, and Abilio “Jim” Acosta bowls past me, grabs my shoulder, and in front of witnesses, says “What are you doing here? This is for real journalists.” That’s what Acosta said. He has a high opinion of himself.

TRUMP: You know, it is incredible how wrong they have been.

GORKA: And the Mueller report —

TRUMP: Mueller would have loved to have written something negative, Mueller and his Trump-haters, angry Democrats. If they had one phone call, if they had anything, even a small conversation, they would’ve tried to make it into a collusion. They spent $35 million, and at the end of two years, they say there’s no collusion.

GORKA: According to the Heritage Foundation, your first year in office was even more successful than Ronald Reagan’s. By any objective measure, your administration in the first two years has achieved more than any modern administration in eight years. Are the next six years of your presidency going to be enough to undo all the harm inflicted by Obama and Clinton?

TRUMP: Well I think we’ve done a lot of it in the first two years despite the phony witch hunt. I think that I’ve done more than any president in the first two years. I wrote out a list for you. It’s point after point after point.

GORKA: Great. Thank you, sir.

TRUMP: These are just things that we’ve done, all big things. And today, again, we hit the highest ever on the Nasdaq and S&P.

GORKA: What did Paul Krugman say after your election? That the stock market would crash and never recover?

TRUMP: Oh, is that what he said?

GORKA: He said never recover.

TRUMP: Boy, I’ll tell you, if you listened to him … and the guy probably gets a big medal.

GORKA: They gave him the Nobel prize.

TRUMP: For nothing!

GORKA: In the last two years, if you look at Capitol Hill, it’s been a handful of people who’ve had your back. It would seem a no-brainer for the GOP to look at what you’ve achieved and hitch their wagon to your agenda. Does the establishment on the Right understand the significance of 2016, and is that going to change, do you think?

TRUMP: I’ve had great support from a larger number of Republicans than people would think.

GORKA: Really?

TRUMP: Yeah. I really have had.

GORKA: But quietly, you mean.

TRUMP: Yes. But I’ve been disappointed by some, and some are just openly, you know, out there—I mean, they just don’t vote for anything that we’re doing. I don’t have to say who because all you have to do is check the votes. It’s pretty shocking. But I think I’ve had a lot more support from Republican congressmen and Republican senators than people think. I really do. I think I’ve had some really good support. I’ve also supported them. One of the greatest moments is the election of 2018. We won.

GORKA: Right. They were great results.

TRUMP: We won. We picked up two seats in the Senate, and I got rid of two senators that, frankly, had been very bad to me. They were hostile to me. They’re gone. We’re at 53. Big difference between 53 and 51. So, we won. Judges, remember, are confirmed by the Senate. Now, did we lose the House? Yeah, but I couldn’t campaign for all of the people. You know, it’s just so many. I campaigned for Senate, and look at the seats we picked up, with Josh Hawley, with so many, you look at Indiana, you look at North Dakota. Look at the seats we picked up, brand new seats. I was told that Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota could not be beaten, you would be wasting your time. And Kevin Cramer ran a great race in North Dakota; he had great support for me. I was told that it was going to be very hard to win in Missouri; it was going to be very hard to win in Indiana.

We won in Missouri; we won in Indiana. In Tennessee, look how great Republican Marsha Blackburn did. How about Florida? You look at Florida, the Senate race between Republican Rick Scott and Democrat Ron DeSantis. We won. Look at the governor of Georgia, where Oprah, President Obama, and Mrs. Obama campaigned; they staked out there and they campaigned. I went there for Brian Kemp, and we won. Look at Ohio, the governor of Ohio, how important is Ohio? The governor’s great. But he was down 7 and he ended up winning by 7 after that final campaign stop, last day, took him up 14 points. Andy Barr in Kentucky was down by 7; he won by 6. Oh also, Cindy Hyde-Smith in the Senate, she was down by 3 or 4 points, and I went down and did two rallies. These aren’t speeches, these are rallies — big deals, with twenty or twenty-five thousand people, or more.

GORKA: I remember when you were with Corey Lewandowski, and we’d always have to expand the stadium. You’d have one location, it wouldn’t be big enough. We’d have to find another one, we’d have to find another one —

TRUMP: Sebastian, I’ve never had an empty seat.

GORKA: And they’re always waiting outside, thousands outside.

TRUMP: Tens of thousands waiting for hours. It shows you how unfair the press is. I go to El Paso, and Beto O’Rouke at that time was the hot new thing, and he heard I was going to do a rally. So he called for a rally. He had 502 people show up. I had 12,000 inside and 35,000 outside. And I mean that place was popping; it broke the [attendance] record [for the site]. We had big screens. And the press said we both had “large” rallies. One reporter in The New York Times actually said his rally was larger than mine…

GORKA: Fake News. In the last year, the tactics of the media and the left have been literally disgraceful. From Justice Brett Kavanaugh, his treatment, to the Covington School boys. Do you expect the tactics to get even worse before 2020? If so, what should the average American do?

TRUMP: I don’t think they can get worse. Because I’ve been a student of politics for a long time. In the history of politics, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like Judge Kavanaugh. Those were fabricated stories, fabricated stories. And I have never seen anyone treated so badly as him, in front of his wife and his children, great people. Never saw anything like it. I don’t think it can get worse than that; it can only be the same. That’s the highest standard there is in town. And will it continue?

The New York Times basically has given up journalistic standards. They’ve said, “We don’t care; we’ll say anything.” Essentially, they’re just making up stories. They don’t even call for confirmation; they don’t call for quotes. If they’re doing a bad story on me, they don’t call for a response. And they couldn’t care less. If we tell them it’s untrue, it makes zero difference to them, zero.

GORKA: As a result, how important is social media?

TRUMP: Without it, I guess, I wouldn’t have a voice. Even other voices would be drowned out, you know, like Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs, and “Fox and Friends” in the morning, other people like Steve Doocy and Ainsley Earhardt, and the whole group, you know, great people. But I think they’re drowned out because eventually they have to succumb to this horror show that’s going on right now.

“Fake News” is a great term for it. I hope I get credit for coming up with that one. But now the Fake News uses it all the time, they’ll say “Fake News has reported,” they’ll say it like they’re legitimate, like they’re talking about somebody else … I never thought the press could be so dishonest. The Democratic Party, the radical, liberal Democrats, are in absolute partnership with the media. It’s crazy.

And when you think of what I’ve done. I’ve strengthened the military to a point where it’s never been. The military was so depleted, we were close to not having a military. I’ve rebuilt the steel industry; steel is hopping now. We were not going to have steel made in this country. Energy, look, we’re now the number one energy producer in the world, oil and gas. We weren’t close when I got elected. I’m approving pipelines now at a pace that nobody’s ever even thought possible. They need them desperately in Texas. I approved all of them: the Dakota Access, the Keystone. I approved them immediately. I got ANWR in Alaska. Ronald Reagan — and everybody who’s tried since — was unable to get that, and I got that approved in Alaska. Look at the judges. I’m now over 120 judges, two of whom are Supreme Court justices.

GORKA: Do you think you’ll get a third Supreme Court justice?

TRUMP: That I don’t know. I hope she [Ruth Bader Ginsburg] and everybody else lives for a long time.

GORKA: Last two questions. How are we doing, Mr. President, in defeating the Deep State?

TRUMP: Well, I think, if it all works out, I will consider it one of the greatest things I’ve done. You look at what’s happened to the absolute scum at the top of the FBI. You look at what’s happening over at the Justice Department, now we have a great attorney general. Whereas before that, with Jeff Sessions, it was a disaster. Just a total disaster. He was an embarrassment to the great state of Alabama. And I put him there because he endorsed me, and he wanted it so badly. And I wish he’d never endorsed me.

It would have been the greatest non-endorsement I ever had. But it’s too bad. But now we have a great attorney general. And I think with the destruction of the Deep State, certainly I’ve done big damage. They’ve come after me in so many different ways; it’s been such a disgrace. But I think it’ll be one of my great achievements.

GORKA: Okay, last question. What would President Trump of 2019 have said to candidate Trump in 2015, by way of advice?

TRUMP: Always be prepared for the unexpected.

Buttigieg Criticizes Trump Over Syria Withdrawal: He Is ‘Systemically Destroying American Alliances’,"Pete Buttigieg appeared Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” and had some harsh words for President Donald Trump on his handling of the withdrawal of American troops from northern Syria.

CNN host Jake Tapper opened his show by reminding Buttigieg of his comments on how the U.S. needs to “put an end to endless wars,” and followed that by asking how the U.S. could “ensure U.S. allies like the Kurds that they would be protected?”

Buttigieg replied that “oftentimes it means we do our part to stabilize or help keep the peace so full blown conflicts don’t break out.” (RELATED: Sec Def Esper Defends White House Move To Pull More Troops From Syria)

The candidate also criticized the president saying, “But look what’s happened here. It is not even a strategy or policy. It is the president systemically destroying American alliances and American values, and that makes America worse off.”

“The 21st century is going to be filled with these kinds of messy, asymmetric conflicts, and we need to make sure the U.S. is up for helping our allies. It’s horrifying to see what is emerging not just in terms of what is being done to Kurds, but in terms of ISIS fighters now being released exactly as we were warned would happen,” Buttigieg continued.

The American troop withdrawal from Syria was followed by the Turkish president announcing a military incursion into northern Syria against U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters. This invasion has allegedly resulted in over 700 ISIS prisoners escaping from a camp.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2019/10/13/buttigieg-syria-trump-meet-the-press/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwib6a7a_rP9AhX3FVkFHfGXCTo4MhAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw3IrX84x8-Q3XliGebQoONA,2019-10-13
CALABRESI: House Democrats Violate The 6th Amendment By Denying Trump A Public Trial,"The nation is transfixed by the impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump for purportedly using U.S. military aid to Ukraine to prompt that country to reopen a corruption into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. What no one is focusing on is the fact that the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives is violating the president’s constitutional rights. The House majority is thus itself acting unconstitutionally and is seriously abusing its power.

Impeachment is a legal proceeding, and just as criminal defendants have constitutional rights in criminal trials so too does Trump have constitutional rights, which House Democrats are denying him. For example, the Sixth Amendment gives criminal defendants the right to “a speedy and public trial.” House Democrats are trying Trump in secret and are denying him the right to a public proceeding.

The Sixth Amendment also guarantees criminal defendants the right to be “informed” of the charges against them. House Democrats are not informing Trump of the charges against him and are leaking salacious information to the press. This, too, violates Trumps rights under the federal Bill of Rights. (RELATED: Calabresi: Democrats Are Violating Trump’s Rights — And Charging Him With A Fake ‘Crime’)

Moreover, the Sixth Amendment guarantees Trump the right “to confront the witnesses against him”, which right House Democrats are denying to Trump. The president has a right under current Supreme Court case law to have a public face-to-face confrontation with the witnesses against and to testify in his own defense. House Democrats are denying the president that very basic constitutional right.

The fact of the matter is that even if the president abused his powers in urging the president of Ukraine to reopen the investigation in that country into illegal activity by the firm that employed Hunter Biden, House Democrats are abusing their power of impeachment by denying Trump his basic rights as a defendant in the case against him under the Sixth Amendment. Impeaching a president and overturning the results of the 2016 presidential election is a really big deal.

For House Democrats to conduct an impeachment investigation while violating multiple rights that Trump enjoys under the Sixth Amendment is a gross abuse of power, which is at least as serious as any abuses of power committed by Trump. The leaders of this unconstitutionally conducted and Kafkaesque “trial” should be expelled from the house for their unconstitutional behavior thus far, and the voters should “punish” House Democrats in the 2020 elections by electing a Republican House majority. (RELATED: Democrats Are Scrambling To Find A Backup Plan After Impeachment Hearings)

Violations of President Trump’s Sixth Amendment rights by House Democrats are lawless, unconstitutional, and suggest that the whole impeachment matter should be dropped. If Democrats in the House believe in the sanctity of the Constitution they should abandon their unconstitutional impeachment inquiry immediately.

Emails Show Trump Admin Planned To Send Masks To Every Household In April Before Shifting Gears To Focus On Frontline Workers,"United States Postal Service (USPS) emails show that the Trump administration originally planned in April to mail 5 reusable masks to every household in the country before shifting the personal protective equipment allotment to critical frontline workers and organizations.

The emails, obtained by a watchdog group through the Freedom of Information Act and first reported by The Washington Post, included a USPS draft press release announcing the shipment of 650 million masks to every home in America, complete with quotes from former Postmaster General Megan Brennan. (RELATED: Recordings Capture Trump Admitting He Knowingly Downplayed Coronavirus From January To March)

“The U.S. Postal Service today announced it will distribute 650 million reusable cotton face coverings on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to every residential delivery point in America, beginning in areas which HHS has identified as experiencing high transmission rates of COVID-19 and to workers providing essential services throughout the nation during this pandemic,” the draft reads. “Orleans and Jefferson parishes in Louisiana will be the first areas to receive face coverings, followed by King County, WA; Wayne County, MI, and New York.”

“The Postal Service will utilize its unrivaled distribution network to deliver the face coverings. Letter carriers, rural carriers and others will deliver one pack of five face coverings to each residential delivery point and PO Box,” the draft continued. “The packs will arrive labeled with a generic Postal Service barcode, not a specific address, and will include HHS instructions on proper use.”

Administration officials told the Post that the announcement was scrapped after the Department of Health and Human Services decided instead to ship the allotted PPE to medical facilities, companies, and other groups on the frontlines of the pandemic. The operation was dubbed “Project America Strong,” and one official noted that the shift in strategy came from a belief “that households receiving masks might create concern or panic.”

The Post’s report comes after tapes were published from interviews between Bob Woodward and President Donald Trump, in which the president can be heard saying he downplayed the severity of coronavirus to avoid a national panic.

“To be honest with you,” Trump says on the recording, “I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic.”

‘We’re On The Same Side’: Trump Pushes Back On Savannah Guthrie Over Mask Question,"President Donald Trump pushed back on NBC anchor Savannah Guthrie during his Thursday evening town hall event.

The president took a question from a first-time voter — who said that she was leaning toward voting for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden — about masks, and pushed back when Guthrie offered a series of follow-up questions. (RELATED: ‘Embarrassing Ratings Ploy’: Don Lemon Rips Into NBC For Allowing Trump To ‘Manipulate Them’)

WATCH:

“My parents are both front line health care workers, as you heard,” a new voter named Isabella began. “I’ve seen the physical and mental tolls this pandemic has taken on them firsthand. As well as the exacerbation of coronavirus due to Americans who are not wearing masks or participating in social distancing. After contracting COVID-19 yourself, has your opinion changed on the importance of mask wearing?”

Trump said his opinion hadn’t really changed because he had never had a problem with masks. “I was good with it.”

Trump went on to say that he had heard a number of conflicting reports on the efficacy of masks, and that many people who did wear masks ended up touching their faces and adjusting them.

“Look, look, you have, on the masks, you know, you have two stories,” Trump continued. “You have a story where they want, a story where they don’t want.”

“I don’t get that because all of your public health officials, your administration, they are in unison about this. They’re all in unison about it,” Guthrie pushed back, saying that models predicted 100% mask compliance could cut the number of deaths in half.

Trump mentioned Stanford’s Dr. Scott Atlas, and Guthrie interrupted him again.

“That’s not an infectious disease expert,” she said. She went on to say that Trump could use his power to require masks at his rallies and encourage more people to do so on a regular basis.

“Then you have other places say different things. Hey, Dr. Fauci said don’t wear a mask,” Trump replied.

“At first, but then everybody agreed,” Guthrie said.

“I don’t know, then he changed his mind but then you have a report coming out two days ago that 85% of the people wearing masks —” Trump pushed back again.

“I looked at that report, it’s not about mask wearing, it was neutral about masks,” Guthrie said.

“Savannah. Savannah. We’re on the same side, I say wear the masks, I’m fine with it. I have no problem, we’re on the same side,” Trump concluded as they cut to a break.

Fox News reporter Kristin Fisher noted earlier Thursday that the Trump campaign was asking rally attendees to wear masks, posting a photo of a sign outside the North Carolina venue where Trump spoke prior to the town hall.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2020/10/15/trump-pushes-back-savannah-guthrie-mask-question/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjC54Lb_rP9AhXMF1kFHXBfCTk4PBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw1tMP1SwD8ZBrrPR7543lBk,2020-10-15
Trump Orders Thousands Of US Troops To Withdraw From Iraq And Afghanistan,"President Donald Trump has ordered an accelerated withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller announced Tuesday.

Miller’s announcement confirmed reports from Monday that Trump planned to make the withdrawal. Miller says the administration aims to have just 2,500 troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan by January 15, for a total of 5,000. The U.S. currently has well over 10,000 troops deployed in the two countries, down from more than 150,000 during the Iraq War in the mid-2000s. (RELATED: National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien Pledges ‘Very Professional Transition’ To Biden Administration)

“This decision by the president is based on continuous engagement with his national security cabinet over the past several months including ongoing discussions with me and my colleagues across the United States government,” Miller said at the Pentagon. “And just this morning, I spoke with key leaders in Congress as well as our allies and partners abroad to update them on these plans in light of our shared approach.”

“We went in together, we adjust together and when the time is right, we will leave together,” Miller added.

O’Brien just spoke at WH on withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan & Iraq, leaving 2,500 in each country by Jan. 15. Remaining troops would defend diplomats & facilities. “By May it is President Trump’s hope that they will come home safely and in their entirety.” h/t @svdate — Chris Johnson (@chrisjohnson82) November 17, 2020

The announcement came less than a week after Trump performed what some called a “near-total decapitation” of civilian leadership at the Defense Department. Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper had repeatedly butted heads with Trump on a number of issues ahead of the 2020 election, and he also opposed the drawdown of troops in the Middle East.

Trump announced Esper’s firing on Twitter last week before purging several other like-minded officials within the DoD. Trump appointed Miller — one of the first on-the-ground heroes of the Iraq war — in Esper’s place, alongside Ret. Army Col. Douglas Macgregor, one of the Iraq War’s most ardent critics.

Esper and Trump had clashed publicly on a number of issues in the lead up to the November 3 election, including the renaming of military bases currently named after Confederate military figures, as well as the deployment of active duty U.S. troops to cities experiencing unrest this summer.

It was rumored throughout this fall that Trump planned to fire Esper after the election, though now Esper says it was his plan to resign regardless of the election outcome.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2020/11/17/trump-iraq-afghanistan-troop-withdrawal/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwib6a7a_rP9AhX3FVkFHfGXCTo4MhAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw0tIRQ0wig4AzccDnywEGaf,2020-11-17
"Trump Tells Mob Storming Capitol That Election Was Stolen, But They Should Go Home Peacefully","President Donald Trump addressed the nation Wednesday, saying the election was “fraudulent” before telling his supporters to “go home and go home in peace” amid chaos at the capital building.

“I know your pain. I know you’re hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us,” Trump said in a video posted to Twitter. “I know how you feel, but go home and go home in peace.”

Trump’s tweets came hours after he promised to march with his supporters to Capitol Hill to protest President-Elect Joe Biden’s election victory. Protesters broke into the Capitol as the Senate was in session, throwing the certification of Biden’s win into chaos even as Vice President Mike Pence said he would not intervene. Trump egged on his supporters throughout his speech Wednesday afternoon, calling alleged dumps of Biden votes on election night “explosions of bullshit.” (RELATED: Rudy Giuliani Says America Needs ‘Trial By Combat’ To Decide Election)

Trump’s statement called for peace but he also doubled down on his claim that the election was “fraudulent.”

Reports say capitol police were forced to use tear gas on rioters inside the Capitol building and officers drew firearms inside the House chamber. Protesters broke through windows and police barricades to access the Senate chamber, where one protester ascended to the dais and yelled “Trump won.”

Trump spoke to the large protest Wednesday afternoon, laying out once again his unfounded accusations of election fraud. Trump and his campaign have filed roughly 40 lawsuits since Nov. 3 challenging the election result, all of which failed due to lack of evidence. The protesters plan to walk to the Capitol as Congress accepts the Electoral College’s certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.

"Trump, As His Supporters Storm The US Capitol, Lashes Out At Pence For Refusing To Overturn Election","President Donald Trump lashed out Wednesday at Vice President Mike Pence as his own supporters broke through security and flooded the United States Capitol.

Pence, who was presiding over Congress’ certification of the votes, had announced that he would follow the Constitution and ignore Trump’s orders to overturn the election results. (RELATED: Capitol Hill Locked Down After Trump Supporters Riot, Storm Capitol Complex)

“Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify,” Trump tweeted. “USA demands the truth!”

Earlier in the day, Trump had told a crowd of thousands to march to Capitol Hill and demand Pence and Congress overturn the election results.

The president’s repeated claims that Pence can overturn the results are false.

The vice president does not have the power to object to any of the state electors’ votes. Congress alone was granted the ability to contest results by the Electoral Count Act of 1887.

Should a member from both bodies object to a single state’s results, the joint session will break and each Chamber will debate the results separately for two hours before voting on acceptance.

Though many Trump allies have pledged to object on Wednesday — including at least 12 Republican senators and more than 100 Republican representatives — that act too is purely ceremonial. Rejecting a set of results requires a simple majority vote, which New York Times noted is ultimately destined to fail given the Democrats’ strong majority in the House and statements from a growing number of Senate Republicans that they will not object to President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/01/06/trump-supporters-storm-us-capitol-lashes-out-pence-overturn-election/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjgsdjb_rP9AhX3FVkFHV4KCsM4RhAWegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw2O5Uj4FJXvZB8eyxSlHrlK,2021-01-06
President Donald Trump Blocked From Facebook And Instagram ‘Indefinitely’ After Platforms Used To ‘Incite Violent Insurrection’,"President Donald Trump will be blocked from using Facebook and Instagram “indefinitely” — and at least until the transition of power to President-elect Joe Biden is complete — the company’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Thursday, after pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday.

“The shocking events of the last 24 hours clearly demonstrate that President Donald Trump intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden,” Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post.

The company will keep the block in place on both of Trump’s accounts “indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the transition of power is complete.”

Violence erupted in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday during a protest against the certification of Electoral College votes that would cement President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. Rioters supporting Trump stormed the Capitol building during the count, postponing certification and forcing evacuation. Four people reportedly died during the riots, including one woman who was fatally shot by law enforcement.

Zuckerberg said Trump was permitted to use Facebook’s platform for “the last several years” because his company supports the public’s access to political speech, with some content removal and labeling when Trump violated policies, but said the circumstances have changed.

“But the current context is now fundamentally different, involving use of our platform to incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government.”

Following the mob violence, Trump posted a video address on social media, which Facebook and Twitter said they removed because of concerns that it would only provoke, rather than diminish, violence. YouTube also pulled the video, citing violations of its policies against allegations of “widespread fraud or errors” that changed the election outcome.

"The GOP Is Trump’s, ‘It Doesn’t Belong To Anybody Else,” Marjorie Taylor Greene Says","Republican Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said Friday that the GOP belongs exclusively to former President Donald Trump.

Greene said Trump received a record amount of votes from Americans and Republicans “because they loved his policies” and what he represented. (RELATED: ‘I Have Been Freed’: Rep. Greene Says She Would Be ‘Wasting’ Her Time As A Conservative In Committees)

“They loved his fight, they loved the fact that for once we had a president that stood up for America, stood up for American businesses and remembered the forgotten man,” Greene said. “He was a president that didn’t care about your skin color because God created us all equal and thank God our Constitution affirms that.”

“He was a president that wanted every single person to achieve and that’s why we supported him. That’s why I’ve always supported him. And when I tell you Republican voters support him still. The party is his. It doesn’t belong to anybody else,” Greene said.

WATCH:

The House voted on Thursday 230-199 to remove Greene from the House Education and Budget committees. Every Democrat and 11 House Republicans voted for Greene’s removal.

Greene has repeatedly insisted that Trump was the 2020 election winner and voiced support for multiple conspiracy theories, including QAnon and that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton secured a Senate spot in New York through orchestrating John F. Kennedy Jr.’s killing.

Donald Trump Jr. And Eric Greitens Have A Message For Liberals While Shooting Firearms,"Donald Trump Jr. and Republican Missouri Senate candidate Eric Greitens had a message for liberals while shooting firearms in a campaign video released Monday.

The video, titled “Striking fear into the hearts of liberals, RINOs, and the fake media,” began with the two shooting the firearms at an outdoor gun range. “Striking fear into the hearts of liberals everywhere, folks,” Trump said. The footage transitioned to the two firing handguns at the range.

“Liberals, beware,” Greitens said.

WATCH:

Greitens, the former governor of Missouri, has come under fire after his ex-wife, Sheena, publicly accused him of physically abusing their young children in an affidavit related to their divorce proceedings. His ex alleged the violence was so severe that family and associates attempted to limit his access to firearms. (RELATED: Vicky Hartzler Scores Another Endorsement As Frontrunner Loses Momentum)

The candidate initially led the Senate primary race against Rep. Vicky Hartzler and state Attorney General Eric Schmitt but has faded in the race in recent weeks since the allegations arose. Hartzler and Greitens are now neck and neck in the race with the representative standing at 24.9% and Greitens with 24.3%, according to a March Trafalgar Group poll.

Hartzler appears to be narrowly leading the race by one point, according to RealClear Politics.

Greitens resigned from his gubernatorial seat in May 2018 over scandals alleging sexual misconduct and misusing a campaign donor list.

"Germany Mocked Trump. Four Years Later, He’s Proven Right","Former President Donald Trump warned Germany in 2018 about relying on Russian oil and was laughed at by the German delegation. Four years later, Trump was proven right as Germany fears a massive gas shortage.

Speaking at the 73rd U.N. General Assembly, Trump criticized Germany for relying on Russian oil exports.

“Reliance on a single foreign supplier can leave a nation vulnerable to extortion and intimidation. That is why we congratulate European states, such as Poland, for leading the construction of a Baltic pipeline so that nations are not dependent on Russia to meet their energy needs,” Trump said. “Germany will become totally dependent on Russian energy if it does not immediately change course.”

The camera then panned to the German delegation. Many members appeared to be laughing. (RELATED: Massive Oil Refinery On Track To Shut Down Amid Fuel Supply Shortages, Record Prices)

It wasn’t the first time Trump warned Germany about energy dependence, making similar comments during a 2018 meeting with German and NATO leaders.

“It’s very sad when Germany makes a massive oil and gas deal with Russia. Where, you’re supposed to be guarding against Russia and Germany goes out and pays billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia,” Trump said. “So we’re supposed to protect you against Russia, but they’re paying billions of dollars to Russia, and I think that’s very inappropriate.”

“Germany is totally controlled by Russia because they will be getting 60-70% of their energy from Russia and a new pipeline, and you tell me if that’s appropriate, and I think it’s not,” Trump continued.

Russia is set to temporarily shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for maintenance. Some fear the shutdown could be permanent, according to CNBC. Officials are worried that the worldwide gas squeeze will only get worse as European nations in particular struggle to fill the gas gap.

If Russia doesn’t turn the pipeline on “after maintenance because President Putin plays games or wants to hit Europe while it hurts, then the plan to fill up gas storage by the end of summer will probably not work,” Director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group Henning Gloystein told CNBC.

German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said Russia plans to curb supply as a “political decision” meant to drive up the price of gas, according to CNBC.

Germany recently declared that it moved to the second “alert level” of its emergency gas plan, which means the nation is concerned about long-term gas supply shortages, according to CNBC.

“We mustn’t delude ourselves: cutting gas supplies is an economic attack on us by [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” Habeck said, according to CNBC. “We defend ourselves against this. But it will be a rocky road that we as a country now have to walk. Even if you don’t really feel it yet: we are in a gas crisis.”

Habeck warned that gas prices will likely rise and “become a major burden for many consumers.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/07/06/germany-russia-oil-gas-pipeline-putin-dependence-donald-trump/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiA7O7d_rP9AhXsMVkFHVhFCU04ZBAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw0-eV71ooB8farT11QsUF4O,2022-07-06
PETER NAVARRO: A Sizzling Hot Trump VEEP Sweepstakes,"Pick your VP early boss! That’s a key piece of advice for President Trump from my new book “Taking Back Trump’s America,” and the stakes in this decision are particularly high.

A feckless Joe Biden has placed this nation on a collision course with everything from an unprecedented stagflation crisis and collateral financial market meltdown to a border invasion and possible nuclear confrontations with China or Russia. Only Trump-style leadership and policies can save us from what may become an irreversible American decline, and the November 2024 election can’t come soon enough.

Accordingly, the Republican Party must avoid at all costs any of the internecine warfare that often populates presidential primaries – and wounds standard bearers for the general election. An uncontested primary would eliminate such bloodshed; and the best guarantee of that is an unassailable – and invincible – Trump ticket.

First, and foremost, Trump’s VP must be not just MAGA-sympatico but a true populist economic nationalist cut from the same cloth as Trump. Two who should lead a list of prospective VP picks are former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

Pompeo weighs in with a heavy foreign policy advantage and clearly understands the existential threat that Communist China poses. DeSantis has shown courage and intelligence under pandemic fire. Of the two, DeSantis clearly wins the popularity contest with voters.

In the VP discussion, there is also talk of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. With no foreign policy experience, she might be far better suited at this stage in her career for a high-ranking cabinet secretary position.

As for those who definitely should not be in the VEEP sweepstakes, the boss has already and rightly ruled out Mike Pence—the et tu Brute RINO controlled by the Koch network, globalist, Party of Davos, Mitch McConnell, offshore our jobs, Wall Street wing of the Republican Party.

At the top of the rest of this no-fly zone list, there is the ever-dangerous Lean and Hungry Look Nikki “Cassius” Haley along with Ted Cruz, who may be a good “conservative” in the narrow sense but simply does not have MAGA in his DNA.

Likewise on the definitely not list should be the rising star of Virginia, Gov. Glenn Youngkin. While Youngkin may sound intriguing, one look at his globalist resume and ties to Wall Street offshoring predators like the Carlyle Group and McKinsey make Youngkin a non-starter.

In between the Big Yes possibilities and Certain Nos, we will also hear talk of candidates from the U.S. Senate like Josh Hawley and Tom Cotton. Hawley likely took himself out of contention with his gratuitous, Mitch McConnell-coordinated hit on Missouri senatorial candidate Eric Greitens in March of 2022.

Tom Cotton is as pure a China Hawk as they come and largely in tune with the Trump agenda. Here, Cotton’s one big slam directed at Trump was a sniper shot at the Trump-sponsored First Step legislation, which has led to the early release of thousands of criminals in Federal prisons.

Cotton ridiculed First Step as “soft on crime,” but that attack may actually win Cotton points with Trump since that legislation was a Made in Jared Kushner fiasco — and the boss knows it. Yet, I would far prefer Cotton as secretary of defense and designated Pentagon cleanser as he may lack the charisma and charm to campaign effectively as a vice president.

Last take: If DeSantis were to agree to the VP slot prior to the primary season, this single action would likely clear the entire Republican field. And by the way, Trump-DeSantis 2024 would likely be unstoppable.

DeSantis should see the wisdom of accepting such an offer from Trump as it would similarly clear the field for DeSantis in 2028 and usher in what would likely be the beginning of an eight-year run of DeSantis as president through 2036.

Memo to Ron: patience is as patience does. Memo to the boss: lead with intelligence and not your chin on this one. A Trump-DeSantis ticket would indeed be a juggernaut.

Special Counsel Investigating Trump Was Key Figure In IRS Targeting Scandal,"Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate former president Donald Trump’s possession of classified information, was a key figure in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)’s infamous targeting of conservative non-profits, according to a 2014 report by Republicans on the House Oversight Committee.

On Oct. 8, 2010, Smith, then-Chief of the DOJ Criminal Division’s Public Integrity Section at the time, called a meeting with former IRS official Lois Lerner “to discuss how the IRS could assist in the criminal enforcement of campaign-finance laws against politically active nonprofits,” according to testimony from Richard Pilger, then director of the section’s Election Crimes Branch and subordinate of Smith’s, to the Oversight Committee. Lerner eventually resigned from the IRS in 2015 following criticism of her targeting of conservative groups when denying or delaying tax-exempt status. (RELATED: Merrick Garland Announces Special Counsel For Mar-a-Lago, Jan. 6)

“This seems egregious to me – could we ever charge a [18 U.S.C. §] 371 conspiracy to violate laws of the USA for misuse of such non-profits to get around existing campaign finance laws + limits?,” Smith wrote in an email to colleagues, per the Oversight Committee report. His email suggested that the department investigate conservative non-profits that reportedly may have violated campaign finance laws, according to The New York Times.

The impetus for the meeting was President Barack Obama’s public criticism of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Citizens United v. FEC, according to the report.

Jack Smith has been a swamp creature forever. Read about him in this 2014 report on the IRS’s targeting of conservatives: https://t.co/u4AaAw6pzy https://t.co/BLU1nJiTIG pic.twitter.com/jrI5ibncYJ — House Judiciary GOP (@JudiciaryGOP) November 18, 2022

The Times’s article described how 501-registered charities, with ties to conservative lawmakers, were receiving donations from corporations and interest groups. At the time, these groups were also lobbying the same lawmakers on Capitol Hill, the Times writing that “The sponsors – AT&T, Chevron, General Dynamics, Morgan Stanley, Eli Lilly and dozens of others – contribute millions of dollars annually in gifts ranging from token amounts to a check for $5 million.”

Smith’s meeting with Lerner shortly followed the article. Smith also urged the IRS to be “more vigilant to the opportunities from more crime in the … 501(c)(4) area.”

IRS officials under Lerner were later involved in selecting groups with the words “tea party,” “patriot” or “9/12” in their names for audits, following Lerner’s meeting with Smith. The IRS’s scrutiny of non-profit 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) tax-exempt statuses applied for by these groups prevented them from fully participating in the 2012 presidential election between Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney, as admitted by the agency in 2013.

Lerner later resigned from the IRS and pled the 5th Amendment when questioned about her actions by the Oversight Committee, which led to her being held in contempt of Congress. However, Smith and his team had “serious conflicts of interest stemming from their interaction with the IRS,” the report alleged.

Smith was also a leader in the prosecution of former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia on federal corruption charges in 2014, for accepting gifts from a lobbyist that he later repaid. The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously reversed his conviction in 2016, and all charges were later dismissed, though commentators have argued that the conviction stopped him from running for president in 2016.

In 2010, Obama Attorney General Eric Holder picked Jack Smith to run Public Integrity Section. Smith took out VA Gov. Bob McDonnell as a potential Republican presidential candidate–on bogus corruption charges. Supreme Court reversed, 9-0. Now Smith is back–to take out Trump. — 🇺🇸 Mike Davis 🇺🇸 (@mrddmia) November 18, 2022

In his role as special counsel, Smith will oversee two investigations into Trump. One is regarding whether he or his affiliates “unlawfully interfered in the transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election,” per the order of appointment.

The other concerns Trump’s possession of classified information at his private Mar-a-Lago estate following the expiration of his term in violation of federal law, leading to a raid of Mar-a-Lago by the FBI on Aug. 8. (RELATED: Trump Says FBI Raided Mar-A-Lago)

Trump has alleged that the FBI unlawfully seized materials subject to attorney-client privilege, and sued to have the documents reviewed by a Special Master to judge whether or not they could be used in the DOJ’s criminal investigation of him, per court filings. Some legal commentators claim that Trump is likely to be indicted on criminal charges for possessing classified information as a private citizen.

“Based on recent developments, including the former President’s announcement that he is a candidate for President in the next election, and the sitting President’s stated intention to be a candidate as well, I have concluded that it is in the public interest to appoint a special counsel,” said Attorney General Garland, per a DOJ press release. Trump, for his part, has said that he “won’t partake” in the special counsel’s investigation.

Smith, Pilger and the Republican staff of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees did not respond to requests for comment.

Trump Campaign Reveals Plans For 2023,"Former President Donald Trump’s team announced their plans for 2023, laying out their “overwhelming” campaign strategy for the next presidential election.

The campaign is rolling out “top-level teams in early voting states” and expanding its “massive data operation” to “wage an overwhelming campaign that’s never been seen before,” the former president’s spokesperson, Steven Cheung, told the Daily Caller.

Trump officially announced his 2024 bid Nov. 15 at Mar-a-Lago. Since his announcement, Trump has attended events with the Republican Jewish Coalition, America First Policy Institute, Log Cabin Republicans and the 14th Annual President’s Conference of Torah Umesorah. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Trump To Attend RJC And AFPI Events After Campaign Announcement)

He also attended galas with American Freedom Tour and Helping a Hero, participated in the Georgia runoff tele-rally, conducted numerous interviews and video appearances, and met with members of Congress, Cheung said.

Trump has released videos on freedom of speech, the Omnibus and the Jan. 6 Committee’s final report, promising in his first video that he would ban the federal government from censoring the “lawful speech of American citizens” in one of his first acts.

“There will be more policy related events and President Trump will continue to lead on key issues like [he] has done on free speech and the border crisis in the past few weeks. Additionally, more print, on-camera, and radio interviews with the press have been scheduled so President Trump can lay out his vision for the campaign and highlight Joe Biden’s disastrous policies that have made America less safe and less prosperous,” Cheung said.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/02/donald-trump-campaign-strategy-presidential-election-speeches-interviews/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiA7O7d_rP9AhXsMVkFHVhFCU04ZBAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw3seeb5g-GOOslO-MmWEBRO,2023-01-02
VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: The Real Differences Between The Biden And Trump Document Troves,"Former President Donald Trump for now certainly seems to have had more documents labeled “classified” at Mar-a-Lago in Florida than did President Joe Biden at his various homes in Delaware.

Yet otherwise, the comparisons between the two cases, contrary to popular punditry, hardly favor Biden.

First, a stranger would face a far greater challenge entering a post-presidential Mar-a-Lago than a pre-presidential Biden home, office, or garage – or who knows where?

Secret service agents and private security were stationed at Mar-a-Lago. Prior to the 2020 presidential election they were not at citizen Biden’s various troves for most of 2017-2020, much less prior to 2009.

Second, we seem to forget that for much of the developing controversy, Biden’s own team was investigating Biden.

On the other hand, the Biden Administration’s Justice Department and the FBI were not just investigating Trump as an outside party, but as a former president – and possible 2024 presidential candidate and opponent of Biden himself.

Remember, the narrative of the first Democratic impeachment of Trump was the allegation that Trump had used his powers of the presidency to investigate Biden and his family, a likely 2020 challenger to Trump’s reelection bid.

Third, no one in a position of government authority had passed judgment on Biden’s alleged security violations.

That was not the case of the still alleged violations of Trump.

Biden, as president, had weighed in, during his own Justice Department’s ongoing investigations of Trump. Indeed, he proclaimed the former president to be guilty: “How could anyone be that irresponsible?” In contrast, he also dismissed the ongoing investigation of himself with “There is no there, there.”

Fourth, Trump is certainly right that as president he had a far more substantial claim of declassification rights than did Biden who took the papers out either as a senator or vice president.

Fifth, the FBI was not merely asymmetrical in melodramatically raiding the Trump home while allowing Biden lawyers to inspect various Biden stashes. The FBI also leaked the purported contents of the subjects of the Trump classified documents (falsely spreading the lie of “nuclear codes” and “nuclear secrets”) in a way it has not with the Biden cache.

The FBI went so far as to scatter the documents on the floor for a fake news photo-op as if the papers were so messily arrayed when they arrived.

So far, the FBI has come lightly and belatedly to the Biden case without the SWAT team get-up, and only under pressure from the public and the Republican opposition.

Six, Biden did not “self-report.” Biden’s team did not call the relevant government authorities the minute they discovered the classified documents in Biden’s office and home and garage.

In truth, Biden, or someone close to Biden, certainly knew that he or someone close to him had illegally removed classified documents when he left the vice presidency in 2017 – or years earlier as a senator.

For at least the last six years – at least – Biden has felt no compunction to confess to authorities he illegally was in possession of classified documents.

Indeed, the only reason the current troves are coming to light was apparent White House paranoia that the media, the Biden Justice Department, and the special counsel were so fixated on the Trump documents that they likely feared someone might raise the logical question of whether a hypocritical Biden himself might be guilty of exactly the crime for which they were pursuing Trump.

Worse, Biden and his staff knew classified documents were in his possession before the midterms, but deliberately suppressed that information until after the elections were over.

Seventh, Trump’s documents were stored only at one place – Mar-a-Lago, and only for about 19 months. Biden’s were stashed at various locations for nearly seven years, or perhaps over a decade. There were far more opportunities of time and space for those without security clearances to have access to the Biden documents than to the Trump files.

Eighth, the press has exhaustively speculated, usually wrongly, about how the documents reached Mar-a-Lago and what they contained. In contrast, no one knows or even asks why Biden took classified documents, what they concerned, or who if any in his family circle had access to them.

Ninth, Trump’s documents did not expose other liabilities of the constantly investigated Trump. The Biden files so far have directed attention to the mysterious tens of millions of dollars in Communist Chinese money that poured into Biden’s think tank at the University of Pennsylvania, the proximity of members of the quid pro quo Biden consortium to these classified papers, and the files’ relevance, if any, to the Biden family’s overseas businesses.

Did Hunter Biden ever consult or view classified documents while living in a home with them? Will there be fingerprint or DNA tests on the documents? If Hunter consulted any of these classified documents, then the Biden presidency is finished.

Tenth, Trump possessed contested documents as a private citizen. Biden’s files under contention involve the current behavior of the president of the United States. Biden ran for office, was elected, and serves as president with the full knowledge that during all this time he unlawfully possessed classified documents.

Trump Unveils Plan To ‘Save’ Education From ‘Radical Left Maniacs’,"Former President Donald Trump announced Thursday his plan to “save American education” from “the Radical Left maniacs” as part of his 2024 presidential campaign.

The plan, provided to the Daily Caller News Foundation, focuses on tackling cultural issues in education including critical race theory (CRT) and gender ideology. Trump proposed cutting federal funding from schools that promote “[CRT], gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto our children,” the investigation of schools which engage in “race-based discrimination,” and keeping men out of women’s sports. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Trump’s Education Secretary Has A Plan To Stop Woke Brainwashing In Schools)

Trump also made several proposals on reforms he would make in K-12 classrooms, which include going after “Marxis[t]” content that is “hostile to Judeo-Christian teachings.” He said that Marxism resembles “an established new religion” and promised to “aggressively pursue potential violations of the establishment clause and the free exercise clause of the Constitution,” according to a video explaining the plan.

NEW VIDEO: President Trump’s Plan to Save American Education and Give Power Back to Parents pic.twitter.com/aizxaRXIM3 — Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) January 26, 2023

Trump also promised to “remove the radical zealots and Marxists who have influenced the Federal Department of Education” and have them “fired and escorted from the building.” He said these employees know “who [they] are” and that President Joe Biden gave them “unchecked power.”

Other promises included the hiring of teachers who express “patriotic values” and funding for schools which adopt several reform efforts. The reforms include abolishing tenure for K-12 teachers, cutting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) funding, adopting a “parental bill of rights” to boost “curriculum transparency” and school choice and adopting a system where parents can elect school principals.

“It’s all about the parents for their children. More than anyone else, parents know what their children need. If any principal is not getting the job done, the parents should be able to fire them and select one who will,” he said.

Trump announced his presidential bid in November, making him the first candidate to publicly toss his name into the hat for the 2024 presidential election. The campaign marks his third consecutive run for the highest office.

“As the saying goes, ‘personnel is policy,’ and at the end of the day if we have pink-haired communists teaching our kids, we have a major problem,” Trump said. “When I’m president we will put parents back in charge and give them the final say. We will get back to teaching reading, writing and math … and we will give our kids the high quality, pro-American education they deserve.”

We Now Know What Trump’s ‘Wall’ Is For 2024,"Former President Donald Trump tested out his new education policy plan in the first two events of his 2024 presidential campaign on Saturday, receiving applause and fervor from the audience much like that of his 2016 campaign pledge of building the wall.

Trump’s speeches in New Hampshire and South Carolina included other policies, such as securing the border and reforming the military, but the loudest applause in New Hampshire rang for Trump’s focus on giving parents greater power over education, according to Politico’s Meridith McGraw. (RELATED: ‘I’m More Angry Now’: Trump Kicks Off 2024 Campaign In New Hampshire And South Carolina)

The loudest applause lines during Trump’s speech in NH so far were for fighting culture war issues, esp. his plan to “eliminate federal funding for any school that pushes Critical Race Theory or left-wing gender ideology” and “direct election of school principals by the parents” — Meridith McGraw (@meridithmcgraw) January 28, 2023

The audience’s response to Trump’s education policies — which appear to be inspired by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin — may lead the former president to hone in on the culture war hot spot going forward. Trump’s 2016 campaign focus on “building the wall” at the southern border was solidified after large audience responses at his rallies.

The education policy plan, first announced in a video released Thursday, would cut federal funding for schools that impose “critical race theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto our children.” Trump’s plan also calls for “abolishing tenure” for K-12 teachers, cutting the number of Diversity Equity and Inclusion administrators, “adopting a parental bill of rights” featuring complete curriculum transparency and allowing parents to elect principals.

“As the saying goes, personnel is policy, and at the end of the day, if we have pink-haired communists teaching our kids, we have a major problem. When I’m president we will put parents back in charge,” Trump said in the policy video.

DeSantis announced plans to codify Florida’s state-wide ban of critical race theory (CRT) in December of 2021. The legislation, entitled the “Stop WOKE Act,” provides employees, parents, and students a private right to sue individuals and school districts that fail to comply with the state ban.

Youngkin, who won the Virginia governorship in part due to his focus on parental rights in schools, has rescinded several CRT programs in the state and banned teachers from socially transitioning children without parental consent.

Both Youngkin and DeSantis may challenge Trump on their education policies if the governors toss in a bid for the 2024 presidential race.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/29/we-now-know-what-trumps-wall-is-2024-education-policy/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiosL7c_rP9AhVYLFkFHSkqCx44UBAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw2HfDT4tTAWGG9qllXlwBUK,2023-01-29
DeSantis Responds To Trump Attacks,"Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis responded to former President Donald Trump criticizing him for his COVID-19 response Tuesday. He said he has “people attacking” him from “all angles” and that the verdict is ultimately up to the “people.”

“Trump has criticized you a number of times in the past couple of days on a number of different issues, one of them being COVID in the state,” Daily Caller chief national correspondent Henry Rodgers asked DeSantis at a press conference on education.

“I roll out of bed, I have people attacking me from all angles,” DeSantis responded. “It’s been happening for many, many years. And if you look at the good thing about it, though, is like if you take a crisis situation like COVID, you know, the good thing about it is when you’re an elected executive, you gotta make all kinds of decisions. You gotta steer that ship, and the good thing is that the people are able to render a judgement on whether they reelect you or not.”

“I’m happy to say, you know, in my case, not only did we win reelection, we won with the highest percentage of the vote that any Republican candidate has in the history of the state of Florida,” DeSantis added. “That verdict has been rendered by the people of the state of Florida.”

On Saturday and Sunday, Trump issued multiple attacks on DeSantis’ handling of COVID-19 and his shutting down of Florida’s beaches. The former president has also labeled the governor “DeSanctimonious,” and has said that a DeSantis presidential run in 2024 would be bad for the “base.” (RELATED: Trump Calls DeSantis An ‘Average’ Governor, Says He Was ‘Politically Dead’ Before Endorsing Him)

Trump Reveals What A ‘Reformed FBI And Justice Department’ Would Do If He Wins In 2024,"Former President Donald Trump said Friday that if he returned to the White House, a “reformed FBI and Justice Department” would be “hunting down Chinese spies,” not Republicans.

“As president, I established a special initiative at the Department of Justice tasked with the sole mission of targeting Chinese espionage in the United States. Joe Biden terminated that program right away, suggesting that it was somehow racist,” Trump said in the video. “According to published reports, this came shortly after 160 faculty members of the University of Pennsylvania, where I went to school, the Wharton School of Finance, home of the now infamous Biden Center, wrote to Merrick Garland and demanded that the Chinese espionage initiative be shut down immediately.” (RELATED: ‘This Is Really Egregious’: Former Trump Nat Sec Official Slams Biden Admin’s Inaction On Chinese Spy Balloon)

The Department of Justice terminated the China Initiative Feb. 23, 2022, following complaints from the Chinese Communist Party, left-wing activists, academics, Democratic politicians and organizations that it was racist. Trump released the video a day after the Department of Defense revealed that it was tracking a Chinese spy balloon over Montana, where Malmstrom Air Force Base, which houses the 341st Missile Wing, is located.

WATCH:

Trump called for the balloon to be shot down in a post on Truth Social.

“I took the most dramatic action of any administration to curtail China’s ability to conduct espionage in the United States,” Trump said. “And when I’m back in the White House, those efforts will be expanded in a very, very big way. Instead of hunting down Republicans, a reformed FBI and Justice Department will be hunting down Chinese spies. We will create new partnerships with businesses and universities to give them the tools to protect themselves from insider threats.”

Trump also noted the presence of Chinese police stations in the United States. One in New York was shut down following a raid by the FBI last fall.

“The FBI even recently admitted that China operates a secret police force on American soil. How do you like that one?” Trump said. “Imposing the iron fist of the Communist Party, the rule, think of this, the Communist Party rule on Chinese nationals in the United States, just think about that. We will shut that down and we will shut it down cold.”

Trump’s Defense Sec. Pushes Back Against Claim Chinese Balloon Flew During Trump Admin,"Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper pushed back Friday against the claim that a Chinese surveillance balloon flew over the United States during the Trump administration.

The Department of Defense (DoD) is tracking a suspected high-altitude Chinese surveillance balloon that appears to be collecting data on sensitive U.S. sites over Montana. The state is home to the Malmstrom Air Force Base, which houses Minuteman III nuclear missiles.

The DoD released a statement Thursday night claiming that “instances of this kind of balloon activity have been observed previously over the past several years.”

The DoD has not specified when these other instances occurred, but CNN’s Kaitlan Collins — who previously worked for the Daily Caller — alleged that one instance occurred during the Trump administration, prompting a shocked response from Esper.

“Yesterday we heard from the Pentagon and they say that this has happened before, during the last administration when you were defense secretary during that time period,” Collins said. “Were you aware of this? How was it resolved? What can you tell us about that?”

“I read that,” said Esper, who served as defense secretary from July 2019 through Nov. 2020. “I was surprised. I don’t ever recall somebody coming into my office or reading anything that the Chinese had a surveillance balloon above the United States.”

“You would, obviously, know that if that had happened when you were defense secretary?” Collins asked. (RELATED: ‘Is He Spaced Out?’: Jesse Watters Asks Why Trudeau ‘Didn’t Give’ A ‘Warning’ About Suspected Chinese Spy Balloon)

“I would remember that for sure,” Esper said. “My focus was on implementing the national defense strategy to take on the Chinese as the greatest strategic threat facing our country.”

“I was keen on everything Chinese,” he continued. “We set up a red cell within the Pentagon to deal with it, we reoriented the military’s doctrine and how we train and fight. All these things focused on the Chinese. I would be curious as to why Chinese surveillance balloons were flying over the United States. That would have caught my attention for sure. I don’t recall it ever happening.”

Esper said shooting down the balloon would send a “strong message” but that he would personally be interested in bringing it down rather than shooting it down so that officials can “capture the equipment and understand what they are doing.”

China has since claimed that the balloon is a weather balloon that blew off course.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/03/mark-esper-denies-knowing-chinese-balloon-flew-over-us-under-donald-trump/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjgsdjb_rP9AhX3FVkFHV4KCsM4RhAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw3-8ctNJ8S29bjCMkOsn4vD,2023-02-03
"EXCLUSIVE: Melania Trump Played Leading Role In Situation Room During Baghdadi Operation, New Book Reveals","Then-first lady Melania Trump sat in one of the Situation Room’s most important chairs during the killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and offered former President Donald Trump advice after the attack, former acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller reveals in his new book.

Melania Trump’s presence in the Situation Room was “unexpected,” and she entered as the president’s executive team was “waiting for the final assault” on al-Baghdadi, Miller wrote, according to an excerpt exclusively obtained by the Daily Caller.

“Secretary of Defense Mark Esper quickly gave up his seat and she sat down next to the President, who introduced her to us as if we didn’t know who she was. Her presence was unexpected, to say the least. I wondered how it would play in the press if word got out that the First Lady had popped in to watch a major military operation. Not my problem, I figured. And after all, it was her house,” Miller wrote in “Soldier Secretary: Warnings from the Battlefield & the Pentagon about America’s Most Dangerous Enemies,” set to hit shelves Feb. 7.

The first lady’s presence in the Situation Room has never been reported before. A photo released by the White House shows that Donald Trump was accompanied by Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, Vice President Mike Pence, National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley.

Miller, who was the senior director for the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) at the time of al-Baghdadi’s death, is not pictured in the photo. Counterterrorism officials, however, have a precedent of being in the Situation Room during counterterrorism operations, including during the deaths of Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri.

Miller’s book offers insights to his time in the Trump administration leading up to the Jan. 6 riot, his three decades of military service, and what has happened to America’s military since 9/11.

Miller claims Donald Trump asked Brig. Gen. Marcus Evans, deputy director for special operations on the Joint Staff, to bring the first lady “up to speed.”

After a discussion about what may happen, Evans told the group that the U.S. “assault force had unleashed their combat dog” into the building with al-Baghdadi, “with our commandos close behind,” Miller wrote. Al-Baghdadi was cornered and detonated a suicide vest, killing himself, his two children, and two of his wives.

“The assault force commander wouldn’t declare ‘Jackpot’—the code word announcing that Baghdadi was dead—until the body was inspected. They would also take some tissue to check for a DNA match once they got back to friendly territory. [Then-deputy national security advisor Matt] Pottinger and I knew that some poor kid was searching through the dust-and smoke-shrouded rubble with his helmet-mounted lamp and handheld flashlight, trying to find Baghdadi’s head,” according to Miller.

Miller recounts how Donald Trump then asked the group what would happen to the bodies, to which Milley responded that he would be buried at sea. Donald Trump pressed Milley on what would happen to the “two women” who were killed, and Milley suggested the bodies could be left there, according to Miller.

“Don’t you think ISIS will parade their bodies around and make it look like they were innocent?” Donald Trump asked, Miller wrote.

Evans then called U.S. Central Command and whispered in Milley’s ear, and Milley said that a “barrage of missiles would pulverize the building” where the operation took place, the book states.

Donald Trump asked the team how he should address the American people about the operation, according to Miller.

Melania Trump, to Miller’s surprise, “took over.”

“You should talk about the dog,” she said, Miller wrote. “Everyone loves dogs.” (RELATED: ‘GREAT JOB’ — President Trump Declassifies Photo Of Dog Involved In Killing ISIS Leader)

Donald Trump agreed.

He brought Conan the dog to the White House and gave him an award, saying he did “such a great job in capturing and killing the leader of ISIS.”

There’s One Clear Way Trump Can Stand Out From His 2024 Rivals,"The Republican primary field for 2024 is already crowded, and qualified candidates are finding ways to stand out from the crowd. For some potential candidates, it could be that they have a proven state-level track record of enacting conservative policy wins. For others, it may be their experience both as a conservative governor and as part of a White House administration. While Donald Trump has never wanted for uniqueness on the political scene, there’s a particular policy issue he could stress as a way to stand out against other candidates, potential or declared.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/13/donald-trump-foreign-policy-ron-desantis-nikki-haley-2024-ukraine/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiPwtPX_rP9AhVmRTABHTJ0BFc4ChAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw3hLR3R0JBZzKj1RrQIgTNM,2023-02-13
Trump Is The Clear Favorite In GOP Primary: POLL,"Former President Donald Trump is the frontrunner in a potential GOP primary, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is the likely runner-up, according to a recent poll.

"Trump Delivers Fiery Presidents Day Speech In West Palm Beach, Group Of Supporters Change Name To ‘Club 47 USA’","WEST PALM BEACH, FL — Former President Donald Trump delivered a fiery Presidents Day speech to a group of his supporters just minutes away from Mar-a-Lago. The event was hosted by Club 45 USA, which is a corporation started by his supporters for Trump’s reelection campaign.

Ahead of the speech, the group announced they would be changing the name of the club to “Club 47 USA.” The group of supporters started lining up hours before his speech. Lines wrapped around the corners surrounding the Hilton Hotel near the airport and the club eventually had to close the doors for the hundreds of other supporters who were in line to attend Trump’s speech.

The overflow crowd watched Trump’s remarks from outside the Hilton ballroom and cheered throughout the speech.

Trump’s speech touched on multiple issues including transgender athletes, his potential presidential race opponents and election integrity.

“We will keep men the hell out of women’s sports,” Trump said.

During Trump’s speech, he took shots at Gov. Ron DeSantis and his recent crowd sizes, again referring to the Florida governor by “Ron DeSanctimonious.” Trump further touted that he received more votes than DeSantis in Florida and took the opportunity to comment on election integrity.

“Wouldn’t it be lovely if we had one day voting … I think every Republican governor should be demanding that right now … All paper ballots, voter ID,” he added.

Inside the venue, there was a cash bar that served beer, wine, and cocktails. Trump was also selling his book. Donald Trump Jr. showed up hours early to take photos and sign copies of his father’s book. The crowd was mostly wearing red, white, and blue with hundreds of attendees also wearing Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” hats.

Trump ended his speech by taking multiple questions from his supporters, the first one was in reference to his upcoming trip to Palestine, Ohio, where a derailment of a train led to a spill of toxic chemicals.

"Trump To Donate Water, Cleaning Supplies During Trip To East Palestine","Former President Donald Trump is going to donate pallets of water and cleaning supplies to East Palestine on Wednesday during his in-person trip to the Ohio city facing toxic chemical concerns.

Trump will be joined by East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway, Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, Republican Ohio Rep. Bill Johnson, Ohio state Rep. Monica Robb-Blasdel, and Ohio state Sen. Michael Rulli, as well as other statewide and local officials, county commissioners, and public safety officials, Trump’s spokesperson Steven Cheung told the Daily Caller.

Trump had previously announced the trip, but did not reveal his exact plans.

A Norfolk Southern train carrying toxic chemicals derailed near East Palestine on Feb. 3, prompting evacuations and shelter-in-place orders for the city with approximately 5,000 people. Officials have said it’s safe for residents to return to the town and that the air and water are safe, but residents have expressed skepticism and have called on the federal government to do more. (RELATED: Trump To Visit Ohio Town After Toxic Train Derailment)

The mayor of East Palestine criticized President Joe Biden for not making a trip to the city on Monday.

“He can send every agency he wants to, but I found out this morning that he was in Ukraine giving millions of dollars away to people over there and not to us … on Presidents’ Day in our country, so I’m furious,” Conaway said.

Trump also directly called out Biden for not announcing plans to visit the city.

“Biden and FEMA said they would not be sending federal aid to East Palestine. As soon as I announced that I’m going, he announced a team will go. Hopefully he will also be there. This is good news because we got them to ‘move.’ The people of East Palestine need help. I’ll see you on Wednesday!” Trump posted Saturday on Truth Social.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/22/trump-donate-water-cleaning-supplies-trip-east-palestine/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjlufXY_rP9AhW7KlkFHZ5uAw04HhAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw1zRbkeguNhUdKjuCqZe6Qj,2023-02-22
‘We’re Like A Third World Nation’: Trump Hammers Pete Buttigieg Over Handling Of Toxic Train Derailment,"Former President Donald Trump hammered Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg Wednesday afternoon and during his visit to eastern Ohio, where a train derailment early February spilled toxic chemicals into the air and water.

Trump visited East Palestine on Wednesday to speak with local residents and deliver pallets of water and cleaning supplies to the community more than two weeks after a Norfolk Southern trail derailed and a controlled burn released hazardous chemicals into the air to prevent an explosion. Trump denied that rail deregulations during his administration were relevant to the crash and said that the US is like a “third world country” and “breaking down” under Buttigieg’s leadership, according to a video filmed by the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: Trump To Visit Ohio Town After Toxic Train Derailment)

“He should have been here a long time ago,” Trump said. “Now he was supposed to come today but he heard I was coming today and postponed it, but whenever he comes he’s got to do his job and if we didn’t come, they never would have come.”

Buttigieg is scheduled to be in East Palestine tomorrow, 20 days after the initial derailment, Politico reported. He came under fire for his slow response to the disaster after he posted a Twitter thread 10 days after it occurred.

Trump denied allegations that his administration’s deregulation of railroad safety policies could have contributed to the derailment.

“It had nothing to do with it,” Trump said when pressed about his administration’s policy on rail regulations. “No, he’s got to work on the airports and we’ve never had airports like this. We’re like a third world nation and this is an example of it … our whole country is breaking down.”

Trump made a quick appearance outside an East Palestine restaurant Wednesday afternoon, where he met with residents lined down the street to welcome him. East Palestine voted heavily for Trump during the 2020 election, USA Today reported.

Residents told the DCNF that they were frustrated with President Biden’s recent visit to Ukraine. Trump said at the restaurant that “it’s terrible” he has not visited the village.

‘That’s Who You Voted For’: Joy Behar Says East Palestine Deserved Train Derailment For Supporting Trump,"“The View” co-host Joy Behar suggested East Palestine residents got what they deserved with the Norfolk Southern trail derailment because they supported President Donald Trump.

A train carrying toxic chemicals derailed Feb. 3 near East Palestine, Ohio, prompting evacuations and shelter-in-place orders throughout the town. Officials have said it is safe for residents to return to the town and that the air and water are safe as well, although residents have expressed skepticism and asked the federal government to do more in the aftermath of the crisis.

Co-host Sunny Hostin said she appreciated that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg did not visit the site of the derailment until Feb. 23, arguing it only would have been for a “photo-op” while investigations into the incident were still underway. The rest of the panel discussed the lack of clean water and possible after-effects of the spill.

The panel then began talking about regulations before discussing Trump’s visit to the town Wednesday. Co-host Sara Haines defended Trump bringing “Trump” water, saying all supplies are needed. (RELATED: Scarborough Rips Trump’s Visit To Ohio, Says Biden Is ‘Risking His Life’ In Ukraine)

“One thing I just want to say is I do think this was an unforced error by President Biden. It was 20 days before we had Secretary Buttigieg go down, 10 days before he put out a statement acknowledging it,” co-host Alyssa Farah-Griffin said. “This is Trump country. He won by 40 points. He is a president for all Americans, I believe that, but he needs to show that he is. It was time for him to be there.”

“I don’t know why they would ever vote for [Trump], for somebody who, by the way, he placed someone with deep ties to the chemical industry in charge of the EPA’s chemical safety office. That’s who you voted for, in that district,” Behar said, looking directly into the camera. “Donald Trump, who reduces all safety, he did!”

“I think this is Donald Trump’s fault,” Hostin said.

“It’s his fault, and then he shows up,” Behar said.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/23/joy-behar-east-palestine-trump-voters-train-derailment/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjlufXY_rP9AhW7KlkFHZ5uAw04HhAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw07h_EQ5-wzVtoKgjOoDmsW,2023-02-23
DeSantis Leads Trump By A Large Margin In California As Primary Race Kicks Off: POLL,"Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis holds a majority lead over former President Donald Trump among California Republicans, according to a recent poll.

Out of 11 candidate choices, 37% of respondents support Desantis and 29% support Trump, resulting in a 8% spread between the politicians, according to the UC Berkeley and Institute of Governmental Studies (IGS) poll released Friday. The results show a change from August poll results, where Trump led DeSantis 38% to 27%. (RELATED: ‘Not Forgotten’: Ohioans Praise Trump For Visiting Their Town After Toxic Train Derailment, Rip Biden’s Ukraine Trip)

“With Republicans in control of the House, President Biden may have an easier time rallying Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, who now see him as standing up to the opposition rather than struggling to navigate his programs through a Democratic-controlled Congress when expectations were higher,” IGS co-director Eric Schickler said in the poll release.

The nine other Republican candidate choices on the poll survey received minimal support, according to the poll. The closest candidate was former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who received support from 6% of respondents.

DeSantis hasn’t launched an official campaign, but the two politicians have sparred over the last few months, with Trump mocking DeSantis by calling him “Ron DeSanctimonious” at a November rally. DeSantis appeared to respond to Trump’s remarks while speaking to a reporter in November, saying that you take “incoming fire” when you are getting things done.

In a national poll released Friday, DeSantis received support from 57% of respondents, while Trump only received support from 33%.

“It’s hard to see Trump losing with even four semi-serious candidates in the race. Even three, I would bet Trump,” a former Trump aide reportedly told ABC News. “You start getting beyond three to four candidates running, it’s basically impossible for him to lose.”
