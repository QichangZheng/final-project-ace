A big f#%king deal: Vice President Joe Biden has perfect NCAA bracket,"Vice President Joe Biden’s NCAA basketball bracket is still flawless going into the Final Four, a feat that none of the other 5.5 million participants in this year’s online bracket competitions has even come close to achieving, sources within the White House confirmed late Wednesday to The Daily Caller.

The odds of accurately predicting the March basketball tournament are so small, statisticians tell us, that that even if everyone alive filled out a different bracket, it would be highly unlikely for one to successfully pick the right teams to make the Final Four.

Biden first filled out the bracket, which he eventually submitted to NBC Sports’ $50 buy-in online Bracket Challenge game, on a handkerchief during last year’s Beer Summit at the White House. The July 30 summit that brought together feuding Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates and police officer James Crowley occurred well before the teams that would play in the March tournament were even finalized.

“Oh, that makes a lot more sense,” Gates said in a somber interview with news affiliate KCBS this morning, when told of Biden’s bracket. “That whole time when we were drinking and he was talking about Butler, I thought he was referring to me.”

He added, “God damn, I just finished a book on racism in the White House. Really wish you guys told me this earlier.”

The White House said it had not informed the public that Biden has a perfect bracket for fear that his Final Four picks will turn out to be incorrect. Top administration officials, who just recently announced a major proposal to expand offshore oil drilling, reaffirmed on Wednesday that they would have preferred the perfect bracket stay a secret.

“Joe’s a lot like Eric Massa,” complained White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emmanuel, who has spent time in the showers with both men. “I wouldn’t want to be alone in a secret bunker with either one of the bastards.”

Despite the apparent discord in the White House, industry heavy-hitters say that secrets are hard to keep when you’re always in the public eye.

NBC Universal CEO Jeff Zucker confirmed during an interview in his New York office that even the most carefully laid plans that have been pondered for years can “really blow up in your face if you’re not careful.”

When told the vice president was the one holding the only flawless bracket in his company’s NCAA competition, Zucker and his assistant, a twenty-something named Jonathan, were visibly stunned.

“We’re working on a sequel to ‘Deal or No Deal,’” Zucker said, enthusiastically pointing to concept drawings for the new show hanging on his office wall as ideas clearly raced through his head. “Maybe we could get Biden to host it, when he leaves office.”

Jonathan nodded approvingly, typing every word his boss spoke into his Blackberry. “Good idea, sir.”

Zucker pressed on. “What could we call it?”

“’Big Fucking Deal or No Big Fucking Deal?’”

“I like it. Write it down,” Zucker responded quickly. “This could be huge.”

Almost as big a story as the vice president’s bracket, though, is how the White House was able to keep it a secret for so long.

“Joe’s been riding Amtrak all over the country to watch tournament games in different venues,” President Obama said in a speech two weeks ago, spilling the beans on Biden’s obsession with March Madness. ” He’s really just one of the regular folk, paying the usual $43 each way for his commute to work.”

Top White House adviser David Axelrod said that the administration got lucky when an autistic teenager drew headlines last week for having a perfect bracket and distracted attention from the vice president.

“Reporters, you know, they were closing in on Joe’s bracket,” Axelrod told The Daily Caller. “But then an autistic teenager, Alex Harman, comes along, and he’s called every game right, too.”

“Now, you guys are journalists,” Axelrod said as he folded the morning newspaper. “Would you rather do a big story on an autistic kid, or Joe Biden?”

BREAKING 7:05 A.M.: A thorough comparison of Joe Biden’s bracket to the one submitted by Harmon, conducted by The Daily Caller and verified by numerous media outlets, reveals that a large amount of the vice president’s bracket was, in fact, plagiarized.

“The picks were not the vice president’s,” White House spokesman Robert Gibbs confirmed today in an e-mail to the White House press pool. “Mr. Biden was not aware that it is inappropriate to plagiarize another fan’s bracket and regrets the error.”

The political fallout from the vice president’s decision to gamble on a major sporting event, and then to copy someone else’s bracket without attribution, is still uncertain. But at least some experts are suggesting things aren’t as bad as they appear.

“Look, it’s the Final Four,” a source who has it out for the Republican National Committee told The Daily Caller. “Biden will survive this. Basketball’s a bonding experience, not a bondage experience.”

Three More Women Share Their Alleged Experiences With Joe Biden After His Semi-Apology Video,"Three more women stepped forward Wednesday describing their experiences with former Vice President Joe Biden that left them feeling uncomfortable.

A former White House intern, a former congressional aide and a woman who was invited to the Oscars because of her experience with sexual assault told The Washington Post about their interactions with Biden.

Seven women have now come forward with concerns about Biden’s “intimate style” ahead of his anticipated 2020 presidential campaign launch, according to WaPo. (RELATED: Joe Biden In 2018: ‘Nothing Justifies’ Touching A Woman ‘Without Her Consent’)

Biden approached Vail Kohnert-Yount in the West Wing basement to introduce himself while she was a White House intern in the spring of 2013.

“He then put his hand on the back of my head and pressed his forehead to my forehead while he talked to me. I was so shocked that it was hard to focus on what he was saying. I remember he told me I was a ‘pretty girl,'” Kohnert-Yount said in a statement to WaPo.

“I do not consider my experience to have been sexual assault or harassment,” Kohnert-Yount said. “But it was the kind of inappropriate behavior that makes many women feel uncomfortable and unequal in the workplace.”

Former Democratic staffer Ally Coll told WaPo that Biden squeezed her shoulders and held her “for a beat too long” while complimenting her smile during the 2008 election cycle. She now says his alleged actions were inappropriate. Coll currently heads the Purple Campaign, a nonprofit group that fights sexual harassment.

Sofie Karasek’s alleged experience was the most recent one told to WaPo. She met Biden at the Oscars in 2016. He had introduced a performance by Lady Gaga, who invited a group of more than 50 sexual assault victims, including Karasek, to share the stage with her.

Karasek said Biden grabbed her hands and touched his forehead to hers after she shared a story with him about a college student who had been sexually assaulted and died by suicide, according to WaPo. A photo of the forehead touch was posted and shared on social media with a positive spin, but Karasek said it felt like a violation of her personal space.

Biden posted a video Wednesday in which he said he’s learning how to respect another person’s personal space and brought up “changing” social norms. He “still didn’t take ownership in the way that he needs to,” Karasek told WaPo.

Former Democratic Nevada Assemblywoman Lucy Flores started a domino effect Friday when she accused Biden of sniffing her hair and kissing the back of her head without her consent in 2014. He was campaigning for her at the time.

Biden Attempts To Walk Back China’s ‘Not Competition’ Remarks,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Saturday clarified remarks he made about China not being an economic threat to the U.S. last week.

“I don’t suggest China is not a problem. I’m the guy who’s been the toughest on – I’ve spent more time with Xi Jinping than anybody else, just because the nature of my job,” Biden said during a fundraiser at the home of Richard “Dick” Harpootlian, an attorney and former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman in Columbia, South Carolina.

“He’s got problems, he’s got gigantic problems. Doesn’t mean he’s not a threat, doesn’t mean they’re not a threat,” Biden added.

Last Wednesday, while campaigning in Iowa, Biden argued that China, the world’s second-largest economy, was “not competition” for the United States. (RELATED: Biden Calls Trump A ‘Clown’ Before Saying He Won’t Get Into A Mud Fight With Him)

“China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man,” Biden said. “They can’t even figure out how to deal with the fact that they have this great division between the China Sea and the mountains in the east, I mean in the west.”

Biden continued, “They can’t figure out how they’re going to deal with the corruption that exists within the system. I mean, you know, they’re not bad folks, folks. But guess what, they’re not, they’re not competition for us.”

Although Biden made similar comments in the past, his Wednesday remarks drew rebukes from not just Republicans but also Democrats.

“It’s wrong to pretend that China isn’t one of our major economic competitors,” the Sanders campaign tweeted. “When we are in the White House we will win that competition by fixing our trade policies.”

Since the China trade deal I voted against, America has lost over 3 million manufacturing jobs. It’s wrong to pretend that China isn’t one of our major economic competitors. When we are in the White House we will win that competition by fixing our trade policies. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) May 2, 2019

Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan called Biden “stunningly out of touch.”

President Donald Trump campaigned on changing U.S. trade policy with China. This past week he attempted to compel the Asian country to strike a deal with his administration by doubling tariffs on $200 billion of China’s sales to the U.S.

Joe Biden’s Climate Plan Uses Nearly Identical Language As Other Sources,"Former Vice President Joe Biden’s climate plan appears to have used nearly identical language from other sources in at least five different passages.

Josh Nelson, co-director of environmentalist group CREDO Action, highlighted two instances where Biden’s campaign used the exact same language as left-wing nonprofits, without citations.

A subsequent review of Biden’s plan by The Daily Caller News Foundation identified three other examples of similarly phrased excerpts.

Biden: “Biden’s goal is to make CCUS a widely available, cost-effective, and rapidly scalable solution to reduce carbon emissions to meet mid-century climate goals.”

Carbon Capture Coalition: “Its goal is to make carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) a widely available, cost-effective, and rapidly scalable solution to reduce carbon emissions to meet mid-century climate goals.”

Biden: “carbon capture, use, and storage (CCUS) is a rapidly growing technology that has the potential to create economic benefits for multiple industries while significantly reducing carbon dioxide emissions.”

Blue Green Alliance 2017 Senate letter: “Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a rapidly growing technology that has potential to create economic benefits for multiple industries while significantly reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.”

Biden: “Aviation accounts for nearly 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and that portion is expected to increase. Unfortunately today, few low-carbon technologies or fuels have been developed to tackle this challenge.”

Vox: “Aviation accounts for about 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and that share is poised to grow… few low-carbon technologies or fuels have been developed so far.”

Biden: “The average American sewage pipe is 33 years old, with many pipes dating back 50 or even 100 years.”

American Rivers: “[T]he average American sewage pipe is 33 years old, with many pipes dating back 50 or even 100 years.”

Biden: “40% of the 567 federally recognized tribes in U.S. live in Alaska where the rapid pace of rising temperatures and melting sea ice and glaciers threaten the critical infrastructure and traditional livelihoods in the state.”

Climate.gov: “Of the 567 federally recognized tribes in the United States, 40 percent (229 tribes) live in Alaska Native communities. The rapid pace of rising temperatures, melting sea ice and glaciers, and thawing permafrost in Alaska is having a significant negative impact on critical infrastructure and traditional livelihoods in the state.”

Biden’s first campaign for president in 1988 was derailed after he was caught plagiarizing on multiple occasions. (RELATED: Artist Featured In Joe Biden’s ‘America’ Ad Actually From Denmark)

The Biden campaign did not immediately return TheDCNF’s request for comment.

After this article was published, the Biden campaign told Business Insider that the missing citations were “inadvertently” excluded.

“Several citations were inadvertently left out of the final version of the 22-page document. As soon as we were made aware of it, we updated to include the proper citations,” the campaign told BI.

Biden Supported Restoration Of Citizenship To Confederate Leader Jeff Davis,"Former Vice President Joe Biden supported the restoration of citizenship to Confederate leader Jefferson Davis in 1977.

The Democratic presidential nomination front-runner was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee when senators were considering whether to restore citizenship to the man who was not only the president of the Confederate States Of America but also a secretary of war and a senator from Mississippi, the Washington Examiner reported Wednesday.

After the committee voted in favor of Davis, the measure was approved by the full Senate and by then-President Jimmy Carter. Biden also approved restoring citizenship to Gen. Robert E. Lee, who led the Army of Northern Virginia for much of the Civil War. (RELATED: Joe Biden Tells Europe That ‘America Is An Embarrassment’)

Both decisions attracted virtually no political opposition at the time but certainly would do so today when protestors seek to topple Confederate statues, rename streets and highways named after Confederate generals and banish the Confederate battle flag from sight.

Virginia’s Jefferson Davis Highway is set to be renamed in October because it honored “a racist traitor and slaveholder who led the fight to take up arms against our nation in order to preserve the brutal system of slavery,” according to Delegate Mark Levine in his newsletter.

The Davis citizenship bill stated that Davis “had served the United States long and honorably as a soldier” before joining the Confederacy and “should no longer be singled out for punishment. … The Congress officially completes the long process of reconciliation that has reunited our people following the tragic conflict between the States.”

Remembering that Biden supported the measure highlights just how long he has been a political force on Capitol Hill, serving as a long-time senator from Delaware long before he was chosen to be former President Barack Obama’s running mate. (RELATED: Joe Biden 2020 Website Is Tricking People Into Thinking It’s The Real Thing)

Although Biden likes to call himself the “most progressive” Democrat running for president, he has held very conservative positions over the years, including support for traditional marriage and the “three strikes” crime bill — both under former President Bill Clinton. Most recently, after decades of backing the Hyde Amendment that prohibits taxpayer funding of most abortions, Biden denounced the law.

Biden’s comments on race have also garnered criticism in the past. Biden once declared that segregation was a form of “black pride.”

"New Yorker Profile Reveals Hunter Biden’s Past With Drugs, Car Crashes And His Divorce","A Monday profile in the New Yorker revealed the details behind Hunter Biden’s history with drugs, his divorce and dalliances, and his car crashes.

The profile revealed that though former Vice President Joe Biden discussed his oldest son Beau, who passed away from a brain tumor in 2015, at length in his recent memoir, the presidential candidate dwelt little on his son Hunter, except to praise him as a supportive brother. Joe does not often mention Hunter in speeches, the New Yorker added.

But Hunter’s history may be another reason his father does not often mention him. The former vice president’s son struggled with both drug and alcohol addictions for decades, according to the profile. (RELATED: This Is How Much Joe Biden Pays A Month For His Virginia Mansion)

Biden married Kathleen Buhle while working as a Jesuit volunteer at a church in Portland, Oregon. Buhle became pregnant three months after they started dating, and the two married in July 1993. They went on to formally separate in July 2015 and divorce in 2016.

One weekend before he was expected to report for reserve duty in 2013, Biden bummed a cigarette from South African strangers — a cigarette that Biden claims must have been laced with cocaine since his urine sample taken the next day tested positive for cocaine. Biden was discharged from the Navy for this usage in February of 2014.

Seeing her husband’s drinking problem, Kathleen reportedly gave her husband an ultimatum in 2015, telling him he would have to leave the house if he would not stop drinking. Hunter drank a bottle of vodka in response and left the house, according to the New Yorker.

The former vice president’s son reportedly fled to the arms of his dead brother’s wife, Hallie, and began using crack cocaine again (having first tried it in his college days at Georgetown University). Hallie and Biden began dating before his divorce with Kathleen was finalized and eventually moved in together. Biden is now married to South African filmmaker Melissa Cohen.

After he split from Kathleen, Hunter wandered around L.A. until he found a homeless man who showed him where to purchase crack, which Biden continued to do on several occasions. The New Yorker reported that on Biden’s first visit down the alley to purchase crack, “someone put a gun to his head before realizing that he was a buyer.”

Hunter also said he lost control of two different cars in the span of two days, blaming the first incident on lack of sleep and the second on a large barn owl who he says he may have hallucinated.

Biden’s reported indiscretions were exposed in 2017 when Kathleen filed a motion in D.C. Superior Court asking to freeze Biden’s assets. Kathleen said that he “created financial concerns for the family by spending extravagantly on his own interests (including drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, strip clubs, and gifts for women with whom he has sexual relations), while leaving the family with no funds to pay legitimate bills.”

Warren Weekend Event Draws Thousands While Biden Draws Hundreds,"2020 Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden both held campaign events this weekend, but numbers show Warren’s event attendance heavily outnumbered Biden’s.

Warren held a Sunday event in Seattle that turned out to be her biggest campaign event so far, drawing a crowd of about 15,000 according to Politico. The widely attended event followed Warren’s Minnesota success earlier that week, where her event drew an estimated 12,000.

Biden simultaneously campaigned in New Hampshire and Iowa, but the former vice president’s events brought in crowds numbering in the low hundreds. His deputy campaign manager says that they are not worried about the difference. (RELATED:Warren Swipes At Biden: ‘It’s Not Enough To Be Not Trump’)

“Are we worried about Elizabeth Warren’s crowd size? No, we’re not. I get it and I understand that it’s an easy metric to measure or to view,” said deputy campaign manager Pete Kavanaugh.

While Biden denounced President Donald Trump throughout his speeches, Warren called for “big, structural change,” according to Politico.

Former state House candidate John Streeter compared the two candidates after one of Biden’s New Hampshire speeches Friday, according to Politico.

“Warren is a rock star,” Streeter said. “Joe Biden is a rock. We know him.”

Polls show Biden, the current Democratic front runner, has the best chance of beating Trump in the 2020 presidential election.

A CNN poll released Tuesday reveals that 29 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say they would vote for Biden, up seven points from June CNN survey conducted after the first round of Democratic debates. (RELATED: Biden Campaign Ad Bashes Trump, Calls Him An ‘Erratic, Vicious, Bullying President’)

An August Quinnipiac University poll also revealed 49 percent of voters believe the former vice president has the best chance of beating President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election.

Fifty percent of voters said they believe electability is more important in a candidate than compatibility with “your views on issues.”

Biden Praises Segregationists Less Than 24 Hours After Promising Not To,"Former Vice President Joe Biden praised a segregationist friend less than 24 hours after he promised to stop mentioning his past work with segregationists.

The 2020 presidential candidate told reporters Tuesday that he should not have discussed his memories of working with segregationists in the Senate earlier this summer, according to Politico.

“I’m not using those examples anymore,” he said, the publication reports. (RELATED: Warren Weekend Event Draws Thousands While Biden Draws Hundreds)

But Biden mentioned segregationist friend Fritz Hollings one day later at a townhall in Spartanburg, South Carolina on Wednesday. Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat who served as a senator for more than 38 years, passed away at age 97 in April.

“Folks, you know, I spent an awful lot of time in South Carolina because of my good friend,” Biden said, “and he was my great, great friend and helped me a great deal through some very difficult times, Fritz Hollings and PT Hollings, and I miss him.”

The former vice president often faces backlash for his political background. He told reporters Tuesday that “it’s hard” when his actions are brought up without the context of the time period.

“It’s hard,” Biden said, according to Politico. “I’m not being critical. I’m just saying I’ve got to be aware that when things are said by me or about something I did or said in 1970 or 1980, people don’t understand the context, and it really is a frightening thing.”

"Joe Biden Unveils Immigration Platform, Acknowledges ‘Pain’ Of Deportations During Obama Era","Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden released his immigration plan Wednesday, pledging to dismantle a number of the Trump administration’s key immigration policies.

Biden called for an end to Remain in Mexico, reinstatement of DACA, and raising the refugee cap to nearly seven times the current limit.

Unlike his progressive rivals, Biden did not call for a ban on deportations, or decriminalization of illegal immigration, and he doesn’t want to see DHS fundamentally changed.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden published a sweeping immigration plan that called for an overhaul of the Trump administration’s agenda, but it remained largely moderate compared to his progressive contenders.

Biden’s campaign on Wednesday published a massive, nearly 6,700-word plan for how the Democratic candidate would manage immigration if elected president of the United States. While the former vice president pledged to undo a number of President Donald Trump’s most notable programs and acknowledged criticism of deportations that took place during his own administration, Biden’s platform was still reflective of his moderate stance on the issue of immigration.

Early on in the outline, Biden appeared to take a left turn by openly acknowledging the “pain” caused by deportations that took place during the Obama administration.

“Joe Biden understands the pain felt by every family across the U.S. that has had a loved one removed from the country, including under the Obama-Biden Administration, and he believes we must do better to uphold our laws humanely and preserve the dignity of immigrant families, refugees, and asylum-seekers,” the announcement said.

Since the launch of his campaign, Biden has been dogged by immigration activists who have criticized him for the record-high number of deportations — three million — that took place during the eight years of the Obama-Biden era. However, he has remained largely defiant about the statistic, and went so far as to say he had “nothing” to apologize for when asked by a Telemundo reporter earlier this month.

The former vice president announced on Wednesday he would mostly unwind the Trump administration’s immigration agenda. Namely, he pledged to end Migrant Protection Protocols, otherwise known as Remain in Mexico, a program that mandates asylum seekers wait in Mexico while their cases are processed in the U.S. immigration court system. He also said he would reinstate Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), and abolish for-profit detention centers.

The former vice president said he would raise the refugee cap nearly sevenfold — increasing the current cap of 18,000 to 125,000.

“Trump has waged an unrelenting assault on our values and our history as a nation of immigrants. It’s wrong, and it stops when Joe Biden is elected president,” the announcement said, referring to Trump’s immigration agenda as a “moral failing and a national shame.”

However, what was not addressed in the plan was also telling.

The leading Democratic candidate did not say he would put a moratorium on all deportations if elected president, nor did he say he would decriminalize illegal immigration. The omissions were notable as they are two positions becoming increasingly popular among his party’s base, and were recently adopted by both Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — the progressive darlings of the Democratic presidential field.

And unlike Sanders’ recent immigration platform unveiling, Biden did not call for an overhaul of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The two agencies under DHS that mostly deal with immigration enforcement — Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — would not be fundamentally reworked under a Biden administration, but he did say that the two agencies would “abide by professional standards” and he would hold those accountable for “inhumane” treatment. (RELATED: Clinton-Appointed Judge Blocks Billions In Funding For Trump’s Border Wall)

Biden also said he would help address the border crisis by hiring more judges and court staff, and called for an investment of $4 billion of U.S. taxpayer funds into Central America to address the root causes of illegal migration.

Joe Biden Says He ‘Became A Professor’ After Leaving White House — He Never Taught A Class,"Vice President Joe Biden claims he “became a professor” after leaving the White House in 2017, but reports from the time say neither he nor the university that hired him expected him to teach any classes, and students and faculty were confused about what he would be doing.

Biden made the claim Wednesday at a campaign event in Georgetown, South Carolina, saying he “became a teacher, became a professor” rather than “taking a Wall Street job” before his book about his son, Beau, released. The University of Pennsylvania did indeed make Biden the “Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor” in 2017, but neither the school nor Biden expected him to teach any classes, according to comments at the time.

“He will not be teaching classes,” Biden spokesperson Kate Bedingfield said in 2017.

One article at The Daily Pennsylvanian featured the headline “No One Is Really Sure What Joe Biden Will Be Doing At Penn.”

UPenn announced Biden’s hiring on February 7, just a week after he left office, and by the end of February Biden’s role was “still uncertain” and “being ironed out,” University spokesperson Stephen MacCarthy told the Pennsylvanian.

MacCarthy did not respond to a request for comment. (RELATED: ‘I Wasn’t Arrested’: Joe Biden Admits He Lied Numerous Times About South African Trip)

One student at the time wrote that UPenn was paying Biden “to essentially do nothing but sporadically show his face on campus.”

The student was not far from the truth. Biden appeared on the UPenn campus four times to make speeches in 2017 and made another four speeches in 2018. Penn paid him $776,527 for his trouble, nearly double the average salary for everyday professors, according to PhillyMag.

When the Daily Caller asked whether Biden had in fact taught any courses since being hired, UPenn Vice Provost for Faculty Anita Allen did not list any, saying his work was instead based in Washington. (RELATED: Joe Bide: ‘No Man Has The Right To Touch A Woman…Other Than Self-Defense)

“Vice President Biden was hired principally to lead the Washington D.C. Penn Biden Center, which opened in 2018,” she said, clarifying that he began a leave of absence in April 2019.

Allen emphasized that “it is not unusual for a Penn faculty member to engage in something other than ordinary classroom teaching as their primary responsibility.”

The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2020/02/28/biden-penn-professor-south-carolina/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiK6trS_7P9AhWNElkFHZjJBkM4FBAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw3hqr5lY37LV7fwm8KtJK1b,2020-02-28
EXCLUSIVE: Hunter Biden Touted Connections Last Year While Pitching UCLA Law On Letting Him Teach Drug Policy Course,"Hunter Biden cited political connections in 2019 while pitching the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law on letting him teach a drug policy course, emails reviewed by the Daily Caller News Foundation show.

The talks broke down after Hunter failed to “submit further materials for the proposed course,” a UCLA Law spokesman told the DCNF.

Former Vice President Joe Biden said in October 2019 that Hunter was “gonna be teaching at law school next year.”

Hunter Biden touted his political connections in 2019 while unsuccessfully pitching the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) School of Law on letting him teach a course on drug policy, emails obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation show.

In his pitch, Biden listed off a number of possible guest speakers, most of whom had ties to his father, Democratic frontrunner and former Vice President Joe Biden.

“In 2019, Hunter Biden inquired about the possibility of teaching a course at UCLA School of Law, and he and school leaders held preliminary conversations about the possibility,” the law school’s executive director of communications, Bill Kisliuk, told the DCNF in an email.

“Mr. Biden subsequently did not submit further materials for the proposed course, which is a required step when the school is considering adding a course. There are no plans for Mr. Biden to teach at the law school,” Kisliuk added.

Joe Biden, who now leads the Democratic primary after a strong Super Tuesday performance, told reporters in October 2019 that Hunter was “gonna be teaching at law school next year.”

Hunter moved to Los Angeles in early 2018, though little is known about his activities there. During his father’s presidential bid, Republicans have set their sights on Hunter’s ties to foreign companies, including in China and Ukraine.

Hunter served on the board of Ukrainian energy firm Burisma Holdings through April 2019, leaving the position weeks before his father announced his presidential bid. He was also on the board of a Chinese private equity firm through October 2019.

Emails reviewed by the DCNF show that school officials were slow to embrace Hunter’s proposal.

Hunter emailed the law school’s dean, Jennifer Mnookin, in July 2019 to share his vision for the course he wanted to teach.

Hunter, whose struggles with drug abuse have been widely publicized, said he “would like to focus on domestic and international drug policy” in the proposed course. He also attached a syllabus of a course he taught for Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service. (RELATED: Hunter Biden Embraces Life As An Artist, And NYT Is Here For It)

“I will have some combination of key decision makers, leading thinkers, policy implementers and grass roots advocates as guests for each topic,” he wrote.

He ticked off high-profile figures as possible guests or co-teachers of the course, including former Obama administration officials and friends of his father.

“For instance I’d like to have former Attorney’s [sic] General Dustin McDaniel of Arkansas and Patrick Lynch of Rhode Island to discuss their roles in the state class action suits brought against Purdue Pharma and possibly a prosecutor involved in the criminal cases against the Sackler family,” he wrote.

“For plan Colombia the El Chapo extradition [sic] I’m certain I could get former President Pastrana of Colombia to discuss how he implemented ‘Plan Colombia’ with the US government along with Christopher Putala and Manus Cooney who were both chief’s of staff (Democrat and Republican) to the judiciary committee at the time,” Hunter continued.

“I would also invite former FBI Director Louis Freeh and possibly the US Attorney responsible for that extradition and indictment. For a the class [sic] on decriminalization I would invite [California] Governor [Gavin] Newsom (may be a long shot but I know he would consider it if his schedule allows),” he added. “The list goes on.”

McDaniel represented Hunter in a paternity lawsuit until withdrawing as counsel in December 2019. Others on Hunter’s list have direct ties to his father.

Pastrana, the former Columbian president, worked with Joe Biden during the latter’s time in the Senate and has also described Biden as his friend. Putala is a lobbyist who once worked for Joe Biden in the Senate.

Freeh once described Joe Biden as a “dear friend” of his. Hunter reportedly recruited the former FBI chief in 2016 to serve on the legal team of Gabriel Popoviciu, a Romanian real estate magnate convicted of bribery charges in Bucharest.

Mnookin, the law school dean, indicated in her email that she met with Biden and his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden.

“It was great to meet you and Melissa last month, and I very much appreciate your following up and sending along the attached syllabus,” she wrote in an Aug. 9, 2019, email. “I think this offers some very exciting possibilities, and I look forward to seeing what we may be able to do.”

Mnookin passed along Hunter’s email to another law school official, Steven Bank.

“As Vice Dean for Curricular and Academic Affairs, I typically help craft the schedule and identify and develop proposed new courses, although the Curriculum Committee and the Faculty have the final say on approving any proposed additions,” Bank wrote in an email to Hunter.

“In determining whether this would be a good fit for the Law School, it might helpful for us to talk further,” he added, and asked when “it might be a good time for us to have a phone call to discuss further.”

Hunter replied in ten words: “Please let me know when you are available to speak.”

“Thanks for getting back to me so quickly, although I hope I didn’t give you the impression in my e-mail that this was a rush,” Bank replied. “If we decided to move forward, this wouldn’t even be considered by the Curriculum Committee and the Faculty until Spring 2020 for a Spring 2021 slot most likely.”

Talks between the two parties apparently broke down sometime after that.

The emails between Hunter and the UCLA officials were obtained through the California Public Records Act and provided to the DCNF.

The emails fill in some of the gaps of what Hunter has been doing in the months since his father began running for president.

Biden moved to Los Angeles following a divorce from his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle. He and Melissa Cohen Biden, his current wife, live in a $12,000-per-month house in the Hollywood Hills, according to a glowing profile of Hunter that The New York Times published Friday.

Biden acknowledged his struggles with drug addiction in that profile, telling the Times that he was addicted to crack for four years. He has since taken up painting as therapy to deal with his struggles with addiction.

Though Hunter is now based in L.A., he was conspicuously absent at his father’s rally there Tuesday night after his strong Super Tuesday showing. The former vice president was accompanied on stage by his wife and sister.

George Mesires, a lawyer for Hunter, did not respond to a request for comment.

"‘I Want The Same Equal Treatment’: Biden Accuser Tara Reade Tears Into Media, Women’s Groups, Democratic Politicians","Media, women’s groups, and Democratic politicians that defended Christine Blasey Ford have kept silent regarding Tara Reade’s sexual assault accusation against former Vice President Joe Biden.

Reade worked as a senate staffer for Biden in 1993 and has accused the then-senator of kissing her and penetrating her with his fingers without her consent. Biden’s campaign has denied the accusations.

“I’m sorry that I’m politically inconvenient but my perpetrator was Joe Biden,” Reade told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “And people need to deal with it.”

Tara Reade condemned the media’s silence regarding her sexual assault allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden in an interview with the Daily Caller News Foundation and demanded equal treatment as “other survivors” like Christine Blasey Ford.

56-year-old Reade lamented that her sexual assault accusation has become a “partisan tool,” saying that Republicans have weaponized her and Democrats have both ignored and discredited her.

“It’s inexcusable,” she told the DCNF. “I’m sorry that I’m politically inconvenient but my perpetrator was Joe Biden. And people need to deal with it.”

Reade worked as a Senate staffer for Biden in 1993 and has accused the then-senator of kissing her, touching her, and penetrating her with his fingers without her consent. Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign, which did not respond to a request for comment from the DCNF, has denied the assault and said it “absolutely did not happen.”

Silence And A “Shroud Of Non-Commitment” From The Media

Between March 24, the day when Reade made her allegations public, and April 15, Biden faced over 81 questions and over 20 hours of interviews with media without being asked to comment on the sexual assault accusation, a recent analysis by the Washington Free Beacon found. Though Biden’s former rival Sen. Bernie Sanders was asked about the allegations last week, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has yet to address the accusations.

Read told the DCNF that major media outlets treat her with a “shroud of non-commitment” and silence. She compared her treatment to the “hundreds of stories” that were written about Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her.

“My question is: why? Are they being told not to by the campaign?” she said. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Video Shows Anti-Kavanaugh Lawyer Saying Christine Blasey Ford Wanted ‘Asterisk’ By Justice’s Name)

Media outlets probe into every aspect of her life when she interviews with them, Reade told the DCNF. By contrast, she pointed out, stories only publish denials from Biden’s campaign without getting details from the former vice president himself.

“Their campaign didn’t have their hands up my skirt,” Reade told the DCNF. “Their campaign didn’t have their hands underneath my clothes and then arrange for me to be fired.”

Biden’s accuser criticized CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, who has hosted Biden multiple times since her story broke, but has not asked him about her allegations. She described how CNN, which did not respond to a request for comment from the DCNF, will call her and ask to interview her, saying they will “consider doing a story” on her allegations.

“Well, get back to me when you know you’re doing a story,” Reade said she tells CNN, “and then I’ll complete the interview.”

According to Reade, ABC News reporter Sasha Pezenik interviewed her immediately after Reade went public with her accusation. But she said Pezenik sat on the story.

“She has never done a story,” Reade said. “When I’ve asked her, she basically just says her producer’s not interested right now.”

Reade Calls Out Women’s Groups For Their Silence

Women’s groups that backed Blasey Ford’s sexual assault accusations against Kavanaugh, including pro-abortion women’s groups like Planned Parenthood, Emily’s List, the National Abortion Right’s Action League, have been silent regarding Reade’s accusations

Reade said it would have meant “so much” to her to have a women’s movement or platform that supported her during this time. (RELATED: ‘Believe All Women’: Women’s Groups That Condemned Kavanaugh Silent On Biden Accuser Tara Reade)

“I say back to these women’s organizations, I want the same equal treatment that other survivors have received, no matter who the perpetrator is,” Reade told the DCNF. She singled out Emily’s List and activist Gloria Steinem, both of which whom she says she interacted as an “active Democrat.”

“Emily’s List, where are you?” she asked. “Gloria Steinem? Where are you? Where are these people?”

Neither Emily’s List nor Steinem responded to requests for comment from the DCNF.

Multiple organizations said that, as nonprofits, they couldn’t weigh in on partisan topics, including sexual assault accusations against a presidential candidate.

The Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, a 501(c)3 nonprofit administered by the National Women’s Law Center (NWLC) and established in the wake of the #MeToo movement, reportedly told Reade in February that it would not support her.

NWLC spokeswoman Maria Patrick said in a statement to the Intercept that the group’s nonprofit status restricts “how it can spend its funds, including restrictions that pertain to candidates running for election.”

A spokeswoman for the Center for Reproductive Rights also told the DCNF in April that CRR does “not comment on elections or candidates as we are a non-partisan 501©3.”

Pressed as to why CRR actively commented on Kavanaugh’s confirmation, the spokeswoman said “judicial appointees are not candidates and are not elected,” and added, “[w]e do not and have never commented on candidates for public elections.”

Reade told the DCNF that women’s groups that blame their silence on their nonprofit status do so out of fear.

She speculated that many of these women’s groups rely on funding that comes from the Violence Against Women Act, which Biden introduced in 1990, and believes that these organizations worry they will lose this funding if Biden becomes president and they have spoken ill of him.

“I think there’s all kinds of reasons,” she adds. ” There’s economic, there’s just fear of who he is and how powerful he is. I’m 56 years old, and I’ve kind of pushed beyond fear, I’m getting attacked I am getting harassed. But I think it’s important I stay strong and stay firm.”

“I’m Not Voting In A National Election:” Reade Disowns Her Life-Long Party

Reade recognizes that Biden is a pro-abortion candidate facing President Donald Trump in the upcoming 2020 election — and that many of the women’s groups are anxious to preserve abortion access in the United States. (RELATED: Here’s How Joe Biden Has Evolved On Abortion As He Attempts To Become President)

But Biden has “a pretty sketchy history on reproductive rights,” she said, pointing to the former vice president’s flip-flops on abortion stances throughout his political career. If the Democratic Party marginalizes her or discredits her, she warns, this “lessens the credibility for women to come forward.”

“I’m strongly pro-choice,” she said. “I have no problem saying that. But what I would say is that sexual assault and sexual harassment are equally as important.”

“Joe Biden is like a wolf in sheep’s clothing,” she adds. “He’s championing supposedly women’s rights but in his personal life that is not the way he’s conducted himself.”

She named several Democratic figures who have touched on her allegations against Biden, including Sanders, Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and former 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar. None of these politicians responded to requests for comment from the DCNF.

“Bernie Sanders would have no concept of who I am, of this incident, of who I was in 1993,” she told the DCNF, referring to Sanders discussing her accusations against Biden on CBS This Morning. “He had nothing to do with it. How could he have an opinion when he doesn’t know?”

The Vermont senator has not reached out to her on the matter, she added.

She pointed out that Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, said recently on MSNBC that Reade’s alleged sexual assault had been investigated. Reade said that statement is false and “irresponsible,” noting that her assault has “never been investigated.”

“My case is open and active with the metro D.C. police,” she said. She added that she found it “very upsetting” to hear Klobuchar go on to discuss Biden’s record on domestic violence prevention during that MSNBC hit. (RELATED: Former Biden Staffer Files Criminal Complaint With DC Police)

As for Ocasio-Cortez, Reade noted that the Democratic congresswoman said April 14 that Reade’s allegations against Biden are “legitimate to talk about.”

“What you’re voicing is so legitimate and real,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “That’s why I find this kind of silencing of all dissent to be a form of gaslighting.”

“I think it’s legitimate to talk about these things,” the congresswoman added. “And if we want, if we again want to have integrity, you can’t say, you know — both believe women, support all of this, until it inconveniences you, until it inconveniences us.”

Though Reade originally thanked Ocasio-Cortez for her initial support, she pointed out to the DCNF Friday that the New York representative proceeded to endorse Biden on April 23.

“She still had to toe the line,” Reade said.



Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is literally the first member of Congress to address publicly what happened to me when I worked for Joe Biden. Thank you @AOC https://t.co/TuN43vpQKq — taratweets ( Alexandra Tara Reade) (@ReadeAlexandra) April 15, 2020

Reade said she is a third generation Democrat with a suffragette grandmother and a Democratic activist mother committed to fighting racism, but she no longer wishes to be associated with the Democratic party. She won’t be voting Republican, either.

“I will never be part of the Democratic Party again,” she told the DCNF.

“I’m not voting in a national election,” Reade added. “There is no democracy for me. I think, in my case, that democracy died in that corridor in 1993.”

"Hunter Biden’s Business Dealings Created ‘Counterintelligence And Extortion Concerns,’ Senate Report Says","Hunter Biden’s financial dealings with Ukrainian, Russian and Chinese businesses created potential “criminal financial, counterintelligence and extortion concerns,” according to a report by two Senate committees.

The report details a series of wire transfers between Biden and a businessman with extensive ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

The report, written by the Senate Homeland Security and Senate Finance committees, also states that State Department officials repeatedly raised concerns about Hunter Biden’s work for Burisma Holdings.

One official testified that he told Joe Biden in October 2015 that his son’s links to Burisma “enabled Russian disinformation efforts.”

U.S. banks flagged suspicious financial transactions between Hunter Biden’s firms and Russian and Chinese nationals, including a businessman with extensive ties to the Chinese Communist Party, according to a highly anticipated report released Wednesday by two Republican-controlled Senate committees.

The report asserts that the wire transfers, which total in the millions of dollars, raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest involving Biden, as well as “criminal financial, counterintelligence and extortion concerns.”

The report, which The Daily Caller News Foundation obtained ahead of its release, also states that State Department officials expressed reservations in 2015 and 2016 about Biden’s links to Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company that has been dogged by bribery allegations.

One official, Amos Hochstein, told the Senate Homeland Security and Senate Finance committees that he said to then-Vice President Joe Biden in October 2015 that Hunter Biden’s position on the board of Burisma “enabled Russian disinformation efforts and risked undermining U.S. policy in Ukraine.”

Hunter Biden, now 50, joined Burisma’s board of directors in April 2014, shortly after his father, Joe Biden, took over as the Obama administration’s chief liaison to Ukraine.

One of the administration’s goals was to help Ukraine fix its problems with corruption. But but State Department officials questioned whether the younger Biden’s work for Burisma posed a problem because the company’s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, was under investigation for money laundering and extortion.

George Kent, who served as deputy chief of mission to Ukraine through 2018, testified that Zlochevsky was an “odious” oligarch who likely paid a $7 million bribe to a Ukrainian prosecutor general in December 2014, months after Hunter Biden joined Burisma’s board, according to the report. (RELATED: ‘You Don’t Get More Politically Connected’: Participants In Securities Fraud Scam Touted Links To Hunter Biden)

Emails cited in the report show that Kent raised Burisma’s issues with corruption to other State Department officials. Kent also told the committees on July 24, 2020, that he said to Joe Biden’s national security staff in February 2015 that Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma “could create the perception of a conflict of interest.”

Kent told Joe Biden’s staff that “someone needed to talk to Hunter Biden, and he should [step] down from the board of Burisma,” according to the report.

Hochstein and Kent’s warnings went unheeded, the Senate report says. Joe Biden avoided publicly criticizing Burisma or Zlochevsky, and Hunter Biden remained on Burisma’s board until his father announced his presidential campaign in April 2019.

The report says that Burisma paid a consulting firm controlled by Hunter Biden and Devon Archer, his business partner and fellow Burisma director, more than $3.5 million from May 2014 to February 2016. Burisma sent nine wire transfers from January 2016 to November 2016 totaling $752,054 to Biden’s law firm, Owasco, according to the report.

The report does not produce any direct evidence of wrongdoing on Hunter Biden’s part. But Republicans say the documents paint a troubling picture of Biden receiving “millions of dollars from foreign sources as a result of business relationships that he built during the period when his father was vice president of the United States and after.”

The report says that several transactions involving Biden-controlled firms were flagged for “potential criminal financial activity,” including wire transfers that Biden sent to his uncle, James Biden, and payments that he received from a mysterious Chinese businessman believed to have ties to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).

The report focuses on millions of dollars in wire payments that Hunter Biden’s firms received from Ye Jianming, the founder of CEFC China Energy Co., and Gongwen Dong, a U.S.-based associate of Ye’s.

According to Republicans, Ye has “extensive” connections to the Chinese government.

He reportedly served as deputy secretary for the China Association for International Friendly Contacts (CAIFC), a front group for the PLA. A report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission in 2011 said that CAIFC has “dual roles of intelligence collection and conducting People’s Republic of China propaganda.”

The Senate report says that on Aug. 4, 2017, a subsidiary of Ye’s company called CEFC Infrastructure Investment (US) LLC, wired $100,000 to Owasco, the Biden law firm.

A month later, on Sept. 8, 2017, Hunter Biden and Gongwen Dong applied for a $100,000 line of credit under a shell company they formed called Hudson West III LLC, according to the Senate report.

Biden, his uncle James, and James’s wife, Sara Biden, accessed the account through credit cards, and spent $101,291 on what Republicans call “extravagant items,” including plane tickets, hotels, restaurants and items at Apple stores.

The wires were “identified for potential financial criminal activity,” the report says.

According to the report, CEFC Infrastructure Investment wired $5 million to the bank account for Hudson West III on Aug. 8, 2017. Of that, nearly $4.8 million was wired to Biden’s law firm over the next year.

The committees relied on confidential Treasury Department records for details about the transactions. The records are not fully described in the report, but Republicans refer to committee requests for Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), which banks are required to file with the Treasury Department when they spot suspicious transactions.

The report also flags wire transfers that Biden received from Elena Baturina, a Russian billionaire who was married to Yuri Luzhkov. Luzhkov served as Moscow’s mayor until his death in 2010.

The report states that Baturina wired $3.5 million on Feb. 14, 2014, to a bank account for Rosemont Seneca Thornton LLC, which Hunter Biden co-founded with Archer, his business partner, the year before.

Baturina transferred another $241,797 to a bank account for Rosemont Seneca Thornton from May-December 2015, according to the report.

“These transactions were identified because of Baturina’s reported criminal activity,” the report states.

The report also refers to potential payments from Biden to women from Russia and Eastern Europe who may have had links to “prostitution or human trafficking ring[s]” in Eastern Europe.

“These foreign nationals have questionable backgrounds that have been identified as being consistent with a range of criminal activities, including but not limited to organized prostitution and/or human trafficking, money laundering, fraud, and embezzlement,” according to the Republicans.

The alleged payments are not detailed in the report.

Joe Biden’s presidential campaign did not respond to an email seeking comment.

"Report: Joe Biden Met With Hunter’s Ukraine Business Partners As Vice President, According To Unconfirmed Emails","Hunter Biden and then-Vice President Joe Biden met with a top executive of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma in 2015, according to a copy of an unconfirmed email obtained by the New York Post.

The email was part of what the Post described as a “massive trove of data recovered from a laptop computer” that was dropped off at an unidentified Delaware computer repair shop in April 2019. The owner of the repair shop said the customer who dropped it off never came back to pay for the service and retrieve the laptop.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has not confirmed the authenticity of the email.

The Post was first informed of the hard drive in late September by former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, who currently faces felony charges for allegedly defrauding donors to a crowdfunded border wall project. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who has worked with a now-sanctioned Ukrainian lawmaker with ties to Russia to dig up dirt on the Bidens’ dealings in Ukraine, provided the Post with a copy of the hard drive on Sunday, the outlet reported.

The meeting described in the email between the Bidens and Vadym Pozharsky, an advisor to Burisma’s board of directors, came less than a year before Joe Biden pressured former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire a prosecutor who was reportedly investigating Burisma in return for a $1 billion loan guarantee.

“Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent some time together,” Pozharskyi allegedly wrote to Hunter Biden in the April 2015 email, the Post reported. “It’s really an honor and pleasure.”

The Post published four photos of a man that closely resembles Hunter Biden that were recovered from the hard drive.

Hunter Biden was serving on the Burisma board of directors at the time of the reported meeting, having obtained the post in 2014.

The report of the meeting runs counter to Joe Biden’s claim in September 2019 that he has “never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.” (RELATED: Biden Says He Never Discussed Hunter Biden’s Ukraine Deal. Hunter Says He Did)

The owner of the shop did not positively identify the person who dropped off the laptop as Hunter Biden but said the computer did contain a sticker from the Beau Biden Foundation, according to the Post.

The repair shop owner later alerted the FBI to the existence of the laptop and its hard drive after it went unclaimed, both of which were seized by federal authorities in December, according to a federal subpoena obtained by the Post.

Before the laptop was seized, however, the shop owner reportedly made a copy of its hard drive and turned it over to Giuliani’s lawyer.

Hunter Biden’s lawyer, George Mesires, questioned Giuliani’s credibility in a statement to the Post when asked about the contents of the laptop’s hard drive.

“He has been pushing widely discredited conspiracy theories about the Biden family, openly relying on actors tied to Russian intelligence,” Mesires told the Post.

Mesires did not immediately return a request for comment by the DCNF. Joe Biden’s presidential campaign also did not immediately respond.

‘Trans Lives Matter’: Joe Biden Again Pledges To Sign Bill That Would Force Male Athletes Into Girls’ Sports,"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden pledged again on Friday to sign the Equality Act, which would force public schools to allow biological males who identify as transgender girls into female athletics.

Biden pledged to sign the bill while condemning what he called an “epidemic” of violence “against transgender and gender non-conforming people,” in a statement his campaign released Friday.

The bill would alter the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to make “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” protected characteristics under federal anti-discrimination law. Among other things, that would force public schools to expand female athletic teams to include biological males who identify as transgender girls.

“My administration will enact the Equality Act to end legal discrimination against LGBTQ+ people, expand economic opportunities for LGBTQ+ people, reform our treatment of transgender and gender non-conforming individuals in our criminal justice system, ensure access to accurate identification documents, and improve government data collection to better track violence against the transgender community,” Biden pledged in Friday’s statement.

“I believe that Trans Lives Matter and, as president, I will fight on behalf of every vulnerable person in this country,” Biden added.

The Equality Act passed the House with unanimous Democratic support in May 2019, but failed to come up for a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.

Biological males who identify as transgender have racked up accomplishments in female athletics.

Franklin Pierce University runner CeCe Telfer in May 2019 won an NCAA DII women’s track championship. Telfer is a biological male who identifies as transgender and previously competed on Franklin Pierce’s men’s team, before switching to the women’s team.

University of Montana runner June Eastwood, a biological male who identifies as a transgender woman, was named the Big Sky Conference’s female athlete of the week in October 2019. Like Telfer, Eastwood competed on the university’s men’s team before switching to the women’s team.

The Biden campaign didn’t return an email seeking comment on the transgender athlete issue.

President Donald Trump’s administration has sought to limit girls’ sports to biological females.

The Department of Education in May sided with high school girls suing the state of Connecticut for allowing biological males who identify as transgender girls to compete in female athletics. In June, the Department of Justice threw its support behind an Idaho law restricting girls’ sports to biological females.

A poll released in November 2019 found that less than a third of Americans believe biological males who identify as transgender should be allowed to compete on girls’ sports teams. Another poll in October 2019 found that Americans said by a 57-20 margin that male athletes who self-identify as transgender have competitive advantages over female athletes.

50 Cent Endorses President Donald Trump After Seeing Biden’s Tax Plan,"Rapper 50 Cent encouraged people to vote for President Donald Trump in the November election Monday on Instagram.

50 Cent’s change of heart seems to come after he saw former Vice President Joe Biden’s tax plan. The “Just A Lil Bit” rapper shared a screenshot of Biden’s proposed tax plan on his Instagram.

“WHAT THE FUCK! (VOTE ForTRUMP) IM OUT,” 50 Cent captioned the screenshot. “FUCK NEW YORK The KNICKS never win anyway.”

“I don’t care Trump doesn’t like black people 62% are you out of ya fucking mind,” he added. (RELATED: 50 Cent Celebrates His Birthday With Gift Of $10K Worth Of Alcohol From Fan)

The increase in the tax rate would only affect Americans who make more than $400,000 annually, according to Hot New Hip Hop. The screenshot showed California’s combined tax rate could climb to 62.6% while New York City’s could be 62%.

The endorsement comes after 50 Cent shared a video of Trump dancing to the YMCA days ago.

“Still no f*cks given,” 50 Cent captioned the video on Instagram.

The rapper seemingly did a 180 on his thoughts about Trump. 50 Cent was critical of Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic back in March.

“You wanted a reality show host as president. Well, now you’re on Survivor,” a post the rapper shared said.

“Yeah we fucked up big time, but we gonna be alright watch. LOL,” 50 Cent captioned the post.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2020/10/19/50-cent-president-donald-trump-endorsement-joe-biden-tax-plan/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiK-7HX_7P9AhXYF1kFHR7tDmc4WhAWegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw1FAZBgEdFXsp4Vc-cN3lcn,2020-10-19
‘Political And Strategic Value Of The Biden Family’: Trove Of Documents Shows Biden Family Links To Chinese Business Deal,"The Daily Caller News Foundation has obtained a trove of business records related to Hunter Biden’s deals with a Chinese energy company.

The documents have also been provided to the Senate Homeland Security Committee, according to Tony Bobulinski, a former business partner of Hunter Biden.

One letter shows that Bobulinski touted the “political and strategic value of the Biden family” to the partnership with CEFC, the Chinese firm.

Another message shows a partner chiding another to not discuss “Joe being involved.”

A former business partner of Hunter Biden’s has provided a trove of business records to Senate investigators about their deals with a Chinese energy company, including one document that touts the “political and strategic value of the Biden family” to a $10 million investment project.

Tony Bobulinski, the former Biden associate, said in a statement on Wednesday that he provided the documents to the Senate Homeland Security Committee. In his statement, he asserted that Hunter Biden and his uncle, James Biden, “aggressively leveraged” their family name to secure foreign business deals.

The DCNF has obtained the documents, which include letters, text messages and emails showing Biden and his partners discussing a partnership with CEFC, a Chinese energy firm chaired by Ye Jianming.

The treasure trove of records are separate from documents purportedly from Hunter Biden’s laptop that have been published by The New York Post.

Bobulinski was part of a five-person partnership with Hunter Biden and James Biden on a venture involving CEFC.

The name of the joint venture was Oneida Holdings, according to the documents.

A Senate report released on Sept. 23 flagged Hunter Biden’s business dealings with CEFC and Ye, who was an official with a Chinese propaganda front group in the 2000s. Some of the transactions were flagged by banking regulators for possible criminal activity, the Senate report said. (RELATED: Joe Biden Denies That His Son Profited Off His Family Name)

Bobulinski’s documents provide much deeper insight into the relationship with CEFC than did the Senate report.

Included in the trove are letters, emails and contracts between CEFC, Oneida, and a related company called SinoHawk.

“I look forward to leveraging those relationships along with the political and strategic value of the Biden family, James Gilliar and CEFC to fulfill SinoHawk’s mission,” Bobulinski wrote to Ye on June 15, 2017.

According to one document, CEFC provided a $5 million interest-free loan to the Bidens.

“This $5 MM loan to BD family is interest-free. But if the $5 MM is used up, should CEFC keep lending more to the family? If CEFC lends more, they need to know the interest rate for the subsequent loan(s),” the company wrote to Bobulinski on Aug. 1, 2017.

The batch of documents also includes an email published last week that was purportedly from Hunter Biden’s laptop. Democrats have cast doubt on the authenticity of emails purportedly from Biden’s laptop, but Bobulinski confirmed its authenticity.

The May 13, 2017, email laid out “remuneration packages” for the partnership with CEFC. James Gilliar, one of the business partners, wrote that Hunter Biden would receive $850,000 as chairman of the partnership.

Gilliar also listed a shareholder breakdown for the partnership in which Hunter Biden would receive a 20% equity stake, James Biden a 10% stake, and another 10% provided to Hunter Biden for “the big guy.”

Bobulinski says that “the big guy” is Joe Biden.

Hunter Biden balked at the $850,000 figure in an email to the partners several days later.

“I have been the only one asked to give up all other active commercial interests – no consulting fees no promoting another business,” he wrote on May 16, 2017, according to an email obtained by the DCNF.

“I have to admit I do expect that if I can’t keep my toe in other things I will need a hell of a lot more than 850 p/y on a monthly basis.”

“$2M to me means $1M before taxes the other half goes to her- 850 to me means 100K to me – she has a 750 floor.”

“That does not include all he debt I assumed and not one dime for the girls (twoIvy [sic] league school living expenses and the most expensive highs cool in DC.”

The documents also reveal that Hunter Biden formed a shell company on May 22, 2017 called GK Temujin LLC.

It is unclear what if anything Joe Biden knew about his son’s partnership with CEFC. But some messages show the business partners cryptically discussing whether to bring up the former vice president in front of Hunter Biden.

“Don’t mention Joe being involved, it’s only when u are face to face, I know u know that but they are paranoid,” reads a May 20, 2017 exchange between Bobulinski and James Gilliar.

An exchange from May 19, 2017 suggests that Hunter Biden used the term “chairman” to refer to his father.

“When he said his chairman he was talking about his dad and I think your dismissal of it maybe offended him a bit, but you didn’t know what he was talking about,” wrote Rob Walker, one of the partners, on May 19, 2017.

The Senate committee that received Bobulinski’s documents did not respond to a request for comment.

"Hunter Biden Sought To Avoid Registering As Foreign Agent In Chinese Business Venture, Text Message Shows","Hunter Biden wanted to avoid registering as a foreign agent as part of a deal with a Chinese energy company, according to text messages obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

In a message to Tony Bobulinski on May 1, 2017, Hunter Biden also proposed creating a U.S.-based shell company so that the joint venture could bid on contracts with the U.S. government.

A day after sending the message, Hunter Biden set up a meeting with his father, Joe Biden, and Bobulinski in Los Angeles.

He claims that Joe Biden is referenced as an equity shareholder in early documents for the Chinese business deal.

Hunter Biden suggested setting up a shell company to do business with a Chinese firm in order to avoid registering as a foreign agent, and to be able to bid on contracts with the U.S. government, according to documents from May 2017 obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

A day after sending the message, Biden arranged a meeting between his father, Joe Biden, and Tony Bobulinski, one of the prospective partners in a deal with CEFC China Energy, a Chinese conglomerate whose chairman had links to the communist regime in Beijing. (RELATED: ‘He Was Plainly Familiar’: Hunter Biden’s Ex-Business Partner Says Joe Biden Was Aware Of Overseas Dealings)

“We don’t want to have to register as foreign agents under the FCPA which is much more expansive than people who should know choose not to know,” Hunter Biden wrote to Bobulinski on May 1, 2017, according to a message obtained by the DCNF.

“No matter what it will need to be a US company at some level in order for us to make bids on federal and state funded projects.”

Biden appeared to be referring to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) as well as the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).

Biden did not explain in the messages why he thought the venture with CEFC would violate FARA or FCPA without the buffer of a U.S. shell company.

A joint report from the Senate Homeland Security and Senate Finance Committees released on Sept. 23 regarding Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings said that CEFC’s chairman at the time, Ye Jianming, had ties to the People’s Liberation Army.

Ye had also been an officer in the 2000s for a group controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, according to the Senate report.

On May 2, 2017, a day after the text message, Hunter Biden arranged a meeting between Bobulinski, James Biden and Joe Biden in Los Angeles.

Bobulinski said at a press conference on Thursday that the meeting lasted an hour. He also said that the meeting undercut Joe Biden’s past claims to have never discussed business with his son.

“That is false,” Bobulinski said of Joe Biden’s previous statements.

“I have firsthand knowledge about this because I directly dealt with the Biden family, including Joe Biden.”

Bobulinski said that during the May 2017 meeting, he and the Bidens discussed “the Biden’s family business plans with the Chinese.”

He said that Joe Biden was “plainly familiar” with those plans “at a high level.”

Text messages preserved by Bobulinski show him discussing the meeting with Hunter and James Biden.

Bobulinski has provided emails, text messages and business records related to the CEFC deal to the Senate Homeland Security Committee. He also met Friday with the FBI, according to Sen. Ron Johnson, who chairs the committee.

The DCNF has also obtained Bobulinski’s trove of records.

WATCH:

Bobulinski, Hunter Biden, James Biden and two other partners, James Gilliar and Rob Walker, went on to form companies called SinoHawk and Oneida Holdings to partner with CEFC.

Documents from the Bobulinski trove show that Oneida Holdings was formed on May 22, 2017, three weeks after Hunter Biden proposed using a U.S. company to do business with CEFC.

According to Bobulinski, CEFC was expected to fund the partnership with SinoHawk with $10 million in seed money to begin investing in infrastructure and technology companies.

He said Thursday that CEFC never followed through with the investment. Emails and text messages from Bobulinski show him hounding CEFC executives about the delayed wire transfer.

Hunter and James Biden ended up working with CEFC, though Bobulinski said on Thursday that he was unaware of the side deal.

In the Aug. 3, 2017, email, Bobulinski provided a letter responding to a list of questions from CEFC about the joint venture with SinoHawk. One question from CEFC was about a $5 million interest-free loan the company was making to the Biden family.

The next day, without Bobulinski’s knowledge, CEFC made the first in a series of wire transfers to a law firm for Hunter Biden.

According to the Senate report, a subsidiary of CEFC China Energy called CEFC Infrastructure Investment wired $100,000 to Hunter Biden’s law firm, Owasco.

The report also says that the wire payment “was identified for potential criminal financial activity.”

On Aug. 8, 2017, according to the Senate report, the CEFC affiliate wired $5 million to a bank account for a shell company called Hudson West III.

That shell company, which Hunter Biden co-owned with an associate of Ye Jianming, would end up wiring $4,790,375 to Hunter Biden’s law firm through Sept. 25, 2018, according to the report.

Hunter and James Biden also tapped into a $100,000 line of credit linked to Hudson West III and CEFC, the Senate report said.

Bobulinski confronted James Biden about revelations in the Senate report, according to his records.

“You can imagine my shock when reading the report yesterday put out by the Senate committee,” Bobulinski wrote to James Biden on Sept. 24.

“The fact that you and HB were lying to Rob, James and I while accepting $5 million from CeFc is infuriating,” Bobulinksi wrote.

“And so disappointing based on the years of work that James, Rob and team invested to get things done,” he continued, referring to James Gilliar and Rob Walker, the two other SinoHawk partners.

Other documents from the Bobulinski documents raise questions about whether Joe Biden was a passive investor in the CEFC partnership.

A May 13, 2017 email written by Gilliar, the SinoHawk partner, makes reference to a 10% equity stake that Hunter Biden would hold for “the big guy.”

Bobulinski said Thursday that “the big guy” is Joe Biden, and that Hunter Biden often referred to his father by that term.

Joe Biden was never listed on any business records for SinoHawk or Oneida Holdings, though messages from the Bobulinski trove show that the partners discussed keeping Joe Biden’s name hidden during business discussions.

“Don’t mention Joe being involved, it’s only when u are face to face, I know u know that but they are paranoid,” Gilliar told Bobulinski in a text message on May 20, 2017.

“They should be paranoid about things,” Bobulinski replied.

The Biden campaign denied in a statement on Thursday that Joe Biden ever invested in his son’s companies.

“Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever. He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him,” said Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates in a statement to The Wall Street Journal.

The campaign did not address questions about Biden’s meeting with Bobulinski, according to The Journal.

A lawyer for Hunter Biden did not respond to a request for comment.

"EXCLUSIVE: NY Post’s ‘Smoking Gun’ Hunter Biden Email 100% Authentic, Forensic Analysis Concludes","An email Hunter Biden received in April 2015 from a Burisma executive discussing an introduction to then-Vice President Joe Biden, which lies at the heart of a New York Post investigation, is unquestionably authentic, a cybersecurity expert told the Daily Caller News Foundation on Thursday.

The DCNF obtained a full copy of Hunter Biden’s alleged laptop from former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday. The DCNF provided Robert Graham, the founder of the cybersecurity firm Errata Security, with a copy of the email and its metadata for forensic analysis.

Graham, who has been cited as a cybersecurity expert in The Washington Post, the Associated Press, Wired, Engadget and other news and technology outlets, told the DCNF that he used a cryptographic signature found in the email’s metadata to validate that an account used by Vadym Pozharsky, an advisor to Burisma’s board of directors, emailed Hunter Biden on April 17, 2015.

In the email, Pozharsky thanked Hunter Biden for “inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together.”

The New York Post first reported the email in October, describing it as a “smoking-gun” showing that Hunter Biden had introduced his father to the Burisma executive in 2015.

The email was sent less than a year before Joe Biden pressured former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire a prosecutor who was reportedly investigating the gas company in return for a $1 billion loan guarantee.

Graham previously told the DCNF that emails sent from Gmail, such as Pozharski’s message to Hunter Biden, can be “absolutely verified beyond a shadow of a doubt” by testing its contents against the unique DKIM signature found in its metadata.

Graham used the DKIM signature within the email to verify with a private key on Google’s servers that the sender, recipient, subject, date and body of the message that the DCNF obtained from Giuliani were unchanged from when the email was originally sent in April 2015. (RELATED: Hunter Biden Emails Could Be ‘Absolutely Verified’ If Rudy Giuliani Released The Metadata, Expert Says)

Graham said the only way the email could have been faked is if someone hacked into Google’s servers, found the private key and used it to reverse engineer the email’s DKIM signature.

Email metadata on its own does not provide any indication of whether hacking had anything to with the email’s release, Graham noted.

“Of course, committing criminal hacking doesn’t make true information any less true, so no matter how illegitimately they gathered emails, the contents are provably legitimate,” Graham said.

Joe Biden’s presidential campaign said in a statement that his schedule indicates that no such meeting as alleged in the email took place. However, the campaign later told Politico that they could not rule out the possibility he had a cursory encounter with the Burisma executive.

The email came from a computer that Hunter Biden reportedly dropped off at a Delaware-based computer repair shop in April 2019. The repair shop owner provided Giuliani a copy of the hard drive after it went unclaimed.

Hunter Biden has not denied giving his laptop to the Delaware repair shop. (RELATED: Hunter Biden Isn’t Denying He Gave His Laptop To A Delaware Repair Shop)

Giuliani had initially refused to provide the Daily Caller with a copy of the hard drive in mid-October, saying that questions surrounding the veracity of its contents were “pettifogging nonsense” pushed by the “liberal press.”

The Biden campaign did not immediately return a request for comment.

"Biden Savages Trump For Capitol Riot, But Doesn’t Say If He Agrees With Invoking The 25th Amendment","President-elect Joe Biden savaged President Donald Trump over the riot that broke out Wednesday at the Capitol but stopped short of voicing support for or opposition against invoking the 25th Amendment during his Thursday press conference.

Biden, who ignored shouted questions from reporters about the 25th Amendment while arriving at The Queen Theater in Wilmington, Delaware, opened by stating he would not “speak on” that subject today. (RELATED: Biden Calls On Rioting MAGA Mob To Leave The Capitol — ‘It’s Not Protest. It’s Insurrection’)

He proceeded to call Wednesday’s riot on Capitol Hill “one of the darkest days in the history of our nation” and an “unprecedented assault on our democracy.”

“All of us here grieve the loss of life, grieve the desecration of the people’s house, but what we witnessed yesterday was not dissent,” Biden continued. “It was not disorder, it was not protest. It was chaos.”

The president-elect claimed that Trump “over the past four years has made his contempt for our democracy — our Constitution, the rule of law — clear in everything he has done.”

“He unleashed an all-out assault on our institutions of democracy,” Biden stated. “Yesterday was what the culmination of that unrelenting attack.”

"Here’s Why Media Calls Biden A ‘Devout Catholic’ According To Theologians, Commentators","Media, reporters, and Democrats who call President Joe Biden a “devout Catholic” may do so in attempts to persuade the public that “Catholicism is indistinguishable” from liberal ideology, Dr. Chad Pecknold told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Major media outlets and reporters have celebrated Biden’s Catholicism as “devout” without noting the significance of his divergence from Catholic teaching. Yet politicians and reporters also criticized the Catholicism of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett for her adherence to certain Catholic principles.

“What we are seeing is not something new, but something very old, and very ugly,” Dr. Patrick Deneen told the DCNF.

Biden’s Catholicism has sparked discord within the Catholic Church, but some clergy say focusing on Biden’s pro-abortion policies reduces Catholicism to a single issue and believe that the president will revive Catholic culture in the U.S.

Those who call President Joe Biden a “devout Catholic” may do so in attempts to suggest that “Catholicism is indistinguishable” from liberal ideology, a professor of theology told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

“When a U.S. President cloaks himself in the outward signs of Catholic identity in order to expand access to abortion, or to use executive power to enforce a gender ideology that will inevitably threaten the freedom of the Church in this country, what you have before you is a Trojan Horse,” Dr. Chad Pecknold, an associate professor of Theology at the Catholic University of America, told the DCNF.

An examination by the DCNF found that major media outlets and reporters frequently celebrate Biden’s Catholicism as “devout” without noting the significance of his divergence from Catholic teaching. Yet outlets and reporters also criticized the Catholicism of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett for her adherence to certain Catholic principles.

“What we are seeing is not something new, but something very old, and very ugly,” Dr. Patrick Deneen, a professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame, told the DCNF. (RELATED: Media Treats Catholicism In Vastly Different Ways Depending On Politics)

Redefining Catholicism To Match Liberal Beliefs

According to Deneen, Roman Catholic Americans have long found themselves at odds with non-Catholic, predominantly Protestant countrymen since Catholics look to the pope for ultimate direction — a figure who “commanded an allegiance that transcended national boundaries,” Deneen said.

American Catholics eventually sought acceptance in two ways, Deneen said: they either accepted that religious beliefs were private and had no bearing on public order, or they redefined their faith “in accordance with dominant liberal beliefs.”

“While often at odds with Catholic teaching, such beliefs could be called ‘Catholic’ because it accorded with the widely accepted liberal view that religious belief was entirely a matter of private conscience,” Deneen said. (RELATED: Biden Has Promised To Undo These Pro-Life Policies)

Biden and many other Catholic Democrats have “gravitated” to this idea, according to Deneen, who said it is not surprising that the press celebrates this conformity since most media conforms “entirely to the dominant assumptions of liberalism.”

The New York Times sparked a backlash on Jan. 23 when it claimed that “President Biden is perhaps the most religiously observant commander in chief in half a century,” and tweeted that “a different, more liberal Christianity grounds his life and his policies.”

President Biden is perhaps the most religiously observant commander in chief in half a century. A different, more liberal Christianity grounds his life and his policies. https://t.co/G27AWibfSe — The New York Times (@nytimes) January 23, 2021

The Times story also suggested that Biden’s policies mirrored those of the Holy Father, writing that “Mr. Biden’s policy priorities reflect those of Pope Francis, who has sought to turn the church’s attention from sexual politics to issues like environmental protection, poverty and migration.”

The publication did not mention Biden’s apparent departure from Catholic teaching on abortion or note that Pope Francis has repeatedly condemned abortion. (RELATED: Media Calls Biden A ‘Devout Catholic.’ Where Does He Actually Stand With The Catholic Church?)

‘It’s Not Catholic To Be Catholic’

The Times piece “perfectly encapsulates the liberal lie that ‘it’s not Christian to be Christian,’” Pecknold told the DCNF, “or rather, in this case ‘it’s not Catholic to be Catholic, but it is Catholic to be a Woke Democrat.’”

“For the next four years, as they expand abortion and prosecute nuns, we’ll be hearing this neat fiction that Democrats aren’t anti-Catholic, but the beloved community itself,” Pecknold said.

Liberal thinkers have long viewed Catholicism as a kind of “competitive faith” which must be “privatized, neutralized, or coopted,” Pecknold said.

“Catholics have used a variety of strategies for carving out freedom for the Church,” the theologian told the DCNF. “Joe Biden represents, however, the most disturbing kind of ‘compatibilism’ which eliminates tensions simply through rhetorically insisting that the Catholic Church teaches whatever the Democratic Party teaches.”

Pecknold referred to an incident where Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi “shamed pro-life Catholics for making the abolition of abortion their preeminent voting priority.” Pelosi said in January that pro-life support for former President Donald Trump “gives me great grief as a Catholic.”

Pelosi’s archbishop, San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone, corrected Pelosi’s comments, saying, “Speaker Pelosi does not speak for the Catholic Church” and pointing out that the Catholic Church is strongly opposed to abortion.

“The greatest triumph over the Catholic Faith for the Liberal is not in burning Catholics at the stakes, but ensuring that they come to believe that their Catholicism is indistinguishable from liberal pieties,” Pecknold told the DCNF.

“As Joe Biden enacts law after law, executive order after executive order, the false impression will be given that liberal laws enjoy a kind of Catholic imprimatur,” he added, “and that is the prize that Democrats all in government and all across the media seek.”

Traditional Catholics: ‘The Enemy Of The Regime’

Media approbation of Biden’s Catholicism contrasts sharply to media treatment of Supreme Court Justice Barrett’s Catholicism. Barrett has been consistently questioned for her faith since her name was first floated as one of Trump’s potential Supreme Court picks in 2017.

Democrats, media outlets and activists fixated on Barrett’s adherence to Catholic principles and her large family, suggesting that she was “extreme” and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court. (RELATED: Media Outlets Link Catholic Group Associated With Amy Coney Barrett To ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’)

Deneen told the DCNF that Catholics who follow traditional Catholic teaching are viewed as “the enemy of the regime” whose faith represents “a hostile threat, a view of Catholicism that has remained consistent since the arrival of Catholics in the Protestant new world.”

“The faith of an Amy Coney Barrett must be vilified and denounced as outside the pale, unacceptable to the regime,” Deneen said. “In effect, they must be ostracized, excluded, defeated, even suppressed.”

Some Clergy Embrace Progressive Biden

Biden’s Catholicism has also sparked discord within the Catholic Church. The president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) rebuked Biden for his support for abortion in an inauguration day statement.

Other church leaders criticized this statement and argued that focusing on Biden’s pro-abortion policies reduces Catholicism to a “single issue.”

Clergy like Jesuit James Martin, a frequent critic of former President Trump, suggest that Biden’s policies do not put him at odds with the church but merely present “a different way of being Catholic.”

O’Loughlin (@MikeOLoughlin) February 1, 2021

Martin declined to comment for this story to the DCNF.

“I think I’ll pass on commenting, since it gets into questions about his own personal faith, which I tend to avoid,” he said. Pressed to address why media figures call Biden devout when he publicly advances policies contrary to Catholic teaching, Martin responded, “Oh I think I’ll pass on that one too.”

Jesuit Fr. William Kelley, who recently said mass for the newly elected president at Holy Trinity parish in Georgetown, also declined to comment for this story.

“I would prefer not to comment on the president’s status as a devout Catholic,” Kelley told the DCNF. “I do not really know him.”

Comparing Biden and Barrett, Martin told NPR: “They’re both Catholic, and they’re both sincere in their Catholicism.”

“I think that the, shall we say, the more traditionalist side has been more active and perhaps more — I don’t want to say loud — but maybe public about their faith,” Martin continued. “And I think people tend to forget about the progressive side that I think President Biden probably more fully reflects than Justice Barrett.”

Martin did not express the fears of other clergy and theologians that Biden will negatively impact Catholicism and religious freedom in the United States, but instead expressed hope that the U.S. will experience “a more Catholic culture.”

“Well, certainly his faith in Jesus is going to help him, you know, look at problems with the poor,” he said.

Congratulations to President-elect @JoeBiden and Vice President-elect @KamalaHarris. Mr Biden is the second Catholic US President. Let us pray for unity, peace and reconciliation in our nation. And let us pray for Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris, that they may serve wisely and well. pic.twitter.com/fpOkuTeoIU — James Martin, SJ (@JamesMartinSJ) November 7, 2020

“Hopefully, you know, he’ll be considering what Pope Francis had said on the environment and on other issues,” Martin continued. “But I think you’re also going to see a more Catholic culture — I think, you know, references to the saints, to the sisters he knew, to going to Mass. You know, President Biden is someone who speaks personally very frequently, and a big part of his personal life is his faith. And so, you know, get ready for at least four years of more Catholic culture.”

Not all clergy refrain from condemning the new president, however. (RELATED: ‘We Cannot Stay Silent’ On Biden’s Pro-Abortion Stances, Leading Catholic Bishop Says)

After D.C. Archbishop Wilton Gregory said he would not deny Biden communion at Mass in late November, Fr. Daniel Gee, pastor at St. Rita’s Catholic Church in Alexandria, Virginia, told the DCNF that he would “absolutely not” give Biden communion if the new president were to attend his church.

“Why would I consider someone who is so publicly opposed to the Church’s teachings and so actively working against them to be in communion with us,” Gee told the DCNF. “He is an enemy of the unborn and has flaunted the Church’s teachings for the last 40 years. How dare he even present himself in the first place?”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/02/02/media-biden-devout-catholic-liberal-ideology/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjtv4XU_7P9AhUcM1kFHc-wCUM4KBAWegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw1GHC-RRfVQW90-h4hSooEx,2021-02-02
Biden Administration Quietly Drops Trump Proposal To Track Chinese Influence In US Schools,"The Biden administration quietly withdrew a rule proposed by the Trump administration that would have required American schools and universities to disclose their partnerships with Confucius Institutes, which some U.S. officials allege are front groups for Chinese Communist Party propaganda.

The Trump administration submitted a proposed rule to the Department of Homeland Security on Dec. 31, 2020, entitled “Establishing Requirement for Student and Exchange Visitor Program Certified Schools to Disclose Agreements with Confucius Institutes and Classrooms.”

Around 500 K-12 schools and 65 colleges in the U.S. have partnerships with the Confucius Institute U.S. Center, a U.S.-based affiliate of the Beijing-based Confucius Institute Headquarters. The institute, also known as Hanban, is affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of Education.

Many of Hanban’s directors are members of the Chinese Communist Party or have close ties to the organization, The Daily Caller has previously reported.

The Trump-era proposal was withdrawn from consideration on Jan. 26, according to information at RegInfo.gov, the website for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), which operates under the Office of Management and Budget and the White House.

The OIRA website does not provide any other information about the proposal, or why it was tabled. The website does say that at any point in the review process for a proposed rule, “an agency may withdraw its rule from review and choose not to move forward with it or to resubmit it after further consideration.”

A spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a component of DHS, confirmed that the rule was withdrawn on Jan. 26.

The spokesperson did not elaborate on the reason for withdrawing the rule, and declined to speculate on whether the Biden administration will re-submit it.

“ICE does not speculate about future pre-decisional proposed rules or policies,” the spokesperson told The Daily Caller News Foundation.

President Joe Biden has pledged to review and potentially nullify many of President Trump’s executive orders, particularly those related to immigration issues, which fall under the control of DHS.

Axios reported on Jan. 11 that the Trump administration was trying to push through a rule that would require colleges and K-12 schools to disclose any financial ties to Confucius Institutes. The story noted that Biden could quickly undo the rule once he took office. (RELATED: Trump Administration Designates Confucius Institute As Foreign Mission In Response To Chinese Community Party Influence)

In August, the Trump administration labeled the Confucius Institutes U.S. Center a “foreign mission” of the Chinese Communist Party, a designation typically used for foreign embassies and consulates.

The Foreign Missions Act applies to entities that are “substantially owned or effectively controlled by a foreign government.”

Trump administration officials said that the Chinese government used the Confucius Institutes as part of its propaganda and influence efforts in the U.S.

Sec. of State Mike Pompeo, who spearheaded many of the Trump administration’s China initiatives, said on Aug. 13 that the Confucius Institute was “an entity controlled by the PRC that advances Beijing’s global propaganda and malign influence campaign on U.S. campuses and K-12 classrooms.”

The Confucius Institute U.S. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Biden Administration Expects To Rely On Trump-Era Private Detention Facility To Hold Migrant Teenagers At The Border,"The Department of Health and Human Services refused to say whether the conditions at the private facility will be different than they were under the Trump administration.

The private facility will host up to 700 migrants in hard-sided structures with the option to expand into soft structures if necessary.

The Biden administration expects to need the private facility to house unaccompanied migrant teens in the next two weeks.

A Trump-era temporary private facility for holding unaccompanied migrant teenagers will reopen at the southern border as the Biden administration anticipates it will be needed within the next two weeks.

The spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human (HHS) Administration for Children and Families declined to answer when asked how the Biden administration’s treatment of detained children would differ from conditions during the Trump administration and instead pointed to President Joe Biden’s executive order on reuniting separated families.

“As you are keenly aware, last week, President Biden signed the Executive Order on the Establishment of Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families, which outlines actions the new administration will take on this key issue,” the spokesperson told the Daily Caller News Foundation Wednesday. “HHS is looking forward to working with the Biden Administration on matters related to this and other critical topics.”

The Biden presidency has started by REDUCING financial help for struggling Americans, REFUSING to give everyone healthcare, and REOPENING more child cages. — Peter Daou (@peterdaou) February 6, 2021

The Carrizo Springs Influx Care Facility (ICF) in southern Texas was constructed by the Trump administration in June 2019 and can temporarily house around 700 children in hard-sided structures with the ability to hold overflow in soft-sided structures, the spokesperson told the Daily Caller News Foundation. Migrants have not been sheltered at the facility since late July 2019 and children under the age of 13 will not be permitted to stay at the facility.

“Utilizing temporary ICFs is one step to prevent UAC from remaining in CBP [Customs and Border Protection] facilities for longer than necessary, and ensure that children are placed in an appropriate setting where they can receive care and services, such as education, medical and mental health care, counseling, recreation, and access to legal services,” a spokesperson for the HHS Administration for Children and Families (ACF) told the DCNF.

The private facility was previously a camp for oil workers before it was remodeled to host migrant teens so they did not have to remain at Border Patrol facilities, an NBC affiliate reported. The facility includes a full medical clinic where kids can receive vaccines, a center where they can make international calls, 24/7 access to immigration lawyers, and several classrooms.

The BCFS Health and Human Services, a non-profit based in Texas was issued a $300 million grant from the HHS to construct the private facility after conditions at CBP owned facilities were heavily criticized, according to the San Antonio Report. Each migrant costs between $750 and $800 per day, BCFS CEO Kevin Dinnin said.

“I hate this mission,” Dinnin said in July 2019, The Washington Post reported. “The only reason we do it is to keep the kids out of the Border Patrol jail cells.” (RELATED: Is The US Headed For Open Borders Under Biden’s Immigration Policy?)

Detained UAC’s and families were dangerously overcrowded and did not have access to showers or hot meals, according to a July 2019 report by the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Democratic Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib said, “Mr. Speaker we do have a crisis at our border. It is one of morality. As we have seen this current strategy unfold intentionally and cruelly created by the Trump administration dead set on sending a hate-filled message that those seeking refuge are not welcome in America. I ask you and beg you not to look away,” video shows.

Biden previously said of migrant detention during a Democratic primary debate, “What Latinos should look at is, comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous, number one.”

He continued, “We didn’t lock people up in cages. We didn’t separate families. We didn’t do all of those things.”

HHS operations have been modified to adhere to CDC COVID-19 guidelines and are quarantining and testing UAC’s upon arrival and practicing social distancing, according to the ACF spokesperson. Around 5,700 unaccompanied minors are currently in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).

“The aggressive immigration push by the Biden administration merely meets the checkboxes of fringe open borders advocates and places Americans last amidst a global pandemic and a difficult economic situation,” the Press Secretary Federation for American Immigration Reform Matthew Tragesser told the DCNF.

UAC’s can be released into the interior of the U.S. to stay with “sponsors” designated by their parents as their immigration case proceeds, according to the HHS. The ORR is responsible for vetting potential sponsors and the agency estimates that UAC’s will be released to sponsors within 30 days of arriving at Carrizo Springs, an ACF spokesperson told the DCNF.

CBP, LULAC, and BCFS did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

‘We Don’t Know For Certain’ — Biden Doesn’t Want To ‘Overpromise’ But Hopes The Pandemic ‘Is Going To Be Done’ In A Year,"President Joe Biden stopped short of listing a specific point in time when life will return to normal following the coronavirus pandemic after being asked Tuesday night, but he hoped that by “next Christmas” the country would be in a “very different place.”

“They tell me be careful not to predict things that you don’t know for certain what’s going to happen because then you’ll be held accountable,” Biden answered when asked by host Anderson Cooper when the pandemic “is going to be done?”

“By next Christmas I think we’ll be in a very different circumstance, God willing, than we are today,” he added. (RELATED: White House Announces Largest Increase In Weekly Vaccine Distribution Since Biden Took Office)

“A year from now, I think that there will be significantly fewer people having to be socially distanced, have to wear a mask, but we don’t know,” he continued. “We don’t know for certain, but it is highly unlikely that by the beginning of next year school, traditional school year in September we are not significantly better off than we are today.”

WATCH:

The president added that his coronavirus team estimates that the total number of vaccine doses purchased by the government should be enough to vaccinate 70 percent of the total population and “God willing” achieve herd immunity.

Dr. Anthony Fauci — a member of the White House coronavirus team and POTUS’ chief medical advisor — has recently changed his own assessment for when all Americans would be able to be vaccinated if they so desired.

Fauci said in early February that he believed late-April would be “open season” on vaccinations, regardless of people’s priority groups or specific risk-levels, yet he told CNN on Tuesday that time will more likely occur later in the summer.

The Biden administration has increased its weekly shipments of vaccine doses to all 50 states by nearly 60 percent since the inauguration on January 20, White House press secretary Jen Psaki and coronavirus adviser Jeff Zients announced separately Tuesday.

The White House has also partnered with states and local governments to set up both large-scale vaccination sites in arenas and smaller, community health centers in underserved neighborhoods. Furthermore, the administration began shipping 1 million doses each week directly to pharmacies across the nation and announced plans to double those shipments starting the week of February 22.

Throughout this process, the president has also called on Congress to pass his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which provides another round of direct stimulus payments to qualifying taxpayers and other economic relief measures, as quickly as possible.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/02/16/we-dont-know-for-certain-biden-doesnt-want-to-overpromise-but-hopes-the-pandemic-is-going-to-be-done-in-a-year/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwinjNnW_7P9AhVjD1kFHeTvBIQ4UBAWegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw1foOfOmygxqa_Gz632x-Nj,2021-02-16
Did Joe Biden Say He Won’t Speak Out Against Chinese Genocide? Not Quite,"Critics of President Joe Biden claimed he justified China’s ongoing genocide against Uighur Muslims during his CNN town hall Tuesday night, but that characterization is misleading.

CNN Host Anderson Cooper pressed Biden on the oppression of Uighurs in China’s Xinjiang region, prompting Biden to say he discussed the issue with Chinese Leader Xi Jinping. While Biden did reference “different cultural norms” in his the answer, he confirmed that China will face “repercussions” for its actions and his administration’s official stance is that the Chinese government is carrying out a genocide against the Uighur population. (RELATED: Biden To Sign Order Protecting US Manufacturing As Carrier Strike Group Enters South China Sea)

Some conservative pundits on Twitter implied Biden’s answer justified the genocide as simply an issue of differing “norms,” but Biden was instead explaining Xi’s position on the genocide.

“We must speak up for human rights. It’s who we are,” Biden began, before discussing his call with Xi. “I said, look — Chinese leaders, if you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been the time when China has been victimized by the outer world is when they haven’t been unified at home.”

“So the central, to vastly overstate it, the central principle of Xi Jingping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China. And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that,” Biden added.

He then laid out what American “norms” and culture demanded of an American leader.

“I point out to him: No American president can be sustained as a president if he doesn’t reflect the values of the United States. And so the idea that I’m not going to speak out against what he’s doing in Hong Kong, what he’s doing with the Uighurs … and Taiwan, trying to end the One-China policy … by the way, he said he gets it,” Biden said.

“Culturally, there are different norms that each country and their leaders are expected to follow,” Biden added.

“There will be repercussions for China, and he knows that,” Biden said.

Countering China on the global stage is among one of the top priorities for the Biden administration. The president ordered the Department of Defense to create a task force to review all policy and force posture with regard to China to make the U.S. more effective in countering its goals.

“If we don’t get moving, they’re going to eat our lunch,” Biden said when announcing the task force February 11. “They have major, major new initiatives on rail, they already have rail that goes 325 miles per hour with ease. They are working very hard to do what I think we’re gonna have to do.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/02/17/joe-biden-uighurs-china-cnn-town-hall/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjz3bDV_7P9AhWiEVkFHf08C7Y4PBAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw0jhge9ZRXqGfK2ihgj6wHB,2021-02-17

19 States Urge Biden To Reinstate Keystone After Colonial Pipeline Hack Caused Mass Gas Shortages,"A 19-state coalition urged President Joe Biden to reinstate the Keystone XL Pipeline and reverse his energy policies because of the recent gas shortages.

“A temporary shutdown of one pipeline’s full-capacity operations shouldn’t bring half the country to the brink,” the states wrote to Biden on Monday. “We need more safe and clean energy sources. And that includes the Keystone XL Pipeline.”

“Your impulse to bow to an extreme climate agenda untethered to scientific fact or reality—exhibited by the Keystone XL cancellation and other similar actions—affirmatively deprives Americans of the safe and clean energy supply they need now” the letter said.

A 19-state coalition urged President Joe Biden to reinstate the Keystone XL Pipeline and reverse his energy policies because of the recent gas shortages.

Gas shortages along the east coast caused by a cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline prove the need for reliable gas pipelines in the U.S., the 19-state coalition led by Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen wrote in a letter to Biden on Monday. The U.S. needs better energy infrastructure if the shutdown of one pipeline leads to such extreme spikes in prices and lines at gas stations, the state attorneys general said.

“A temporary shutdown of one pipeline’s full-capacity operations shouldn’t bring half the country to the brink,” the coalition of states wrote to Biden. “We need more safe and clean energy sources. And that includes the Keystone XL Pipeline.”

Biden revoked the Keystone XL Pipeline’s federal permit hours after he was sworn into office on Jan. 20. The White House explained that the U.S. would focus on developing a “clean energy economy” instead of installing gas pipelines. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Republican Attorneys General Plan To Create Legal Roadblocks For Biden Agenda)

But, the letter noted that the Biden administration took multiple emergency steps last week to secure the supply chain and alleviate gas shortages in response to the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack. For example, the administration allowed tankers to transport overweight loads of gasoline on the interstate in ten states and waived environmental regulations preventing a sufficient amount of gas to be taken to certain areas, according to a White House statement.

If Biden was willing to take steps to save the Colonial Pipeline, he shouldn’t also nix the Keystone Pipeline, the attorneys general argued.

“Most Americans—particularly those not located along the coasts—now wish you had been so diligent and responsive before you determined that Keystone XL could be sacrificed on the altar of left-wing virtue signaling,” they wrote to Biden.

“Maybe one day, down the road, we will obtain the Utopian energy profile you desire,” the letter said. “But in the meantime, Americans want practical, effective leadership—not visionary deprivations.” (RELATED: Biden Overstepped Constitutional Authority When He Revoked Keystone Pipeline Permit, Multiple States Allege In Lawsuit)

Former President Barack Obama’s administration, which Biden was a member of, had also determined on multiple occasions that the Keystone Pipeline was a net positive for the economy, the environment and energy security, Knudsen and the other attorneys general said.

The Colonial Pipeline resumed operations Wednesday after the cyberattack, which was conducted by a foreign hacking group, causing its operations to come to a halt for multiple days.

The average price of gas nationwide is $3.05 per gallon as of Monday, according to AAA. The average price in 2020 during the same period was $1.87 per gallon.

In March, Knudsen and 20 other state attorneys general sued the Biden administration over the revocation of the Keystone Pipeline, alleging that it was unconstitutional. States have filed several other lawsuits against Biden over his energy policies.

“To be clear, we believe your Keystone XL decision was unconstitutional and unlawful, and many of the undersigned states are currently pressing those claims in federal court,” the letter stated. “But beyond the basic lawlessness of your decision, the current predicament shows what a poor policy decision it was.” (RELATED: 13 States Sue Biden Administration Over Federal Oil And Gas Leasing Ban)

“Your impulse to bow to an extreme climate agenda untethered to scientific fact or reality—exhibited by the Keystone XL cancellation and other similar actions—affirmatively deprives Americans of the safe and clean energy supply they need now,” according to the letter.

Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming joined Montana in signing the letter Monday.

Biden Vows To Remain In Afghanistan Until Everyone Is Evacuated,"President Joe Biden said Wednesday the U.S. will keep troops in Afghanistan past his Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline if it is necessary to evacuate all Americans who are currently in the country.

“If there are American citizens left, we’re going to stay until we get them all out,” Biden said when asked by ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos whether troops would stay past the deadline if the evacuation is not complete by the end of the month. “We’re going to do everything in our power to get all Americans out and all our allies out.”

The U.S. military withdrawal was all but complete when the Taliban stormed their way into Kabul and ousted the Afghan government, but Biden was forced to send additional forces back into the country to help facilitate the evacuation of American citizens and Afghan allies on the ground. There are an estimated 10,000-15,000 Americans still in Afghanistan that will need to be flown out of the airport in the nation’s capital.

“The commitment holds to get everyone out that, in fact, we can get out and everyone who should come out,” Biden answered when pressed on whether troops would stay past the deadline to evacuate Afghan allies who assisted the U.S. in its fight against the Taliban. The militant group has reportedly been assassinating Afghan military members, government officials and collaborators with the U.S. as it re-imposes strict Sharia rule over the country. (RELATED: Taliban Reportedly Kills Woman Not Wearing Burqa After Promising To Respect Women’s Rights)

Americans currently in Afghanistan have been told by the State Department to shelter in place until they are told by the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, which was already evacuated, to make their way to the airport. However, the U.S. government cannot guarantee the safety of Americans who are trying to make that trek to the airport at this time, and some Americans in the country have described scenes of utter chaos surrounding the runway, with Taliban checkpoints and vast throngs of desperate Afghans standing between them and a safe departure home.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/08/18/joe-biden-afghanistan-taliban-abc-interview-kabul-evacuation/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiT6d3U_7P9AhXGFFkFHc0yBBs4MhAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw2cJIGlujyxzQb3NNYE9Vqr,2021-08-18

However, the U.S. government cannot guarantee the safety of Americans who are trying to make that trek to the airport at this time, and some Americans in the country have described scenes of utter chaos surrounding the runway, with Taliban checkpoints and vast throngs of desperate Afghans standing between them and a safe departure home.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/08/18/joe-biden-afghanistan-taliban-abc-interview-kabul-evacuation/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjtv4XU_7P9AhUcM1kFHc-wCUM4KBAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw1lvTsJ3o_DERof59Ni-43b,2021-08-18
Biden Admin Says It Will Require Private Companies With 100+ Employees To Mandate Vaccine Or Test Weekly,"President Joe Biden announced Thursday that a rule is being developed to require all employers with 100 or more employees to ensure workers are vaccinated or test them weekly.

The president previously mandated vaccines for federal government workers and contractors, noting that they’d need to confirm their vaccination status or undergo various hurdles such as testing. The president signed an executive order expanding on this rule and mandating that all federal executive branch workers be vaccinated, the senior administration officials said. Biden spoke about his “six-pronged strategy” in a speech Thursday evening.

In addition to limiting the loopholes for unvaccinated federal government workers and contractors, the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is developing a rule aimed at private sector businesses. Anyone running a business with 100 or more employees will need to make sure workers are vaccinated or require weekly testing for unvaccinated employees, senior administration officials explained prior to Biden’s remarks.

This new requirement will affect over 80 million workers in the private sector, officials said. Violating the rule could result in a fine of thousands of dollars per employee.

“Some of the biggest companies are already requiring this,” Biden said. “United Airlines, Disney, Tyson food and even Fox News. The bottom line: we’re going to protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated co-workers. We’ll reduce the spread of COVID-19 by increasing the share of the workforce that’s vaccinated in businesses all across America.”

“We’ve been patient, but our patience is wearing thin. Your refusal has cost all of us. Please, do the right thing,” the president added.

WATCH:

OSHA is also working to develop a rule regarding paid time off. Employers affected under the Biden administration’s new rule will need to provide paid time off for workers trying to get vaccinated, as well as for workers affected negatively by the vaccine afterwards.

Biden said this paid time off requirement is “one of the last obstacles that make it difficult for you to get vaccinated.”

“No one should lose pay in order to get vaccinated or take a loved one to get vaccinated,” the president explained.

The new requirements are just the latest step from the Biden administration in combating COVID-19. The administration has urged private sector companies to implement vaccine mandates but stayed away from issuing a federal government-based mandate.

“If you’re a business leader, a nonprofit leader, a state or local leader who has been waiting on full FDA [Food and Drug Administration] approval to require vaccinations, I call on you now to do that. Require it,” Biden said at the end of August after the FDA approved the Pfizer vaccine.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/09/09/joe-biden-require-private-companies-100-more-employees-mandate-vaccines-weekly-testing-coronavirus/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjtv4XU_7P9AhUcM1kFHc-wCUM4KBAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw2AVGI7Yxnz4dKUTSZ5oQJG,2021-09-09
POLL: Less Than Half Of Americans Say Biden Is Mentally Stable Enough To Serve As President,"Less than half of Americans believe President Joe Biden is mentally stable enough to serve as president, according to a Fox News poll released Monday.

Confidence in Biden’s mental fitness has continuously dropped since July, when only 39% of Americans said he was mentally unfit. Just 49% of respondents to Monday’s poll were confident that Biden is mentally fit enough to serve as president, while 48% believe he is not.

Fox said the poll, conducted Sept. 12 – 15, has a 3% margin of error. Democratic respondents to the poll also outnumbered Republican respondents 44% to 39%.

America’s apparent falling confidence in Biden has also manifested in his approval rating, which has continued to fall since June. A Reuters/Ispos poll put the president at just 44% approval on Thursday, a steep drop from the 54% approval he enjoyed when he entered office.

Swaths of Americans are turning sour on Biden’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the poll, with his disapproval rating sitting at 50%. Biden’s current polling is among the lowest for any sitting president at this time in office, excepting former President Donald Trump, who sat at 38% approval his first year. (RELATED: ‘It’s A Nightmare Number For The White House’: Politico Reporter Breaks Down Biden’s Falling Approval Ratings)

Biden’s troubles began with Americans’ lack of confidence in his immigration policies, and while he came into office with a high approval rating for his COVID-19 policies, just 48% approve of those policies now.

Biden also took a hit thanks to his handling of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. While the vast majority of Americans supported ending the 20-year-long war, polling indicates they did not approve of how Biden executed the withdrawal.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/09/20/biden-america-mental-fitness-president/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiQ6K7T_7P9AhXVGFkFHce6DUU4HhAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw1LbjnVgHCAm-oSqbyp0Jrm,2021-09-20
"Biden Promises UN That America Is ‘Not Seeking The New Cold War,’ Highlights Push For ‘Relentless Diplomacy’","President Joe Biden addressed global challenges Tuesday and promised that the United States is “not seeking the new Cold War” with China during his first address to the United Nations General Assembly since becoming president.

Biden’s lengthy speech – which lasted for roughly 34 minutes – addressed the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change and cybersecurity issues, among other subjects. The president first warned that this decade “will quite literally determine our futures” and later promised that America will work “with any nation that steps up.”

“We are not seeking the new Cold War or the world divided into rigid blocks,” Biden declared. “The United States is ready to work with any nation that steps up, that pursues peaceful resolution to shared challenges, even if we have intense disagreement to shared challenges, because we will all suffer the consequences of our failures if we don’t come together to tackle COVID-19, climate change or threats like nuclear proliferation.”

Biden first highlighted the global pandemic, noting that the world is “mourning more than 4.5 million people.” He promised that leaders will “work together to save lives” and said he’ll be “announcing additional commitments” dedicated to helping combat COVID-19 worldwide during Wednesday’s virtual COVID Summit.

“As we look ahead, we will lead on all of the greatest challenges of our time, but we will not go it alone,” Biden said. “We will lead together with our allies and partners, with all who choose and believe as we do, that this is within our power to meet challenges, build a future, lift all of our people and preserve this planet.”

The president made climate change another focus of his speech, warning that the world is at a “code red for humanity.” Biden said scientists and experts are cautioning that “we are fast approaching a point of no return.” (RELATED: ‘Code Red’: Biden Amps Up Messaging On Climate Change)

WATCH:

“Will we meet the threat of climate change already ravaging every part of our world with extreme weather?” the president asked. “Or will we suffer more intense fires and hurricanes, longer heat waves and rising seas?”

Biden touted what his administration has done since taking office, largely ignoring current crises like the border and the chaotic exit from Afghanistan. He said this administration has “prioritized rebuilding our alliances, revitalizing our partnerships, and recognizing they are central to America’s enduring security and prosperity,” but failed to address tensions with France after America’s new trilateral agreement with the U.K. and Australia.

While the president focused on highlighting a strong and united front – namely against China – he never mentioned the country by name. He noted the human rights violations against religious minorities occurring in China’s Xinjiang region but didn’t speak directly to security threats coming from areas like China.

“President Biden’s speech ignored the reality and seriousness of America’s threats and enemies,” former UN ambassador Nikki Haley told Fox News after Biden’s speech. “China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Afghanistan, and terrorism, to name a few.”

Biden briefly mentioned Iran when he promised the U.S. is “committed to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.” He highlighted terrorism – both abroad and at home – during Tuesday’s speech and brought up the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan after nearly 20 years of conflict.

Biden didn’t highlight the chaotic exit from Afghanistan, nor did he focus on the allies and Americans left behind when the U.S. left on Aug. 31. Instead, the president declared the exit to be a sign of the “new period of relentless diplomacy” and the end of a “relentless war.” He also vowed to limit military use and instead expand the country’s use of diplomacy, a point he’s made during past remarks.

WATCH:

At the same time, the president promised that America “will continue to defend ourselves and allies against threats,” but noted “the mission must be clear and achievable.”

“I can tell you where America stands,” Biden said as he finished his remarks. “We will choose to build a better future. We – you and I – we have the will and capacity to make it better. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot afford to waste any more time. Let’s get to work.”

Another crisis facing the administration is convincing the world that America truly “is back,” as the president has claimed. A senior administration official described Biden’s week, which is focused on bilateral meetings, as being “an important, consequential week for … Biden and his leadership on the world stage.”

“As President Joe Biden makes his presidential debut at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, the question is not whether America wants to lead the world any longer, but whether it can,” one CNN analysis noted.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/09/21/joe-biden-un-america-not-seeking-cold-war-china-speech-diplomacy/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjeqJDY_7P9AhVhMVkFHYbKB1g4ZBAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw2CwOyY7nzaw-5p7cR8qwad,2021-09-21
Biden Administration Announces Changes To Get China To Comply With Trump-Era Trade Agreement,"President Joe Biden’s administration plans to revisit the Trump-era first phase trade agreement with China and announced that it will use “all available tools” to enforce compliance, according to senior administration officials.

While Biden criticized the former president’s way of dealing with China, he has often opted to continue policies – like maintaining tariffs and sanctioning Chinese officials – stemming from the Trump administration. Senior administration officials told reporters that Biden remains critical of the phase one agreement, but added that China must “live up to the commitments and promises” it made.

“These include promises that China made in the phase one deal that benefit workers, farmers, and manufacturers across America,” an official said.

Officials didn’t offer specifics as to how the U.S. plans to enforce the trade agreement but said it will begin by engaging China “on its commitments under phase one.” This engagement will include discussions regarding “areas where we believe they may have fallen short,” according to a senior administration official.

The official noted that the administration will restart a tariff exclusion process and admitted the Biden administration isn’t “taking any tools off the table” throughout this process.

U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai will announce Monday that China hasn’t been adhering to the Trump-era trade deal. She “intends to have frank conversations with her counterpart in China about China’s performance under the phase one agreement,” an official said.

The Biden administration has been quietly pushing back on Beijing’s military advancements over the summer, though it has not openly characterized the moves as a direct response to China. The U.S. announced a trilateral deal with Australia and the U.K. to help provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia in mid-September. Biden described that decision as “investing in our alliances and updating them to better meet the threats of today and tomorrow.”

“You know, since the beginning of the administration, we’ve made clear our strategy of competing with China from a position of strength,” a senior administration official said regarding the phase one agreement. “That’s why we’ve been investing in our domestic renewal, getting the pandemic under control, investing in our supply chain resiliency and our technological edge so we can continue to lead the world in industries of the future. And it’s why we’ve been working with our allies and partners to align our approaches to China’s unfair, non-market practices.”

“But unlike his predecessor, President Biden is going to hold China to account where China is falling short of its commitments. Biden also believes that we have to use all our tools to make sure China’s economic and trade policies do not hurt American workers and businesses,” an official added.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/10/04/joe-biden-katherine-tai-phase-one-trade-agreement-china-donald-trump/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjtv4XU_7P9AhUcM1kFHc-wCUM4KBAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw0QGaWxiVqCgV1I1rZ7GiJe,2021-10-04
America Is Becoming More Dependent On Foreign Oil Under Biden,"Fears of a tighter regulatory environment has caused the U.S. to begin importing more oil, threatening its energy independence and security, trade groups representing fossil fuel companies said.

“The signals sent very early on, most notably the cancelation of Keystone and the federal leasing ban, along with all the planned upcoming regulation and all the anti-oil and gas provisions in the reconciliation bill have sown uncertainty in the industry,” Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Colorado-based Western Energy Alliance, told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

American oil imports have steadily climbed from roughly 5.9 million barrels per day in January to more than 6.5 million barrels per day this month, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.

The White House has repeatedly signaled it will regulate the fossil fuel industry but recently doubled down on its call for Russian and Middle Eastern suppliers to ramp up their oil production, Reuters reported.

Fears of a tighter regulatory environment has caused the U.S. to begin importing more oil, threatening its energy independence and security, trade groups representing fossil fuel companies told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

American oil imports have steadily climbed from roughly 5.7 million barrels per day during the week ending Jan. 22 to more than 6.5 million barrels per day during the week ending Oct. 8, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). During former President Donald Trump’s tenure, by comparison, oil imports declined 27% from 8.1 million barrels per day in January 2017 to 5.9 million barrels per day as the U.S. relied less on foreign energy than any other time since 1991.

U.S. oil and gas production, which surged to record levels in 2020 and 2019 respectively, has simultaneously remained low in recent months as the economic recovery has continued, additional EIA data showed.

But immediately after taking office, President Joe Biden revoked the Keystone XL pipeline’s federal permit, prohibited new oil and gas leasing on federal lands, introduced the possibility of broad regulations on carbon-emitting energy producers via executive action and initiated a review of Alaska’s key 6.8-million-acre petroleum reserve. Democratic leaders in Congress, in close coordination with the White House, have also introduced a sweeping $3.5 trillion budget package that would target the fossil fuel industry.

“The signals sent very early on, most notably the cancelation of Keystone and the federal leasing ban, along with all the planned upcoming regulation and all the anti-oil and gas provisions in the reconciliation bill have sown uncertainty in the industry,” Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Colorado-based Western Energy Alliance, told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The Biden administration and the Federal Reserve have mulled regulations that would negatively impact energy companies’ access to capital, which Sgamma said is a major factor in declining U.S. energy production.

On Wednesday, the Department of Labor reversed Trump-era rules requiring private-sector retirement plans to make investment decisions based on the financial interests of workers rather than the environmental impact of companies being invested in. Under the proposal, fiduciaries would be required to consider the environmental implications of their investments.

‘This president favors OPEC+ over American producers’

The White House, though, has recently doubled down on its plea for Middle Eastern and Russian suppliers to ramp up oil production, Reuters reported. In August, the Biden administration was criticized after National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan asked the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its Russian counterpart, which together are known as OPEC+, to boost oil output, a request which the groups later rejected.

The Department of Energy also hinted that it might tap into the emergency petroleum reserves if energy demand continues to outpace supply, according to the Financial Times.

“Were markets properly responding to signals like higher energy prices and increased demand, the American producer would be more quickly ramping up new production,” Sgamma said. “Instead we have a situation where the Biden Administration asks Russia and OPEC to increase production even as they’re doing everything in their power to suppress American production.”

“I’ve actually never seen an energy issue crystalize so clearly in the American mind, as people are feeling the squeeze of high energy prices and looking on with disbelief as this president favors OPEC+ over American producers,” she added.

Since July, energy prices have skyrocketed in the U.S. and abroad with both oil and natural gas hitting multi-year highs. Heating costs may tick up as much as 54% for Americans this winter, the EIA projected on Oct. 13, and gasoline prices rose again Monday, reaching a national average of $3.33 per gallon, according to a AAA database.

The American Petroleum Institute (API), which bills itself as the primary oil and gas industry trade association, has repeatedly argued that the U.S. must take advantage of its own oil and gas resources to combat rising energy prices and supply chain issues.

“The solution to affordable, reliable energy is right here in the United States,” API Senior Vice President of Policy, Economics and Regulatory Affairs Frank Macchiarola told the DCNF in a statement.

“Instead of looking to restrict access and trade and asking other countries to increase their production, the administration should continue the bipartisan tradition of promoting U.S. energy leadership, which deliver jobs, security, and government revenue from U.S. energy produced among the highest environmental standards in the world,” Macchiarola continued. (RELATED: Joe Biden Denies Ever Saying He Opposed Fracking But Promises To Eliminate Oil Industry)

The Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA), another industry group representing energy producers, has pointed to regional hurdles for constructing pipelines to explain why oil and gas imports have recently increased in the U.S.

The group has also argued that California’s denial of fracking permits for climate change reasons has made the state more dependent on foreign energy. California depends on foreign nations — mainly Ecuador, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Mexico — for a plurality of its oil despite having vast resources of its own.

“As global energy consumption grows, the U.S. natural gas and oil industry, governed by commonsense, effective regulations and public-private partnerships, can ensure that America and nations worldwide will have a reliable energy supply to power their homes, businesses, and critical services,” IPAA COO Jeff Eshelman said in a statement to the DCNF.

Biden Ditches Alaska Oil Drilling Project That Would’ve Created Thousands Of Jobs,"The Biden administration abandoned an oil and gas drilling project in Alaska approved by former President Donald Trump, which it had previously defended.

“Today’s affirmation of our legal victory against the Willow project is a win for the climate and for an irreplaceable Alaska landscape,” Jeremy Lieb, an attorney for the group Earthjustice, said in a statement Wednesday. “We are glad to see that President Biden is taking positive steps in his commitment toward a cleaner energy future.”

While the administration chose against appealing a federal ruling that blocked the project, it previously vowed to defend the project and accused environmentalists of “cherry-picking” government records.

The Biden administration abandoned an oil and gas drilling project in Alaska approved by former President Donald Trump, which it had previously defended.

The Department of the Interior failed to file an appeal to a federal judge’s August decision blocking the multi-billion dollar Willow Project being developed by the Texas-based oil and gas firm ConocoPhillips. Judge Sharon Gleason of the U.S. District Court of the District of Alaska ruled that the federal government hadn’t adequately reviewed the emissions profile of the project, which she said would ultimately harm the environment and wildlife.

“Today’s affirmation of our legal victory against the Willow project is a win for the climate and for an irreplaceable Alaska landscape,” Jeremy Lieb, an attorney for the group Earthjustice, said in a statement Wednesday. “We are glad to see that President Biden is taking positive steps in his commitment toward a cleaner energy future.”

The Biden administration had until Tuesday to appeal Gleason’s decision. (RELATED: America Is Becoming More Dependent On Foreign Oil Under Biden)

While the administration chose against appealing the ruling – all but killing the project – it previously vowed to defend the initiative. In a May brief, the Department of Justice accused environmentalists of “cherry-picking” government records and said the Willow Project was in full compliance with relevant laws regulating such leases.

“We hope the Biden administration’s choice to accept the federal court’s decision of halting ConocoPhillips’ Willow project is the beginning of the end of federal backing of fossil fuels,” Greenpeace USA senior research specialist Tim Donaghy said in a statement.

The Trump administration approved the project in October 2020 after an extensive review of its potential ecological impacts. Former Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said Willow was part of Trump’s pledge to increase “American energy independence.”

But several environmental groups joined a lawsuit challenging the project shortly after the Interior Department signed off on it.

The entire congressional delegation from Alaska – Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and Rep. Don Young – have been vocal proponents of the project, arguing it would produce 100,000 barrels of oil per day, lead to $10 billion in government revenue and create 2,000 construction jobs and 300 permanent jobs. They also applauded the Biden administration after its brief defending Willow in May.

“This decision won’t do one thing to help the environment,” Sullivan said in a statement following the August ruling. “To the contrary, it further delays one of Alaska’s most strategic energy development projects, which will benefit our adversaries that produce oil, like Russia, Venezuela and Iran, whose environmental standards are some of the worst in the world.”

“The Biden Administration needs to keep its commitment to the Alaskan people by continuing to defend the Willow project in court for the sake of American energy,” he continued. (RELATED: Is The Shift To Renewable Energy Propelling Us Into An Energy Crisis?)

Since July, oil and natural gas have hit multi-year highs across the world. The federal government recently projected that heating costs could increase 54% for Americans this winter and gasoline ticked up again Wednesday, reaching a national average of $3.36 per gallon, according to a AAA database.

The U.S. has also shown signs of returning to dependence on the Middle East and Russia for much of its oil and natural gas supply. The White House has repeatedly urged the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to boost its output amid rising prices.

The Interior Department declined to comment on the administration’s decision not to appeal the ruling. ConocoPhillips didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Psaki Says The Last Time Biden Was At The Border Was Driving By It In 2008,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki defended on Friday President Joe Biden’s no-show at the southern border, informing reporters that Biden did, in fact, visit the border while on the campaign trail in 2008.

“Why did President Biden say he has been to the border?” Fox News’ Senior White House Correspondent Peter Doocy asked, referring to Biden’s CNN Townhall Thursday night.

“Well, Peter, as you may have seen, there’s been reporting that he did drive through the border when he was on the campaign trail in 2008, and he is certainly familiar with the fact, and it stuck with him, the fact that in El Paso the border goes right through the center of town,” Psaki replied. “But the most important thing everyone should know and understand is that the president has worked on these issues throughout his entire career and is well versed in every aspect of our immigration system, including the border.”

Psaki then touted Biden’s travels as vice president, noting he went to Mexico and Central America “ten times to address border issues.”

“He does not need a visit to the border to know what a mess was left by the last administration, that’s his view,” she continued. (RELATED: Missouri, Texas Sue Biden Administration Over Border Wall)

Biden addressed concerns he should visit the southern border during the town hall Thursday night after a Republican law student questioned his absence.

“I know [the southern border] well, I guess I should go down, but the whole point of it is I haven’t had a whole hell of a lot of time to get down,” the president said. “I’ve been spending time going around, looking at the $900 billion damage done by hurricanes and floods and weather and traveling around the world.”

Border crossings have spiked since Biden took office, with agents encountering 17,097 migrants in August of 2021 compared with just 694 in August of 2020, according to Todd Bensman with the Center for Immigration Studies, an immigration-skeptical think tank. Migrants also told the Daily Caller they “thank [Biden] very much” for his immigration policies which they say encouraged them to make the trek.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/10/22/jen-psaki-joe-biden-southern-border/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiJqYTW_7P9AhWFFVkFHSTgCFc4RhAWegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw3Pl5Kh_95rIo76bE0a7JOc,2021-10-22
"Biden Blames Russia, OPEC Nations For Skyrocketing Gas Prices","President Joe Biden claimed Tuesday that gas prices have skyrocketed due to Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) refusing to “pump more oil.”

Biden delivered his remarks during the United Nations climate conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, where he was asked to comment on when Americans could expect to see everyday prices come down, including those of gas.

The president reiterated his administration’s assertion that the uptick in consumer prices was, first and foremost, due to supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic.

“If you take a look at gas prices… That is a consequence of, thus far, the refusal of Russia or the OPEC nations to pump more oil,” Biden said. “We’ll see what happens on that score sooner than later.”

Despite his decisions to revoke the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline and impose a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing and drilling permits for U.S. lands and waters, the president has accused OPEC of being unwilling to significantly ramp up their production of oil to combat rising gasoline prices. (RELATED: Top OPEC Official Blames High Gas Prices On Global Shift To Renewable Energy)

“[T]he idea that Russia and Saudi Arabia and other major producers are not going to pump more oil so people can have gasoline to get to and from work, for example, is not right,” Biden said Sunday at the G20 summit.

Many OPEC members have shunned Biden’s pleas, arguing that they shouldn’t produce oil at a faster rate due to the uncertainties associated with the pandemic, according to Al Jazeera.

Biden Promises To Axe Nord Stream 2 If Russia Invades Ukraine But Won’t Explain How,"President Joe Biden promised Monday that “there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2” if Russia invades Ukraine, though he avoided explaining how he plans to ensure it doesn’t move forward.

The $11 billion Russia-to-Germany gas pipeline has become a focus in recent weeks amid ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz met with Biden at the White House on Monday, and the American president was expected to press Scholz on coming up with a sanctions package should the invasion move ahead, senior administration officials explained in a call previewing the meeting.

While Biden, speaking to reporters at a joint press conference after the meeting, told reporters emphatically that there will “no longer [be] a Nord Stream 2” if Russia invades Ukraine, Scholz wouldn’t address what would happen to the pipeline. The German chancellor only reiterated that allies would be united in their action.

“I promise you, we will be able to do it,” Biden said when pressed about how he would ensure the pipeline doesn’t move forward.

WATCH:

Biden’s comments echo those of State Department spokesperson Ned Price, who said in January that the pipeline “will not move forward” in the event of a Russian invasion. Price highlighted the “leverage” the U.S. has with the pipeline because “gas is not currently flowing through” it – a comment the White House has reiterated as it deals with the tensions.

It’s unclear exactly how much influence the U.S. has over Nord Stream 2, and Biden’s comments on Monday offered little in way of clarifying. The president did note that an invasion means “tanks or troops crossing.” (RELATED: ‘That’s Not On The Table,’ Biden Says On Sending US Troops To Ukraine)

Nord Stream 2 would connect Russia and Germany via the Baltic Sea, and gas exports to Germany would double according to BBC News. Price has also declined to say exactly how the U.S. plans to stop the pipeline from becoming operational.

Biden’s vow to stop Nord Stream 2 if Russia invades and Scholz’s unwillingness to explicitly say whether it will become operational under these conditions indicates that although the two world leaders touted unity, it remains unclear whether the meeting produced significant agreements.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/02/07/joe-biden-promises-end-nord-stream-2-russia-invades-ukraine/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjtv4XU_7P9AhUcM1kFHc-wCUM4KBAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw2r3EDDpDr5nWgSp7vDCKQa,2022-02-07
Biden Announces Ban On Russian Oil As Ukraine Invasion Continues,"President Joe Biden announced a ban on U.S. imports of Russian energy Tuesday as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues.

European allies have made no such decision yet, though the countries were consulted as the U.S. weighed making the move. Biden said the ban applies to “all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy.” (RELATED: ‘Putin Chose This War’: Biden Lays Out New Sanctions Against Russia After Full-Scale Invasion)

“That means Russian oil will no longer be accepted at U.S. ports, and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine,” Biden, speaking to the nation from the White House, said. “This is a move that has strong bipartisan support in Congress and, I believe, in the country.”

Biden’s announcement coincides with a bipartisan push from lawmakers to ban imports of Russian oil. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi noted Sunday that Congress was “exploring” legislation to support this move, according to Reuters, suggesting the Biden administration was pressured to announce a ban.

WATCH:

The president described this decision as one that targets “the main artery of Russia’s economy” and declared that the U.S. “will not be part of subsidizing [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s war.”

“We’re moving forward, understanding that many of our European allies and partners may not be in a position to join us,” Biden said. “The United States produces far more oil domestically than all of the European countries combined.”

The ban also coincides with record-high gas prices in the U.S., with the national price for one gallon of gas breaking the previous high from 2008, AAA data shows. The price of gas has risen during Biden’s presidency, and the administration first blamed the COVID-19 pandemic and are now pointing to the Russian invasion.

“The decision today is not without cost here at home,” Biden said Tuesday. “Putin’s war is already hurting American families at the gas pump. Since Putin began his military build-up at the Ukrainian border, the price of gas in America went up 75 cents, and with this action is going to go up further. I’m going to do everything I can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home.”

White House press secretary Jen Psaki also blamed oil companies, telling reporters during Monday’s press briefing that “there are 9,000 unused, approved drilling permits.” She also noted the U.S. continues to produce oil at “record numbers.”

“So I would suggest you ask the oil companies why they’re not using those if there’s a desire to drill more,” Psaki said.

Biden, upon announcing the ban, pushed back on suggestions that his policies have held back domestic energy production. The president previously signed an executive order to halt new oil production for public plants.

“It’s simply not true,” the president said before adding that “this crisis is a stark reminder to … become energy independent.”

This latest announcement highlights the ever-changing decisions surrounding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as just last week Psaki pushed back on the notion. During a press briefing March 3, Psaki said the U.S. didn’t “have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy.”

Her comments came one day after President Joe Biden said “nothing is off the table” when pressed about the possibility of banning Russian oil imports.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/03/08/joe-biden-ban-russian-oil-invasion-ukraine/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiJqYTW_7P9AhWFFVkFHSTgCFc4RhAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw2SnlTyPMMiOBgoui7PuqFD,2022-03-08
‘Simply Not True’: Biden Says He Isn’t Holding Back US Energy Production,"President Joe Biden said his administration hasn’t prevented domestic energy production, even after more than a year of pushing policies designed to phase out fossil fuels.

“It is simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production,” Biden remarked at the White House on Tuesday. “That is simply not true.”

The president announced earlier in his speech that the U.S. would ban all oil imports from Russia in response to the nation’s invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. imported more than 670,000 barrels of oil per day from Russia in 2021, government data showed.

Biden said that energy companies have increased energy production during his tenure. However, the Energy Information Administration, which tracks global energy markets, forecasted on Feb. 18 that the U.S. would again become a net importer of oil in 2022. (RELATED: ANALYSIS: White House Keeps Misleading Public On Oil, Gas Leasing. Here Are The Facts)

More, fossil fuel industry groups have urged the Biden administration to reverse its energy policies and prioritize domestic production of oil and natural gas in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Both Republicans and Democrats have urged the president to open up avenues of domestic energy production amid the Ukraine crisis, which has roiled global oil markets.

“The United States has shown its global energy dominance over the past decade. Unfortunately, this has been threatened by the current Administration’s policies against domestic natural gas and oil production,” Independent Petroleum Association of America COO Jeff Eshelman told the Daily Caller News Foundation in early March. (RELATED: ANALYSIS: How Biden’s Energy Policies Enabled Putin’s Aggression In Ukraine)

Since taking office, President Joe Biden has waged a war on fossil fuels, nixing the Keystone XL oil pipeline, ditching an oil drilling project in Alaska, introducing sweeping fossil fuel regulations and making it harder for utilities to gain approval for natural gas projects. His administration has also defied multiple court-ordered deadlines to restart the federal oil and gas leasing program after Biden attempted to halt the program altogether.

Biden has also aggressively pushed renewable forms of energy despite doubts from experts.

“We share the goal of reducing reliance on foreign energy sources and urge policymakers to advance American energy leadership and expand domestic production to counter Russia’s influence in global energy markets,” Mike Sommers, the president and chief executive of industry group the American Petroleum Institute, said in a statement.

Biden’s Green Transition May Usher In More Energy Insecurity. Here’s How,"The Biden administration has pushed green energy in the wake of the Ukraine crisis — saying it would ensure U.S. energy independence — but has failed to address foreign mining and refining dominance, according to industry leaders.

A so-called green transition would shift dependency from fossil fuel resources like oil, natural gas and coal which are abundant in the U.S., to critical minerals like cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel, graphite and zinc which are largely mined and refined by China, Russia and other foreign powers.

“The focus on renewables, in essence, is a license to trade what dependency we may have had on the Middle East with an almost exclusive dependency on Communist China for the materials and the processing,” Institute for Energy Research President Tom Pyle told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an interview.

“If foreign adversarial nations stopped selling us critical minerals, it would be devastating for our nation, it would be devastating for the Department of Defense, it would be devastating for the medical instrument company, it would be devastating for our everyday lives,” Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber, the top Republican on the Natural Resources Energy and Mineral Subcommittee, told the DCNF.

The Biden administration has pushed green energy in the wake of the Ukraine crisis — saying it would ensure U.S. energy independence — but has failed to address foreign mining and refining dominance, the key to renewable energy security, according to industry leaders.

The administration has argued that renewable energy technologies, like solar, wind and electric vehicles, aren’t dependent on fossil fuels and would lead to lower costs for consumers over the long term, a line of argument that Democratic lawmakers have also parroted in recent days. On Wednesday, the average price of gasoline nationwide reached $4.25 per gallon as of March 9, the highest level in history and more than 52% higher than a year ago, according to AAA data.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has destabilized global crude oil and natural gas markets, which Russia has established itself as a major player in over the last decade. President Joe Biden announced a ban on Russian oil imports amid the crisis, sending prices higher.

“The only viable path to energy independence for the American economy is to reduce the energy intensity of our economy overall and ultimately to reduce it to zero and to get ourselves to a position where we are no longer reliant on fossil fuels,” National Economic Council Director Brian Deese told Bloomberg on Tuesday.

“That’s a long term project, but what we are seeing today — and the geopolitics and the economic pain — should only reinforce our efforts to try to move there more quickly,” he added. (RELATED: Electric Vehicle Industry Hit With Bad News Amid Ukraine Crisis)

When asked about energy independence on Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki similarly said transitioning away from fossil fuels would alleviate high energy costs faster than building the canceled Keystone XL pipeline.

Democratic Sen. Sheldon White House tweeted Wednesday that switching to renewables would lower costs and “insulate consumers from price spikes.” California Rep. Ro Khanna, the top Democrat on the Oversight Subcommittee on Environment, added that the U.S. must have a “moonshot to invest in renewable energy” if it wants to lower gasoline prices long-term.

However, a so-called green transition would shift dependency from fossil fuel resources like oil, natural gas and coal which are abundant in the U.S., to critical minerals like cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel, graphite and zinc which are largely mined and refined by China, Russia and other foreign powers. Such minerals are essential for the production of electric vehicle batteries, battery storage facilities, solar panels and wind turbines, according to a 2021 International Energy Agency (IEA) report.

“The data shows a looming mismatch between the world’s strengthened climate ambitions and the availability of critical minerals that are essential to realizing those ambitions,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said after the report was released. (RELATED: Senators Introduce Bipartisan Legislation To End US Reliance On Chinese Minerals)

The average electric car needs six times more mineral resources than a conventional car while a single onshore wind turbine plant requires nine times more minerals than a typical fossil fuel plant, the IEA report showed. A single offshore wind farm needs a whopping 8,000 kilograms of copper to produce one megawatt, enough to power just 400-900 homes.

‘Green New Deal World’

But China controlled about 55% of the world’s mining capacity and 85% of global mineral refining in 2020, a White House supply chain report from June concluded. The report pointed to Russia as another key global producer of minerals.

Experts have warned that shifting rapidly to renewables could therefore decrease energy security, forcing reliance on countries that have access to the highly sought-after minerals. Biden has committed to aggressive climate goals such as achieving a completely carbon-free grid by 2035 and net-zero emissions by 2050.

“The focus on renewables, in essence, is a license to trade what dependency we may have had on the Middle East with an almost exclusive dependency on Communist China for the materials and the processing,” Institute for Energy Research President Tom Pyle told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an interview.

“About 20% of our oil is imported directly from the Middle East,” he continued. “Today, without any changes to the landscape, we’d be about 80% dependent on China, in a ‘Green New Deal world.'”

Pyle compared the critical mineral trade to the direct Russia-to-Germany natural gas Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Critics, including U.S. lawmakers, slammed the pipeline for its potential to tether European energy supply to Russian state-run energy firms.

The German government halted its review of the pipeline amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February.

In 2021, the U.S. mined about 6% of the global copper supply, 0.4% of global cobalt supplies, 0.67% of the world’s nickel, 0% of global graphite supply and about 5.7% of the world’s zinc, the annual U.S. Geological Survey analysis published in January showed.

‘Terribly Far Behind’

On Feb. 22, the Biden administration announced an all-of-government approach to boosting domestic critical mineral supplies. A White House fact sheet said critical mineral demand is projected to increase 400-600% in the coming decades while demand for minerals important for electric vehicles specifically would increase by up to 4,000%.

The president’s plan included a series of funding agreements with the private sector on future domestic mining and refining projects. As part of the initiative, the Departments of Defense, State and Energy also unveiled a plan to stockpile minerals for future use.

Miners, however, slammed the administration’s plan, saying it would mean greater reliance on foreign materials since it would begin immediately stockpiling minerals not yet mined in the U.S., Reuters reported. The National Mining Association (NMA) applauded the effort but suggested Biden should push harder for domestic production.

“The challenge is: Is that going to transfer to enabling policies from the permitting authorities here in the United States to actually stand up and incentivize new mining, new mines, new mine production, mine expansions, for materials that are essential,” NMA President and CEO Rich Nolan told the DCNF. (RELATED: ‘A Mad Scramble’: One Rare Mineral May Spell Doom For Electric Vehicle Market)

“It’s more secure, coming from inside our borders than it is from overseas, especially when a lot of the suppliers now, who are trying to corner the market, include hostile regimes such as China and Russia,” he added.

Nolan noted the U.S. environmental review process for approving new mining projects is cumbersome and can cause American mines to fall behind their foreign rivals. It takes an estimated 10 years for the federal government to approve a mining permit in the U.S., one of the longest approval processes in the world, according to the NMA.

“The US is terribly far behind,” he said. “When you look at even our allies in Canada and Australia, it can take two to three years. That’s a huge problem.”

He added that, in its report, the White House completely neglected to address how the Department of Interior (DOI), which oversees permitting for mine projects, would improve the regulatory process. Instead, the DOI opened the door for further regulations and legal hurdles, Nolan said.

Environmentalists have opposed mining projects around the world, arguing they are detrimental to the surrounding ecosystem and environment.

In January, the DOI nixed the permits for the Twin Metals Minnesota project approved during the Trump administration, explaining that it hadn’t undergone a complete environmental review. The project would have produced copper, nickel, cobalt and platinum and created union jobs.

“It was purely a political decision,” Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber, the top Republican on the Natural Resources Energy and Mineral Subcommittee, told the DCNF in an interview. “We need to secure our critical minerals, we need energy and mining dominance in this nation.”

An estimated 95% of U.S. nickel reserves, 88% of U.S. cobalt reserves and more than 30% of U.S. copper reserves are located at the now-cancelled Twin Metals site, according to Stauber. (RELATED: LG Abandons Solar Panel Business Amid Supply Chain Issues, High Costs)

“If foreign adversarial nations stopped selling us critical minerals, it would be devastating for our nation, it would be devastating for the Department of Defense, it would be devastating for the medical instrument company, it would be devastating for our everyday lives,” Stauber said, noting the other areas of the economy dependent on minerals.

“So we have the opportunity to mine these minerals in the United States of America, and this administration is hell bent on banning mining across this nation,” he continued.

"Biden Says He’s ‘Not Stupid,’ Immediately Steps On A Rake","President Joe Biden said Thursday despite his Irish roots he’s “not stupid” before immediately confusing his wife’s father and grandfather.

“I just want you to know, I may be Irish, but I’m not stupid,” the president said while speaking at the Annual Friends of Ireland Luncheon. “I married Domenic Giacoppo’s daughter.”

WATCH:

First Lady Jill Biden was born to Donald Carl Jacobs and Bonny Jean Jacobs. Her grandfather, Domenico Giacoppo, is from the tiny village of Gesso in Sicily, according to Forbes. When Giacoppo was two, his family left Italy and headed to Ellis Island before settling in New Jersey, according to Forbes.

Biden attended the gala for the Ireland Funds on Wednesday, an annual dinner to promote relations between Ireland and the U.S.. Ireland’s leader, Micheál Martin, also attended the event but later tested positive for the coronavirus, according to USA Today. A spokesperson for Biden said the leaders were not in close contact.

How Biden Raised Gas Prices Without Anyone Noticing,"U.S. pump prices have surged throughout President Joe Biden’s tenure in office, even as Democrats continue to blame the spike on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Big Oil companies.

The average price of gasoline nationwide increased a whopping 48.4% between Biden’s January 2021 inauguration and Feb. 21, three days before Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.

“We haven’t had a federal lease sale in North Dakota in over a year,” Republican North Dakota Rep. Kelly Armstrong, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Energy Subcommittee, told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an interview. “These are real things — that you are sending signals, not just to energy companies, but also to Wall Street.”

President Joe Biden and Democrats have blamed the continued gasoline price surge on Big Oil and Russia’s invasion, but pump prices have climbed throughout his tenure.

While Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has destabilized global energy markets, causing an historic supply crunch, high gasoline prices have been the norm throughout Biden’s first 14 months, federal data showed. Experts have blamed the high prices on the administration’s energy and climate policies disincentivizing domestic fossil fuel production.

Since Russia’s invasion, gasoline prices have increased more than 20%, from $3.53 per gallon to $4.24 per gallon, according to the Energy Information Administration. However, pump prices increased a whopping 48.4% between Biden’s January 2021 inauguration and Feb. 21, three days before Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine.

Democrats and the White House initially blamed Russia for the entirety of the price increases, calling it “Putin’s gas price hike,” before also accusing oil companies of profiteering off the crisis. (RELATED: ‘Slap In The Face’: Dems’ Solution To High Gas Prices Is More Stimulus Checks)

“While there is no denying that Putin’s war has led to instability on global energy markets, I remain concerned that the oil industry is not doing enough to protect American consumers from rising gas prices,” House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva wrote to Big Oil executives on March 18.

However, fossil fuel industry groups and Republicans have slammed the Biden administration for its long string of policies dating back to the president’s first day in office. They accused Biden of waging a war on fossil fuels, causing decreased capital flows to domestic projects.

“The United States has shown its global energy dominance over the past decade,” Independent Petroleum Association of America COO Jeff Eshelman told the Daily Caller News Foundation in February. “Unfortunately, this has been threatened by the current Administration’s policies against domestic natural gas and oil production.”

“Make no mistake, natural gas and oil production here at home benefits not only our nation, but also our worldwide allies,” he added. “For America, it means less reliance on oil imports from unfriendly countries.” (RELATED: Biden Administration Backtracks On Media Reports Signaling Oil, Gas Leasing Resumption)

Among Biden’s first actions as president was to revoke the Keystone XL pipeline’s federal permit, which would have transported more crude oil into the U.S. from Canada. The administration also abandoned the Willow Project, a significant oil and gas project in Alaska approved by the Trump administration that would have produced 100,000 barrels of oil per day.

After a federal judge ordered the Biden administration to halt its attempted ban on new federal land drilling leases, the Department of the Interior has dragged its feet and defied multiple court-ordered deadlines to restart the program. The Interior Department also chose not to appeal a recent ruling that prohibited an offshore drilling lease in the Gulf of Mexico the agency facilitated in the fall.

Further, the administration hasn’t developed a new five-year federal leasing program — which is needed to plan future lease sales — to replace the current one which expires in late June 2022, according to a Congressional Research Service report from December. The most recent offshore lease sale occurred in 2020 during the Trump administration.

Overall, there are just 601 oil and gas drilling rigs active in the U.S., the latest government data showed. The number of rigs peaked under the Trump administration in 2018 when there were 1,032 active.

The U.S. is also on track to again become a net importer of oil in 2022 after briefly reaching net exporter status in 2020. The U.S. became a net exporter of total energy in 2019, factoring in oil, coal and natural gas trade, for the first time in 75 years. (RELATED: Biden Administration’s Offshore Oil Leasing Policy Will Crush American Energy Security, Experts Say)

“We haven’t had a federal lease sale in North Dakota in over a year,” Republican North Dakota Rep. Kelly Armstrong, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Energy Subcommittee, told the DCNF in an interview. “These are real things — that you are sending signals, not just to energy companies, but also to Wall Street.”

“(Drilling projects) take several years to do and a ton of capital the raise,” he continued. “How are you going to do that when you have an administration basically signaling that they want nothing to do with oil and gas?”

North Dakota produced 1.1 million barrels of oil per day in 2021, the third-largest statewide output, according to federal data.

"Biden Promises Lower Gas Prices After Emergency Reserve Release, Suggests ‘Up To 35 Cents’ Lower","President Joe Biden promised Thursday that gas prices will decrease after tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to release tens of millions of oil barrels.

“Mr. President, how much, in monetary terms, do you estimate these announcements will reduce gas prices and when can Americans expect to see these changes?” Daily Caller Senior White House correspondent Shelby Talcott asked.

“That’s a really important question and there’s no firm answer to it, but prices already came down,” Biden began. “When it was announced ahead of time that Biden was going to release so many barrels of oil from this probe. They’ve already come down. My guess is, we’ll see it come down and continue to come down, but how far down I don’t think anyone can tell.”

The president claimed there will be a slight delay in dropping gas prices by days and weeks, but the prices will decrease by an unknown range.

WATCH:

“But it will come down,” he continued. “And it could come down fairly significantly. It could come down [to] a better part of anything from 10 cents to 35 cents a gallon, it’s unknown at this point.” (RELATED: Biden Calls For Raising Taxes On Oil Drillers Amid Energy Crisis)

Biden also noted the administration is waiting to see how many barrels the European allies release from their supply, which he estimated could range from 30-50 million barrels. Lowering the price of gas will greatly depend on the number of oil barrels released by countries’ supplies, the president concluded.

The administration is planning to release an average of one million barrels per day for 180 consecutive days after facing increasing pressure to combat rising gas prices in the aftermath of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The average gas price has continued to exceed $4 per gallon, reaching around $4.32 per gallon March 14.

The president has ordered a total of 80 million from the SPR, first ordering 50 million in November to combat the rising inflation. He then joined 30 nations in the International Energy Agency (IEA) to release 30 million barrels of U.S. oil on March 1 in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/03/31/biden-promises-lower-gas-prices-35-cents/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjeqJDY_7P9AhVhMVkFHYbKB1g4ZBAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw0STDbria3PPPBgOwOXWb1b,2022-03-31
‘Big Mama’ Joins ‘Corn Pop’ In Joe Biden’s Colorful Cast Of Characters,"President Joe Biden detailed Monday an alleged encounter with a female truck driver named “Big Mama” during a trucker’s strike when he was a young senator.

“I used to drive a truck, it’s a long story, anyways, it’s getting hard, and I thought I was going to get to drive one of these suckers today,” Biden said, pointing to the Mack truck behind him. “Anyway, that’s another story too. Look, it’s getting harder and harder to recruit new drivers, particularly women and people of color, to an industry that this nation and our economy desperately needs at full strength.”

“I remember, I gotta digress for one second, I got a commercial license because my dad used to run an automobile agency, and I used to have to go to a body shop up in Philadelphia from Wilmington,” Biden said.

“During the truckers strike years later when I was a young Senator, there was a guy who ran steel … and I decided to ride out with him to see what it was like on the strike and I was driving going through Shiloh, Ohio and his handle was Big Ten and I remember all the truck stops were being blockaded at the time and he called and said ‘Big Ten…’ and the only woman truck driver I ever knew I met that day, she said ‘this is Big Mama, no room,'” Biden recounted.

“I swear to God, true story. And he said ‘I’ve got a United States Senator driving my truck,’ [and] she said ‘I got the damn president in mine, so what?’ I’ll never forget that, I was a very powerful guy, anyway, that was the first woman trucker I met.” (RELATED: Tucker Debuts ‘Actual Footage’ Of Joe Biden’s Confrontation With Corn Pop)

Saudi Comedians Roast Biden And Harris Like ‘SNL’ Never Would,"Two Saudi Arabian comedians are going viral on social media Tuesday for a sketch roasting President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.

The sketch portrays Biden as a sleepy and confused and Harris as desperately trying to manage his repeated missteps and gaffes. A television station owned by the Middle East Broadcasting Center, which is part of a Saudi Arabian government-owned conglomerate, broadcasted the 67-second sketch, according to Mediaite.

WATCH: Saudi Arabia TV makes fun of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and honestly it’s funnier than SNL pic.twitter.com/4lhy8iRSGY — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) April 12, 2022

The sketch opens with comedians portraying Biden and Harris walking onto a stage with flags in front of reporters for a “press conference.” The actor playing Biden points at the crowd and immediately tries to exit, so the actor portraying Harris herds him back to where he’s supposed to be on-stage.

Once at the podium, the person playing Biden says he’s there to “talk about the crisis [in] Spain,” after which the person portraying Harris appears to whisper and correct him. “Yeah, we gotta talk about the crisis in Africa,” he says, before finally getting to “Russia.” He then appears to forget Russian President Vladimir Putin’s name, prompting the vice president character to whisper to correct him again.

“Listen to me, I have [a] very important message to you. The message is…” Before the actor playing the president can finish, he pretends to fall asleep, so the Harris character nudges him awake. He bursts into “And the President of China!” before being whispered to again.

The comedian portraying Biden responds with “Thank you to correct me, First Lady,” seemingly playing off a recent incident in which Biden accidentally referred to Harris as the First Lady, according to the New York Post. The Biden character then falls asleep again, forcing the VP character to pick him up and drag him off stage while telling the crowd, “Thank you all. Hallelujah! Clap to your president!” (RELATED: ‘Is My Brain Okay’ SNL Skit Rips The Real Life Impact Of COVID Lockdowns… And It’s Terrifyingly Accurate)

Saudi Arabia was recently reported to have snubbed Biden. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman allegedly refused to take a call from Biden, who was attempting to discuss the country’s oil production amid rising prices in the U.S., according to Mediaite.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/04/12/saudi-comedians-roast-biden-harris/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiK-7HX_7P9AhXYF1kFHR7tDmc4WhAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw0RL7bn7W8wjYcTQ-ZQMHL7,2022-04-12
Biden Turns To Venezuelan Dictator For Oil After Canceling US Lease Sales,"The Biden administration is expected to soon announce it would ease sanctions on Venezuelan oil amid the ongoing energy crisis, several media outlets reported.

The federal government will ease “some” of the energy sanctions on Venezuela, two senior administration officials told CNN. In addition, U.S. oil corporation Chevron will be allowed to enter into negotiations with Venezuelan state-owned firm PDVSA over potential continued operations in the South American oil-rich nation.

As part of the deal, Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro agreed to open talks with opposition leader Juan Guaidó, Reuters reported.

“[The U.S. agreed to lift some sanctions] on the basis of ambitious, concrete and irreversible outcomes that empower the Venezuelan people to determine the future in their country through democratic elections,” one official told CNN.

While the U.S. has pursued an aggressive sanctions regime against Venezuela for more than 15 years, in 2019 the Trump administration imposed a fresh swath of restrictions on the South American nation’s oil industry to renew pressure on Maduro, a 2021 report from the Congressional Research Service showed. Trump administration White House officials said the sanctions would reduce Venezuela’s oil exports by $11 billion.

As a result of the Trump-era sanctions, the U.S. hasn’t imported oil from Venezuela since May 2019, according to government data. The U.S. imported about 462,000 barrels of oil per day from Venezuela in 2018, and it imported 670,000 barrels per day from Russia in 2021.

Chevron has recently lobbied the federal government to remove the sanctions, according to Senate disclosures.

“Our experience buying Russian energy should have taught President Biden that buying energy from tyrants is a dangerous proposition,” Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member John Barrasso said in a statement.

“Yet President Biden continues to reward our enemies by waiving sanctions while his administration does its best to kill American energy production. Funding despots isn’t in the national interest. Supporting American energy is,” he continued.

Venezuela consistently ranks as one of the least “free” countries in the world, according to Freedom House.

Meanwhile, the Biden administration has increasingly moved to restrict further domestic oil and gas production. The Department of the Interior canceled the three remaining federal offshore oil and gas lease sales last week and dramatically scaled back the federal onshore program in April.

The average price of gasoline reached an all-time record $4.52 a gallon on Tuesday, according to AAA data.

The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Daily Caller News Foundation.

"Biden Admin Quietly Admits Math Error Is Causing Massive Oil, Gas Permitting Delays","The Biden administration privately blamed a math error for severe offshore oil and gas permitting delays, in a letter sent to industry leaders in late April.

“[The National Marine Fisheries Service] understands the concerns of industry and is working with [the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)] to expeditiously develop … revised regulations,” an administration official wrote in the letter to the National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA).

“Gulf of Mexico seismic permitting delays — when coupled with the lack of progress on a new five-year offshore leasing program and the continuation of a multi-year gap in Gulf of Mexico oil and gas lease sales — undermine the predictability companies have relied on to make multi-billion-dollar investment decisions in the Gulf of Mexico,” NOIA President Erik Milito said.

The Biden administration privately acknowledged in late April that a mathematical error is delaying the federal offshore oil and gas program, in a letter to industry leaders.

Richard Spinrad, the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), said a subagency “discovered a miscalculation” that has caused a massive backlog in permitting, in the April 29 letter obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. Spinrad acknowledged the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) — the subagency tasked with analyzing the impact of offshore drilling projects on wildlife — has used faulty modeling on such impacts and, as a result, overestimated wildlife effects, delaying permitting on existing leases.

“NMFS understands the concerns of industry and is working with [the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)] to expeditiously develop … revised regulations,” Spinrad wrote in the letter to the National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA). (RELATED: ‘I’m Not Going To Respond To That’: Biden Cabinet Officials Can’t Get Their Story Straight On Energy Production)

The NOAA administrator’s letter came in response to an April 5 letter from NOIA, the American Petroleum Institute and the EnerGeo Alliance, warning that energy producers had experienced significant permitting delays. In particular, oil and gas companies have reported delays in obtaining letters of authorization (LOA) from the NMFS to conduct pre-drilling activity, including seismic surveying and geological exploration, in the Gulf of Mexico. (RELATED: Biden Cancels More Oil And Gas Leases As Fuel Prices Skyrocket)

The Biden administration implemented the faulty modeling through an April 2021 regulation, according to the industry groups. A spokesperson for the Department of Commerce, which oversees NOAA and NMFS, said Thursday that the administration was “working to consider all possible solutions to expedite the rulemaking process to the greatest extent possible.”

“NMFS is also engaged with affected members of industry and with industry trade associations as it considers both short-term and long-term solutions,” the spokesperson told TheDCNF in an email. “The Commerce Department understands the concerns of industry and is working expeditiously to address the incorrect data it received for the initial rule and to proceed in earnest with the revised rule.”

The spokesperson didn’t answer a question about the current size of the permit backlog.

“Gulf of Mexico seismic permitting delays — when coupled with the lack of progress on a new five-year offshore leasing program and the continuation of a multi-year gap in Gulf of Mexico oil and gas lease sales — undermine the predictability companies have relied on to make multi-billion-dollar investment decisions in the Gulf of Mexico,” NOIA President Erik Milito told TheDCNF in a statement.

“At a time when energy issues are at the forefront, NMFS should address the problems as quickly as possible,” Milito continued. “Companies must be able to continue to explore for and develop hydrocarbon resources in the Gulf of Mexico.”

Milito and other industry leaders have warned the delays have “commercial, operational, and safety implications.”

Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and 19 fellow GOP senators wrote to the Department of Commerce Tuesday, expressing concern about the permitting delays caused by the mathematical error. The lawmakers demanded that the administration issue a new rule immediately, fixing the issue.

“NMFS’s permitting delays represent one example of the Administration’s de facto ban on new drilling – impeding domestic oil and gas investment, exploration, and production,” they wrote to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.

“It is unacceptable that agency miscalculations have restricted access to safe, secure, and reliable domestic oil and gas production through substantial, unnecessary, and arbitrary permitting delays,” they added.

The Commerce Department was planning to respond to Cruz directly, a spokesperson told TheDCNF.

Meanwhile, the Department of the Interior (DOI) canceled all remaining offshore lease sales on May 11, including a sale spanning 1.09 million acres in the Cook Inlet in Alaska. The DOI has also dragged its feet on replacing the current offshore leasing plan that expires in late June and suggested in its latest budget proposal that the next offshore sale wouldn’t take place until fall 2023 at the earliest.

"If Schools Don’t Let Boys Into Girls’ Bathrooms, Biden Will Take Their Lunch Money","The Biden administration will require schools that receive federal funding for lunches to enforce its ban on discrimination on the basis of gender identity and let biological males into girls’ bathrooms.

All state and local agencies that receive Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) funding, including schools, will have to update their non-discrimination policies to include protections for gender identity and must investigate any allegations of discrimination on the basis of gender identity, according to a May 5 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announcement. Obama-era guidance interpreting Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to prohibit gender-identity discrimination stated that transgender students must be allowed to use the restroom, locker room and shower facility that matches their gender identity.

“Under the leadership of the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA and FNS are issuing this interpretation to help ensure its programs are open, accessible and help promote food and nutrition security, regardless of demographics,” the announcement read.

FNS funding supports food security programs for the poor such as federally subsidized school lunches and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, also known as food stamps.

The USDA is interpreting the ban on sex-based discrimination in Title IX of the Education Amendments to include gender identity rather than just biological sex, according to the USDA announcement. The move is in line with Biden’s executive order banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity.

The move is part of a broader push from the Biden administration to promote transgender rights and gender ideology through guidance to federal bureaucracies and reinterpretation of civil rights laws. (RELATED: POLL: Americans Overwhelmingly Reject Biden’s Stance On Sex Changes For Kids)

“Whether you are grocery shopping, standing in line at the school cafeteria, or picking up food from a food bank, you should be able to do so without fear of discrimination,” said Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services Deputy Under Secretary Stacy Dean, according to the announcement. “No one should be denied access to nutritious food simply because of who they are or how they identify.”

‘Build Back Beijing’: Biden Waives Solar Tariffs In Massive Win For Chinese Industry,"President Joe Biden is set to use his executive authority Monday to issue a 24-month moratorium on solar panel tariffs designed to bolster U.S. industry.

Biden’s actions will pause enforcement of Obama-era anti-circumvention tariffs on solar panels and invoke the 1950 Defense Production Act (DPA) to boost domestic panel manufacturing, the White House announced. The president’s move came in response to complaints from the green energy industry and Democratic lawmakers that an active Commerce Department probe into Chinese companies’ alleged tariff violations was slowing the administration’s clean energy goals. (RELATED: ‘Reward The Chinese Communist Party’: US Green Groups Are Working To Undercut American Solar Industry, Critics Say)

“It shows that the Biden administration policy, in this space in particular, is Build Back Beijing,” Nick Iacovella, a spokesperson for the pro-tariff group Coalition for a Prosperous America, told The Daily Caller News Foundation in an interview. “There’s no other way to describe it. They haven’t done a single thing to support U.S. solar manufacturers.”

“All of this boils back down to — if you allow the Chinese to dump subsidized product in our market, it doesn’t matter,” he continued. “For our manufacturers, they’re not going to compete with subsidized product.”

He added that White House didn’t consult any American solar companies before issuing the executive action Monday despite saying it would “spur domestic manufacturing, construction projects, and good-paying jobs.”

In late March, the Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration initiated its investigation into Chinese solar manufacturers after California-based firm Auxin Solar presented evidence claiming the companies were routing panels destined for the U.S. through four southeast Asian nations to avoid duties introduced by the Obama administration. Auxin Solar CEO Mamun Rashid previously told TheDCNF that the case was “existential” for his company.

Chinese solar panel makers produce more than 90% of the global supply of solar wafers, a key component in panels, according to a 2021 analysis from BloombergNEF.

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), whose members include Chinese companies and U.S. companies reliant on cheap Chinese panels, and other green industry groups like the American Clean Power Association have raised the alarm on the probe, saying it would destroy the domestic solar industry. The groups and their members have aggressively lobbied lawmakers to push back against the investigation in recent weeks.

“During the two-year tariff suspension window, the U.S. solar industry can return to rapid deployment while the Defense Production Act helps grow American solar manufacturing,” SEIA President Abigail Hopper said in a statement Monday morning, applauding the actions.

“The work our members did to articulate the urgency created by the initiation of this case and to provide data on negative impacts was critical to the effort to raise awareness about the damage being done,” she continued. “President Biden recognized this and has taken the steps needed to both accelerate the deployment of solar energy and invest in America’s clean energy future.”

Reuters first reported Biden’s plans to nix the tariffs and invoke the DPA.

In February, Biden loosened safeguard tariffs on solar imports introduced by the Trump administration. Labor unions and the U.S. International Trade Commission had supported the tariffs.

The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from TheDCNF.

Biden To Visit Saudi Arabia After Once Vowing To Make Them A ‘Pariah’ During 2019 Debate,"President Joe Biden will visit Saudi Arabia in mid-July, the White House confirmed Tuesday following weeks of speculation.

While in Saudi Arabia, the president is expected to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a senior administration official told the press, according to Axios. The upcoming visit is particularly notable because Biden vowed to make Saudi Arabia “the pariah that they are” during a Democratic debate in 2019.

In a statement confirming the trip, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre made no mention of Biden’s past promise. Instead, Jean-Pierre noted that Saudi Arabia “has been a strategic partner of the United States for nearly eight decades” and said Biden is looking “forward to this important visit.”

“While in Saudi Arabia, the President will discuss a range of bilateral, regional, and global issues,” Jean-Pierre said. “These include support to the UN-mediated truce in Yemen, which has led to the most peaceful period there since war began seven years ago. He will also discuss means for expanding regional economic and security cooperation, including new and promising infrastructure and climate initiatives, as well as deterring threats from Iran, advancing human rights, and ensuring global energy and food security.”

“The President looks forward to outlining his affirmative vision for U.S. engagement in the region over the coming months and years,” she added.

Although Biden has denied that a Saudi Arabia trip would be largely focused on convincing them to pump more oil – at a time when the U.S. is seeing record-high gas prices – some U.S. officials noted that the subject is a big reason for the upcoming visit, according to NBC News.

Saudi Arabia has the ability to quickly boost its oil production, and Biden is facing widespread criticism over inflation as a whole as well as gas prices, NPR reported.

Biden’s trip, which will be July 13-16, also includes a stop in Israel and the West Bank. Biden “will meet with Israeli leaders to discuss Israel’s security, prosperity, and its increasing integration into the greater region,” according to Jean-Pierre. At the West Bank, the president plans “to consult with the Palestinian Authority and to reiterate his strong support for a two-state solution.” (RELATED: White House Cheers Middle East Oil Production Despite Attacks On US Drilling)

The president’s comments about Saudi Arabia in 2019 marked a sharp pivot from former President Barack Obama’s view of the country. At the time, Biden promised he would not sell weapons to Saudi Arabia and addressed the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributor.

“I would make it very clear we were not going to in fact sell more weapons to them,” Biden said during a Democratic debate. “We were going to in fact make them pay the price, and make them in fact the pariah that they are.”

The U.S. intelligence community concluded in 2021 that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman “approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey, to capture or kill” the journalist, NPR previously reported.

Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki noted shortly after the intelligence community’s report that Biden’s aim “is to recalibrate our engagement with Saudi Arabia.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/06/14/joe-biden-visit-saudi-arabia-july/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiQ6K7T_7P9AhXVGFkFHce6DUU4HhAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw2-dafWK5i7HeqjV4Gx9xcL,2022-06-14
Biden Threatens Oil Companies For Not Refining More Gasoline — There’s Just One Problem,"UPDATE: This article has been updated to include comments from ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, Phillips 66, Marathon and the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers.

President Joe Biden sent letters to seven major oil companies Wednesday, saying he would take action if they didn’t boost fuel output from their domestic refineries.

“I understand that many factors contributed to the business decisions to reduce refinery capacity, which occurred before I took office,” Biden wrote in the letters. “But at a time of war, refinery profit margins well above normal being passed directly onto American families are not acceptable.”

“We are surprised and disappointed by the President’s letter,” American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) President and CEO Chet Thompson said in a statement to The Daily Caller News Foundation. “Any suggestion that U.S. refiners are not doing our part to bring stability to the market is false.”

President Joe Biden wrote a letter Wednesday to oil industry executives, warning them he would take action if they don’t boost refining output, Axios reported.

Biden warned the leaders of seven major U.S. oil producers and refiners — ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP America, Shell USA, Phillips 66, Marathon and Valero — that he was “prepared to use all reasonable and appropriate Federal Government tools and emergency authorities” to increase petroleum refinery capacity and output, according to the letter obtained by Axios. The average price of gasoline nationwide hit a record $5.02 per gallon Tuesday while the average price of diesel fuel hit an all-time high of $5.78 a gallon Wednesday, according to AAA data.

“I understand that many factors contributed to the business decisions to reduce refinery capacity, which occurred before I took office,” Biden wrote in the letters. “But at a time of war, refinery profit margins well above normal being passed directly onto American families are not acceptable.”

“With prices for your product where they are today, you have ample market incentive to take these actions, and I recognize that some of you have already begun to do so,” he continued. (RELATED: RUNNING ON EMPTY: America’s Diesel Stockpiles Are Rapidly Dwindling, Fuel Rationing On The Horizon)

However, U.S. refining capacity utilization surged to 94.2% earlier this month, its highest rate since late 2019, and is expected to average 94% between July-September, according to a June 7 report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Refining utilization measures how much fuel refiners produce from crude oil inputs relative to their total production capacity.

The EIA noted that, while refinery utilization will continue to increase over the upcoming months, total output will remain relatively low since total domestic capacity has dropped by 900,000 barrels per day since 2019. Total U.S. operable refinery capacity peaked at nearly 19 million barrels per day in early 2020, but has since fallen to about 17.9 million barrels per day, the latest federal data showed.

“Though our refinery footprint in the U.S. is relatively small today, we are producing at capacity and continue to explore options that would have the result of delivering additional energy products to customers in the U.S. and abroad,” Shell spokesperson Curtis Smith told The Daily Caller News Foundation in an email. “Those efforts include accelerating new and existing production of crude oil in the Gulf of Mexico and repurposing an idled refinery in Louisiana (Convent) that will produce lower-carbon fuels and products.”

ExxonMobil said it has been in regular contact with the White House to update it on its continued investments in domestic oil and gas supplies in a statement shared with TheDCNF. The Texas-based company added that the federal government should promote investment through “clear and consistent policy” such as streamlining the regulatory approval process for fossil fuel infrastructure and holding regular oil and gas lease sales.

“We’ve been investing through the downturn to increase refining capacity to process U.S. light crude by about 250,000 barrels per day – the equivalent of adding a new medium-sized refinery,” the statement continued. “We kept investing even during the pandemic, when we lost more than $20 billion and had to borrow more than $30 billion to maintain investment to increase capacity to be ready for post-pandemic demand.”

Phillips 66 spokesperson Bernardo Fallas confirmed the company had received Biden’s letter and wanted to “underscore that U.S. refineries are running at record-high utilization rates” and that expanding refinery capacity was a long-term proposition, not a short-term fix.

“Chevron is committed to the supply of affordable, reliable, ever-cleaner energy in the United States and across the globe,” Chevron spokesperson Bill Turenne told TheDCNF. “We understand the significant concerns around higher fuel prices currently faced by consumers around the country, and the world. We share these concerns, and expect the Administration’s approach to energy policy will start to better reflect the importance of addressing them.”

“Unfortunately, what we have seen since January 2021 are policies that send a message that the Administration aims to impose obstacles to our industry delivering energy resources the world needs,” he said.

The last major refinery to be constructed in the U.S. was the Marathon facility built in Louisiana in 1977. Industry groups and experts blamed the declining capacity and lack of new refineries on environmental regulation and projected fuel demand decline in the future as governments push green energy alternatives.

“We are surprised and disappointed by the President’s letter,” American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) President and CEO Chet Thompson said in a statement to TheDCNF. “Our team at AFPM has been working closely with the Administration—as recently as this week—providing industry insights and policy recommendations to address the global energy challenge. Any suggestion that U.S. refiners are not doing our part to bring stability to the market is false.”

“We would encourage the Administration to look inward to better understand the role their policies and hostile rhetoric have played in the current environment,” he continued.

Mike Sommers, the CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, said that his group appreciated the opportunity for dialogue with the White House but that the “administration’s misguided policy agenda shifting away from domestic oil and natural gas has compounded inflationary pressures and added headwinds to companies’ daily efforts to meet growing energy” in a statement.

Biden added in his letters that Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm will host an emergency meeting on domestic refining capacity.

Marathon spokesperson Jamal Kheiry said the company looked forward to speaking with the Biden administration in an email. BP America declined to comment.

The White House, Energy Department and Valero didn’t respond to requests for comment from TheDCNF.

SCOTUS Rules Biden Can Scrap Signature Trump-Era Immigration Policy,"The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Biden administration can stop the implementation of the Trump-era ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy.

The policy, formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, forces certain migrants to await asylum proceedings in Mexico. The Trump administration enacted the policy in 2019 to send certain migrants to Mexico to await their asylum proceedings. But, on his second day in office, President Joe Biden ended the policy, calling it both “dangerous” and “inhumane.”

“For the reasons explained, the Government’s rescission of MPP did not violate section 1225 of the INA, and the October 29 Memoranda did constitute final agency action. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand, the District Court should consider in the first instance whether the October 29 Memoranda comply with section 706 of the APA,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in Thursday’s 5-4 opinion.

In April 2021, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the Biden administration after it scrapped the policy, which he argued would curb illegal activity originating from the border. (RELATED: Biden Border Officials Barely Implementing Remain In Mexico Policy After Months Fighting It)

“President Biden could immediately remedy the influx of crime pouring across our border by reinstating the Migrant Protection Protocols,” Paxton said in an April statement.

“Dangerous criminals are taking advantage of the lapse in law enforcement and it’s resulting in human trafficking, smuggling, a plethora of violent crimes, and a massive, unprecedented burden on state and federal programs for which taxpayers must foot the bill. We cannot allow this lawlessness to destroy our communities any longer. President Biden must act,” he added.

A federal judge ruled in August that ending the policy violated the law.

A Biden Tax Hike Kicked In That Affects Everything From Soap To Lightbulbs,"An excise tax hike on household items that was buried in President Joe Biden’s $1 trillion infrastructure package last year went into effect on July 1, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

A roughly $13 billion tax increase on 42 chemicals, metallic elements and critical minerals was included in Biden’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Common household items like rubber, soap, concrete, plastics, lightbulbs and electronics will be impacted. (RELATED: ‘Truly Historic’: Biden Takes Victory Lap During Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill Signing Ceremony)

Superfund chemical excise taxes were previously in place between 1987 and 1995, according to the IRS. The infrastructure package, which the White House called “a once-in-a-generation investment,” triggered the re-implementation of the taxes.

Funds from the reinstated excise tax will be partially directed to the Superfund Trust Fund, which is administered through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and responsible for “cleaning up some of the nation’s most contaminated land and responding to environmental emergencies, oil spills and natural disasters.”

The tax impacts Americans who import, produce or manufacture qualified chemicals, Bloomberg Law reported. Importers, producers and manufacturers will pay between $0.48 and $9.47 per ton in tax on chemicals, the outlet reported.

Republicans have been critical of the Biden administration for imposing the taxes amid soaring inflation and supply chain crises. Inflation reached 8.6% in May from a year prior, which is the fastest increase in 40 years.

“The fake infrastructure bill was drafted to raise taxes on and kill jobs in Louisiana specifically,” Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy said last year upon introducing a bill with other Republicans to eliminate the Superfund taxes. “Its Superfund Tax will increase taxes on our petrochemical industry by $1.3 billion, and that’s going to endanger good jobs at a time when inflation is already ravaging Louisiana families.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the EPA. The IRS declined a request for comment.

"Biden Signs Executive Order Aimed At Protecting Access To Abortion, Contraception","President Joe Biden will sign an executive order Friday aimed at “protecting access to reproductive health,” the White House announced.

The “Executive Order Protecting Access to Reproductive Health Care Services” is the Biden administration’s latest response to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. That decision, decried by Biden as a “tragic error,” has reportedly caused friction within the Democratic Party and the president, with some members quietly questioning the administration’s response.

Only Congress has the ability to codify abortion rights, so Biden’s executive order is designed to build “on the actions his Administration has already taken to defend reproductive rights,” according to the White House.

Biden’s executive order establishes “an Interagency Task Force” designed to help coordinate federal “policymaking and program development” to combat the Supreme Court decision, the administration noted. Attorney General Merrick Garland will be part of this task force and part of his job will be to “provide technical assistance to state affording legal protection to out-of-state patients.”

The order, in part, directs Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra to “take additional action to protect and expand access to abortion care, including access to medication that the FDA approved as safe and effective over twenty years ago.” It also directs the head of the agency to do more in protecting access to contraption, the White House announced.

“HHS will take steps to ensure all patients – including pregnant women and those experiencing pregnancy loss – have access to the full rights and protections for emergency medical care afforded under the law, including by considering updates to current guidance that clarify physician responsibilities and protections under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA),” the administration wrote.

Notably, the administration also said it plans to convene a group of pro-bono lawyers “to encourage robust legal representation of patients, providers, and third parties lawfully seeking or offering” abortions throughout the U.S.

“Such representation could include protecting the right to travel out of state to seek medical care,” the White House fact sheet reads, honing in on Biden’s push that a woman must be allowed to travel safely out of her home state if seeking an abortion.

The executive order also focuses on patient privacy, another concern Biden raised shortly following the Supreme Court decision. Among other asks, Biden is pushing the Federal Trade Commission (FDA) to “consider taking steps to protect consumers’ privacy when seeking information about” abortion.

“The Administration will ensure the safety of patients, providers, and third parties, and to protect the security of other entities that are providing, dispensing, or delivering reproductive health care services. This charge includes efforts to protect mobile clinics, which have been deployed to borders to offer care for out-of-state patients,” the White House also noted.

Biden has expressed his frustration, saying during a recent trip overseas that “the one thing that has been destabilizing is the outrageous behavior of the Supreme Court of the United States by overruling not only Roe v. Wade, but essentially challenging the right to privacy.”

The president also made news during that trip when he said he would back a filibuster carve-out in order to codify Roe v. Wade. (RELATED: Biden Warns Of A ‘Mini Revolution’ If SCOTUS Overturns Roe)

“The first and foremost thing we should do is make it clear how outrageous this decision was and how much it impacts not just on a women’s right to choose, which is a critical, critical piece, but on privacy generally,” Biden said during the press conference in Spain at the end of June. “But the most important thing, to be clear about it, I believe we have to codify Roe v. Wade in the law and the way to do that is to make sure Congress votes to do that.”

“And if the filibuster gets in the way, like voting rights, we provide an exception for this, we require an exception to the filibuster for this action to deal with the Supreme Court decision,” the president added.

Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have remained firmly opposed to making any such exceptions, meaning the Biden administration may not be holding its breath in the hopes that Congress will codify Roe v. Wade.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/07/08/joe-biden-executive-order-abortion-reproductive-health-contraception/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiR-oPS_7P9AhXMFVkFHX-tAdU4ChAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw1WyOnc-C8vy44QcHm4kEbQ,2022-07-08
‘They Want Me To Run’: Biden Misrepresents NYT Poll Showing Most Democrats Don’t Want Him For 2024,"President Joe Biden on Tuesday maintained that Democratic voters “want” him to run again in 2024, misrepresenting the results of a recent New York Times/Siena College poll.

The poll, published Monday, found that 64% of Democratic voters want another 2024 candidate. Reporters asked Biden what his message is to Democrats who, based on the poll’s findings, don’t want him running again. The president first claimed that the party does want him in 2024. (RELATED: New NYT Poll Shows ‘Staggering’ Amount Of Americans Believe US Heading In Wrong Direction)

“They want me to run,” the president declared.

ABC News’ Ben Gittleson then quickly pointed out the 64% number — a number that the president suggested was incorrect.

“Read the poll. Read the polls, Jack. You guys are all the same. That poll showed that 92% of Democrats, if I ran, would vote for me,” Biden responded, incorrectly citing another portion of the poll.

WATCH:

“But 92% said if I did [run], they’d vote for me,” the president continued after Gittleson again noted that the “majority of Democrats” don’t want him to run.

While the 92% number Biden referenced is in the poll, it specifically refers to the percentage of Democrats who would vote for Biden if the only other alternative is former President Donald Trump.

“The poll showed that Democratic misgivings about Mr. Biden seemed to mostly melt away when presented with a choice between him and Mr. Trump: 92 percent of Democrats said they would stick with Mr. Biden,” The Times reported Monday.

Biden claims the NYT poll found that 92% of Dems would vote for him if he ran. That 92% number is *specifically* in reference to Democrats being presented with a choice between Trump or Biden.

On Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre dismissed the same poll and misrepresented the same 92% portion.

“I would also say, from that very same poll, there were 92% of Democrats who support this President as well,” Jean-Pierre said after she was asked for Biden’s response to the poll.

“There’s going to be many polls, they’re going to go up, they’re going to go down. This is not the thing that we are solely focused on,” she added.

Soon afterwards, Jean-Pierre issued a further dismissal of polls, declaring to the room that the administration is “not going to pay attention” to them.

“That’s not what we’re going to do here,” she said.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/07/12/joe-biden-misrepresents-new-york-times-poll-democrats-want-alternative-2024/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiK-7HX_7P9AhXYF1kFHR7tDmc4WhAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw1iBUfswQxlO7a9pUMBX32D,2022-07-12
Biden Admin Poised To Force Insurers To Pay For Sex Changes,"President Joe Biden’s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) moved to strengthen Obama-era rules that could force insurance providers receiving federal funding to pay for sex change procedures in a Monday rule change proposal.

The rule would expand Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) ban on sex-based discrimination to include gender identity, sexual orientation and pregnancy-related conditions including abortion, according to a Monday announcement. In practice, this would mean forcing health insurance providers to cover sex change procedures, according to Roger Severino, former director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights. (RELATED: If Schools Don’t Let Boys Into Girls’ Bathrooms, Biden Will Take Their Lunch Money)

“By imposing an unscientific gender standard of care, and requiring insurance plans to pay for it, the rule will result in sterilization, loss of sexual function, removal of healthy reproductive organs, and a plethora of unnecessary surgeries and chemical interventions with life-long consequences,” Severino said.

The move is part of a broader push within the Biden administration to promote transgender ideology and sex changes, including for minors.

“What’s truly alarming about this rule is how it irresponsibly pushes transgender treatments despite no legal requirement to and in the face of faulty and contradicting evidence,” Severino added. “Neither law, policy, nor science support such an extreme inversion of medicine, which is why the HHS should abandon all efforts to amend the Section 1557 rule.”

The American Principles Project (APP), a conservative advocacy organization, suggested that the rule would force healthcare workers to provide sex change treatments along with forcing insurance providers to cover them.

“Doctors will likely be forced to facilitate sex-change procedures for minors or else risk losing their jobs,” APP said in a press release. ‘The rule will also mandate that insurance companies cover these procedures, thus compelling Americans to subsidize them through their insurance premiums.”

Transgender advocates, including a representative of the Biden administration, consider sex change procedures such as puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgeries to be medically necessary.

“Today’s proposed rulemaking through the Affordable Care Act is a big moment for equal protection under the law,” Assistant Secretary for Health Rachel Levine wrote. “It ‘prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, and disability in certain health programs and activities.'”

“This is especially key when it comes to providing services like gender-affirming care for trans youth,” Levine said.

The HHS initially announced its plans to expand the definition of sex-based discrimination under Section 1557 in May 2021, but that announcement did not mention pregnancy or abortion.

The rule change “makes clear that discrimination on the basis of sex includes discrimination on the basis of pregnancy or related conditions, including ‘pregnancy termination,'” according to the HHS announcement.

The HHS did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Biden To Sign Executive Order Directing HHS ‘To Consider’ Having Medicaid Aid Women Crossing State Lines For Abortions,"President Joe Biden will sign an executive order Wednesday directing Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Xavier Becerra “to consider” having Medicaid help pay the costs for women who want to cross state lines to undergo abortions.

The executive order builds on the Biden administration’s efforts to protect abortion access in wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling. In June, the Supreme Court voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that deemed abortion is protected under the U.S. Constitution.

“The Executive Order directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to consider action to advance access to reproductive healthcare services, including through Medicaid for patients who travel out of state for reproductive healthcare services,” reads a fact sheet provided by the White House on the executive order. “This directive is in line with the President and the Attorney General’s clear statements on the Administration’s commitment to defending the bedrock right to travel across state lines to seek reproductive healthcare in states where those services remain legal.”

It remains unclear exactly what specific costs Medicaid could pay for in these cases. Medicaid is not supposed to pay for abortions themselves because of the Hyde Amendment. (RELATED: Biden Warns Of A ‘Mini Revolution’ If SCOTUS Overturns Roe)

On July 8, Biden signed his first executive order aimed at “protecting access to reproductive health.” That order was designed to build “on the actions his Administration has already taken to defend reproductive rights,” according to the White House.

While Wednesday’s action represents a stronger push from the Biden administration, the president has not yet declared a public health emergency. Some members of his party have pushed for him to do so, and the president said in July that it was being weighed as an option.

The latest order, called the “Executive Order on Securing Access to Reproductive and Other Healthcare Services,” also directs Becerra “to evaluate and improve research, data collection, and data analysis … on maternal health and other health outcomes,” according to the White House.

Biden plans to sign the order at the White House’s first interagency Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access meeting. The president will attend the meeting virtually, as he continues to test positive in a “rebound” COVID-positivity case.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/08/03/joe-biden-executive-order-abortion-medicaid-cross-state-lines-hhs-becerra/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwinjNnW_7P9AhVjD1kFHeTvBIQ4UBAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw3zNbqKe7EripPGVWL5u-re,2022-08-03
‘Time To Take Risks’: Activists Push Biden To Take Harder Pro-Abortion Stance,"Pro-abortion activists think President Joe Biden is the wrong leader for their cause given his Catholic faith and long history of opposing abortion, according to The New York Times.

Biden opposed abortion throughout most of his political career and is hesitant to discuss abortion explicitly, White House sources told the NYT. He changed his public stance on the issue over the past decade and became more pro-abortion, but activists feel he’s soft on the issue and not doing enough to promote abortion rights.

“Yes, there are limits to executive branch power, there are limits to what the president can do,” Andrea Miller, president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health, told the NYT. “But this just feels like you’ve got to push the boundaries right now. This is a time to pull out all the stops. This is a time to take risks.”

Yesterday, following my Executive Order, HHS released new guidance to ensure health care providers across the country know their obligation under federal law to provide life- or health-saving abortion services in emergency situations—regardless of their state’s abortion laws. — President Biden (@POTUS) July 12, 2022

Biden issued two executive orders enshrining abortion access, including through protecting interstate travel for the procedure, after Roe was overturned. His administration has promoted abortion through the Department of Justice’s lawsuit against Idaho over the state’s abortion law, and Biden considered declaring a public health emergency to promote abortion access. (RELATED: Abortion Activists Seethe After Biden WH Calls Them ‘Out Of Step’)

Some pro-abortion activists view these actions as insufficient and urge Biden to take stronger actions to promote abortion; they also wish Biden would discuss abortion explicitly rather than using euphemisms like “reproductive health care,” according to the NYT. His history of opposition to abortion makes activists skeptical that he’s really doing all he can to enshrine abortion.

In 1974, the year after the Roe decision first came down, Biden told a reporter he felt that it went too far, and voted in favor of a failed constitutional amendment overturning Roe in 1983. He softened his ant-abortion stance by 2008, when he ran for vice president alongside then-candidate Barack Obama, and cemented his public pro-abortion views during his own campaign for president.

“This is not necessarily the guy that I am sure most activists wanted in the seat when this happened,” Jamie L. Manson, president of Catholics for Choice, told the NYT in reference to the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. “It’s unfortunate because he has so much power and we need him to really get out of his comfort zone.”

"‘Easy As 1,2,3’: Biden Admin Outlines How To Claim Student Loan Handout","The Biden administration says claiming relief for student loans will be as “easy as 1,2,3,” according to a tweet.

The Department of Education (DOE) announced its student loan forgiveness plan, which will cancel $10,000 of debt for those making less than $125,000 per year, on Aug. 24. The application for the student loan forgiveness will open in October and take three steps, according to a tweet by Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. (RELATED: Here’s How Much Biden’s Student Debt Forgiveness Could Cost Taxpayers)

A “simple application” is set to open to those applying for student loan forgiveness no later than early October, Cardona stated. After completing the application, borrowers will be relieved of their student debt in four to six weeks.

To be notified of when the application opens up, Cardona advised borrowers to visit the Federal Student Aid website powered by the DOE.

While borrowers have until Dec. 31 to apply for student loan forgiveness, borrowers should apply before Nov. 15 in order to get relief before the payment pause ends, Cardona said. The student loan repayment pause, which was implemented because of the pandemic, extends until the end of the year.

Pell Grant recipients are eligible for up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness under the plan by the Biden administration, according to the DOE. Those working for nonprofits, as well as the military, federal, state or local government may also be waived of their debt through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.

Biden Admin Issues Fewest Oil And Gas Drilling Leases Since The 1940s: REPORT,"The Biden administration has leased fewer acres of land for oil and gas drilling on federal lands and waters than any administration in the last 76 years, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.

The Department of The Interior (DOI) has issued just 126,228 acres of federal land for drilling during President Joe Biden’s 19 months in office, according to a WSJ analysis. President Harry Truman issued fewer drilling acres from 1945 to 1946, allocating roughly 65,658 acres of land; however, at this time, the federal government did not yet control offshore drilling leases which account for the majority of areas available for leasing. (RELATED: Federal Court Allows Biden To Once Again Pause Oil And Gas Drilling)

“This is a sobering but unsurprising look at the headwinds to developing essential American energy,” American Petroleum Institute Vice President of Upstream Policy Cole Ramsey told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Maintaining a strong federal leasing program is critical for advancing U.S. energy security, strengthening our economy … we urge the Biden administration to take immediate action to hold onshore lease sales and issue a final 5-year program for federal offshore leasing that includes all of the proposed lease sales.”

The Biden administration has attempted to pause or place a moratorium on issuing new drilling leases numerous times to help further its aggressive climate agenda. A federal court allowed the administration to continue to block drilling in August after Louisiana and a dozen other states filed a lawsuit against the administration relating to Biden’s indefinite suspension of federal oil and gas leasing in January 2021.

No president since Richard Nixon has leased fewer than 4.4 million acres of land during the first year and a half of their term, according to the WSJ.

Biden vowed to protect federal lands and waters from oil and gas drilling during his campaign as part of his wider climate agenda, which advocates against the use of fossil fuels to curb carbon emissions, according to Biden’s campaign website.

The record-low levels of land being auctioned off for energy production comes amid soaring domestic electricity costs, fuel shortages and high gas prices. Biden promised in late March to increase the amount of oil on the worldwide market to address the global energy crisis; however, he did not issue more drilling leases, instead, he began releasing hundreds of millions of barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

Biden’s DOI estimated in July that offshore drilling cutbacks would force the U.S. to import more crude oil to plug supply gaps as well as hike energy costs. Halting offshore drilling leases would force over half (51%) of the country’s lost energy production to be replaced by foreign energy imports from abroad should Biden refuse to issue new offshore leases from 2023 to 2028, according to a report produced by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM).

The government is required to hold auctions for lands for oil and gas exploration, including one by the end of this year, according to the Democrats’ new climate, tax and health care bill that Biden signed into law in August.

The DOI and the White House did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

‘Sue And Settle’: Biden Admin Agrees To Block Oil And Gas Drilling After Settling With Eco Activists,"The Biden administration will halt oil and gas exploration on over 58,000 acres of government land after reaching a court settlement with climate activist groups on Sept. 6.

“These settlements are an abuse of the system and are being used to advance the policy goals of the Biden administration at the expense of the law,” Paul Seby, a shareholder who specializes in environmental issues at Greenberg Traurig law firm, told the Daily Caller News Foundation .

. “Environmental activist groups for the past several years have challenged federal leases in court, and now with the Biden administration in office they can settle behind closed doors,” Western Energy Alliance vice president of public affairs Aaron Johnson told the DCNF.

The Biden administration will stop oil and gas drilling on more than 58,000 acres of federally-issued land after reaching a legal settlement with environmental activist groups on Sept. 6.

The Interior Department’s (DOI) Bureau of Land Management (BLM) agreed to halt drilling permits on 113 oil and gas leases across 58,617 acres of land in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota, according to the settlement. The DOI agreed to stop drilling after a coalition of environmental nonprofits led by WildEarth Guardians and the Sierra Club filed a lawsuit against the agency in January 2021. (RELATED: Biden Admin Admits Drilling Plan Will Force Dependence On Foreign Oil, Hike Prices)

“This is a sue and settle case,” Paul Seby, a lawyer who specializes in environmental issues at Greenberg Traurig, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “It’s an abuse of the system and is being used to advance the policy goals of the Biden administration at the expense of the law.”

Seby stated that the administration is voluntarily agreeing to block drilling in the interests of the climate groups when such an action is not legally required under the Administrative Procedure Act, as the lawsuit was filed on the grounds of a procedural violation rather than a “substantive” one.

President Joe Biden vowed during his campaign to phase out fossil fuels and place a moratorium on oil and gas drilling to further his aggressive climate goals, an imposed an indefinite ban on new federal leases in January 2021 as one of his first acts as president.

The BLM will now review the climate impact of drilling and could cancel the leases and end drilling on sites where oil and gas exploration is currently ongoing if regulators determine that the environmental review process was not thoroughly conducted. Government agencies are required to consider climate impacts in their environmental reviews before approving any project; however, the activist groups claim that such impacts were not properly assessed when the leases were issued by the Trump administration in 2019 and 2020, according to the settlement.

The settlement is described as nonprecedential, meaning that judges are not required to follow its rulings in future cases, and contains no admission of wrongdoing by the BLM, limiting the scope of the case to the 113 leases referenced in the settlement.

“Public agencies are supposed to make decisions and those decisions are meant to remain unless they’re lawfully overturned,” Seby continued. “The administration is getting around that process by cutting a deal with NGOs.”

The moratorium is currently being challenged in court by Louisiana and 12 other states after the states filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration in April 2021.

“Federal leasing is among the most environmentally protective oil and gas programs in the world because it is so highly regulated but that is not sufficient for activists,” Western Energy Alliance vice president of public affairs Aaron Johnson told the DCNF. “Environmental activist groups for the past several years have challenged federal leases in court, and now with the Biden administration in office they can settle behind closed doors.”

“This agreement opens the door for the Biden administration to undo the Trump administration’s recklessness and disregard to the public interest,” said Jeremy Nichols, WildEarth Guardians’ climate and energy program director, according to a Sierra Club press release. “Oil and gas leasing is completely at odds with climate action, we applaud the administration for agreeing to do the right thing.”

WildEarth Guardians also claims that federal oil and gas leases give energy producers a license to “pollute,” according to a June press release.

Biden promised in late March to increase domestic oil production to help lower gas prices and address global supply shortages, according to a White House press release. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm also threatened in August to use “emergency measures” if U.S. fuel refiners did not increase their stockpiles of refined fuel products like diesel that the country is running low on.

The Biden administration has leased fewer acres of land for oil and gas drilling on federal properties than any administration in the last 76 years. Biden’s dramatic reduction in allocating lands for energy production comes amid soaring domestic electricity costs and fuel shortages.

The Democrats’ $369 climate spending bill, dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act, requires the federal government to auction millions of acres of oil and gas leases before it can allocate land for green energy production, according to the bill’s text.

“The goal of these groups is to keep energy resources in the ground,” Johnson stated.

The White House and the DOI did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Joe Biden Owns A Pricey Beachfront Mansion Despite His Sea Level Alarmism. He’s Not The Only One,"President Joe Biden and other climate activists like Bill Gates, John Kerry and former President Barack Obama own several expensive beachfront properties despite their claims that rising sea levels are threatening the planet.

Biden owns a $3.8 million beachfront mansion in Delaware even though he has previously warned against rising sea levels caused by climate change, according to CNN. Other prominent environmental activists such as Gates, Obama and Kerry have all expressed concerns about the threat of rising sea levels despite the fact that they also own beachfront properties worth up to $43 million. (RELATED: ‘Sue And Settle’: Biden Admin Agrees To Block Oil And Gas Drilling After Settling With Eco Activists)

Biden, who bought his beach mansion in 2017, expressed his fears of rising sea levels in Delaware that he attributed to climate change during a CNN town hall in 2019.

“My state is three feet above sea level,” Biden said. “We know what is going to happen if we don’t make significant change.” The average elevation in Delaware is 60 feet above sea level, according to the World Population Review.

Biden also claims that rising sea levels could pose a threat to “lives and property” on the East Coast, according to his campaign website.

Gates, who has donated billions of dollars to fight climate change, paid $43 million for a 5,800 square feet Los Angeles beachfront property in 2021, according to Business Insider. However, Gates previously claimed in 2021 that beach properties will soon no longer exist due to a coming “climate catastrophe,” according to the Miami Herald.

“There will be places near the ocean [that] the sea-level rise will completely wipe out,” Gates told the Herald. “Those beaches will be all gone.”

Obama denoted rising sea levels as a threat to the nation and alerted Americans that rising sea levels could cost the country up to $200 billion in a 2015 speech.

“Climate change, and especially rising seas, is a threat to our homeland security, our economic infrastructure, the safety and health of the American people,” he stated.

Obama owns a Martha’s Vineyard mansion that is near the water and was worth about $15.4 million in 2019, according to Tatler magazine. He also bought a Hawaii property located on the beach for $8.5 million in 2015.

Biden’s Climate Envoy and Obama’s former Secretary of State John Kerry said in February that rising ocean levels caused by climate change will lead to floods that could cause trillions of dollars in damages, according to a State Department press release.

“We know the sea level rise predicted to occur by the end of the century will now happen in the next 30 years, threatening trillions in damages,” Kerry stated, according to the press release.

Kerry also stated in 2014 that Asian countries could be destroyed by rising ocean levels and climate change. Kerry’s warnings about rising sea levels did not stop him from buying an $11.75 million Martha’s Vineyard beachfront mansion in March 2017.

The White House, the Obama Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Biden Declares ‘The Pandemic Is Over’,"President Joe Biden declared the Covid-19 pandemic “over” Sunday while speaking with Scott Pelley on “60 minutes.”

Speaking together at the first Detroit auto show in three years, Pelley asked the President if that was evidence that the pandemic was “over.” Biden replied in the affirmative, though conceding that COVID was still a “problem.”

“We’re still doing a lot of work on it, but the pandemic is over,” Biden assured.

“The pandemic is over. We still have a problem with COVID. We’re still doing a lot of work on it. But the pandemic is over,” President Biden tells 60 Minutes in an interview in Detroit. https://t.co/7SixTE3OMT pic.twitter.com/s5fyjRpYuX — 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) September 19, 2022

Biden’s remarks come days after Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, announced that the number of weekly deaths from COVID were the lowest they had been since March 2020, CNN reported. “We have never been in a better position to end the pandemic,” Ghebreyesus stated. “We’re not there yet, but the end is in sight.”

Similarly, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has shifted its Covid-19 guidance away from stringent measures such as quarantines and social distancing and has instead re-focused its efforts on reducing severe disease from Covid-19, according to CNN.

Biden is far from the only world leader who’s hopeful about the future. Last week, New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, known for the tough controls she enacted during the pandemic, lifted mask requirements in public spaces, quarantine requirements for exposed individuals and vaccination declarations for inbound travelers, Bloomberg reported. (RELATED: ‘Don’t Talk To Your Neighbors’: New Zealand Reimposes Lockdowns After Single COVID-19 Case)

While the CDC has warned that those with underlying conditions are still at risk and should continue to take precautions, data has shown that the risk of death fell to the lowest it’s ever been during the Omicron wave, CNN reported. Higher levels of immunity, from vaccination and previous infection, advances in treatments and the less infectious properties of the Omicron sub-variants have contributed to an improved mortality risk overall, the news outlet stated.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/09/18/biden-declares-pandemic-is-over/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjeqJDY_7P9AhVhMVkFHYbKB1g4ZBAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw2aS31HU11cmYwmXmf4Hpm3,2022-09-18
Biden Admin Begged Saudis To Delay Oil Production Cuts Until Days Before The Election: REPORT,"Biden administration officials urged Saudi Arabia to delay production cuts until a few days before the midterm elections, meaning that Americans would not have felt the impact of reduced supplies before casting their ballots, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its Russia-led allies, which are collectively known as OPEC+, cut crude oil production on Oct. 5 by 2 million barrels per day to reduce global supply and raise prices. Before the cut was announced, the Biden administration begged Saudi Arabia, a founding member of OPEC, to delay the decision until November, the WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the negotiations. (RELATED: Biden Turns To Venezuela For Oil After OPEC Slashes Production)

Saudi Arabia viewed the appeals as a cynical attempt to avoid fallout prior to the November elections and refused to do so, according to the WSJ. The Arab kingdom instead pressured its OPEC allies to vote to slash production following the Biden administration’s attempts to delay the cuts.

A National Security Council spokeswoman told the WSJ that the administration’s efforts were not politically motivated. Administration officials did not trust Saudi predictions about a fall in oil prices and wanted the nation to wait another month before cutting production to analyze the global market’s reaction, according to the spokeswoman.

“It’s categorically false to connect this to U.S. elections,” the spokeswoman said. “It’s about the impact of this shortsighted decision to the global economy.”

With the national average gas price hitting $3.92 on Tuesday, the White House is scrambling to respond as it is concerned that price hikes at the pump could hurt the Democrats’ chances in the midterm elections, according to The Washington Post. The Biden administration will release 10 million oil barrels from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) throughout November to bring down gas prices and is mulling further releases from the emergency stockpile following OPEC’s cuts.

John Kirby, the White House coordinator for strategic communications at the National Security Council told CNN that Biden will re-evaluate the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia due to its decision. Biden vowed to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” during his campaign yet visited the nation in July to ask them to pump more oil.

‘Eat My A$$’: Lewd Joe Biden Protest Causes Scene For DC Commuters,"Critics of President Joe Biden staged a protest Tuesday above a major road to Washington, D.C. during morning rush hour which included a large animated penis and signs urging Democrats to “suck my dick.”

Shaun Porter, a YouTube performer, placed several signs on a bridge over the 270 spur in Maryland that read “FUCK BIDEN,” “EAT MY ASS” and “DEMOCRATS CAN SUCK MY DICK 2022!!!” according to several photos and videos shared online. Men in costumes including a cowboy hat and a Care Bear costume waved signs from a truck on the bridge, and at least one woman drove up to the bridge to express her anger over the signs.

“We’re just unhappy with the direction of the country and we’re having a redress of grievances as protected under the First Amendment and within the laws of the state of Maryland,” Porter told the DCNF. “We’re ordinary people expressing our concerns with the direction of the country hoping to influence our fellow citizens in the upcoming November elections.”

One sign, which appeared to be about ten feet long, featured a cartoon penis with Biden’s face drawn on it which read “Biden sucks.” Several signs said “FUCK BIDEN,” and one sign featured an image of the Seinfeld character George Costanza in boxer underwear beneath the words “Eat my ass you liberal yupee whores.” (RELATED: Dem Donors Give Up On Florida Ahead Of Expected Midterm Bloodbath)

WATCH:

One sign advertised Porter’s YouTube account, which shared videos Tuesday morning of the anti-Biden protest along with videos of individuals exiting their cars to complain about the signs. One woman was filmed cutting a “FUCK BIDEN” flag in half with scissors before engaging in a verbal altercation with the cameraman.

Responses to the protest were overwhelmingly positive, and several people stopped to bring the protesters beer, coffee and snacks as well as to take pictures with the signs, Porter told the DCNF. A handful of “completely insane” people also attempted to destroy the signs and halt the protest, including one woman Porter identified as a Montgomery County school teacher.

"Biden Spent Nearly 40% Of 2022 In Delaware, Camp David, Or On Vacation","President Joe Biden spent nearly 40% of 2022 in Delaware, Camp David and vacation destinations.

A Daily Caller analysis of Biden’s 2022 public schedule shows that the president spent 92 days or partial days at one of his Delaware properties, and 32 days or partial days at Camp David.

Biden also vacationed seven days in South Carolina, five days in Nantucket, and five days in the U.S. Virgin Islands, bringing his total getaway days to a total of 141, or 38.6% of his first full calendar year. (RELATED: Biden Vacations In Virgin Islands After Saying There Are ‘More Important Things’ Than Visiting Border)

Past presidents have also taken getaway trips to their favorite locations, including Donald Trump traveling to Mar-a-Lago and New Jersey, Barack Obama to Martha’s Vineyard and George W. Bush to his Texas ranch.

Biden’s numbers, however, are on track to outpace every president, CNN reported, using data compiled by former CBS White House Correspondent Mark Knoller.

His time working from Delaware had already exceeded that of Trump in October, according to Knoller. If Biden is re-elected and keeps up the pace of his trips to Delaware, his vacation time would far eclipse those of Obama, Bush and Reagan, Knoller told the outlet.

The White House has argued that the presidency can be conducted from outside Washington, D.C., and that Biden has the “right to spend time with his family.”

“The presidency is a nonstop job that chief executives can do from anywhere in the world. And regardless of location, he has taken fewer vacation days than the modern norm,” White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates has said.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defended Biden’s time away from the Oval Office in August, saying, “he was going to go spend time with his family which every president does. That is not unusual, that is not uncommon to do and the president has a right to spend time with his family just like every other American across the country.”

Biden has a history of not paying for the luxurious properties he vacations at. He spent a week in August vacationing with his family in Kiawah Island, South Carolina, while staying at Democratic donor Maria Allwin’s $20 million mansion, the New York Post reported.

In Nantucket, Massachusetts, Biden stayed in private-equity billionaire David Rubenstein’s $20 million property, the outlet reported.

In the Virgin Islands, the president stayed with at the St. Croix villa of Bill and Connie Neville, wealthy donors who were invited to the State Dinner with French President Emmanuel Macron, according to the New York Post .

Biden ‘Working Out The Details’ To Go To Southern Border,"President Joe Biden said Wednesday he has the “intention” to go to the southern border when he visits Mexico City from Jan. 9 to Jan. 10 for the North American Leaders’ Summit (NALS).

Biden confirmed he would be making the trip to the border, and that he’s “working out the details now,” while speaking to reporters outside of Air Force One on his return trip from Kentucky.

When he got back to the White House, Biden said he wanted to see “peace and security” and is “going to see what’s going on” at the border. He said he’ll give a speech on the topic Thursday.

Biden has not gone to the border since 2008 when he drove by as vice president, former White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in 2021.

Customs and Border Protection has experienced record-breaking numbers of illegal migrant encounters during Biden’s presidency, with 2.3 million encounters recorded in fiscal year 2022. (RELATED: Here’s How Many Migrants Have Crossed The Southern Border Under Biden — That We Know Of)

Republicans have repeatedly called on Biden to visit the border, but the White House has called border visits “political stunts.” In December, Biden said he had “more important things going on” than visiting the border ahead of a trip to Arizona.

Biden will meet with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at NALS in Mexico City, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday.

“The NALS will be an opportunity for President Biden, Prime Minister Trudeau, and the President of Mexico to promote a common vision for North America with concrete initiatives that will address climate and environmental challenges; increase North America’s competitiveness; protect the health and safety of our citizens; jointly respond to irregular migration in the region; and advance diversity, equity, and inclusion as well,” she said.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/04/biden-intentions-visit-southern-border-mexico-city-trip/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiT6d3U_7P9AhXGFFkFHc0yBBs4MhAWegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw0K9bPmMeIQdAEi4pn9rkcs,2023-01-04
‘I Am Going To Get Assault Weapons Banned’: Biden Pledges To Go After Guns During MLK Day Speech,"President Joe Biden announced Monday that he will continue his campaign to ban all so-called “assault rifles” during his remarks at the National Action Network’s Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast.

Biden pledged to continue his goal of banning “assault weapons,” saying that there is no “social redeeming value” to owning “assault weapons” because deer do not wear “Kevlar vests,” according to the president’s remarks. Furthermore, Biden questioned why Americans need so many bullets, saying “ban the number of bullets that can go in a magazine. No, no need for any of that.”

“About a month after Buffalo and Uvalde, visited both, I signed the first major gun safety legislation in 13 years and I’ll say what I said then and I’ll say it over and over again: I am going to get assault weapons banned. I did it once and I’m going to do it again,” Biden said. (RELATED: ‘Weapons Of War’: Washington State’s Dem Gov, Attorney General Propose Major Gun Control Measures)

Biden questioned why assault weapons are legal, saying that it would take a lot more firepower than an AR-15 to take down the government. “I love my right-wing friends who’ll talk about the tree of liberty is watered with the blood of patriots. If you need to worry about taking on the federal government, you need some F-15s you don’t need an AR-15,” he said.

An F-15 is a type of fighter jet.

Following the Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, mass shootings, Biden rolled out an extensive gun control agenda in June 2022, calling for a ban on “assault weapons and high capacity magazines.”

“They had one message for all of us: Do something, just do something, for God’s sake, do something,” Biden said while discussing the mass shootings. The president noted during his speech that the move to ban “assault weapons” and high capacity magazines “is not about taking away anyone’s guns.”

In November, Biden called for a ban on semi-automatic firearms, saying the ability to purchase these guns is “just sick.”

“The idea we still allow semi-automatic weapons to be purchased is sick. Just sick. It has no, no social redeeming value. Zero. None. Not a single solitary rationale for it except profit for the gun manufacturers,” Biden said.

Most modern weapons are semi-automatic, and a ban for that style of weapon would designate most pistols, rifles and shotguns as illegal. “I’m going to try to get rid of assault weapons,” Biden said.

During the Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast, Biden said that AR-15’s are only legal because of the money. “I’m serious, think about it. About the rationale for this. It’s money, money, money, money,” he said.

The National Action Network’s Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast was held at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. Biden was joined by the Rev. Al Sharpton, and the event honored former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Arndrea Waters King and “other national leaders who have kept Dr. King’s mission alive,” according to the National Action Network.

Biden made the remarks while touting a commitment to reducing violent crime.

“Meanwhile, we’re making historic investments in community violence intervention. Studies have shown they reduced violent crime up to 60%. We’ve seen this kind of impact in Baltimore and Sacramento,” Biden said.

“And by the way, even if I didn’t want to do this I’d be in real trouble, my daughter is a social worker, this is what she does. So if I didn’t, I’d be in real trouble with my Ashley,” the president continued. “You think I’m joking I’m not joking.”

Biden made the remarks while delivering a speech at the civil rights group National Action Network’s Martin Luther King Jr. Day Breakfast.

The president’s youngest daughter made headlines after her diary was allegedly stolen from a Florida halfway house where she had a rehab stint, and sold to investigative group Project Veritas. Reports circulated that Ashley claimed in the diary she had showered with her father when she was young, which he allegedly wrote was “probably not appropriate.”

Biden has made similar gaffes in the past. Famously, he said once that “poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids” at a campaign event in 2019. Biden also once told a story about the “first woman trucker I met” named “Big Mama” in a speech at the White House in April.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/16/joe-biden-daughter-social-worker-ashley-national-action-network-al-sharpton/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiK6trS_7P9AhWNElkFHZjJBkM4FBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw1E9RljNVVMCxjAsJSr81KK,2023-01-16

The “DOJ had full access to the President’s home, including personally handwritten notes, files, papers, binders, memorabilia, to-do lists, schedules, and reminders going back decades,” Bauer’s statement said, noting that the search took more than 12 hours.

After its search, the DOJ took “six items consisting of documents with classification markings and surrounding materials, some of which were from the President’s service in the Senate and some of which were from his tenure as Vice President,” the statement added. The “DOJ also took for further review personally handwritten notes from the vice-presidential years.”

Bauer stressed that the Biden administration is intending to cooperate with the DOJ and offered the search to move “the process forward as expeditiously as possible.”

Biden has maintained that he was “surprised” about the discovery of the documents, and that he does not know what they contain.

After one week of not speaking to the press about the documents, Biden said Thursday he has “no regrets ” about the matter, and that the public will find out “there’s nothing there.”

The White House did not inform the public about the documents until CBS reported a leak about their discovery on Jan. 9. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has stressed that she has been “transparent” and that the press office did not know about the documents until the CBS report.

"Biden Admin Is ‘Breathing A Sigh Of Relief’ Amid Discovery Of Pence Docs, CNN Panelist Says","A CNN panelist said Tuesday the Biden administration has to be breathing a “sigh of relief” about the discovery of classified documents in former Vice President Mike Pence’s home.

“If you’re the Biden Administration, as I think our Phil Mattingly has reported, you’re breathing a sigh of relief, right? This is clearly a problem, that is one that is definitely about classified documents and how they’re handled in a broad way in addition to obviously each individual case,” CNN National Affairs Analyst Kasie Hunt said. “But, you know, listening to some of these lawmakers talk to our hill team over the course of today, holy heck is what Mark Warner said. He is the head of the – the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee. You can sort of hear the undertones in their voice. I don’t get to treat classified information like this.” (RELATED: ‘A Widespread Issue’: CNN Reporter Suggests ‘Amnesty’ Over Classified Documents)

WATCH:

Former Vice President Pence informed the National Archives and Records Administration about the discovery of classified material in his Indiana home Jan. 18 following reports that classified documents were discovered at the Penn Biden Center and President Joe Biden’s Wilmington, Delaware, home.

FBI agents raided Mar-a-Lago, the Florida estate owned by former President Donald Trump, Aug. 8 while investigating allegations that classified documents were removed when Trump left office in January 2021, even though Trump maintained he declassified the documents.

Attorney General Merrick Garland named Robert Hur as special counsel to look into the Biden matter, while selecting Jack Smith to be the special counsel investigating Trump.

“We’re going run out of special counsels. Maybe they take the Biden case and the Pence case and give it both to Rob Hur,” CNN Special Correspondent Jamie Gangel said. “I also think we’re going to see very shortly that the Archives may reach out to all the formers, the former vice presidents, the former presidents, and I don’t mean this lightly, say ‘Amnesty. Guys, please go back, take a look and see if there is… one more time.’”

“It just reminds me of the long old phrase, there but for the grace of God go I, right?” Hunt said. “Because if you look at how all these Republican politicians handled the Biden news, how many Democrats handled the Trump news, obviously there is differences between them, but you sort of realize that you know in our politics, people are so quick to judgment and so quick to condemn because of the tribe that they are a member of, and not necessarily because of the conduct itself.”

"Hunter Biden Admits Laptop Data Is Real After White House, Media Insisted For Months That It Wasn’t","Hunter Biden’s attorneys admitted that the data from his laptop was real in a letter sent Wednesday, despite White House and media assurances to the contrary.

Biden attorney Abbe D. Lowell wrote a letter to the Justice Department’s National Security Division requesting an investigation into individuals who accessed Biden’s “personal computer data,” such as Delaware repairman John Paul Mac Isaac. (RELATED: Hunter Biden’s Lawyers Admit That His ‘Computer Data’ Is Real)

NEW: In a letter demanding probes of the dissemination of Hunter Biden’s files, his lawyer appears to admit the underlying data is real, but also casts doubt on the origin story, noting it “supposedly originated from a computer left at [John Paul Mac Isaac’s] repair shop in Del.” pic.twitter.com/umLjrWpAok — Kenneth P. Vogel (@kenvogel) February 1, 2023

“Mr. Mac Isaac has admitted to gaining access to our client’s personal computer data without Mr. Biden’s consent. Mr. Mac Isaac has admitted to copying that data without Mr. Biden’s consent, and Mr. Mac Isaac has admitted to distributing copies of that data to the political enemies of Mr. Biden’s father, without Mr. Biden’s consent,” the letter alleges. “These unlawful actions caused the widespread publication, manipulation, and exploitation of Mr. Biden’s most personal information.” Lowell did not acknowledge that the actual laptop belonged to Biden.

Mac Isaac has provided paperwork showing that Biden left the laptop at his repair shop and signed over custody in April 2019. He alerted authorities to Biden’s laptop in October 2019 and later delivered a hard drive to Rudy Guiliani, who sent a copy to the New York Post.

“Backing up Mr. Biden’s files for any repair did not require Mr. Mac Isaac to review the contents of any such files. Mr. Biden did not consent to Mr. Mac Isaac gaining access to the content of those files in April 2019 or at any other time,” the letter continues.

The Daily Caller News Foundation verified the contents of Biden’s laptop two weeks after Twitter censored the Post’s reporting on the laptop in Oct. 2020. Other media outlets, including The New York Times, the Washington Post and CBS News, have since verified the contents of Biden’s laptop.

As a presidential candidate, Joe Biden said during a debate with then-President Donald Trump that the laptop was “a Russian plant.” His comments were based on an Oct. 2020 letter signed by dozens of former intelligence officials, who dismissed the laptop as “a Russian information operation” without having reviewed it. None of the former officials have apologized for signing the letter, nor have they retracted it in light of new information.

The intelligence officials’ claims were widely regurgitated by the media and led to numerous outlets dismissing the story entirely. National Public Radio (NPR) said it was “a waste of time,” and former CNN Host Brian Stelter suggested that the whole scandal had been “manufactured” by right wing media. When Trump mentioned the laptop during a “60 Minutes” interview, CBS Host Leslie Stahl said its veracity “can’t be verified.”

Washington Post opinion columnist Max Boot dismissed the laptop as “false” and “possibly part of a Russian disinformation campaign,” and his colleague David Ignatius called it a “non-scandal.” (RELATED: Disgraced Ex-FBI Official Says Computer Repairman Could Face Criminal Charges Over Hunter Biden’s Laptop)

The New York Times described the laptop story as “unsubstantiated” in 2021, a claim the outlet quietly deleted following widespread pushback. MSNBC Host Joe Scarbrough said the laptop was “false” and “so obviously” Russian disinformation, and his co-host Mika Brzezinski speculated the emails could be “linked to a foreign intelligence operation.”

MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace told viewers, “We shouldn’t look at it as anything other than a Russian disinformation operation.” Her colleague Stephanie Ruhle used the phrase “so-called story” in response to the New York Post’s reporting on the laptop.

Former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki amplified the intelligence community letter on Twitter and labeled the laptop story “Russian disinfo” shortly before the Biden administration hired her.

After the New York Times verified the laptop in March 2022, Psaki delegated authority to “the Department of Justice and also to Hunter Biden’s representatives” to determine its authenticity. On March 31, the White House declared that it would “absolutely stand by the president’s comment” about his son’s laptop.

Biden Uses Mass Shooting Hero To Push For ‘Assault Weapons’ Ban,"President Joe Biden used Monterey Park hero Brandon Tsay to call for a nationwide ban on “assault weapons” during his State of the Union Address Tuesday night.

Biden referenced Tsay while calling for the ban, saying, “He saved lives. It’s time we do the same as well.” Tsay, 26, took down the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people following a Chinese Lunar New Year dance festival, later telling reporters “something came over” him. (RELATED: ‘I Am Going To Get Assault Weapons Banned’: Biden Pledges To Go After Guns During MLK Day Speech)

“He thought he was going to die, but then he thought about the people inside. In that instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semi-automatic pistol away from a gunman who had already killed 11 people at another dance studio,” Biden said. “Ban assault weapons now.”

During the speech, Biden also referenced the parents who lost their children in Uvalde, Texas, saying they believe it is time to “do something on gun violence.”

Bided touted his own record on gun laws after referencing the Uvalde parent’s request, saying, “Thank God we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades.”

“That includes things that the majority of responsible gun owners support, like enhanced background checks for 18 to 21-year-olds and red flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and others,” Biden continued.

BREAKING: Biden is planning to call for a permanent nationwide ‘assault weapons’ ban #2A — Uncle Sam 🇺🇲 (@MericaHeartland) February 8, 2023

In June, Joe Biden signed the “Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,” saying it was “the most significant law” on the topic “in the last 30 years.” The law provides funding for crisis intervention programs to be used for “red flag” programs and mental health courts.

The law also addressed “the boyfriend loophole,” blocking individuals convicted of a domestic violence crime from owning a gun even if they didn’t live with their victim. Additionally, the law expanded background checks for individuals between 18-21 years old.

Following multiple mass shooting in January, Biden pledged to continue his goal of banning “assault weapons,” saying that there is no “social redeeming value” to owning “assault weapons” because deer do not wear “Kevlar vests,” according to the president’s remarks at the National Action Network’s Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast.

Biden further questioned why Americans need so many bullets, saying “ban the number of bullets that can go in a magazine. No, no need for any of that.”

Despite Biden’s call for an “assault weapons” ban, a majority of Americans do not support banning such firearms, according to a recent poll. Of 1,003 adults, 51% said they opposed a ban, a 10-point increase from 2019, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Monday.

Support for an “assault weapons” ban steadily declined from 2019, to 47% in 2023, as the public is undecided on whether or not making it harder to get guns would reduce mass shootings, according to the poll.

Biden closed his call for an “assault weapons” ban by saying, “We did it before. I led the fight to ban them in 1994. In the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled. Let’s finish the job and ban assault weapons again.”

Watch Biden Pause SOTU Mid-Speech To Have It Out With Booing GOP,"Republicans erupted in condemnation after President Joe Biden accused them of wanting to ruin Social Security and Medicare.

Biden was addressing the nation Tuesday during his State of the Union address when he made the claim that Republicans are holding the country hostage as they seek to negotiate the debt ceiling.

“Some of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage, I get it, unless I agree to their economic plans,” Biden said. “All of you at home should know what their plans are. Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset. I’m not saying it’s the majority …”

Biden Says Illegal Immigration Is ‘Down’ In SOTU,"President Joe Biden claimed he’s succeeded in driving illegal migration “down” during his State of the Union Tuesday night.

Biden attributed his success to a new program allowing migrants from Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Haiti to qualify for parole if they have a sponsor. The president’s statement follows a record surge in illegal immigration in fiscal year 2022, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded more than 2.3 million migrant encounters and in December, when the agency recorded more than 250,000 migrant encounters, marking the highest month on record. (RELATED: Illegal Immigrants Believe The Border Is ‘Open’ Under Biden, Official Tells Congress)

“We now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers and seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months. Since we launched our new border plan last month, unlawful migration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela has come down 97%. But America’s border problems won’t be fixed until Congress acts,” Biden said.

Following the launch of the latest parole program, illegal migrant encounters at the southern border dipped from a seven-day average of 3,367 per day on Dec. 11 to a seven-day average of 115 on Jan. 24, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Biden pressured Congress to pass immigration reform in addition to amnesty for Dreamers and certain migrant workers.

“If you won’t pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border. And a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers,” he added.

Biden Pledges To Prevent Medicare Cuts — But He’s Cutting Medicare Advantage Right Now,"President Joe Biden pledged to stop anyone who tries to cut Medicare during his State of the Union address Tuesday evening, but his administration is currently pushing to cut billions of dollars from Medicare Advantage.

Budget cuts have been at the center of the fight over how to handle the debt ceiling, and Republicans have denied charges that they are plotting to cut Medicare or Social Security. The Biden administration, however, is moving to cut $4.7 billion from Medicare Advantage, an increasingly popular alternative to traditional Medicare, from 2023 to 2032, according to Axios.

“The mainstream media allowed Biden to get away with gargantuan lies during his State of the Union address,” Republican Oklahoma Rep. Kevin Hern told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “He refused to take the blame for his failures, and instead railed against Republicans (who spent the last four years in the minority) for everything from inflation to cutting Medicare. The fact is, just last week the Biden Administration cut Medicare programs by administrative fiat. These cuts will impact millions of seniors.”

“We will not cut Medicare,” Biden said in his Tuesday speech. “If anyone tries to cut Social Security — which apparently they’re not going to do — and if anyone tries, and Medicare, I’ll stop them. I’ll veto it.” (RELATED: Biden’s IRS Pushes Scheme To Crack Down On Restaurant Tips)

His comment was met with praise from Democrats including Democratic New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman, who suggested independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders had actually written the speech.

The Biden administration’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced Jan. 30 it plans to conduct audits and recoup funds from overpayments to insurance programs dating back to 2011, which will mean clawing back $4.7 billion from the program, according to Axios.

On Feb. 1, CMS proposed $3 billion in Medicare Advantage cuts as part of an effort to change the way insurance companies record their data; insurance companies would get less money from Medicare Advantage for certain diagnoses, according to Kaiser Health News.

Republican Texas Rep. Brian Babin said Biden had “gutted” Medicare Advantage with these moves.

The White House did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN: The Spy Balloon Was A Test — Biden Failed It,"Once again, the Biden administration’s response to a serious national security threat has proved to be too little, too late.

The Pentagon first detected the Chinese Communist Party’s now-infamous surveillance balloon over U.S. airspace in Alaska on Saturday, Jan. 28, but failed to inform the American people of its existence until Thursday, Feb. 2.

The announcement caused an uproar – and immediate action here on Capitol Hill – but by that point, the damage was done. President Biden had allowed the balloon to potentially collect intelligence and spy on American military assets for a whole week. In typical Biden administration fashion, officials praised the president before launching a full-scale, media-abetted cover up.

President Biden’s national security “experts” sprinted for the cameras and assured us that it posed no risk to the United States, despite knowing that the spy balloon was capable of launching remote-controlled drones or dropping listening devices over sensitive military installations.

The spy balloon is only the tip of the iceberg in Beijing’s lengthy quest for control over the United States and our freedom-loving partners, and it’s high time the Biden administration realized that. The CCP is not our friend.

While Democrats are eager to swallow Beijing’s lies about weather research balloons that “accidentally” strayed off course, the CCP has been working behind the scenes to expand its power through the extortionate programs under Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative, by planting Confucius Institutes on college campuses, and by purchasing farmland and other property in the U.S. Their use of TikTok will go down in history as one of the world’s most terrifying propaganda operations.

Internally, the CCP is a hostile force against their own people. In full view of their global audience, they destroyed Hong Kong’s autonomy and are openly seeking to take control of Taiwan. Xi Jinping and his tyrannical puppets view any culture that is different from theirs as a threat to the ruling party.

The CCP is openly committing crimes against humanity in Xinjiang province. More than one million Uyghurs currently languish in prisons and forced labor camps simply because they are Muslim. Those fortunate enough not to be jailed are targeted, harassed, and surveilled 24/7.

The Biden administration cannot be so naive as to think that multiple Chinese-controlled spycraft just happened to stray into U.S. airspace. Their choice to de-emphasize the threat, then, should make you wonder: What kind of message does their indecisiveness send our adversaries? What actions is the administration taking to prevent further acts of espionage within our airspace?

It seems they’re in no hurry to reassure us. Had the public not found out about the balloon, President Biden would have let it fly all the way back to Beijing. And you can be certain that Secretary of State Antony Blinken would have traveled to China as planned to shake hands with President Xi.

After Blinken canceled his trip, he told his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, that he is “prepared to visit Beijing as soon as conditions allow.” What conditions? This isn’t a vacation that got canceled because it wasn’t sunny and 75. And yet, Secretary Blinken is practically apologizing to the CCP because the American reaction to their surveillance operation forced him to delay his trip. Our bad, China.

The Biden administration’s entire response was unacceptable and dangerous. Beijing is watching the United States very closely, and how we respond matters.

In this situation, we must rebuild our nuclear stockpile and rapidly modernize our military to ensure our service members have the resources they need to adequately combat the New Axis of Evil.

And still, resources mean very little without a formidable Commander-in-Chief—a standard that Joe Biden has once again failed to live up to on the world stage. This isn’t hard, Mr. President: when a Chinese spy balloon appears over U.S. airspace, shoot it down. Immediately.

"‘Irresponsible, Radical, And Unconstitutional’: 15 Attorneys General Poke Holes In Biden’s Stance On ‘Assault Weapons’","A coalition of 15 Republican attorneys general sent a letter to President Joe Biden Wednesday calling out his stance on so-called “assault weapons” and pledging to oppose his plan to target gun rights.

The coalition, led by Republican Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, questioned Biden’s definition of so-called “assault weapons,” further saying that his call for Congress to ban “assault weapons” is both “irresponsible and unconstitutional,” according to the letter. The letter specifically responded to Biden’s State of The Union Address and his comments about assault weapons and semi-automatic handguns, saying they were “astonishing,” as there are over 100 million semi-automatic handguns and 45 million semi-automatic rifles in the United States possessed by law-abiding Americans.

The coalition also questioned Biden’s “assault weapon” designation, saying it is a “misleading label” and an attempt to scare Americans and criminalize law-abiding gun owners.

“The right to keep and bear arms in self-defense guards and protects the right to life, the first and most fundamental God-given right recognized in the Declaration of Independence. And, needless to say, your repeated attempts to deprive law-abiding Americans of guns that are in common and widespread use for self-defense are patently unconstitutional,” Knudsen wrote in the letter.

The letter further condemned Biden’s decision to use Monterey Park hero Brandon Tsay to call for a nationwide ban on “assault weapons” during his State of the Union Address. Biden referenced Tsay while calling for the ban, saying, “He saved lives. It’s time we do the same as well.” (RELATED: Biden Admin Sends Over $200 Million To States For Gun Crackdown)

Tsay, 26, took down the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people following a Chinese Lunar New Year dance festival.

“Knowing how radical your proposed policy is, you attempted to assuage Americans’ legitimate concerns about self-defense by invoking the example of Brandon Tsay, a heroic young man who wrestled a firearm away from an active shooter in Monterey Park, California,” the letter said. “Your reliance on Mr. Tsay’s heroics, however, is both cynical and self-defeating.”

Biden has a record of calling for “assault weapon” bans, and most recently pledged to push for a ban in January. Following multiple mass shootings, Biden said that there is no “social redeeming value” to owning “assault weapons” because deer do not wear “Kevlar vests,” according to the president’s remarks at the National Action Network’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Day breakfast.

Referencing the Second Amendment as a means for private citizens to defend themselves against the government, Biden also said that it would take a lot more firepower than an AR-15 to take down the government.

“I love my right-wing friends who’ll talk about the tree of liberty is watered with the blood of patriots. If you need to worry about taking on the federal government, you need some F-15s you don’t need an AR-15,” Biden continued.

“In a letter sent to President Biden, 15 other state attorneys general joined Attorney General Knudsen in highlighting the many flaws of his reasons for banning his personal, broad definition of ‘assault weapons,’ as well as the dangers of doing so.” https://t.co/BDG48A4Ihd — FPC Action Foundation (@FPCAction) February 15, 2023

Biden’s address is the first time he has spoken at length to the public about the Chinese spy balloon which was shot down Feb. 4 after it had been hovering above the U.S. for seven days, and the three unidentified flying objects which were shot down near Alaska, Canada and Michigan in the days after. (RELATED: Pentagon On ‘Heightened Alert’ As Fourth Unidentified Aerial Object Shot Down Near Michigan, NORAD Commander Says)

“I gave the order to take down these objects due to hazards to civilian commercial air traffic, and because we could not rule out the surveillance risk of sensitive facilities,” Biden said.

The “Intelligence Community’s current assessment is that these three objects were most likely balloons tied to private companies, recreation or research institutions, studying weather, or conducting other scientific research,” he added. “Make no mistake: if any object presents a threat to the safety and security of the American people, I will take it down.”

The debris from the Chinese spy balloon is still being recovered from the Atlantic Ocean, and the other three objects have yet to be found. The White House has said that the unidentified objects were shot down because they were at low altitude, and that the administration was on higher alert after modifying their search scope following the discovery of the Chinese balloon.

Relations between China and the U.S. had not taken a “hit” after the balloon incident, Biden previously said in an interview with PBS, and maintained that the U.S. is not “looking for conflict” with China.

The Biden administration established an “interagency team” to further study “unidentified aerial objects,” White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby announced Monday.

Biden also “directed the secretary of state, the secretary of defense, and the director of national intelligence to engage with their relevant counterparts to share information and to try to gain their perspectives” and “instructed the Intelligence Community to take a broad look at the phenomenon of unidentified aerial objects,” Kirby added.

In his remarks, Biden said he has asked for the establishment of “a better inventory of unmanned airborne objects and space about the United States;” “improve our capacity to detect” objects; “update the rules and regulations for launching and maintaining unmanned objects in the sky;” and the secretary of state will lead “an effort to help establish” common global norms in the sky.

He added that he expects to “speak with President Xi.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/16/biden-addresses-recent-aerial-objects/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiT6d3U_7P9AhXGFFkFHc0yBBs4MhAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw2_kffcSMK1n6yk20sgKsv0,2023-02-16
Biden Appointee’s Firm Admits He Belonged To Alleged Chinese Intel Operation,"President Joe Biden’s appointee to represent the U.S. at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) formerly served as a member of an organization which experts have identified as a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) intelligence front group, according to a spokesman from the company he leads.

Dominic Ng, CEO of East West Bank, served at an “executive-director level” in an “honorary position” at the China Overseas Exchange Association (COEA), yet allegedly withdrew from the organization in 2014 due to “non-participation,” according to statements an East West Bank spokesman made to American Banker on Friday. The statements were issued following a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation which found that Ng served as “executive director” at COEA between 2013 and 2017, before the banker began a five-year position with the same title of “executive director” at the related China Overseas Friendship Association (COFA) in 2019; both COEA and COFA have been identified by China experts as Chinese intelligence front groups.

Consequently, six Republican members of Congress led by Texas Rep. Lance Gooden of Texas sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday demanding an investigation into Ng’s reported ties to the CCP. While characterizing recent scrutiny into Ng’s alleged CCP ties as “conspiracy theories,” the bank’s spokesman also denied Ng had ever been involved with COFA, according to the report. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: GOP Reps Demand FBI Probe Biden Appointee Linked To Alleged Chinese Communist Orgs)

“An individual with ties to Chinese intelligence front groups should be disqualified from public office,” Texas Republican Rep. Lance Gooden told the Daily Caller News Foundation on Monday. “If he has any integrity, Mr. Ng would step down until an investigation has time to occur.”

Multiple Chinese intelligence analysts, such as former CIA officer Nicholas Eftimiades, have identified both COEA and COFA, which merged in 2019, as front groups for the United Front Work Department (UFWD), a CCP agency overseeing both influence and intelligence operations, according to reports from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC).

“American law and policy makers need to stand firm against candidates who have known associations with the COEA or COFA because it’s a part of the CCP’s UFWD which is responsible for coordinating domestic and foreign influence operations through propaganda and manipulation,” Ina Mitchell, co-author of “The Mosaic Effect: How The Chinese Communist Party Started A War In America’s Backyard,” told the DCNF.

East West Bank’s spokesman claimed that the extent of Ng’s involvement with COEA was significantly less than what the DCNF’s investigation found, according to American Banker; for example, the spokesman claimed that although Ng had been a member of COEA, Ng never paid membership fees and allegedly withdrew from the organization at some point in 2014.

However, the DCNF found that Ng was listed as COEA’s “executive director” throughout the entirety of COEA’s 5th Council between 2013 and 2017, citing multiple archived versions of COEA’s website.

The East West Bank spokesman also claimed that Ng never attended any meetings with COEA, according to American Banker.

Yet, the main image on the front page of an archived version of COEA’s website from February 12, 2014, prominently features Ng meeting in Beijing with COEA’s former “chairman,” Han Qide, the DCNF found.

Furthermore, since 2014, Ng apparently continued to interact with UFWD leaders from COEA including participating in meetings with the alleged front group’s former “executive vice chairman” Qiu Yuanping in Beijing in March 2015 and again in Los Angeles in February 2016.

“America needs to wake up and start to view political appointees with ties to UFWD organizations as a national security threat to the nation,” Mitchell told the DCNF. “[Individuals who’ve belonged to UFWD fronts] are not only unfit to serve, they are a danger to the nation. They are there to undermine America and help shape foreign views of China.”

APEC, East West Bank and Ng did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

DeSantis Slams Biden For Visiting Ukraine While Ignoring Southern Border,"Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday criticized President Joe Biden for his Ukraine war strategy, accusing him of neglecting the U.S.-Mexico border.

DeSantis joined “Fox & Friends” from Staten Island, New York, where he spoke about President Biden’s surprise visit to Kyiv, Ukraine. “I think I and many Americans are thinking to ourselves, ‘Ok, he’s very concerned about those borders halfway around the world. He’s not done anything to secure our own board here at home,'” DeSantis said. (RELATED: DeSantis Responds To Nikki Haley Criticism)

WATCH HERE:

“We’ve had millions and millions of people pour in, tens of thousands of Americans dead because of fentanyl, and then of course, we just suffered a national humiliation of having China fly a spy balloon clear across the continental United States. So, we have a lot of problems accumulating here in our own country that he is neglecting,” DeSantis continued.

The Fox & Friends co-hosts followed up with questions about Biden’s objectives in Ukraine and whether America should continue funding Ukraine’s war efforts against Russia.

“They have, effectively, a blank-check policy with no clear strategic objective identified,” DeSantis responded. “So I think it would behoove [the Biden administration] to identify … the strategic objective that they’re trying to achieve. But just saying it’s an open-ended blank check, that is not acceptable.”

The governor also addressed what it would mean for the U.S. if Ukraine were to win in the war against Russia.

“I think it’s important to point out [that] the fear of Russia going into NATO countries and all that, and steamrolling: That has not even come close to happening. I think they’ve shown themselves to be a third-rate military power,” he said.

“I think [Russia has] suffered tremendous, tremendous losses. I’ve got to think the people in Russia are probably disapproving of what’s going on. I don’t think they can speak up about it for obvious reasons. So I think Russia has been really, really wounded here, and I don’t think that they are the same threat to our country — even though they’re hostile — I don’t think they’re on the same level as China,” he concluded.

DeSantis is widely expected to run for president against former President Donald Trump and a growing field of Republican candidates, where Ukraine war funding will likely be a contentious issue.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/20/desantis-biden-ukraine-southern-border/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwinjNnW_7P9AhVjD1kFHeTvBIQ4UBAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw2vrEGQIFLc3qyLeI1kMbMC,2023-02-20
America’s Largest Native American Lobbying Group Calls For Biden Admin To Hit Pause Button On Offshore Wind: REPORT,"Editor’s note: This article has been updated to include comment from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

The largest lobbying group for Native American tribes called for a moratorium on offshore wind projects Thursday, according to Bloomberg.

The National Congress of American Indians voted on a resolution asking the Biden administration to halt the projects, citing their non-inclusion in the planning, permitting and contracting process of the coastal projects, according to Bloomberg. The resolution follows concerns over the projects’ potential links to whale deaths. (RELATED: Biden’s Interior Secretary Refers To The US Capital As The ‘Ancestral Homelands’ Of Native American Tribes)

The group asked the Interior Department and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to stop all scoping and permitting of offshore wind projects until a “comprehensive and transparent procedure adequately protecting tribal environmental and sovereign interests” is implemented, according to Bloomberg. They also emphasized that all tribes “must be included in the management, permitting and development of power purchase agreements.”

“We have taken coordinated actions to incorporate Indigenous Knowledge and Tribal input into our decision-making process, and we are working to help Tribes expand capacity to engage in environmental reviews, work with industry, and develop partnerships. BOEM is committed to upholding our Tribal trust responsibilities and fostering working relationships based on trust and meaningful consultation and we are always working to improve the consultation process to engage Tribes in a respectful way,” a BOEM spokesperson told the DCNF.

Offshore wind projects have also been the subject of recent criticism from environmental groups like Clean Ocean Action due to mounting whale deaths near project sites. On Tuesday, 30 New Jersey mayors signed a letter calling for an immediate moratorium on offshore wind projects until an investigation into the whale deaths is conducted, according to MidJersey.News.

The Department of Energy (DOE) announced more funding to accelerate floating offshore wind development Wednesday, according to a DOE press release.

Biden had vowed to include tribal nations in the decision-making, according to Bloomberg. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland is the first Native American to lead a cabinet agency and has taken action like renaming U.S. sites with “racially insensitive” meanings.

The Department of the Interior and the National Congress of American Indians did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

BETSY MCCAUGHEY: Biden’s Response To Ohio Train Disaster Reveals A Dark Truth — The Average Joe Doesn’t Matter,"President Joe Biden’s “Put Americans Last” policy is on full display at the chemical spill disaster in Ohio.

Fearing for their lives, local residents of the small town of East Palestine, Ohio, have been forced to evacuate their homes, their eyes burning, their skin mottled with rashes, their drinking water suspect — yet the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) refused to help for two weeks. What a contrast to the immediate help FEMA provides when buses of illegal immigrants roll into Washington, D.C., or New York. (RELATED: DAVID BOSSIE: Americans Will Never Forget ‘The Buttigieg Botch’)

To assist illegals, charity workers funded by FEMA literally meet the buses and begin distributing food, hotel rooms, rental assistance, legal counsel and health care — the very things that the East Palestine victims also need. And the omnibus spending bill Biden signed in December gives FEMA a whopping $800 million expressly to pay for migrants’ needs as they arrive in U.S. cities from the southern border.

Yet Biden is giving the people of this Ohio town — working-class, taxpaying citizens who are 98% white — the cold shoulder. Under Biden, FEMA apparently stands for First Embrace Migrants and Aliens. FEMA is the welcome wagon for illegals.

On Feb. 17, 14 days after the Norfolk Southern train derailed in this small Ohio town, spewing burning vinyl chloride into the air and water, the White House tried to produce a reason why FEMA was a no-show. “FEMA is on the frontlines when there is a hurricane or tornado. This situation is different.” That is a lame lie.

Under the Stafford Act of 1988, FEMA is empowered to respond to human-made disasters, such as fires and explosions, as well as natural disasters. FEMA was envisioned to help people like East Palestine residents Audrey DeSanzo and her two school-age children.

After the train accident on Feb. 3, Gov. Mike DeWine told families to evacuate immediately or face “grave danger of death.”

The DeSanzos fled to a relative’s empty apartment in Pennsylvania, where they slept on the floor and on a couch.

On Feb. 9, officials gave the clear for residents to return, but DeSanzo says her children quickly developed sore throats and coughs. A local doctor said many patients had these problems and advised calling poison control.

DeSanzo would like to get out of East Palestine, but she makes only $14 an hour. “Where am I supposed to go?” she asked. FEMA is footing the bill for migrants to stay in hotels, but not the DeSanzos.

Norfolk Southern is sending each family $1,000. That doesn’t cover medical bills, housing, meals and lost wages during an evacuation. Small business owners wonder how they will recover from shutting down and losing inventory ruined by chemical odors.

Meanwhile, FEMA’s website urges illegals to apply for disaster relief, supplying an Undocumented Immigrants Disaster Assistance Flyer in a staggering 18 languages — but heartland Americans can take a hike.

The White House claimed on Friday that it’s “mobiliz(ing) a robust, multi-agency effort” for the Ohioans, including help from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

HHS says it will open a clinic Tuesday in cooperation with the Ohio Department of Health. It’s too little too late. Since Feb. 4, residents have complained of burning eyes and gums, rashes and shortness of breath. Vinyl chloride is a carcinogen known to cause liver cancer and possibly brain and lung cancers, lymphoma and leukemia.

Yet Ohioans have been left to fend for themselves.

Meanwhile, HHS has been busy coddling illegals. HHS recently approved a waiver for Washington State to offer illegals free health insurance for the sake of “equity.” And HHS is flying unaccompanied illegal minors from the border to their new homes under the cover of night.

Where’s the concern for helping Ohio children being subjected to dangerous toxins?

The people of East Palestine will tell you the odor of burning vinyl chloride is suffocating, but worse is the stench of Biden’s disdain for regular Americans.

American resources should be going to help Americans first.

‘Huge Difference’: Jean-Pierre Tries To Dispel Accusations That Biden Admin Is Bringing Back A Trump Rule,"White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre attempted to push back against accusations that the Biden administration is adopting a Trump-era asylum rule, during a news conference Thursday.

The Biden administration announced Tuesday a new immigration plan that would bar access to asylum for migrants who pass through safe countries on their journey without making an asylum claim there. A former Trump administration official and some immigrant activists said it resembled the Trump administration’s safe third country agreements with Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to expel many illegal immigrants claiming asylum in the U.S. (RELATED: More Than A Dozen Illegal Immigrants Found In Texas Storm Drain)

“There is a huge difference here, which is what we are providing is expanded legal pathways. And that is important to make note is that that is something that the past administration didn’t do and that is something that we are doing here,” Jean-Pierre said.

“Look, on day one, the president put forward a comprehensive immigration reform proposal and that’s showing that the president was taking this very seriously. And the way that we see this is Congress needs to act and what was happening currently, right now is that congress is not acting,” she added.

WATCH:

The new rules coincide with a record surge in illegal immigration into the U.S. under Biden’s tenure. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded more than 2.3 million migrant encounters in fiscal year 2022.

The Biden administration introduced the rule before the anticipated end of Title 42, the Trump-era expulsion order used to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, on May 11.

Title 42’s end is still being contested in court as a result of lawsuits led by Republican states.

President Joe Biden also created new legal paths in January for migrants to enter the country either using a phone app at ports of entry or to utilize a program for Venezuelans, Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans to apply for humanitarian parole to fly into the U.S.

REPORT: Biden Judicial Nominee Is Diversity Trainer Who Argued For More Exceptions To First Amendment,"President Joe Biden’s judicial nominee for a vacancy on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals is a diversity trainer who argued for expanding a First Amendment exemption.

Maria Araujo Kahn, an associate justice in the Connecticut Supreme Court, said in a 2020 opinion the “fighting words” exception to the First Amendment should be expanded to account for certain groups having to endure more offensive speech. (RELATED: Diversity Officers Pink Slipped Like Never Before During Black History Month)

SCOOP: President Joe Biden’s nominee to fill a vacancy on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals is a longtime diversity trainer who has argued for curtailing the First Amendment and conducted training sessions that say “microaggressions” can “kill you.” 🧵https://t.co/zojgMUCAk4 — Aaron Sibarium (@aaronsibarium) February 24, 2023

The fighting words exemption narrowly applies to speech likely to incite a violent reaction from an ordinary citizen, and it takes into consideration the personal attributes of the speaker. Under existing fighting words criteria, certain groups “must endure a higher level of offensive speech before being afforded legal remedies,” Kahn wrote.

Kahn has conducted at least 12 diversity training sessions about topics such as “microaggressions” and “cultural competence,” the Washington Free Beacon reported. In one session with Fordham Law School graduates, Kahn compared “microaggressions” to lethal mosquitoes sucking a person dry.

“Some mosquitoes carry truly threatening diseases that can mess up your life for years,” a cartoon voice-over says. “And other mosquitos carry strains that can even kill you.” The video proceeds to show a mosquito holding a gun next to a dead body.

Dems Cry ‘Racism’ After DCNF Bombshells Expose Rep. Judy Chu and Biden Appointee’s Ties To Alleged Chinese Intel,"Several Democrats labeled a Republican lawmaker’s recent comments about California Democratic Rep. Judy Chu “racist” and “xenophobic” in a series of tweets and press releases Thursday.

Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, along with Reps. Adam Schiff of California, Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois and Daniel Goldman of New York attacked Texas Republican Rep. Lance Gooden after he questioned Chu’s “loyalty or competence” during an interview on Jesse Watters Primetime on Wednesday night. Gooden’s comments were in response to Chu’s defense of Dominic Ng, President Joe Biden’s appointee to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), following a series of reports from the Daily Caller News Foundation which revealed that both Chu and Ng have apparent ties to alleged Chinese Communist Party (CCP) intelligence front groups. (RELATED: ‘Tip Of The Iceberg’: Biden Appointee’s Ties To Alleged Chinese Intel Groups Put Him In Legal Hot Water, Experts Say)

“Lance Gooden’s slanderous accusation of disloyalty against Rep. Chu is dangerous, unconscionable and xenophobic,” a press release from Jeffries office stated.

Gooden said that Jeffries was “playing the race card in a sick display of disloyalty to our nation,” in a press release response.

Schiff then alleged that “questioning Chu’s loyalty to the United States is xenophobic and racist” and characterized Gooden’s comments as “hate” and “anti-Asian bigotry” in a tweet.

Questioning @RepJudyChu’s loyalty to the United States is xenophobic and racist. Shame on you, @LanceGooden. And on @FoxNews for airing such hate. We cannot allow anti-Asian bigotry to go without condemnation. — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) February 23, 2023

Goldman also took to Twitter and labeled Gooden’s comments “racist” and “dangerous.”

My friend @RepJudyChu is an American patriot and one of our nation’s finest public servants. At a time when anti-AAPI violence is at record highs, @Lancegooden‘s racist comments are not only disgusting and unacceptable, they are also dangerous. There must be consequences. https://t.co/SSQgj8iu0q — Rep. Dan Goldman (@RepDanGoldman) February 24, 2023

Chu has served as the “honorary president” at the All America Chinese Youth Federation (AACYF) since 2012 and was appointed the “honorary chairwoman” of the Forums for Peaceful Reunification of China in 2019, the DCNF recently revealed. While AACYF’s leadership has apparently included at least five individuals who belong to alleged CCP intel fronts, Forums for Peaceful Reunification of China opposes Taiwan’s independence and was identified by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission as a front group serving a CCP “intelligence service” known as the United Front Work Department (UFWD).

Meanwhile, the DCNF also recently reported that Biden’s appointee to APEC, Dominic Ng, has served as “executive director” at both the China Overseas Exchange Association (COEA) and the China Overseas Friendship Association (COFA), which have both been identified as CCP intel front groups.

In the wake of the DCNF’s revelations, Gooden and five Republican members of Congress sent a letter to the FBI on Feb. 15 urging Director Christopher Wray to investigate Ng’s alleged CCP ties, while a spokesperson for East West Bank told The Hill that Ng, in fact, admitted to having held an “honorary position” at an “executive-director level” at COEA.

Chu came to Ng’s defense on Feb. 17, labeling “suspicions” about Ng as “profiling.”

Chu has come under increased scrutiny since she voted against the formation of the House Select Committee on China on Jan. 10, which is charged with investigating the CCP’s malign influence efforts. While defending her vote, Chu alleged that the new committee might prompt anti-Asian violence, according to a statement released by the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC), which Chu chairs.

Krishnamoorthi, who was recently appointed to serve as the ranking member on the committee, said that Gooden’s comments on Fox News “only feed the scapegoating and targeting of Chinese-Americans, further endangering them and all Asian Americans,” according to an announcement from Krishnamoorthi’s office.

However, Gooden has also received support from several Republican colleagues who co-signed the Feb. 15 letter to the FBI.

“It’s unfortunate that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are choosing misdirection over getting to the bottom of Mr. Ng’s troubling associations with these shady CCP-linked groups,” Wisconsin Republican Rep. Tom Tiffany told the DCNF. “This is a matter of national security, and I hope the FBI takes these allegations seriously.”

“There is a well-documented history of Chinese intelligence operatives attempting to infiltrate the United States,” Alexandra Lavy, communications director for California Rep. Doug LaMalfa, told the DCNF. “Mr. Ng has involvement in at least one Chinese intelligence front group, and it is the job of all lawmakers to ensure Chinese Communist operatives do not jeopardize American institutions.”

“These Democrat lawmakers should be more concerned with safeguarding our national security than elevating their baseless smear tactics,” Lavy said.

CAPAC, Chu, Jeffries, Goldman, Krishnamoorthi, Schiff did not respond immediately to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Sen. Marco Rubio Vows To Stop Biden Nominee For Allegedly Covering Up Sexual Assault,"Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio announced Friday that he is placing holds on seven Biden administration nominees, including prospective Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti.

Biden nominated Garcetti, the former mayor of Los Angeles, to serve as ambassador in July 2021. However, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has not yet scheduled a floor vote to confirm him amid reports that he covered up sexual harassment and assaults committed by a top aide. The aide, Rick Jacobs, was named in a lawsuit filed by a police officer, and other complainants have since come forward.

“One of these nominees has ignored credible sexual assault accusations in his prior office. Another has done legal work with solar panel companies operating in Xinjiang, where egregious human rights abuses are committed. The list also contains an abortion extremist, someone with no diplomatic or investment experience, and an individual who has supported a policy of engagement with Cuba’s murderous dictatorship. I will not turn a blind eye to these absurd nominations, which will hasten America’s decline,” Rubio said in a statement.

RUBIO announces he’s placing a hold on Eric Garcetti’s nomination to be U.S. ambassador to India, joining other GOP senators. But Rubio is notable because he’s a member of SFRC, which is voting on his nomination on Tuesday.

Rubio sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which advanced Garcetti’s nomination by voice vote in January 2022. It stalled on the floor, with Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mark Kelly of Arizona and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, as well as now-Independent Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, expressing concern about Garcetti’s alleged knowledge of Jacobs’ activities. Republican Iowa Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst placed holds on Garcetti during the 117th Congress.

A report commissioned by Grassley found that Garcetti “more likely than not” was aware of Jacobs’ alleged sexual harassment of Los Angeles Police Department officer Matthew Garza, former Garcetti communications director Naomi Seligman, Kirra Consulting partner Alec Evans, and former deputy press secretary Anna Bahr. Jacobs admitted to some of the instances in a report submitted to the City of Los Angeles by attorney Leslie Ellis.

Obama Economist Says Inflation Has Made ‘Little If Any Progress’ Under Biden,"An economist who served in the Obama administration warned Friday the economy is “overheated” and said the current administration has barely made progress on inflation.

Former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Jason Furman released a Twitter thread indicating that things aren’t as good as they may seem when it comes to the economy.

“The economy is very overheated,” Furman tweeted. “We have made little if any progress on inflation. There is little, if any, reason to expect a large slowdown going forward.”

The economy is very overheated. We have made little if any progress on inflation. There is little if any reason to expect a large slowdown going forward. Core PCE at an annual rate: 1 month: 7.1%

12 months: 4.7% pic.twitter.com/aCA1341MQd — Jason Furman (@jasonfurman) February 24, 2023

“Supply chains unfreezing were supposed to bring down inflation,” he continued. “They didn’t. The economy looked like it was turning last summer/fall but that never materialized.” (RELATED: POLL: Highest Number of Americans In Four Decades Say They’re Financially Worse Off Under Biden’s Presidency)

“But there are still forces going in the direction of high inflation. In recent months goods prices have fallen, that likely won’t continue. And the extremely tight labor market has lagged effects on inflation. 6% inflation is much more likely than 2% inflation.”

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 6.4% in January year-over-year, though inflation peaked in June when it hit 9.1%, marking a near four decade high. While inflation did fall, it still remains more than three times above the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2%.

‘Unacceptable’: Biden Threatens Russia With ‘Severe Consequences’ If Putin Uses Nuclear Weapons,"President Joe Biden and other G7 leaders released a joint statement Friday calling Russia’s recent increase in nuclear rhetoric “unacceptable.”

“We reiterate that Russia’s irresponsible nuclear rhetoric is unacceptable, and any use of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences,” the leaders wrote in a statement.

Russian officials and media pundits have increasingly called for the country to launch nuclear weapons against the West since the beginning of the invasion in Ukraine. Former Russian Vice President Dmitry Medvedev said, “the defeat of a nuclear power in a conventional war may trigger a nuclear war.” Russian officials have previously threatened the U.S. for sending military aid to Ukraine.

On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin abandoned the START Treaty — the last remaining nuclear arms agreement with the U.S. — and said Russia would test nuclear weapons if the U.S. did so first. (RELATED: Putin Abandons Landmark Nuclear Arms Treaty With US After Biden Visits Ukraine)

The G7 leaders responded that they “deeply regret Russia’s decision to suspend the implementation of the new START treaty,” and also expressed grave “concern” over Russia’s continued control over Zaporizhzhya’s nuclear power plant.

The White House has maintained that there is no “indication” Putin “has any intention” of using nuclear weapons in the war on Ukraine. There was no increase in threats after the U.S. sent 31 M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said in January.

“The propagandists and the Russian media can say what they will. The president put it very clearly today. These tanks pose no offensive threat to Russia,” Kirby said.

“We don’t have any indication Mr. Putin has any intention to use weapons of mass destruction, let alone nuclear weapons, tactical or otherwise. And we monitor as best we can,” he added.

The G7 leaders met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday to discuss the one-year anniversary of the war. They called on Russia to end the war, and pledged continued aid to Ukraine “for as long as it takes.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/24/unnecaptable-biden-threatens-russia-severe-consequences-putin-nuclear-weapons/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjtv4XU_7P9AhUcM1kFHc-wCUM4KBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw2ps0NUoGxqXkJb4cO_Juac,2023-02-24
Biden Says He’s Not Planning To Visit East Palestine ‘At This Moment’,"President Joe Biden told the press Friday that he has no plans to visit East Palestine, Ohio following the Feb. 3 train derailment that forced members of the community to leave their homes and continues to pose environmental threats to the general vicinity.

In response to a reporter asking Biden on the White House lawn if the Commander-in-Chief will visit East Palestine three weeks after the locomotive derailment and subsequent release of toxic chemicals, the President said “At this moment [I’m] not,” NBC News reported.

Q: “Are you planning on traveling to East Palestine?” BIDEN: “At this moment not. I was, I did a whole video, I mean, uh, you know, the uh, what the Hell? On Zoom. All I can hear every time I think of Zoom is that song of my generation, ‘Who’s Zoomin’ Who?’” pic.twitter.com/tFo4zHhEkk — ALX 🇺🇸 (@alx) February 24, 2023



Biden assured reporters that he is addressing the situation remotely.

“The answer is that I had a long meeting with my team and what they’re doing. You know, we were there within two hours that the train went down, two hours,” Biden told the press. The President added that his cabinet was “keeping very close tabs” in regards to the aftermath of the destruction.

These comments come after former President Donald Trump, a 2024 Republican presidential front-runner,traveled to the region and donated shipments of bottled water and cleaning supplies as part of the Wednesday campaign stop, according to WKBN. Trump railed against the response (or lack thereof) by the current Democratic administration.

While a handful of Ohio politicians insisted that the tap water in East Palestine is safe to consume in a flurry of social media photo ops, residents remain leery, viewing the water as tainted, VICE reported.

Biden’s Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was on the ground Thursday and “vowed that his department will work with the administration and Congress to prevent future disasters similar to the Feb. 3 train derailment,” NBC noted. (RELATED: Buttigieg Visits Site Of Train Derailment, Three Weeks After Toxic Crash)

The GOP-majority House Oversight Committee began a probe into the Secretary’s response; including Chairman James Comer of Kentucky alongside other Republican members “[requesting] documents related to maintenance and procedures, including for trains carrying hazardous materials,” according to NBC. (RELATED: Buttigieg’s Office Refuses To Say Why He Took Photo Of DCNF’s Jennie Taer, Demands Reporter Turn Off Camera)

Buttigieg and the White House alike have attributed the toxic train derailment to rail deregulation that happened under the previous administration.

Democratic Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) have also taken aim at the Biden administration response effort, accusing federal officials of not doing enough to remedy the railway catastrophe, NBC continued.

Sen. Manchin attacked Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael Regan for declaring at the scene of the incident Feb. 16 that the administration “would work to hold Norfolk Southern responsible for the derailment.” (Norfolk Southern is the transportation company at the center of the derailment debacle.) (RELATED: Train Company Hit With Class Action Lawsuit After Toxic Derailment In Ohio)

On the same day, the Senator from West Virginia released a statement saying it was “unacceptable that it took nearly two weeks for a senior Administration official to show up,” the outlet noted.

According to a Thursday report by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, nearly 40,000 minnows, and 5,000 additional larger species such as “small fish, crayfish, amphibians, and macroinvertebrates” perished in a 5-mile-radius of the derailment site .

One of the researchers, Weihsueh Chiu, told the Post that short-term exposure poses little risk, but rather “It would take months, if not years, of exposure to the pollutants for serious health effects.”

In contrast, Keeve Nachman, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told the Post, “We don’t know enough about how those levels will change over time in order to rule out any concerns about long-term exposures or risks…”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/25/biden-not-planning-visit-east-palestine-train-derailment/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiR-oPS_7P9AhXMFVkFHX-tAdU4ChAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw0OglOivV4XGA4OR-erLdrA,2023-02-25
SUZANNE DOWNING: Biden Is Throwing Americans’ Retirement Savings To The Wolves. It’s Not Too Late To Stop Him,"Two wolves and a sheep decide what’s for dinner — that’s what the U.S. Department of Labor has done with American workers’ retirement accounts over the past few months.

Now that President Joe Biden’s ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) rule has been published in the Federal Registry, Congress can review it and disapprove it. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) is the one weapon Congress has to keep the Biden Administration from wolfing down Americans’ 401(k)s.

The House and Senate must do so at their earliest convenience this week. (RELATED: DERRICK MORGAN And MIKE MCKENNA: Climate Money Is Pouring Into Washington — Watch Out For The RINOs)

The CRA can be used anytime by Congress, but is usually tried after a change in administration, when an outgoing president promulgates 11th-hour rules and when there is a shift in majority in the House and Senate that can undo those rules through the congressional review and disapproval process.

The ESG rule is one of those Biden blunders that needs review and disapproval now. The rule issued through the Department of Labor encourages retirement fund managers to insert political bias into their investment decisions, in favor of environmental, social and corporate governance ideals — a shifting goal — rather than profitability. The regulation is 180 degrees opposite of the intent of Congress when it created the rule that mandated that fund managers make decisions that protect the financial interests of clients.

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) set parameters for most voluntarily established retirement and health plans in the private sector, with Congress aiming to protect individuals in these plans. ERISA allowed workers to trust their retirement fund managers, and trust is no small deal.

The Biden ESG rule allows these fund managers to instead take the retirement savings of millions of hard-working Americans and, rather than invest them for earnings, invest them with one or both eyes on political correctness, or for some shifting environmental or social engineering goal.

The ESG rule puts a thumb on the scale for “woke” investments that have historically not done that well in the free market, but instead push a far-left political agenda, including things like Critical Race Theory, climate change and the definitions of gender.

The new “Great Reset” rule allows retirement funds to essentially become independent expenditure groups that make businesses into the handmaidens of the left. Plan participants may unknowingly be enrolled in ESG funds that don’t even align with their political views or honor their investment strategies.

Indiana Republican Sen. Mike Braun, and all Senate Republicans drafted a bipartisan joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to overturn President Joe Biden’s ESG rule. West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, is apparently with them, and they need but a simple majority to pass a disapproval resolution. It is within reach in the Democrat-controlled Senate to get that majority.

In the House, a similar resolution is being advanced, led by Kentucky Republican Rep. Andy Barr. Also in the House, a working group was formed this month to do a deeper dive into the hazards of ESG investing rules. The Republican Working Group, led by Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Chairman Bill Huizenga Michigan Republican Rep. will look at the threat to capital markets posed by ESG proponents.

Americans’ 401(k)s are already threatened by a related Biden proposal announced during his State of the Union address that will increase taxes on corporations because their shareholders are, in his view, making too much money. That proposed tax makes profit a bad thing and less profit means less earnings for retirement accounts, which are the very shareholders Biden thinks are getting too rich.

The last thing Americans need is for their financial advisors to now take an ideological stand and decide that workers of America should be invested in high-risk, low-yield green companies. That’s never been the role of the fiduciary. The job is to protect the investor.

Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan describes it as raiding retirement accounts. It’s worse than that. This new rule shakes Americans’ faith in their financial institutions, and it takes away their rights as investors, rights that were, until November, protected under ERISA.

As the Senate reconvenes and the House returns from two weeks of meet-and-greets in home districts, readers will be seeing a lot more about the effort to eject — and the lobbyists’ effort to protect — the ESG woke investing rule.

Democrats are wolves deciding that retirement funds are the lamb they are having for dinner. Only the Congressional Review Act can keep those wolves at bay, for now.
