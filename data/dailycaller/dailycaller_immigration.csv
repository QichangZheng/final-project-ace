Two-stage reform answer to immigration,"In the lead-up to the health care reform debate, some observers argued that the White House should focus on passing smaller and more manageable pieces of legislation rather than pushing “comprehensive” reform. We may never know if this more modest strategic approach—endorsed by White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel but rejected by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi— might have proven more effective, and ultimately more popular, than Obama Care. But the issue of legislative method—and its efficacy in a bitterly divided, partisan Congress—is instructive because Obama faces a similar challenge on another first-term policy initiative—immigration reform—with the strong possibility that another legislative debacle could occur.

Here again, the commonsense Democratic wisdom is to push for a comprehensive” reform bill rather than to tackle the problem more modestly. In fact, the Obama-Reid-Pelosi approach to immigration reform is virtually identical to the expansive one that George W. Bush pursued so doggedly—and so unsuccessfully—in 2006 and 2007. It’s virtually DOA because it includes a sweeping legalization program for the nation’s estimated 12 million to 15 million undocumented immigrants at a time when the unemployment of legal workers is at record levels. At the same time, the bill doesn’t guarantee that an airtight border and workplace enforcement system will be in place to effectively control future illegal flows. If past evidence is any guide, the bill could actually make the problem of illegal immigration worse, not better.

House Republicans who decry any legalization program as an unconscionable “amnesty” aren’t budging until they see stronger immigration enforcement measures in place. And plenty of Democrats, everyone from the House caucus known as the “Blue Dogs” to the estimable Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) in the Senate, aren’t budging, either. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who’s tried to work closely with Democrats on a wide range of issues, is so furious with the way Democrats handled health care reform that he’s refusing to tackle immigration reform in 2010. And yet amazingly, that’s exactly what the Democrats are considering, even if it means pushing a Democrat-only bill, which no one on either side of the aisle believes, has any chance of success.

There is a way for the two parties to avoid his cynical and destructive impasse. And that’s to do what Obama could and should have done with health care—abandon the pretense of “comprehensive” reform, and focus on a more modest package. As was the case with health care reform, there are smaller and more “digestible” pieces of immigration reform legislation that might serve as the basis for bipartisan agreement now, before the mid-term elections. Time is short, but if the two parties can reach a first-stage agreement on these less contentious items, it might make partisan gridlock a bit less likely when they resume their debate after November.



The logic of a stripped down immigration agreement is similar to what’s been debated in comprehensive reform—only the scale is much smaller. The basic trade-off is still the same: a legalization of the undocumented in exchange for improvements in enforcement. Except that we are no longer talking about a massive and largely unconditional legalization program affecting as many as 15 million people. Or an equally contentious effort to introduce a controversial guest worker program or to impose a national ID card as the “final solution” to enforcement.

Conservatives, for example, could easily agree to some of the narrow legalization schemes that Democrats have proposed in the past, such as the DREAM Act that legalizes the children of illegal aliens who migrated with their parents, and really, through no fault of their own, are now living here illegally. The bill only affects about 1.5 million people, and to qualify for a green card, it insists that applicants either go to college or join the recruit-starved US military. It makes no sense to try to send these kids back to their countries of origin that they do not know, and to lose the value of the accrued investment in their education acquired here. Skillfully presented, DREAM might do for immigration what the CHIP program has done for child welfare—build a badly needed bridge on a hotly-contested issue

Another likely candidate for GOP support is Ag Jobs, which combines a special guest-worker program for agriculture with provisions to allow these workers to transition to legal residency. It’s not really an amnesty because many of the workers “imported” under the program aren’t yet living here. And the numbers involved, as with DREAM, are relatively small—perhaps 2 million workers. Furthermore, agribusiness desperately wants and needs the program, simply to survive. Finally, in contrast to other sectors of the unskilled labor market, there is little evidence that the foreign-born workers involved are competing with native-born Americans for the same jobs. (Wages are low, and the work is simply too demanding, and dirty, except for those long accustomed to it).



What would the GOP get “in return,” for these concessions? A dramatic expansion of the “E-Verify” workplace enforcement system that currently only applies to companies that are federal contractors—a tiny proportion of the firms operating in our economy. At present, the program’s largely voluntary. So let’s make E-Verify mandatory and extend it to more US firms, especially in low-skill industries like construction and food service in which illegal immigrants typically congregate. E-Verify isn’t bug-free, but the error rate is sufficiently low that the program can be safely expanded. And it’s high time that the “nod-and-the-wink” illegal hiring system known as “employer sanctions” was mothballed—or transcended. Thanks to E-Verify that should soon be possible. And let’s continue to enhance border enforcement, which, in recent years, has shown measurable progress in reducing illegal flows.

A deal of this sort will not resolve the immigration reform debate. It’s not meant to. It merely establishes a solid foundation that both parties can agree to prior to addressing the remaining “big-ticket” items. But only a narrow legislative window remains in 2010 to address immigration reform at all, and Democrats and Republicans alike are under increasing pressure to show progress. Rather than grandstanding and pointing fingers to gain partisan advantage, the two parties should simply conclude a more modest deal. For Republicans, it’s a chance to impress Hispanic swing voters who are as concerned about immigration as they are about rising deficits and the state of the economy, and who could easily be lured into backing Democratic candidates this fall if the GOP offers no positive vision of its own. And once the GOP gains greater control of Congress this fall—which is all but certain—it will be well placed to resist the Democrats’ general amnesty plan with more constructive proposals of its own.

Tea Party divided over immigration,"Tea Party activists who are debating whether to embrace “family values” issues in a year when the economy could make or break the Democrats and sweep their candidates to power are also divided over another hot-button issue — immigration.

One leading Tea Party group has decided to work closely with Roy Beck’s Numbers USA, a well-known “restrictionist” lobby that wants to see immigration, both legal and illegal, reduced. Together these groups are opposing passage of the DREAM Act, the stand-alone legislation that immigration reform advocates have rallied around as the prospects for passing a broader immigration bill have faded.

However, two other key Tea Party groups, including FreedomWorks, whose co-founder, former House majority leader Dick Armey, supports expanded immigration, say they’ll stay out of the fight over the DREAM Act.

Ideologically, support for immigration is thoroughly consistent with the Tea Party’s enthusiastic endorsement of the unfettered free market. In fact, for years, libertarian, pro-free enterprise groups like the CATO Institute have joined business groups and immigration advocates in calling for less government regulation of immigration — a position that critics call an “open borders” policy.

But many Tea Party activists believe that restoring the “rule of law” — and regaining control of the country’s borders — is also fundamental to the American ideal of freedom. They don’t necessarily oppose rising immigration, especially legal immigration, but they are hostile to “amnesties” for illegal aliens that appear to reward “lawbreakers.”

Ironically, anti-immigration Tea Partiers can cite the Founding Fathers in defense of their views. Ben Franklin spoke out frequently about the dangers of unregulated German immigration, which he felt would dilute the American “ideal” — much as nativists today oppose unrestricted Mexican immigration, fearing it will undermine mainstream culture, including English as the nation’s primary language.

So far, there doesn’t appear to be a consistent Tea Party view on immigration, and with no single national leader, the movement is under no pressure — at least not yet — to develop one. Different Tea Party groups are free to go their own way, and at the local level, often do.

In Philadelphia, a Tea Party Immigration Coalition (TPIC) formed in early July to oppose the city’s policy of providing “sanctuary” to illegal aliens. The group reportedly included local trade unions and a key state legislator who supports legal immigration, but opposes illegal immigration on the grounds that it hurts unemployed Philadelphia workers.

But the presence in TPIC of organizers from the Federation Against Immigration Reform, or FAIR, a national advocacy group that’s been accused of nativism and even racism in the past, has called into question how seriously TPIC actually supports immigration, or even immigration reform.

The prospects for political fissures within the Tea Party over immigration are undoubtedly real, however. In some locales, Tea Party leaders have broadly supported the Arizona crackdown and other expanded police enforcement measures but have drawn the line if the rights of legal residents and US citizens are threatened — as a recent federal court judge found when she blocked key provisions of the Arizona law.

And some Tea Party activists are staunchly opposed to the introduction of a national ID card as a way of weeding out illegal aliens from the workplace. Their opposition could put them to the “left” of Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans who are championing the national ID as an alternative to the current employer sanctions system and to flawed workplace verification systems like E-Verify.



Given their inclinations to favor citizen privacy, Tea Party activists are also likely to oppose E-Verify, which could provide an important opening for an alliance with pro-immigration groups that opposes expanded workplace enforcement altogether.

Divisions within the Tea Party over immigration parallel the divisions within the GOP between conservatives like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Jon Kyl (R-AZ) on the one hand, and Republican moderates and business groups that favor comprehensive immigration reform, including an expanded guest worker program.

Right now, the Tea Party appears likely to serve as an additional brake on any further efforts at compromise by the GOP with the Democrats on immigration reform, especially on the DREAM Act, or the new comprehensive immigration reform bill that Senator Roberto Menendez (D-NJ) is promising to introduce in the next few weeks.

But once Congress returns to the issue in earnest, sometime in 2011 or perhaps 2012, we can expect these divisions to widen as Democrats and Republicans alike turn their attention to the presidential race, amid an economy that may have recovered sufficiently to ease pressure on joblessness, and renewed inter-party competition for the allegiance of Latino voters.

At that point, the current fault line within the Tea Party over immigration could test the movement’s unity, and force it to choose between competing conservative ideals.

MSNBC’s Chuck Todd: ‘Immigration reform’ will get ’80 to 90 votes in the Senate’,"After Tuesday night’s re-election victory for President Barack Obama, MSNBC’s Chuck Todd predicted that one of the president’s agenda items — one promise he never managed to fulfill in his first term — would breeze into law. “Immigration reform,” he said, will get “80 to 90 votes in the Senate.” Since the election night results showed Republicans unable to attract Latino voters, he said, “Republicans will run, not walk, in trying to support that now.”

On the Wednesday broadcast of MSNBC’s “The Daily Rundown,” NBC White House correspondent Kristen Welker said Obama’s victory speech in Chicago pointed to an immigration bargain.

The president, Welker, said, “laid out some of the other things he wanted to accomplish during his second term that he wasn’t able to accomplish during his first term. One of those things [was] immigration reform.”

“He of course got a lot of criticism from the Latino community for not bringing about immigration reform, not getting the DREAM Act passed. You heard him mention that last night. Latinos clearly played a big role in his re-election. So I think that is something we’ll see him dedicate a fair amount of time to.”

GOP needs to get serious about immigration reform,"Every election cycle, Republicans wring their hands and repeat the same mantra about the Hispanic demographic. “They are pro-life, they are entrepreneurial, they are religious. Their natural home is the GOP. Why aren’t they voting for us?” Then the party increases its “Hispanic outreach” budget, cuts some Spanish-language ads for the Miami and Denver media markets, and wonders why it is hemorrhaging even more Hispanic votes than it did the previous cycle.

By now, it is almost universally understood that the GOP needs to capture more of the Hispanic vote. It will soon be very difficult for the party to win national elections if it doesn’t. But much more has to be done; Hispanics have heard enough about how the Republican Party is the pro-life, pro-small business, anti-tax party. What they have not heard is a Republican consensus that America’s immigration system is broken. Until the GOP acknowledges the need for immigration reform, the other issues that make the party the natural home for American Latinos will remain second-tier, non-vote-moving issues.

The Republican Party and conservative movement have much to offer Hispanics. But combining our message with “we want to deport your uncles, cousins, parents, grandparents, neighbors, fellow church members, and friends,” does not work. Republicans understand the importance of family and religion, so why are we attacking Hispanics in those two areas and expecting their support?

We need to change course. George W. Bush earned 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in his re-election bid. John McCain only mustered 32 percent, and Mitt Romney received support from only 27 percent of the Hispanic community. McCain and Romney didn’t slash their Hispanic outreach budgets; they strayed from Bush’s message of inclusion, free labor markets, and serious immigration reform.

Recognizing this reality is not just a cold political calculation. It’s good public policy. Immigrants, both low-skilled and high-skilled, enrich our country. They add to the tax base, serve in our military, and attend church. Many of them start businesses that otherwise would be our competitors overseas. And allowing a freer flow of labor is consistent with free market economics, and goes against the protectionist tendencies of labor unions.

But the political impetus will be what motivates most Republicans to embrace a new approach to immigration. Forget swing states; red states like Texas, Arizona, and Georgia will wind up solidly blue if the erosion of Republican support among Hispanics continues. Sure, Republicans could win the House of Representatives once in a while. But the Senate and the presidency will be all but out of reach — and with them, the ability to appoint and confirm Supreme Court justices.

But the GOP’s problem isn’t just with Hispanics; it’s with other new immigrant groups and their descendants, too. Asian-Americans are the fastest-growing racial group in the U.S., according to Cato Institute immigration policy analyst Alex Nowrasteh. In 1965, barely 1 percent of the nation’s population was Asian; it has since increased to 6 percent. Romney fared worse with Asians than he did with Hispanics, winning just 24 percent of the Asian vote. Most Asian groups trend Democratic, but this wasn’t always the case, and Republicans can win them back.



Asian-American values are very conservative. Asian-Americans overwhelmingly believe that hard work, marriage, and family are essential to success. They believe in the American dream, are more likely than the general population to be educated, are entrepreneurial, and are upwardly mobile.

The Hispanic and Asian populations in formerly Republican swing states are large and growing quickly. In Virginia, Hispanics and Asians together comprise almost 14 percent of the population. In Colorado, 24 percent. In Nevada, 34 percent. Arizona, where Asians and Hispanics make up a combined 33 percent of the population, is still fairly Republican, but is changing rapidly. Kansas, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Idaho, and Utah have Hispanic and Asian populations in the low double digits. Republicans can’t win national elections by only attracting one out of every four votes from these growing groups.

As the Republican Party rebounds from its failure in 2012 and begins to chart its return to power, improving its standing among Hispanics and Asians will be the number one priority. It’s important to reject the type of pandering that Democrats have gotten away with in the current political vacuum. By becoming the party of forward-thinking immigration solutions, the GOP can boost the economy and its prospects.

Alert: Immigration sellout underway?,"Alert! The entire GOP elite seems to be trying to sell out en masse on immigration. Not only Boehner, but Cantor. And Hannity (who works for pro-amnesty world citizen Rupert Murdoch). Even Krauthammer. …

Maybe these people are convinced the larger GOP project can be saved simply by caving on just this one issue. That seems cracked. The bulk of the Hispanic electorate appears to instinctively vote Democratic, and not just because of immigration. (“[T]his is just a fairly liberal voting block.”) Maybe they can be wooed over to the Republican side over the course of decades. But by then there will be another wave of new, instinctively Democratic illegal immigrants (lured by the Boehner Amnesty) for Dems to appeal to. And the idea that the GOPs don’t have to change any of their other ideas if only they appease this one ethnic group (making up 10% of the electorate) is highly questionable, as David Frum has argued. … There were plenty of other reasons why Romney lost. (If he’d gotten McCain’s share of the Latino vote … he still would have lost.)

The larger point is that “Comprehensive Immigration Reform”–which is supposed to be a simultaneous combination of an amnesty plus enforcement measures–is a terrible idea. It’s a terrible idea if it helps the Republican Party win national elections or if it hurts them..** As with the 1986 “comprehensive” reform, we will get the amnesty but not the enforcement–after the ACLU and Chamber of Commerce are through undermining it in the courts, and the Obama Justice Department is through undermining it in practice. The result will be (as in 1986) a new wave of illegal immigrants, largely unskilled, who will bid down the wages of the Americans and legal immigrants at the bottom of the labor market. These workers are the people most hurt by the big economic changes of the last few decades. If you want any American to be able to make a decent wage–even if they didn’t go to college–as long as they are willing to work full time, it’s a disaster. And even in the most optimistic scenario such an influx would test our country’s already depleted powers of assimilation.

A much better strategy would be to enact the enforcement measures (including a border fence and a system of employment checks), then wait a few years and see if they survive. If they do, sure, come up with some kind of amnesty. You could calmly pitch that plan to Latinos–it ends in the same place (amnesty). But that’s not the sort of sensible approach you will insist on if you are part of a stampede of panicked pols and consultants whose only goal is to pander to what they think Latinos want to make up for their shortcomings in other areas.

P.S.: It’s particularly insane to think (as Krauthammer seems to) that we can have an amnesty that stops short of full citizenship. If we do, it’s the worst of both worlds–we get the full magnet effect, luring would-be illegals for whom being able to stay here and work is reward enough, while creating a distinctly un-American groups of second class laborers. It will never fly. Either Dems will immediately win the argument and get amnesty with citizenship, or over time those newly legalized will be allowed to apply.

P.P.S.: Just because the elite makes a mass feint toward amnesty doesn’t mean it will succeed. The grass roots may rebel (though the MSM will then try to portray them as crazy Tea Partiers). Boehner has already been forced to back down, at least in public, from his apparent surrender on Obamacare. The last big GOP elite push for “comprehensive” amnesty came from a Republican president, and it was defeated. The whole debate reminds of the late-60s fight over a “guaranteed income,” which Nixon and most editorial boards endorsed. Only an obscure governor named Ronald Reagan spoke out against it. He won. The difference is that with immigration there is a large constituency–Latinos, but not just Latinos–that politicians will try to rile and appease, and this constituency isn’t going anywhere soon.

Update–How to Save the GOP using one weird trick! In print, Krauthammer’s view is more nuanced. He notes the “Enforcement First” plan, which he says he has now abandoned because

many Hispanics fear that there will be nothing beyond enforcement. So, promise amnesty right up front.

So far, so OK. But instead of promising amnesty after a few years, once all court challenges are exhausted and relevant systems are in place, he would trigger amnesty

on the day the four border-state governors affirm that illegal immigration has slowed to a trickle.

This is a sophomoric gimmick traditionally promoted by pro-amnesty types. 1) Immigration ebbs and flows. It slowed to a trickle during the current recession. It will pick up later. The temporary slowing isn’t a sure sign enforcement is working; 2) Border-state governors are often the most pro-amnesty. They’re responding to their own Latino electorates and chambers of commerce. They have to be good neighbors to Mexico. We’re talking Janet Napolitano (former Arizona governor) and Susanna Martinez and Jerry Brown. Even amnesty skeptics (Jan Brewer, maybe) will find themselves under irresistable pressure to pretend immigration has slowed; 3) This is a national problem. Illegal immigrants are now almost everywhere, as pundits assured us during the recent election. You don’t delegate national problems to non-national decision makers. Would Krauthammer let, say, the governors of Michigan (lots of Arabs) and New York (lots of Jews) decide whether to launch a strike on Iran? 4) Illegal immigration is more than a problem of the Southern border, and pretending it is rightly offends many Latinos. It’s also a problem of visa overstays, for one thing.

Maybe you could come up with some sort of promise of future amnesty that wouldn’t be a gimmick. It would involve a long (multiyear) waiting period, expedited judicial review, some objective measurements and an elected national decisionmaker, plus a chance for a legislative veto. I wouldn’t want Krauthammer to negotiate that deal–he’s already eagerly giving away the store. And it seems better to stick to enforcement measures (he neglects E-Verify) sweetening them with a narrow version of the DREAM Act. You can buy a lot of goodwill and good press with the DREAM Act while avoiding the potential catastrophe of a premature across-the-board amnesty.

I’ve seen short-sighted consultant-induced Beltway panic before …",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2012/11/09/alert-immigration-sellout-underway/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi86tqDgbT9AhWUElkFHQEVCwU4FBAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw3_pAgkYJYXiE7uq7E4ftdR,2012-11-09
The gulf between Barack Obama’s immigration stance and Barbara Jordan’s,"During his November 14 press conference, President Obama said his broad vision of comprehensive immigration reform “is very similar to the outlines of previous efforts at comprehensive immigration reform.” This is newsworthy because previous comprehensive immigration reform efforts since 1986 have produced seven amnesties, none of which reduced illegal immigration. This begs the question: Is the permanent reduction of illegal immigration a goal of this administration?

The last bipartisan U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform studied the issue for six years. President Clinton appointed former congresswoman and Democratic icon Barbara Jordan as its chair. Jordan rose from humble means to become a lawyer and the first Southern black woman elected to the House of Representatives. She was a leader in the civil rights movement, a professor of ethics, a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and a world-class orator (two of her speeches are considered among the greatest of the 20th century). Her appointment gave the commission instant credibility. Jordan said that she believed her responsibility as the head of the commission was to restore credibility to the U.S. immigration system. On the issue of illegal immigration, Jordan was unambiguous about her goals: “Unlawful immigration is unacceptable. Those who should not be here will be required to leave.”

President Obama signaled a different philosophy on November 14, saying, “I do think that there should be a pathway for legal status for those who are living in this country, are not engaged in criminal activity, are here simply to work.”

This is a clear departure from the approach advocated by Jordan, who couldn’t have been clearer on this point. “There are people who argue that some illegal aliens contribute to our community because they may work, pay taxes, send their children to our schools, and in all respects except one, obey the law,” she said. “Let me be clear: that is not enough.”

Jordan’s stated concerns were about “the impact of immigration on the most disadvantaged within our already resident society — inner city youth, racial and ethnic minorities, and recent immigrants who have not yet adjusted to life in the U.S.” At the time, 3-4 million foreign citizens were working illegally in the U.S. Today, 7 million illegal workers hold U.S. jobs while more than 20 million U.S. citizens and legal immigrant workers can’t find full-time work. If that isn’t the immigration problem that Obama proposes to fix, what is?

Additionally, if Obama believes an exception should be made for illegal aliens who “are simply here to work,” does that apply only to those who are here illegally today, or will his exception extend to future waves of illegal workers? If he wants to make this exception for any future alien who violates the terms of her visa or crosses the border illegally, why have limits on immigration at all beyond terrorists, rapists, and murderers? If President Obama wants to limit the exception to an eighth (and final?) amnesty, why is he advocating a “continuation” of policies that got us into this mess in the first place? Obama has rejected Jordan’s framework without articulating an alternative.



Jordan didn’t take a hard line against non-violent illegal immigration because she was hard-hearted. She did so because she understood that the desire for work is precisely what drives illegal immigration. “If we cannot demagnetize our economy for illegal aliens who come here to seek jobs, we cannot control illegal immigration,” she testified. “If we cannot control illegal immigration, we cannot sustain our national interest in legal immigration. Those who come here illegally, and those who hire them, will destroy the credibility of our immigration policies and their implementation. In the course of that, I fear, they will destroy our commitment to immigration itself.”

Obama has never expressed these concerns.

Barbara Jordan and the members of her commission were clear about how to stop illegal immigration. They recommended implementing the system that is known today as “E-Verify.”

President Obama did not mention E-Verify in his press conference. His policy is to audit individual companies and fine those that hire illegal workers, while allowing the illegal workers to go and seek jobs somewhere else. That policy, while good in individual cases, fails to reduce overall illegal employment.

I keep waiting for a mainstream reporter to notice the daylight between Obama’s understanding of illegal immigration and Jordan’s. The president clearly rejects the bipartisan Jordan Commission’s strategy to end illegal immigration. The question is whether President Obama also rejects Jordan’s goal of ending illegal immigration for the sake of disadvantaged Americans.

"Obama floats ambitious immigration bill, stops short of simple ‘amnesty’ promise","President Barack Obama will soon push for a massive change to U.S. immigration law that would provide a kind of conditional amnesty for roughly 11 million illegal immigrants, import more unskilled and skilled workers, and speed up visas for relatives of new arrivals.

But the White House argues that the ambitious legislation would penalize illegal immigrants seeking legal status.

Obama’s bill was sketched out in a Jan. 12 leak to The New York Times, and it won immediate plaudits from the National Council of La Raza, a major Hispanic lobby group.

The bill does not include provisions favored by immigration reformers, such as NumbersUSA — which wants to spur employment of American workers. That group’s legislative goals include a reduction in the flow of low-skilled workers, and a cutback in the number of “family reunification” green cards offered to relatives of new immigrants.

Ethnic lobbies and progressive advocates say they can win passage of the White House’s bill, partly because GOP leaders were shocked by Obama’s lopsided margin of victory among Hispanic voters in November.

Countering expected opposition, the White House said its bill would not grant amnesty to the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants in the country.

Instead, “the White House will argue that its solution for illegal immigrants is not an amnesty … because it would include fines, the payment of back taxes and other hurdles for illegal immigrants who would obtain legal status,” the Times reported.

“The president’s plan would also impose nationwide verification of legal status for all newly hired workers; add visas to relieve backlogs [of people waiting to immigrate] and allow highly skilled immigrants to stay; and create some form of guest-worker program to bring in low-wage immigrants in the future.”

But the bill’s future is threatened by a high unemployment level that has left 23 million Americans without full-time employment, and many others skeptical about the need for immigration. (RELATED ANALYSIS: In Obama’s economy, immigrants outpace native-born Americans)

A Gallup poll released Dec. 20 showed that only 2 percent of respondents believe immigration is “the most important problem facing this country.” The economy and unemployment, together, were cited as the most important issues by 40 percent of respondents.

In previous immigration debates in 2006 and 2007, intense public opposition pushed many legislators to hedge or reverse their initial support for immigration expansions.

Much of the public’s opposition was then based on worries about the impact of immigration on jobs and wages.

Since 1973, the after-inflation hourly wage paid to the bottom 20 percent of American workers has climbed by only 4 percent, to $33,426, according to a Jan. 12 New York Times article.

So-called “guest worker” programs are especially contentious, because they allow companies to keep wages low by importing low-wage workers when Americans decline to take low-paying jobs.

In 2007, for example, then-Senator Obama was part of a one-vote majority that amended a pending immigration bill with a five-year limit on a “guest worker” program. Obama’s vote came shortly after he had voted to expand the that program by allowing foreign workers to stay until they were removed by a court.

The amendment’s one-vote majority upset other deals among Senators and helped kill the overall bill.

This year some critics and supporters of additional immigration are skeptical that Obama will risk a big battle to push for his agenda.

Instead, he may be trying to generate added Hispanic support for the 2014 mid-term elections,

“The word that I’ve heard from many, is [that he will] submit a very, very liberal plan that most Republicans will not support, that most southern and moderate Democrats will not support,” Robert de Posada, former head of the GOP-affiliated Latino Coalition, told The Daily Caller in December. (RELATED: Obama promises new immigration plan but keeps endgame close to his vest)

When the bill fails, “they can announce once again that they tried [and that Latinos] need to rally in the next election,” said Posada, who supports a bill that would provide citizenship to illegals.

De Posada helped President George W. Bush win 40 percent of the Latino vote in 2004, during the housing boom.

His view, that an ambitious bill will be more difficult to pass, was echoed by administration officials cited in the Times article on Saturday.

“Obama and Senate Democrats will propose the changes in one comprehensive bill, the officials said, resisting efforts by some Republicans to break the overhaul into smaller pieces — separately addressing young illegal immigrants, migrant farmworkers or highly skilled foreigners — which might be easier for reluctant members of their party to accept,” the Times reported.

The article cited only one critic of the bill, Georgia Republican Rep. Phil Gingrey.

Gingrey said he opposed “amnesty of any kind,” and that he would “continue working to secure our borders and enforce existing immigration law.”

Critics say large-scale immigration of unskilled workers and their families increases unemployment and boosts public support for the Democrats’ big-government policies.

Instead, they’re calling for a series of modest reforms that would spur demand for U.S. workers, reduce employment and increase support for the GOP’s small-government policies.

‘The idea of a grand settlement to the immigration issue is a mistake … we need confidence-building measures between our bipartisan pro-amnesty elites, on the one hand, and the public, on the other,” said Mark Krikorian, the director of an immigration reform group, the Center for Immigration Studies.

A better option, he said, would be passage of a bill that provides a conditional amnesty for people brought in the country as children, in exchange for laws penalizing companies that hire illegals. That trade would “represent a real step forward but a small enough one that each side could judge the other’s subsequent performance and see if they want to continue,” he said.

GOP representatives, including Gingrey and Texas Rep. Lamar Smith, have pushed alternative approaches such as the STEM bill, which would boost immigration among job-creating, skilled professionals, while trimming immigration of low-skill workers.

In a November vote, however, Democrats opposed the STEM bill because it would end the so-called “Diversity Lottery,” which annually grants 55,000 visas to would-be immigrants regardless of skills.

The STEM bill was supported by high-tech companies in Silicon Valley.

Expert: Bipartisan immigration reform plan will cost trillions,"Robert Rector, a senior research fellow with the Heritage Foundation, expects the bipartisan immigration reform proposal, which includes a path to citizenship, will end up costing taxpayers more overtime than the trillion-dollar calculations he testified to during debate over the 2007 immigration reform bill.

“[The proposal] seems to be virtually identical to the 2007 bill and would be extremely costly to the U.S. taxpayers,” Rector told The Daily Caller in a Wednesday interview. “Granting amnesty or legal status to illegals will generate costs in Medicare and Social Security alone of $2.5 trillion above any taxes paid in.”

According to Rector, the majority of the undocumented immigrants who would eventually be legalized by the legislation are largely uneducated, and therefore more likely to be dependent on government assistance. Fifty to 60 percent of the new immigrants are high school dropouts, and 75-80 percent have no more than a high school degree.

“It’s not like they pay in a lot when they are young, and they take it out when they’re old. They are in fiscal deficit every year of their lives,” Rector explained. “For example, the typical household headed by someone who does not have a high school degree, as I said in that paper in 2007, got back then $30,000 in benefits and paid $10,000 [in income and consumption taxes]. It’s a net cost of $20,000. That would be significantly higher now.”

Rector’s numbers, he noted, were from 2007, which means that now the cost will higher due to the increase in benefits programs and number of undocumented.

“We don’t know how many there are,” Rector said of the 11 million undocumented immigrant figure. “You can say all these costs will be significantly higher in this bill than in the 2007 bill.”

Rector added that he is currently working on a follow up paper to bring the 2007 numbers up to date.

“Basically, the figures from 2007 are just under counts now,” he said. “Everything now has gotten more expensive. Obamacare increases the costs considerably. One of the tricks is they will do things like say, ‘They will contribute to the Social Security Trust Fund.’ Well, you can’t compartmentalize these costs that way, because it doesn’t do the taxpayer any good if they contribute to the Social Security tax fund $2,000, but they take $20,000 out of general revenue. Right?”

“They will put a little money into the Social Security Trust Fund in the long term, but also in the short term, they’re taking $30,000 annually per household in government benefits and services, most which they don’t pay for,” he added.

Rector warned that people should remember the lack of border and employer enforcement that followed the 1986 amnesty.

“They almost all came here after the last amnesty, and almost all have been employed here because we did not enforce the law we put on the books in 1986,” Rector said. “There is no actual effort to prevent employers from hiring illegals. Ostensibly, we’re going to do that, but they didn’t do it last time. All administrations have basically turned a blind eye to the hiring of illegals, and we’re to somehow pretend that won’t happen in the future.”

“Everything I said in the past — you can use those numbers,” he concluded. “They’re just worse now.”

Rubio dodges immigration controversy at CPAC,"Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio won loud applause for his speech at the first day of the CPAC meeting, but he carefully avoided mentioning his controversial effort to rewrite the nation’s immigration law.

“I do think it is interesting, and telling, that he didn’t mention immigration,” said Rosemary Jenks, director of government relations for NumbersUSA, which wants to reduce the current immigration level of 1 million people per year.

During his short speech, Rubio urged conservatives to focus on the worries of blue collar and middle class Americans..

Rubio called for a new focus on students’ debts, which have grown past $1 trillion as Americans fail to find jobs that match their expensively-earned qualifications. He also called for continued attention to overseas problems, highlighted his pro-life beliefs and celebrated marriage in the face of progressive efforts to reshape it, earning support from groups that he will need if he runs for the the GOP’s presidential nomination in 2016.

However, the speech’s contents “completely conflicts with his [immigration] plans,” said Jenks.

“You can’t grow the middle class when you’re flooding the low-skill labor market and keeping workers impoverished,” she told The Daily Caller. “The only thing that grows is big business profits and the entitlement system.”

Those plans include the award of both work permits to at least 11 million low-skill illegal immigrants, and many work visas to high-skilled and low-skilled workers sought by businesses.

Numerous polls show the amnesty and guest-worker measures are unpopular among Americans, and very unpopular among GOP supporters. (RELATED: Immigration group says polls are all wrong)

A February poll by Reuters and Ipsos showed that 53 percent of Americans believe that all or most illegal immigrants should be deported, not given amnesty. Only 5 percent wanted all immigrants to be allowed to stay, while 31 percent said most immigrants should stay.

Democratic-voting union members are also deeply opposed to new immigration. (RELATED: Is there a split between union bosses and members on immigration?)

By avoiding any mention of immigration, Rubio “is trying to walk a fine line and hoping not to alienate” his GOP supporters or political allies who want large-scale immigration, said Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies.

Rubio’s “silence on immigration is part of his effort to avoid such alienation,” said Krikorian.

Elsewhere at the CPAC meeting, a speakers’ panel comprised of immigration-supporters earned only tepid applause, Jenks said.

“About the only applause line was when [Rep. Raul] Labrador said we shouldn’t give illegal aliens a path to citizenship,” she added.

But that the balancing act will become more difficult once the immigration bill is released, likely in early April, Krikorian said.

“We’ll see over the next month whether he decides he has to walk away from Schumer’s amnesty plan to maintain his viability with conservative voters,” he added.

Rubio’s spokesman scoffed at the criticism.

“He talks about immigration all the time — including on a ton of conservative radio shows,” spokesman Alex Conant told TheDC. “And he’s going to be talking about it a lot in coming weeks as the Senate group finalizes its proposal.”

At the start of his speech, Rubio did allude to the recent wave of immigration that has increased the foreign born population, which now comprises roughly one in eight Americans.

There is “a fear that America has changed, that our people has changed, that we have too many people that want too much from government,” he said. “That’s not true. Our people have not changed. The vast majority of the American people are hard working taxpayers, take care of their families … [and] go to work every day.”

After the speech, his office tweeted out one of Rubio’s applause lines — “’We Don’t Need a New Idea. The Idea Is America & It Still Works” — that may be interpreted as an endorsement of American-style immigration and integration.

Despite — or perhaps because of — Rubio’s decision to not mention immigration, the speech received much applause from a sympathetic crowd.

Overall, “aside from immigration … I thought it was a good speech,” said Krikorian, who added that he was speaking as citizen, not as a director of his immigration center.

Immigration lobbies spent $1.5 billion since 2007,"A loose alliance of business and political groups has spent almost $1.5 billion since late 2007 to rewrite the nation’s immigration law according to a new report.

The flood of money hired 3,136 lobbyists at 678 lobbying groups to pass one or more of 987 small or large bills, said the March 25 report from the Sunlight Foundation.

“[I]n the five years (2008-2012) since the reform last died on the Senate floor, we count 6,712 quarterly lobbying reports filed by 678 lobbying organizations in 170 sectors mentioning 987 unique bills, associated with more than $1.5 billion in lobbying spending,” the Sunlight Foundation’s Lee Drutman and Alexander Furnas write.

The report corroborates lobbyists’ recent comments to The Daily Caller that business and progressive groups are spending very heavily to pass a joint “comprehensive immigration bill” this year, which could include enhanced guest worker program and some form of amnesty.

One lobbyist said he had been given a surprise offer to promote the new bills, while another said that meetings of experienced immigration lobbyists are crowded with new advocates who know little about immigration law.

“They’re hiring nearly everybody,” the second lobbyist told TheDC.

The Sunlight Foundation’s report, however, does not focus on the 2013 fight, and instead concentrates on the scale and pattern of immigration lobbying. It does not compare funding spent by pro-immigration groups to the much smaller spending by the handful of groups fighting to curb immigration and the influx of guest workers.

Those groups include Federation for American Immigration Reform and NumbersUSA, which want to scale back the annual inflow of roughly one million new immigrants.

“The true stakeholders of what happens with America’s immigration policies — the American public — are left out and left behind as powerful and well-financed industry lobbyists run roughshod over their interests,” Bob Dane, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform told The Daily Caller.

“Special interests lobby with their checkbooks … citizens lobby with their votes and terminate the careers of those who neglect their interests,” he added.

The report says that the NumbersUSA group has an annual budget of $6 million, and has hired lobbyists at three lobbying firms.

Federation for American Immigration Reform and NumbersUSA rallied public opposition to defeat 2006 and 2007 immigration bills that were championed by the progressive activists and corporate lobbyists.

Those 2006 and 2007 bills would have granted a conditional amnesty to roughly 11 million illegal immigrants, and also increased the use of guest-workers in restaurants, construction, software, farming and retail.

OpenSecrets says that NumbersUSA spent $600,000 in lobbying in 2012. That’s less than 10 percent of the $8 million spent by one company, Microsoft Corp., which is trying to up its employment of professional guest-workers under the H-1B program.

The number of lobbying firms working on immigration increased to 355 in 2012, up from 317 in 2011, according to OpenSecrets.org.

In fact, the Sunlight Foundation itself is one of the many groups that are partly funded by the Soros Foundation, which is using its money to help pass the immigration bills. Sunlight received $300,000 from Soros in 2010 and 2011.

The Soros group has spent more that $70 million since 2005 to boost groups seeking to increase immigration, according to a February report by WNYC.org.

The Soros-funded “Open Society [group] gave nearly $70 million to immigration advocates in the past eight years … [and other] national funders, such as the Ford Foundation, and the Carnegie Corporation of New York … are putting millions of dollars into work being done of behalf of immigrants,” said the WNYC report.

The groups are trying to pass a “comprehensive” immigration bill that would substantially alter the nation’s current immigration laws. Their strategy involves using business lobbyists to mollify GOP concerns that any amnesty would boost Democratic votes in 15 years. At the same time, progressive advocacy groups are trying to mollify widespread Democratic opposition to imported guest-workers.

According to new reports, the pending bill would allow companies to bring in roughly 600,000 guest workers each year, and also provide work permits and citizenship to 11 million Democratic-leaning immigrants.

Companies are lobbying for the workers to fill jobs in the professional and service sectors, even though 20 million Americans are unemployed, underemployed or given up looking for work.

Currently, opposition from unions that represent skilled workers — such as construction workers — have stalled a closed-door deal between the U.S Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO.

Roughly 90 percent of union members say the reduction of illegal immigration is important to them, according to a Jan. 29-30 poll of 1,000 likely voters by Rasmussen. Only 9 percent of union members said they thought it was not important. (RELATED: Union members split on immigration)

Progressive groups also want the 11 million immigrants to be able to bring in their relatives, including their siblings’ families and their elderly parents.

A March 21 blog post by Sunlight Foundation says that three business sectors “tech, agribusiness and construction — have contributed more than $51 million since 1988 [in donations] to lawmakers who are either on committees with key roles in drafting immigration legislation or who are otherwise closely involved with the bill legislation.”

The blog post links to a Feb. 13 post by the foundation, which said that Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer — the leader of the eight senators drafting the pending 2013 immigration bill — has received $4.86 million from the three sectors.

The Sunlight Foundation’s report does not focus on the political alliance between business interests and progressive groups, and it reveals little about the spending by these progressive groups and corporations.

Instead, the Foundation provides a useful map of lobbying efforts in the complex immigration debate.

It shows how much lobbying effort is being directed toward winning gains for companies that employ agricultural, service-sector and professional workers, as well as progressive groups that want to boost the number of visas for immigrants’ relatives or to win a large-scale conditional amnesty, also dubbed “a path to citizenship.”

It also shows lobbying devoted to wining visas for entertainment industry employees, dubbed “performing artists visas” by the foundation.

Polls show that most Americans want to welcome immigrants, but worry about their impact on white-collar and blue-collar jobs, and would prefer illegal immigrants to go home.

A poll released March 14 by the left-of-center Public Religion Research Institute showed that 56 percent of 4,465 American adults believe immigrants drive down wages.

A February poll for Reuters by Ipsos showed that “thirty percent of those polled think that most illegal immigrants, with some exceptions, should be deported, while 23 percent believe all illegal immigrants should be deported … Only 5 percent believe all illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay in the United States legally, and 31 percent want most illegal immigrants to stay.”

DeMint pans immigration reform bill as expensive amnesty,"Jim DeMint, the former South Carolina senator turned president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, dismissed the “Gang of Eight” immigration reform bill Wednesday as an unfair amnesty at a significant cost to American taxpayers.

In a USA Today op-ed published Wednesday evening, DeMint and Heritage Vice President for Domestic and Economic Policy Derrick Morgan asserted that those drafting the immigration forgot to keep those who followed the law and “the forgotten and hard-working American taxpayer” in mind when drafting the legislation “behind closed doors.”

Decrying a costly welfare system with an annual cost reaching nearly $1 trillion, DeMint and Morgan wrote that lawmakers must consider the cost to the American taxpayer when legalized illegals qualify for federal benefits.

“The Heritage Foundation’s Robert Rector has pioneered research into the cost to the federal government over time of granting amnesty,” the pair wrote. “Rector was the driving force behind welfare reform in the 1990s. Five years ago, Rector found that amnesty would likely cost taxpayers some $2.5 trillion. Over the last six months he has been putting the finishing touches on an updated study that calculates an even higher price tag.”

Groups in favor of the immigration proposal have already attacked Rector’s upcoming report — by citing his earlier 2007 report, which this is an update to — as potentially flawed by using analytical tools such as static scoring, rather than dynamic scoring.

While the legislation prohibits those legalized and on their probationary period from receiving benefits, DeMint and Morgan that the promise is meaningless.

“Some may say we can solve this fiscal problem by granting amnesty without any government benefits,” the pair wrote. “We all know that will never happen. As soon as any of the nearly 11 million unauthorized immigrants are given legal status, the political fight will turn to speeding their transition to citizenship and promises of a full array of federal benefits.”

“Delaying eligibility for federal benefits to newly legalized immigrants merely puts off the day of reckoning,” they continued. “The truly enormous costs come when unauthorized immigrants start collecting retirement benefits. Social Security, Medicare, food stamps and other entitlement programs already impose huge, unfunded liabilities on taxpayers; adding more recipients only makes the fiscal hole we find ourselves in much deeper.”

They concluded that attempts at immigration reform should be geared toward specific problems, rather than a comprehensive overhaul “guided by special interests.”

“In this immigration debate, we should encourage lawful immigration and discourage unlawful immigration,” DeMint and Morgan wrote. “A critically important factor will be calculating the cost of amnesty to taxpayers. Any reform legislation should first do no harm to our already dire fiscal outlook.”

"Immigration bill contains 400 waivers, exceptions and exemptions","The Senate’s pending immigration bill includes roughly 400 exemptions, exceptions, waivers, determinations and grants of discretion.

The bill’s complexity is forcing opponents and supporters to comb through its 844 pages before they can declare their conditional support or opposition to the high-stakes measure.

“WAIVER.—The Secretary, in the Secretary’s sole and unreviewable discretion, may waive the application of subparagraph (A) on behalf of an alien,” says one passage on page 71 of the complex document.

The prospective beneficiary of that discretion by a political appointee, according to the bill, is “an alien who departed from the United States while subject to an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal.”

The document mentions “discretion” or “discretionary” 41 times.

It mentions “judge” or “judges” 73 times, and mentions “secretary” 1018 times, normally as the people who decide whether to apply a waiver, exemption, determination or exception.

The complexity has already sparked GOP objections from Sen. Jeff Sessions and other Republicans who say they should be given more time to study and then explain the bill’s myriad complexities and loopholes to the public.

Top Democratic leaders, including Sen. Chuck Schumer, hope to push the bill quickly through the committee and then to the floor by early June.

The eight Senators who drafted the measure in secret for several months are expected presented their bill to the public on Thursday.

The bill mentions “exempt” or “exemption” 18 times.

“The competition requirement under section 253(a) of title 41, United States Code, may be waived or modified by a Federal agency for any procurement conducted to implement this title or the amendments made by this title if the senior procurement executive for the agency conducting the procurement … determines that the waiver or modification is necessary,” the bill declares on 142.

“Except” appears 156 times in the document.

On page 12, one exception allows the secretary to bypass the enforcement mechanisms that limit the award of green cards to former illegal immigrants.

“(B) EXCEPTION.—The Secretary shall permit registered provisional immigrants to apply for an adjustment to lawful permanent resident status if — (i)(I) litigation or a force majeure has prevented one or more of the conditions described in clauses (i) through (iv) of subparagraph (A) from being implemented.”

There’s also a “hardship exception” under Section 245D.

“The Secretary may adjust the status of a registered provisional immigrant to the status of a lawful permanent resident if the alien … demonstrates compelling circumstances for the inability to satisfy the requirement.”

Thee are 94 uses of “waiver,” including a provision on page 198 that allows the secretary to invite a deported illegal immigrant to return and file for the amnesty.

“WAIVER.—The Secretary may waive the application of subparagraph (A)(iii) on behalf of an alien if the alien ‘‘(i) is the spouse or child of a United States citizen … [or] … was physically present in the United States for an aggregate period of not less than 3 years during the 6-year period immediately preceding the date of the enactment of this section.

“Determines” is used 84 times in the bill.

“The Secretary of Homeland Security may permit an alien to remain temporarily in the United States and authorize the alien to engage in employment in the United States if the Secretary determines that the alien … has been helpful, is being helpful, or is likely to be helpful, in the investigation, prosecution of, or pursuit of civil remedies related to the claim arising from a covered violation.”

“Unreviewable” appears seven times in the bill.

On page 568, for example, the bill declares that “the Attorney General may, in the Attorney General’s sole and unreviewable discretion, appoint or provide counsel to aliens in immigration proceedings conducted under section 240 of this Act.”

The six other mentions of unreviewable authority apply to the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

In 2012, the immigration flow consisted of 450,000 working-age immigrants, 30,000 older immigrants and 700,000 short-term and long-term workers. The guest workers included roughly 50,000 agriculture workers, 400,000 service workers and 250,000 university-trained workers.

The new law would increase the inflow by at least 350,000 more workers, and exempt university-trained professionals from immigration caps, even when unemployment is above 8 percent.

Leaders of anti-immigration groups aren’t exactly conservative,"In 2007, I met a field organizer who had worked against immigration reform. He was not who you might imagine. His background was in the labor and environmental movements that so many conservatives deplore.

He wanted to stop immigration reform because he believed that human beings were destroying the planet and that an increase in the U.S. population would exacerbate the environmental injustices he perceived to be occurring already.

That was my first experience with the anti-immigration reform movement’s real radicalism, but it has hardly been the last. Even though the activist was working for an immigration restrictionist group that many people instinctively think of as “conservative,” the truth is that he, like many other immigration opponents, was not conservative. He was a union-promoting environmentalist, just like many of the figures involved in the formation and funding of groups that will voice strong opposition to the new immigration reform bill this week by claiming, inaccurately, that it is not “conservative” enough.

The reality is, their problem with immigration has nothing to do with border security or the fear that immigrants will become public charges — both concerns that are dealt with robustly and effectively by the Gang of Eight’s legislation, which is vastly more conservative than the immigration reform proposed in 2006 and 2007. Their concern is with “saving the planet” from the supposed grave menace of human beings, with many prominent figures associated with anti-immigration causes and organizations having advocated for population control, abortion and sterilization.

To the extent that my acquaintance was concerned about human dignity, he viewed an increase in the population of humans as the greatest challenge to that dignity. This is something that he shared with Margaret Sanger and the founders of Planned Parenthood. That’s why Planned Parenthood supported contraception and abortion for certain elements of society. This is the real face of so many leaders of anti-immigration organizations who, when they talk to conservatives and Christians, present themselves as conservative.

As the evangelical publication World Magazine noted recently, Dr. John Tanton, an environmentalist who served as national president of Zero Population Growth, helped “found FAIR (1979), CIS (1985) and NumbersUSA (1997), groups that separately engage the public, produce research and lobby Congress for the same thing: lower immigration.”

The Wall Street Journal reported a few years back that “CIS, FAIR, NumbersUSA, Project-USA — and more than a half-dozen similar groups that Republicans have become disturbingly comfy with — were founded or funded (or both) by John Tanton, a retired doctor in Michigan. In addition to trying to stop immigration to the U.S., appropriate population-control measures for Dr. Tanton and his network include promoting China’s one-child policy, sterilizing Third World women and wider use of RU-486.”



As the New York Times reported, Tanton also founded Planned Parenthood and Sierra Club chapters. He formed FAIR in 1979; the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), which can be expected to oppose immigration reform loudly, was established as a spin-off of FAIR in 1985.

FAIR is currently headed by Dan Stein, who has reportedly described China’s one-child policy using the benign terminology “international family planning program” (as opposed to, say, “forced abortion diktat”).

Roy Beck, the former editor of Dr. Tanton’s journal, founded NumbersUSA, reportedly with fundraising assistance from Tanton. Today Beck heads NumbersUSA, which can also be expected to criticize the bill. NumbersUSA’s YouTube page features a video of the founder of Earth Day touting Beck’s work on population matters, and this video linking environmental concerns to population and immigration restrictionism.

According to a recent report detailing the origins of the anti-immigration movement, other figures involved with FAIR — including Sarah Epstein, J. Bayard Boyle, Dorothy Blair and Janet Harte — have worked for or with Planned Parenthood. Epstein and other figures associated with FAIR have reportedly advocated for the use of quinacrine to sterilize women, even in cases where women don’t want to be sterilized. Epstein reportedly called China’s one-child policy “compassionate and fair” — a viewpoint that should automatically make her and the organizations to which she is linked suspect even to more socially moderate individuals, let alone strong social conservatives.

Yet, in the coming days we can expect to hear FAIR, CIS and NumbersUSA criticize the immigration reform bill on conservative grounds. Christian conservatives and pro-life leaders in elected office should beware. When we listen to these organizations, we should ask ourselves what value they actually place on human life and human dignity.

It is worth noting in this context that countless Christian conservative leaders and organizations in fact support immigration reform, including Dr. Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention, the National Association of Evangelicals and members of the Evangelical Immigration Table.

An estimated 300 evangelical leaders met this week in Washington, D.C., to urge Congress to reform America’s immigration laws.

These are leaders and organizations whose flocks man the phones and knock on doors to elect socially conservative Republicans when election time draws near. Hardcore environmentalists aren’t out there electing pro-life Republican congressmen.

People like Dr. Richard Land lean toward immigration reform on the basis of Matthew 25:35: “For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and you invited me in.”

These are socially conservative Republicans’ best, and most natural, allies. The same can’t be said for organizations tainted by the stain of consistently siding against human life and human dignity and arguing that more life is itself a grave menace to creation. Coalitions are good, but some bedfellows should be resisted.

"Paul urges Reid, McConnell to stall immigration reform after Boston","Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said Monday that immigration reform should not go forward until the national security weaknesses exposed by the Boston Marathon bombing are addressed.

In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senator urged that the bombing — and the fact that the two alleged bombers were immigrants to the United States — be taken into account as the Senate begins the process of considering the Gang of Eight immigration reform bill.

“As our thoughts and prayers continue to go out to those affected by the tragedy in Boston, I urge you to incorporate the following national security concerns into the comprehensive immigration reform debate,” Paul wrote. “Before Congress moves forward, some important national security questions must be addressed.”

Paul continues:

I believe that any real comprehensive immigration reform must implement strong national security protections. The facts emerging in the Boston Marathon bombing have exposed a weakness in our current system. If we don’t use this debate as an opportunity to fix flaws in our current system, flaws made even more evident last week, then we will not be doing our jobs.

We should not proceed until we understand the specific failures of our immigration system. Why did the current system allow two individuals to immigrate to the United States from the Chechen Republic in Russia, an area known as a hotbed of Islamic extremism, who then committed acts of terrorism? Were there any safeguards? Could this have been prevented? Does the immigration reform before us address this?

There should be hearings in the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee that study the national security aspects of this situation, making sure that our current immigration system gives individuals from high-risk areas of the world heightened scrutiny.

In the wake of 9/11, there was a comprehensive reform of our intelligence gathering system, yet our improved intelligence gathering system did not adequately detect these extremists. We need to understand possible intelligence failures and craft solutions.

Media reports indicate that the deceased bombing suspect was interviewed by the FBI two years ago at the request of a foreign government. We need to know the details of this interview. We need to know if this interview might have given investigators any reason to conclude that this individual might be dangerous or at least worthy of further inquiry. If so, was there an intelligence failure? At the very least, it should be examined.

Media reports indicate that both the bombing suspects were legal permanent residents and one is reported to be a naturalized citizen. We need to make sure that we have safeguards against this type of situation happening again.

In 2002, Congress set up the National Security Registration System (NSEERS), yet it was suspended in 2011 by Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. That system had problems, yet was still based on the practical idea that extra screening is necessary from nations that have a higher population of extremists. Congress might need a similar system updated for current circumstances to be rolled into comprehensive immigration reform.

I would like the US-VISIT/OBIM program studied to see if it actually works, or at least study the process by which we collect and analyze biometric data on immigrants.

Our refugee programs have proven to be a problem. On, January 29, 2013, two Iraqi citizens living in Bowling Green, in my home state of Kentucky, were sentenced to long prison terms for participating in terrorism and providing material support to terrorists while living in the United States. How did this happen? Does the current immigration reform address how this might have happened? We may need more scrutiny when accepting refugees from high-risk nations.

I want to make sure that any new bill addresses the visa entry and exit programs, in addition to refugee programs that have proven problematic in Bowling Green and possibly, if media reports are correct, in Boston.

Finally, do we need to take a hard look at student visas? Should we suspend student visas, or at least those from high-risk areas, pending an investigation into the national security implications of this program?

I respectfully request that the Senate consider the following two conditions as part of the comprehensive immigration reform debate: One, the Senate needs a thorough examination of the facts in Massachusetts to see if legislation is necessary to prevent a similar situation in the future. Two, national security protections must be rolled into comprehensive immigration reform to make sure the federal government does everything it can to prevent immigrants with malicious intent from using our immigration system to gain entry into the United States in order to commit future acts of terror.

The Gang of Eight bill was authored by Republican Sens. John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio and Jeff Flake, and Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, Michael Bennet and Bob Menendez.

"Immigration bill to bring in at least 33 million people, says group","The pending Senate immigration bill would bring a minimum of 33 million people into the country during its first decade of operation, according to an analysis by NumbersUSA, a group that wants to slow the current immigration rate.

By 2024, the inflow would include an estimated 9.2 million illegal immigrants, plus 2.5 million illegals who arrived as children — dubbed ‘Dreamers’ — plus roughly 3.4 million company-sponsored employees with university degrees, said the unreleased analysis.

The majority of the inflow, or roughly 17 million people, would consist of family members of illegals, recent immigrants and of company-sponsored workers, according to the NumbersUSA analysis provided to The Daily Caller.

The estimate is likely the first of several that will be produced by advocates as the Senate grapples with the immigration bill developed by the “Gang of Eight” senators.

The 844-page bill was released last week, and was scheduled for debate and amendment in the Senate’e judiciary committee starting April 25. However, the amendment process was held up for a week by Republican Senators, who said they need more time to study the complex bill.

Advocates for the bill have yet to release any estimates of the future inflow.

“Nobody has a number that is based on the bill right now that’s accurate,” Lynn Tramonte, deputy director of the pro-immigration America’s Voice Education Fund, told the Christian Science Monitor in an April 25 article. “It’ll take a bit more [analysis] to get a specific number about how things will change.”

A high inflow could prove to be a political problem for the bill’s advocates.

An April 20-22 Fox News poll of 1,009 registered voters showed that 55 percent of respondents want a reduction in the current number of legal immigrants.

Currently, the country accepts 1 million immigrants and 700,000 temporary company-sponsored workers each year. The bill would boost that to roughly 3 million immigrants and 1 million company-sponsored workers per year.

Forty-five percent of non-whites, 53 percent of independents and 62 percent of people without college degrees, favor a reduction in legal immigrants. Only 18 percent of Republicans and 29 percent of independents favor an increase in legal immigration, the Fox poll reported.

The current population of the United States is 314 million. That estimate includes roughly 40 million immigrants, both legal and illegal.

Opponents of the immigration bill are already highlighting the potentially large inflow.

“I believe the interest that needs to be protected is the national interest of the United States, and that includes existing workers today, workers whose wages have been pulled down, without doubt, by a large flow of… low-wage labor into the country,” Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions said during one of three hearings on the pending bill.

“This bill would continue that in a way that’s very disturbing to me,” he said.

NumbersUSA’ said that its estimates of a 33 million inflow “are conservative … [because they do] not attempt to project increases in these categories that are certain to occur in future years,” once many of the new immigrants seek green cards for their overseas relatives.

Also, some categories of immigrants are uncapped, and the analysis “does not attempt to project increases in these [family unification] categories that are certain to occur in future years,” it says.

The pending bill allows illegal immigrants to bring their overseas spouses and children into the country, says the NumbersUSA report. If that provision is implemented, “it could more than double the [illegal immigrant inflow] number shown in the chart,” bringing the total inflow to 40 million by 2024, it said.

The analysis shows an inflow of roughly 3.4 million university trained immigrants. That estimate does not include graduates who get green cards under the family unification route, or the uncapped inflow of doctors and PhD-carrying scientists.

Roughly 1.8 million Americans graduate from college each year, including 300,000 with degrees in science and engineering.

Population-growth forecasts will also contribute to the emerging fight over the bill’s cost, because the award of a green card — or the right to live in the United States — confers access to some government benefits.

“It is important to note here that each of the individuals represented in this chart becomes eligible for Obamacare on the day a green card is issued,” said the NumbersUSA analysis. “Most of those on the chart will then have to wait five years before they become eligible for all US welfare benefits … [but some] will actually become eligible for welfare immediately upon being issued a green card,” said the report.

Enrollment in Obamacare is expected to spike the cost of the immigration bill, partly because federal subsidies are used to offset the annual Obamacare cost of $20,000 for a family of four.

Currently, pro-immigration groups such as the American Action Forum, the Cato Institute and the Center for American Progress are criticizing a pending-cost estimate that is being prepared by the Heritage Foundation. In 2006 and 2007, Heritage’s cost-estimates helped to derail pending immigration bills.

"Jack Kemp, the conservative split over immigration, and how optimism vs. pessimism explains it all","Before Ronald Reagan came along, conservatism was, almost by definition, pessimistic.

With the help of Jack Kemp (who introduced him to supply-side economics), Reagan changed all that. But in recent years, conservatives have too often reverted to the paranoid style in American politics.

The current schism over immigration reform is indicative of this split. Where you stand probably has less to do with a right vs. left — or even libertarian vs. traditional conservative paradigm — than whether you’re an optimist or a pessimist.

This really hit home with me when I read Bob Costa’s recent NRO column about how Kemp influenced Paul Ryan on the issue.

An excerpt:

Kemp often spoke passionately about how immigration was necessary for economic growth and for the Republican party to prosper. He also tangled with critics and, in a 1994 memorandum, warned against a “nativist, anti-immigration climate.” “We are a nation of immigrants,” Kemp said in 1996, during his vice-presidential acceptance speech. “We must close the backdoor of illegal immigration so that we can keep open the front door of legal immigration.” Ryan was Kemp’s speechwriter during that campaign, and if Ryan’s visit to Chicago on Monday afternoon is any indication, he continues to share Kemp’s view on the subject.

If you have a negative worldview, you’ll probably dismiss Kemp’s philosophy as quixotic hooey. Meanwhile, Kemp’s words will likely inspire the optimist.

* * *

Of course, there are extremes on both sides of this divide. The most forceful opponents of “Shamnesty” envision a dystopian world where nobody speaks the same language, where working-class Americans can’t find work, and where mariachi bands are ubiquitous.

In short, they fear America will turn into Mexico — or, maybe worse — California.

Meanwhile, the utopians see a world where diversity creates few obstacles, where immigrants are quickly assimilated into the dominant culture, and where we all hold hands and sing kumbaya.

In truth, I suspect neither extreme has a monopoly on the truth. But that doesn’t mean the optimism vs. pessimism schism isn’t where the action is.

* * *

This divide isn’t just about policy, either. It’s also about process. The optimists believe our leaders have the ability to craft legislation that — while not perfect — can make things slightly better. Pessimists see legislators as either inept, impotent, gullible, or corrupt.

And, of course, this is also about future elections. The optimists believe many immigrants will support an opportunity society where achieving the American Dream is still possible. The pessimists scoff at such naivety. They assume that new citizens will seek only their own self interest, thus dramatically increasing the welfare state.

The optimists hope conservatism is a compelling enough philosophy to attract new adherents. The pessimists know that it is not.

Who’s right? I’m not sure. The safe thing to do is nothing, which partially explains why the opponents of immigration reform can play on fear and emotion to easily move undecided conservatives to the “no” column on this issue.

Maybe we are going to hell in a hand basket? Maybe we are Rome? Maybe Pat Buchanan’s “Death of the West” prophesy was correct?

On the other hand, America has absorbed immigrants before. And, despite all the fear-mongering at the time, it worked out pretty well. Maybe this handwringing is what always happens?

* * *

I’m not sure who’s right — but I am sure which is the most compelling and inspiring message. Optimism is clearly the political winner.

Pessimism has a way of becoming a self-fulfilling prophesy. People are repelled by negativity, which, of course, proves the pessimist right all along.

So I think it comes down to this. What kind of person do you want to be? Do you want to focus on the hopes and aspirations of the future, or dwell on fear and negativity? — to desperately clinging to the status quo? Do you believe that America has a bright dawn ahead, or that we must manage its decline?

Kemp was known for his cheery optimism. So was Reagan. In fact, conservatism didn’t really take off until Kemp and Reagan teamed up. And if you look at today’s most rhetorically inspiring conservatives, is it any wonder you find people like Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Paul Ryan — both champions of immigration reform?

The most vociferous opponents tend to be pundits and talk radio hosts, who don’t need to win a majority to be successful, and who have entirely different incentives.

Bill Kristol to Marco Rubio: ‘Walk away’ on immigration; ‘Jeff Sessions is winning the debate’ [AUDIO],"Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, a self-admitted liberal on immigration, advised Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio Tuesday to walk away from the Senate immigration bill and revisit it in a few years.

Kristol said it is important for Republicans to fight the convention wisdom that the need to act on the issue is urgent.

“I think it’s very important to push back — for us who are skeptical at least about this bill — to push back on the notion that we have to do something,” Kristol said Tuesday on Laura Ingraham’s radio show. “I was with a bunch of Republicans and one of them made this case to me: ‘This is the moment we’ve got to act. Why? Why do we have to act? We’ve gone on with the current situation. It’s not perfect, God knows. But we’ve gone on with it for years and years. Right now, there’s no looming, I don’t believe, crisis or urgency.”

“And I much would prefer to take out time, pass discreet pieces of legislation, come back in 2015 when there are more Republicans in Congress, come back in 2017 when perhaps there is a Republican president and address these issues,” he continued. “I agree — the impulse that we have to act or that doing something foolish is better than doing nothing is always a mistake, and it’s particularly a mistake in immigration because once you legalize, you legalize. It’s done. This is not even like a tax increase, which you can reverse three years later.”

Ingraham asked Kristol what advice he would give Rubio. According to the Weekly Standard editor, Rubio should throw in the towel.

“He should walk away from it,” Kristol said. “He should say, ‘I made a good-faith effort, but you know what, this is not a piece of legislation …’ You just got to judge on the substance, and I don’t believe honestly — I follow this one kind of as an outsider without much of a stake one way or the other. I care about it … but the public policy actual argument, the critics of the bill are winning over and over. I’m a better friend of Marco Rubio than Jeff Sessions. I know him much better, but Jeff Sessions is winning the debate. I just don’t think you can deny that.”

Marco Rubio indicates he won’t vote for own immigration bill without changes,"In an interview on Hugh Hewitt’s radio show on Tuesday night, Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio indicated that he would not support the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill he had helped author unless it is changed.

Earlier in the day, Rubio had said that immigration reform was still short of the 60 votes it needs to pass the Senate. (OPINION: Immigration questions House conservatives should ask Rubio)

“Well, let me first say that the news of what I said today on Fox about there not being the 60 votes: Actually, Sen. [Robert] Menendez of New Jersey, a Democrat, said the same thing last week,” Rubio said. “And that’s a fact. And the reason why is because while there’s a group, well, the majority of our colleagues are prepared to do immigration reform, they’re only prepared to do it if we ensure that this illegal immigration problem never happens again.”

“And so there’s a handful of Democrats, and a sizeable number of Republicans that are saying to us we’re prepared to do immigration reform, but we have to make sure there isn’t another wave of illegal immigration,” he continued. “So for those who want immigration reform, the task is very simple: Let’s strengthen the border security parts of this bill so that they’re stronger, so that they don’t give overwhelming discretion to the Department of Homeland Security. And I think if we can do that, then you’re going to be able to get something done. But if you can’t, it’s not going to happen.”

Later, Rubio indicated he would not vote for the bill unless it is amended.

“I think if those amendments don’t pass, then I think we’ve got a bill that isn’t going to become law, and I think we’re wasting our time,” Rubio replied. “So the answer is no. If they don’t pass, then we’ve got to keep working to ensure that we get to a bill that can become a law. We’re not interested in passing a Senate bill. We’re interested in passing a law that reforms a broken legal immigration system, that begins to enforce the law and that deals with the 11 million people who are here illegally.”

“And that’s the goal of this endeavor. And so if those amendments fail, we’ve got to go back to the drawing board and keep working until we can figure out one that will pass. But I don’t understand why anyone would be against it, as such. I don’t think there is a good reason to be against strengthening border security for our country.”

UPDATE — USCIS union to warn of “Gang of Eight” bill consequences:

The Daily Caller has learned exclusively that tomorrow the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Could, the union representing 12,000 U.S. Citizenship and Immigrations Services officers and staff, will be sending a letter to Sen. Marco Rubio and all “Gang of Eight” members stating that if legalization comes before enforcement, even if the enforcement provisions were completely re-written by Congress, the policy will fail. The letter also claims that because of the interior enforcement provisions the bill would result in a national security threat.

SEIU pushes seven-figure ad campaign for immigration reform,"The Service Employees International Union announced the launch of a seven-figure advertising campaign for immigration reform Tuesday.

The five commercials the SEIU said would run on national cable networks feature law enforcement officers, small business owners, “DREAMers,” veterans and Republicans.

The ad campaign, which begins Tuesday, will run through June.

Watch:

“We’re seeing a growing consensus across the country that we need to get immigration reform done and get it done now,” Mary Kay Henry, SEIU International President, said in a statement.

“These ads show the breadth of support for commonsense immigration reform and highlight the diverse voices that are integral to moving this debate forward,” she added.

Kay joined President Obama Tuesday as he called for Congress to pass immigration reform, according to The Guardian.

The big union’s ad campaign comes a day after Crossroads GPS announced their $100,000 print and online ad buy for immigration reform.

The Senate is expected to take its first vote on immigration reform on whether to move forward with debate on the bill.

"CBO says immigration bill aids investors, not wage earners","The Senate’s pending immigration bill would boost investors’ and owners’ share of the economy for at least twenty years, and shrink some Americans’ wages and salaries for at least 10 years, according to a report from the Congressional Budget Office.

“The rate of return on capital would be higher [than on labor] under the legislation than under current law throughout the next two decades,” says the report, titled “The Economic Impact of S. 744.”

The higher rate of return would also push up the interest rates paid by American taxpayers for the federal government’s $17 trillion debt, the report says.

The threat of lost wages has spurred opposition from populist conservatives, including Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, and from left-wing politicians, such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Populist conservatives who oppose the immigration bill, and some progressives who back the bill, also have long bemoaned the declining percentage of new wealth earned via blue-collar wages and professionals’ salaries.

President Barack Obama strongly backs the immigration rewrite, but has complained about the trend.

“In all countries around the world, you’re seeing growing inequality, and so we have to find ways to make sure that ladders of opportunity exist for those at the bottom, and that profits and increased productivity all does not just benefit those at the top,” Obama told a German audience in Berlin.

Last September, those worries were buttressed by a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, which showed that labor’s share of income has dropped by roughly 10 points since the early 2000s.

In turn, the share of income earned via capital has increased by the same percentage.

The federal Bureau of Economic Affairs estimates that labor’s share fell from roughly 67 percent to 58.2 percent.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the share fell from 75 percent in 1979 to 67 percent in 2007.

The result of this economic shift is that economic inequality widened, according to the authors of the reserve’s report, Margaret Jacobson and Filippo Occhino.

But once the economy recovers, the widening gap “will be reversed as the recovery continues … [and] the labor share will pick up and converge to its long-run trend value,” says the September report.

The pending bill will roughly double the inflow of immigrants over the next 20 years to roughly 46 million, or about 1 immigrant for every 7 Americans.

At least 85 percent of the immigrants will be low-skilled, and will not pay enough in taxes to cover the cost of routine government benefits, said Robert Rector, a budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation.

“It is very difficult to imagine that those households could pay enough in taxes to pay for their benefits,” he told reporters Wednesday.



The huge inflow of new workers will force down average wages, the CBO predicted. Average wages would then increase after 2025 as the market balanced itself out, according to the prediction.

“Because the bill would increase the rate of growth of the labor force, average wages would be held down in the first decade after enactment by a reduction in the ratio of capital to labor, which would make workers less productive,” said the densely written report.

The lost wages would be felt most by the low-skill Americans, but also by the smaller population of high-skill worker who will face an influx of competition from roughly 5 million skilled immigrants, and from a changing pool of roughly 2.5 million skilled guest-workers, the CBO report said.

“The legislation would particularly increase the number of workers with lower or higher skills but would have less effect on the number of workers with average skills. … The wages of lower- and higher-skilled workers would tend to be pushed downward slightly (by less than ½ percent) relative to the wages of workers with average skills,” said the CBO report.

Bill supporters dismissed the criticism.

The immigrant low-skill workers “complement our labor force, they make it more efficient,” said Diana Furchtgott-Roth of the Manhattan Institute. Even if the gain for capital increases inequality, “what’s important is not the degree of inequality, but the ability [of Americans] to move between income groups,” she said.

Increased immigration will help that movement because it will increase the economy’s efficiency, she told The Daily Caller.

The CBO report shows that low-skill and high-skill workers may not gain as much as middle-skill workers, but “average wages across all skills increase in the long term,” said Josh Culling from Americans for Tax Reform, which is backing the immigration rewrite.

The decline in average wages is caused by the arrival of many new low-skill immigrants, not by drops in Americans’ wages, he said.

The bill’s opponents’ dismiss these defenses.

For example, said Rector, the bill authors allow low-skill workers to be imported until the unemployment rate rises to 8.5 percent.

“What they’re really saying is that we don’t give a darn about those [American] low-skill workers,” Rector said.

Polls show weak support for Obama’s immigration push,"Two more polls released Thursday show continuing weak public support for President Barack Obama’s top-priority policy of increased immigration.

A Gallup survey showed the number of Americans who want increased immigration is only 25 percent. Another survey from Quinnipiac showed half of Americans opposing Obama’s immigration policies.

The Gallup survey of 4,373 adults also reported that 35 percent of Americans want reduced immigration, and 40 percent want immigration to stay level, said the poll, released July 11.

Quinnipiac’s poll showed public support for Obama’s immigration policy remains flat, at 41 percent approval and 50 percent opposition.

Only 35 percent of independents support his immigration policies, said the poll.

The Senate-passed immigration bill would roughly double annual immigration to add 46 million immigrants by 2033, and double the annual inflow of university-trained guest workers to more than 500,000 a year.

The inflow would lower average wages and education for a decade, but allow long-term increases in productivity, according to a June 16 report by the Congressional Budget Office. The bill would also shift more of national income from wage-earners to investors for at least 20 years, according to the CBO report.

The Senate approved the immigration bill 68 to 32 in late June.

But the House’s GOP leadership has adopted a go-slow approach, partly because opposition from the GOP’s base has partly canceled out demands by the GOP’s business allies for passage of the controversial bill.

One challenge in polling public opinion is that many Americans do not know the real levels of immigration or the increased immigration levels set by the Senate’s immigration rewrite.

A May poll by Rasmussen Reports showed widespread ignorance of current immigration levels.

One-in-eight Americans believe the inflow of immigrants is only 250,000 people per year, the poll said. The actual rate, based on current net migration rate of 3.64 per 1,000 population, comes to just over 1.1 million per year.

Fifty-six percent of adults believe fewer legal immigrants arrive than illegal immigrants, even though the inflow of illegal immigrants has dropped to almost zero since the housing crash of 2007.

Few media reports about the immigration debate cite numbers about current and project inflows.

To boost their case, business groups cite business-funded polls showing high support — up to 80 percent — for a staged amnesty that is coupled with a series of conditions, such as improved border security, payment of back taxes and use of English.

To win approval for the bill, business groups are funding ads that highlight increased border security, but do not mention the increased inflow of immigrants.

But Obama’s strong support for the bill may be shifting the numbers, at least among partisan Democrats.

Gallup’s new poll showed a steady rise in support for immigration, up from 14 percent when Obama and his deputies declared their support for additional immigration in 2009, to 25 percent in July. The rise was fueled by an increased among Democrats and white Americans, said the poll.

Democratic leaders have made a strategic decision to seek the support of the growing Latino demographic.

Since 2010, Democrats, led by Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, have embraced the immigrant Latino demographic, despite fears that it would cost support among other Americans.

Some of those costs are highlighted by the Quinnipiac poll, which shows that 55 percent of independents, 35 percent of Hispanics, and 18 percent of Democrats oppose the president’s immigration policy.

He’s got support from 75 percent of Democrats, 35 percent of independents, 77 percent of blacks, 62 percent of Hispanics.

Among people with college degrees, the president has 50 percent support and 44 percent disapproval. Among people without college degrees, he’s facing 38 percent approval and 53 percent disapproval.

The drop-off in support among lower-income voters is pushing efforts by GOP reformers to argue that the GOP’s support among whites and Hispanics would be boosted by a low-immigration, high-wage policy.

“If there is any lesson for the GOP to learn from 2012, it’s that we must do a better job fighting for and connecting with working Americans of all backgrounds — immigrant and native-born alike — whose wages have fallen and whose employment opportunities have increasingly diminished,” Sen. Jeff Sessions, said in a July 10 article in National Review.

“By doing the right thing on immigration, the GOP can distance our party from the corporate titans who believe the immigration policy for our entire country should be modeled to pad their bottom line,” he wrote.

Overall, Quinnipiac reported that Obama has 44 percent approval, and 48 disapproval, from its panel of 2,014 voters.

Obama urges Hispanics to rally for more immigration,"President Barack Obama tried to revive the stalled effort to revamp the nation’s immigration laws by telling Spanish-speaking immigrants on Tuesday that he would not try to arrange a regulatory bypass around Congress.

“I do get a little worried that advocates of immigration reform start losing heart and immediately think… ‘if Congress doesn’t act, we’ll just have the president sign something and that’ll take care of it,’” Obama told the audience of Telemundo, a Spanish-speaking TV network that promotes increased immigration.

“There’s a path to get this done, and that’s through Congress,” Obama insisted Sept. 17.

“And right now, everybody should be focused on making sure that that bill that’s already passed out of the Senate hits the floor of the House of Representatives,” he directed.

In October, business groups, ethnic lobbies, progressive groups, unions and church leaders are expected to step up pressure for passage of a new package of immigration laws.

NumbersUSA and other groups that want to reduce the current immigration rate fear that the House GOP leadership will use the end-of-year legislative crush to sneak through a surprise immigration increase.

The Senate bill was passed in July.

Many business groups are pushing the GOP leadership to create a small immigration bill through the House, so a comprehensive joint bill can be drafted in a conference of House and Senate legislators. Once drafted, the joint bill could be passed through the House with overwhelming support from the Democratic caucus.

Obama seemed to endorse this staged strategy. He wants to increase pressure on the GOP leadership, especially House Speaker John Boehner, until he agree to a joint House-Senate conference, even though an overwhelming majority of the House GOP legislators oppose the Senate bill.

“What’s stopping him from going ahead and calling that bill? … [he] shouldn’t be afraid of [the GOP’s] majority opinion on this thing,” Obama said.

Obama also said passage is a very high priority for him.

“You’ve got a president who says that this is a number-one priority and he can’t wait to sign a comprehensive immigration reform bill,” he said.

White House aide Valerie Jarrett recently said passage of an immigration bill would be as important as passage of Obamacare.

Obama also claimed the push for increased immigration is popular. “You’ve got the majority of the American public who are committed to immigration reform and support a pathway to citizenship for those who don’t have it,” he claimed.

Numerous polls show that Americans and Latino immigrants strongly oppose an increased inflow of workers. Polls also show that many Americans would support a staged amnesty for illegals on the condition that further illegal immigration is greatly reduced.

Immigration officers’ union: End political corruption in immigration before amnesty,"The president of the union representing 12,000 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services adjudications officers and staff is calling on Congress to bring an end to the political corruption at his agency prior to bringing up any “amnesty proposals.”

Kenneth Palinkas, the president of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, issued a scathing statement Thursday, pressing Congress to fix the problems at USCIS before bring up more legislation.

“At USCIS, our institutional mission has been corrupted by politics, and I hope these abuses will be examined and fixed before any amnesty proposal is brought forward in the House,” Palinkas said.

Palinkas listed five problems USCIS is facing:

–USCIS adjudications officers lack the mission support to safely screen and review applicants for immigration benefits. This includes the inability to conduct in-person interviews, the failure of our software system, the lack of training and office space, and pressure to rubber-stamp applications. We have become an approval machine. –Failure to protect taxpayers from abuses of the welfare system by those granted immigration benefits –Administrative orders that require us to grant immigration benefits to those who, under law, are not properly eligible –Approval quotas placed on adjudicators that emphasizes clearing applications more than vetting them –A management culture that sees illegal aliens and foreign nationals, not US citizens and taxpayers, as the customer. We believe in treating all with respect and always will, but our agency’s focus must be keeping the country safe and secure on behalf of the American people.

The USCIS union president further lamented the current process immigration reform is taking in the House, explaining that without confronting the problems at USCIS, the proposals —- especially if the House blends its bills together with the “extremely dangerous Senate bill” in conference — will make the situation worse.

“These plans are being pursued before first reforming the very agency — USCIS — that will be charged with reviewing these tens of millions of green card, temporary visa and citizenship applications,” he said. “Advancing such measures without first confronting the widespread abuses at USCIS would be to invite disaster.”

Palinkas voiced concerns about reports that the House is considering proposals to legalize the undocumented immigrant children.

“Legislators, including [Majority Leader Eric] Cantor and [House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob] Goodlatte, have suggested that it is improper to apply immigration law to younger illegal aliens. But if it is improper to apply immigration law to one specific group of illegal aliens, then why should we expect future illegal aliens in this group to be treated any differently?” he asked.

“This seems like an argument for extending birthright citizenship in the future to include the foreign citizens of other countries,” he added. “Should we just expect that the next Secretary at DHS will use the arguments we are hearing in the House to enact the next Deferred Action program in anticipation of the next legislated amnesty?”

Palinkas and his union were vocal opponents of the Senate immigration bill earlier this year.

Obama to urge immigration increase in White House speech,"President Barack Obama will give a high-profile speech Thursday to revive his top second-term priority — a bill intended to sharply increase immigration.

But he’ll deliver the speech during a week when the advocates’ hope for its passage have dimmed, and when his first term’s highest priority — Obamacare — seems ready to implode amid a wave of damaging publicity.

The 10:35 a.m. speech is set for the White House’s East Room, which allows plenty of TV cameras, magnifies the apparent priority of the speech and likely will divert media attention from Obamacare’s escalating problems.

The event will be intensively covered by Spanish-language TV and media outlets, such as Univision and Telemundo, all of which favor an increased population of Spanish-speakers.

By giving the speech, Obama can distract the media from Obamacare, show progressives and Latino groups that he’s pushing for the immigration increase, and proclaim his sympathy for the Latino voters he needs in the 2014 midterm election. In mid 2012, Obama decreed a part-amnesty for younger illegals, greatly boosting his Latino support in the 2012 election.

He can also increase pressure on the GOP from Democrats, GOP donors, the media, plus local business and agricultural lobbies.

But “it doesn’t seem like it going to have any impact in Congress,” said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which urges a reduction in the current immigration level of 1 million people per year.

Amid widespread public opposition, a wave of GOP legislators, including several who previously backed an immigration rewrite, have recently declared that Obama can’t be trusted to negotiate any deal, or to enforce portions he does not like.

Top GOP leaders in the House, including House Speaker John Boehner, say they want a bill, but seem reluctant to risk splitting their party prior to budget negotiations in December and January.

If Obama’s speech is also a 2014 pitch, the GOP can respond by trying to win a share of Latino votes in the same way the GOP pursues votes from other Americans, said Krikorian.

There’s some evidence that the White House has given up trying to persuade Congress, Krikorian said. For example, Obama appointed a loyal lawyer to take the top position in the Department of Homeland Security, he said. That won’t do anything to build trust with suspicious GOP legislators, but it could help Obama create a series of mini-amnesties for groups of illegal immigrants, he said.

Obama’s high-profile speech also reverses his long-standing effort to keep a low profile in the debate. The strategy was intended to help immigration-friendly Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio, Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. Paul Ryan, woo GOP legislators for the amnesty and doubled inflow. The plan helped the Democrats get a bill through the Senate in June.

Obama is expected to couch his East Room call for greater immigration in poll-tested and vague language that masks the unpopular aspects of the proposed rewrite. On Oct. 17, for example, Obama said the bill “would make the biggest commitment to border security in our history; would modernize our legal immigration system; make sure everyone plays by the same rules, makes sure that folks who came here illegally have to pay a fine, pay back taxes, meet their responsibilities.”

In practice, the Senate bill would double immigration via various programs, and provide a staged amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants. Overall, it would ensure the arrival of 33 million immigrants over 10 years, and double the resident pool of low-wage, university trained guest-workers to roughly 2 million.

That’s roughly one new working-age immigrant and one new guest worker for every two American who turn 18.

Only 10 to 15 percent of the immigrants are expected to have the workplace skills to allow them to pay more in taxes that they’ll receive in government services, welfare, medical care and retirement.

To aid passage in the House, advocates for the Senate bill included more than $30 billion to boost border defenses.

But the bill actually reduces current border security requirements, gives illegals more courtroom rights, and opens up many new legal immigration options for illegal immigrants, foreign workers, foreign students, people from war-torn countries, favored minorities, deportees and criminals.

Polls show that increased immigration is very unpopular, especially during a time of high employment, stalled wages and growing worry about outsourcing and automation.

However, a majority of Americans say they would accept an amnesty for the 11 million illegal immigrants if the government could be trusted to prevent subsequent illegal immigration. But only a minority trust the government to stop future illegal immigrants.

“Confidence in the likelihood of the federal government actually securing the border fell to a previous low of 28% in late June from a high of 45% in January… [and] continues to be perhaps the biggest problem immigration reformers face,” said a survey announced on Tuesday by Rasmussen Reports.

The bill is strongly supported by progressives, who believe it will give them political dominance after a few years. On Oct. 23, for example, The Hill newspaper quoted a “senior administration official” who said Obama would prefer an immigration rewrite to a 2014 majority in the House. “Given the choice, if we could only have one, he’d rather have immigration reform,” said the official.

The bill is also backed by business and agriculture groups, who want the increased inflow of customers and low-wage workers. Their lobbyists include Grover Norquist and former Mississippi governor, Haley Barbour.

The increased inflow is also very popular among journalists, who describe it as “immigration reform” or a “civil rights movement.”

GOP senators press Obama’s DHS nominee to end ‘lawless’ immigration policies,"A group of Republican Senate Judiciary Committee members are pressing Jeh Johnson — President Obama’s nominee to head the Department of Homeland Security — on the current problems afflicting the department and immigration system.

In a letter to Johnson, dispatched Friday and obtained by The Daily Caller, the senators request answers to more than 55 detailed and diverse questions focused largely on immigration.

“At your confirmation hearing, you stated that, ‘[I]f confirmed, I will work to implement all legislation enacted into law,’ the letter reads. “While we may have different views than President Obama on how to reform our immigration system, we have all repeatedly expressed our strong disapproval of the refusal of this administration — and DHS in particular — to enforce our immigration laws, contradicting duly enacted federal law through administrative orders and internal memoranda.

“These actions have eroded the rule of law and undermined Americans’ confidence in their government. We hope you will commit to discontinuing these lawless policies if confirmed,” the letter, signed by every Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee — except South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake — reads.

The lengthy letter presses Johnson on general issues facing DHS and his nomination — “Do you find any of former Secretary Janet Napolitano’s actions, or current DHS policies, to be objectionable ” — but focuses largely on immigration matters and the administration’s failure to fully enforce current immigration law and dysfunction within the department — “Can you please describe, in detail, how you would restore vigorous enforcement of the public charge law to protect taxpayers, including what efforts you would undertake to reduce noncitizen enrollment in means-tested welfare programs.”

Like Napolitano, Johnson — the former Pentagon general council and advisor to Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign — will likely play a significant role in the nation’s immigration policy and any upcoming reforms to the system.

Five of the senators who put their names on the letter to Johnson — Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — voted against the Senate “Gang of Eight” immigration bill in June. The sixth, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, voted for it.

GOP leaders hide immigration plans,"Republican leaders ducked and dodged this weekend to avoid answering questions about their plans for a rewrite of the nation’s immigration laws, but their comments indicated a determination to move ahead with President Barack Obama’s top legislative priority.

The leaders’ evasions were jeered by conservatives.

The federal government’s insincere promises of proper enforcement “has been going on so long that even the least savvy base voters… aren’t being fooled by this,” said D.A. King, an immigration reformer based in Atlanta, Ga.

The evasions show that “they’re putting on a face with the public until the timing is right,” perhaps after the Spring primaries, said King, who wants to reduce the current immigration inflow of 1 million people per year. “The Republican establishment is clearly saying to voters ‘drop dead.’”

“Who knows if these people are playing a game — it’s very difficult to pin them down,” said Dave Gorak, a former Chicago journalist who now runs the Wisconsin-based Midwest Coalition to Reduce Immigration. “You’re dealing with people who do not rely on logic and common sense — it’s a scary time, there’s doubt about it.”

CBS White House reporter Major Garrett asked GOP Majority Leader Eric Cantor on Sunday if the GOP plan would allow the 12 million illegal immigrants to get citizenship.

Cantor changed the subject.

“There’s a lot of focus on the immigration issue, but you know in reality, we not only want to help the situation there, a lot of the discussion that we had with our members at the retreat was that we want to help the problems right now: job growth and the lack of the job growth,” said Cantor, who is the second-ranking GOP leader.

Garrett also asked Cantor if the GOP leaders, including Virginia Rep. Bob Goodlatte, want a so-called “trigger” that would delay benefits for illegals until new security measures are working and approved by the courts.

“Well, no one is satisfied with the use of that term,” Cantor said as he evaded the question. Goodlatte did not appear on the TV shows, even though his Judiciary committee will write the planned legislation.

On ABC, Rep. Paul Ryan, a leading advocate for an immigration rewrite, shrugged off criticism from GOP allies who say his push for an immigration increase will divide and damage the party before the 2014 election.

The rewrite is needed because “we don’t know who’s coming and going in this country… [and] we don’t trust the president to enforce the [current] law,” said Ryan, who has repeatedly called for additional low-wage guest-workers.

Ryan downplayed the prospect of a deal by highlighting its unpopularity. “We’re still having a debate in our caucus,” he said.

Both legislators also tried to steer the focus away from the immigration rewrite, which is Obama’s top legislative priority.

“We have an increasingly lawless presidency where he is actually doing the job of Congress, writing new policies and new laws without going through Congress,” Ryan said at the start of his interview, which came three days after he and House Speaker John Boehner unveiled their immigration plan.

The plan would increase the current inflow of non-agricultural guest workers — now roughly 650,000 each year. It would also allow the 12 million illegal immigrants to stay in the country.

Cantor also tried to shift the topic. “We want to help the problems right now [with] job growth… 75 percent of Americans are living from paycheck to paycheck,” he said.

The GOP’s leadership is also trying to minimize opposition within the GOP by downplaying the prospects of a deal.

A deal “is clearly in doubt,” said Ryan who is regarded as the GOP’s strongest ideological supporter of greater immigration.

“We’re going to continue the discussion on immigration… [but] the president has got to demonstrate, frankly, the country and the congress can trust him in implementing the laws,” Cantor said.

Obama has strongly suggested that he wants a deal, even if there’s no quick way for illegal immigrants to get citizenship.

“If the speaker proposes something that says right away: Folks aren’t being deported, families aren’t being separated, we’re able to attract top young students to provide the skills or start businesses here and then there’s a regular process of citizenship, I’m not sure how wide the divide ends up being,” Obama told CNN Feb. 1.

In August, Valerie Jarrett, his closed aide, described the proposed deal as comparable to Obamacare in importance, adding “when we look back 50 years from now, I think we will all just be extremely proud.”

The GOP leadership is also showing its eagerness to sign a deal, partly because it might reduce pro-Democratic Latino turnout in 2016.

After the Jan. 30 strategy session, GOP leaders told The Wall Street Journal that their plan “was largely accepted [by the caucus], with some reservations from rank-and-file Republicans.”

“Aides and lawmakers who feared that strong dissension would derail the effort… said there appeared to be enough support to push forward,” the WSJ reported, even though several GOP legislators at the closed-door session said two-thirds of the legislators who spoke opposed the unpopular proposal.

Also, a GOP leadership aide applauded Obama for downplaying the immigration issue in the State of the Union speech. “One senior GOP leadership aide conceded that ‘we breathed a sigh of relief when he got through immigration without making it some partisan attack,’” according to the Hill.

“A ‘sigh of relief’ can only mean relief that the President was going through with the [bipartisan] plan to get an immigration bill out of the House and to his desk,” responded one GOP aide who opposes the worker inflow. In their strategy session, “GOP leaders followed the President’s example and made a gentle sales pitch… to keep opposition cool while plowing ahead,” the aide said.

If the GOP backs the deal, they’d be hurting Americans workers during election campaign in which Obama is expected to allege that the GOP is hostile to American workers, said King. It “looks like they’re going all-out to prove the [Obama] allegation,” he added.

“Boehner and and his crew are so disconnected inside the Beltway that they don’t understand that they’re not fooling the base,” King said. In Georgia, “I don’t meet many people who don’t understand that this is an effort by big business to keep wages low.”

"Valerie Jarrett {Hearts} Rupert Murdoch, {Hates} Dave Brat On Immigration","Top presidential aide Valerie Jarrett told reporters Friday that Virginia GOP candidate Dave Brat is wrong when he says the business-backed push for increased immigration is crony capitalism, and that Rupert Murdoch is right to call for more foreign workers.

“No, no, no, I mean our analysis shows that immigration reform would be terrific for the economy, would grow jobs, would bring people out of the shadows,” she told The Daily Caller at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.

But her criticism of Brat was accompanied by effusive praise for Rupert Murdoch, the head of News Corp., and for other business leaders who are pushing for the Senate immigration rewrite, which would provide them with cheaper workers and more customers.

On June 18, Murdoch used an op-ed in his Wall Street Journal to call for passage of a law allowing companies to hire an unlimited number of foreign professionals in place of Americans.

On June 17, Jarrett and Murdoch met for dinner at the three-star Blue Duck Tavern.

“I had a very enjoyable dinner with Rupert, and he made it clear that he would like to try to help galvanize the business community support [for the Senate bill] … not just through private [conversation] but through public action,” Jarrett told the reporters.

“I was very heartened by Rupert Murdoch’s passionate interest in immigration reform,” she said. “He understands from a business perspective how important immigration reform will be to our economy, and our conversation was really reflected in the op-ed he published in the Wall Street Journal.”

The bill would double the inflow of guest workers and legal immigrants to roughly four million per year for a decade. That’s roughly equal to the number of Americans who turn 18 each year.

Between 2000 and 2013, the government accepted 10 million guest workers and 13 million immigrants.

As the labor supply rose during this period, Americans’ wages stalled. In 2012, employees’ share of the nation’s annual income dropped to the lowest level in 63 years, while companies’ share reached an after-tax, 85-year record level. Amid higher profits, the stock market rose to record heights, and nearly all the wealth generated since the 2008 was gained by the top 1 percent.

Numerous polls show that the push for amnesty and more guest workers is unpopular. That unpopularity was highlighted June 10 when Dave Brat — a college professor with $200,000 in donations —- ousted Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor in a GOP primary.

Brat won 55 percent of the vote, partly by slamming Cantor’s on-and-off support for a bill that would boost the flow of guest workers and provide an amnesty younger illegal immigrants. “I will fight to end crony capitalist programs that benefit the rich and powerful,” Brat said in his victory speech, where he described amnesty as “big business gets the cheap labor and the American people pay the tab.”

Despite Cantor’s shocking defeat, Jarrett urged the GOP to back the bill.

“Sometimes decisions are tough, but it is time for Congress to step up and act now,” she said.

GOP leaders should be reassured by support from Murdoch, she said.

Before dinner with Murdoch, Jarrett said she had breakfast with top business leaders at the D.C.-based Business Roundtable lobby where they described their plans to lobby for the Senate’s immigration bill.

“The Business Roundtable was meeting in town, and I met with their executive committee over breakfast as well — so dinner with Rupert and breakfast with the Business Roundtable,” Jarrett said.

“They were all here and meeting with leadership on the Hill and impressing on them for the business imperative for acting now,” she said.

“There are a wide range of business leaders … who appreciate the importance of comprehensive immigration reform, and who full-throatedly support the bill that was passed by the Senate a year ago,” she said.

Economists generally agree that increased immigration will expand the economy, but will also drive down wages of Americans who have to compete against the foreign workers.

But Jarrett focused her arguments on the advantages for immigrants and for federal tax receipts.

If Congress passed the Senate’s immigration bill, the roughly 12 million illegal immigrants “will pay taxes, they will have employers who can no longer take advantage of them by paying them lower wags, they’ll have to come of the shadows — both the employers and the employees — and so immigration reform is resoundingly good for the economy,” she told the reporters at the breakfast.

“The immigration reform that the president would support is embodied in the Senate bill, which is the only bill that’s actually on the table concretely [and] is good for the economy,” she said.

She did not say if the immigration bill would be good for individual Americans.

Gallup Shows Obama Is Wrong About Immigration,"Only one in five Americans want to see additional immigration, while two in five Americans want less immigration, says a new Gallup poll.

The June 27 Gallup poll helps to explain why the GOP’s rejected the media-touted lobbying push for the Senate’s June 2013 immigration-boosting bill.

Progressives and business groups have spent at least $1.5 billion since 2008 pushing for increased immigration, and routinely insist that the public supports their version of comprehensive immigration reform. That version was approved last June by the Senate, and it would double the inflow of guest workers and legal immigrants up to roughly four million per year.

“The majority of the American people want to see immigration reform done,” Obama insisted during in June 27 interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America.”

But even among Democratic respondents, only 27 percent want increased immigration, said the Gallup survey of 1,027 respondents.

That’s actually less than the percentage of Democrats who want it reduced, which is 32 percent, according to Gallup.

Only 23 percent of independents want immigration increased, while 43 percent want it to be reduced, said the new Gallup.

Fourteen percent of GOP voters want immigration increased, while 50 percent want it reduced.

Roughly one third of independents and GOP supporters say they want immigration to remain level, suggesting they’re not very concerned with the issue.

The new Gallup poll matches many other independent surveys.

For example, a 2012 Pew Research showed that 69 percent of independents and 59 percent of Hispanics say, “We should restrict and control people coming to live in our country more than we do now.”

A March 2014 poll by The Washington Post showed that independent swing voters would vote against a legislator who backed amnesty for illegals by 41 percent to 28 percent.

Even Hispanics oppose greater immigration, despite the concurrent sympathy with their co-ethnics south of the border. In June 2013, only 25 percent of Hispanics wanted immigration increased, according to a February 2014 Gallup poll. Thirty percent of Hispanics wanted immigration reduced, and 43 percent wanted it to stay level.

However, actual election-day support for more immigration may be far lower than even these polls show.

One reason is that only about 10 percent of Americans know their government welcomes 1 million immigrants each year, despite a record level of joblessness, according to a May 2013 poll by Rasmussen Reports.

Thirty-two percent of Rasmussen’s respondents believed immigration is less than one million per year, and seven percent believe it is more than 2.5 million per year. Fifty-one percent of 1,000 respondent in the poll said they don’t know how many people come into the country.

In any debate over immigration, public knowledge about those numbers is likely to grow, and nudge more people to vote against further increases.

Many polls also overstate support for increased immigration by asking broad questions that invite Americans to repeat socially-approved support for new immigrants. That idealistic support, however, plummets when people are asked by pollsters to make trade-offs.

A May 2014 New York Times poll, for example, said that 66 percent of Americans agreed that “most recent immigrants to the United States contribute to this country,” and that 21 percent said “most of them cause problems.”

That poll pushed a left-leaning set of respondents — of whom only 20 percent identified as Republicans — to reject the hard-edged claim that “most” immigrants cause problems. Unsurprisingly, it is cited by advocates for greater immigration, including Aaron Blake, a blogger at The Washington Post.

But the respondents’ private ambivalence was highlighted by a subsequent question, which asked them if they “support or oppose local police taking an active role in identifying undocumented or illegal immigrants?”

In response, 66 percent endorsed active policing, while only 18 percent opposed the policing, said the New York Times poll. That almost 4:1 answer suggests that many Americans are worried that a significant number of immigrants — although not most — cause problems.

That idealistic vs. practical drop-off is also shown in the new Gallup poll, which shows that 63 percent of independents, and 55 percent of Republicans, say immigration is a “good thing” for the country. Yet only 23 percent of independents and 14 percent of Republicans want it increased.

The new Gallup survey also may have overstated support for immigration by ignoring the closely related and very unpopular issue of guest workers.

Few voters recognize that the federal government awards work-permits to roughly 800,000 guest-workers each year, or that the Senate’s June 2013 immigration bill would have sharply increased that inflow.

When the public is asked about guest-workers, the results show a lopsided rejection.

A 2012 poll by the Washington Post showed that adults opposed guest-workers by 59 percent to 31 percent.

A poll funded by NumbersUSA — which favors reduced immigration — showed 60 percent strong opposition and 2 percent strong support for a policy that allows companies to hire guest-workers in place of Americans.

But an increased inflow of guest-workers is a central part of Obama’s so-called “Comprehensive Immigration Reform” push.

He’s offering extra guest-workers to big business groups in exchange for their promise to lobby GOP legislators for passage of legal changes that would allow at least 11 million illegal immigrants to win citizenship, not just residency.

“If we’re reasonable with 11 million, if we all give them a pathway to citizenship … then the Democratic Party has to give us the guest worker program to help our economy,” one of the Senate bill’s drafted, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, told NBC’s “Meet The Press” in April 2013.

Also, public opinion can be shifted during elections by politicians and advertising.

For example, since Obama’s inauguration in 2009, many more Democrats echoed his support for more immigration. This shift is especially strong among African-Americans and progressives, who previously opposed higher immigration a threat to the economic interests of working-class Americans.

Also, numerous carefully-designed industry polls have managed to show supposed public support for the bill above 70 percent. Those polls tend to mischaracterize the Senate bill, and to downplay particularly controversial elements.

The impact of skewed polls was highlighted when a pollster tested a pro-industry pitch this June on voters in Majority Leader Cantor’s district, shortly after his defeat by Dave Brat, who campaigned against increased immigration.

When initially asked for their views by North Star Opinion Research, only 15 percent of Republican primary voters in the district supported the Senate’s immigration bill. Forty-four percent opposed it and 44 percent said they don’t know about the bill, according to a statement from North Star.

The pollster then presented a carefully drafted and misleading description of the Senate bill, and then tested opinions.

“When the bill is described, including four key components — strengthening border security, employer verification, an earned approach to legal status including paying fines and taxes, learning English, and waiting at the back of the line, and tying legal immigration to the economy — primary voters support the bill by a 75 to 21 percent margin,” said North Star in its summary of the poll. That’s a huge 80-point swing.

But Brat defeated Cantor — and that industry pitch — with a shoe-string budget and an value-related argument that said wages and job-prospects are being curbed by a “crony capitalist” alliance of immigration-boosting business executives and politicians.

The business-backed push for more workers “is the most symbolic issue that captures the difference between myself and Eric Cantor in this race, but it also captures the fissures between Main Street and Wall Street,” Brat said after his defeated the GOP’s Majority Leader in his home district.

U.S.S. Obama Hits Immigration Iceberg,"No news here — just another poll showing that President Obama’s immigration policies are making him as popular as ice on the Titanic’s forward deck.

The new Fox News poll showed that Obama’s immigration policies are favored by only 25 percent of independent registered voters. That leaves 67 percent of independents who disapprove of his immigration policies, according to the poll of 1,057 registered voters.

Even 58 percent of self-described Democratic voters disapprove of his immigration policies.

The polls is bad news for Democrats, whose long-term political strategy is to grow the number of immigrant voters.

But it’s especially bad news for Democratic incumbents in the 2014 election, when few of the at-risk Democratic senators live in states with a significant percentage of immigrant citizens.

Obama’s immigration policy has suffered a 25-point downward shift since February 2013, when he had 47 percent approval and 46 percent disapproval among all registered voters, said the Fox poll.

He’s now at 34 percent approval and 58 percent disapproval, said the poll, which was taken July 20 to July 22, and was fully released July 28.

When asked about Obama’s handling of the border crisis, only 31 percent of respondents approval of Obama’s performance, while 56 percent disapproved.

The dour results match other polls which show the public is increasingly alarmed by out-of-control illegal immigration over the southern border, and is increasingly skeptical about the impact of legal immigration on Americans’ wages and jobs.

Obama’s ratings on immigration are so low that even The Washington Post has noticed. “Immigration has emerged as perhaps President Obama’s worst issue — definitely for today, and maybe of his entire presidency,” said a July 31 Washington Post article.

Republican leaders have spotlighted this growing public concern, but they haven’t managed to craft a popular alternative appeal that would help elect more Republicans.

However, GOP leaders say they’re trying.

The federal government’s acceptance of more than 100,000 illegal immigrants from Central America has caused “intense concern within our conference – and among the American people – about the need to ensure the security of our borders and the president’s refusal to faithfully execute our laws,” said a July 31 statement from House Speaker John Boehner after conservative legislators rejected a lengthy and complex bill that purported to fix the Central American inflow.

“We will continue to work on solutions to the border crisis and other challenges facing our country,” Boehner added.

One political solution adopted by Boehner was reminding Americans that Obama is responsible for Obama’s policies. “There are numerous steps the president can and should be taking right now, without the need for congressional action, to secure our borders and ensure these children are returned swiftly and safely to their countries,” Boehner said in his Thursday statement.

Numerous polls suggest Boehner’s statement is on target.

For example, a July poll of 1,044 Americans by the Associated Press and GfK Public Affairs showed that public approval of Obama’s immigration policies has slipped from 22 percent in May, to only 18 percent strong approval in July. Strong disapproval climbed from 43 percent to 57 percent, marking a 18-point shift away from Obama since May, said the AP/GfK poll.

This shift in public opinion goes far beyond criticism of Obama’s policies.

For example, the Fox News poll polls shows the public is adopting a hawkish attitude towards the illegal immigrants, especially the 100,000-plus Central American adults, youths and children that have crossed the border since last October.

Even when the migrants were generously described as “children,” 45 percent of registered voters — including 52 percent of independents, 63 percent of Republicans and 36 percent of Hispanics — said they should be repatriated “as soon as possible,” according to Fox.

That hawkish response might have been higher if Fox had told the registered voters that more than 80 percent of the 57,000 border-crossing “unaccompanied alien children” claim they’re still teenagers.

In the Fox poll, 40 percent of respondents said the “children” should be allowed to stay because they’re fleeing a “humanitarian crisis.” That score included 28 percent of independents and 52 percent of Hispanics.

During the last two years, the sky-high crime rates have either dropped or leveled off in the three countries providing the migrants, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

Fox’s respondents also offered a realistic view of politicians’ attitudes towards the migrants.

Fifty-one percent said that Democrats want to increase immigration because they “simply believe Hispanic and Latino immigrants will vote for Democrats.” Only 29 percent of all respondents said Democrats “truly believe increasing immigration will help the country.”

When asked about the Republicans, only 40 percent of respondents said they want to decrease immigration because they believe the immigrants will vote Democratic. Thirty-six percent said Republicans want to reduce immigration because it will help the country.

Hispanics were evenly split. Thirty percent of Hispanics said that Democrats support immigration out of concern for the country, and 30 percent said Republicans oppose immigration out of concern for the country.

"SHOCK FLASHBACK: Obama Says Illegal Immigration HURTS ‘Blue-Collar Americans,’ STRAINS Welfare [VIDEO]","President Barack Obama once declared that an influx of illegal immigrants will harm “the wages of blue-collar Americans” and “put strains on an already overburdened safety net.”

“[T]here’s no denying that many blacks share the same anxieties as many whites about the wave of illegal immigration flooding our Southern border—a sense that what’s happening now is fundamentally different from what has gone on before,” then-Senator Obama wrote in his 2006 autobiography, “The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream.”

”Not all these fears are irrational,” he wrote.

“The number of immigrants added to the labor force every year is of a magnitude not seen in this country for over a century,” Obama noted. “If this huge influx of mostly low-skill workers provides some benefits to the economy as a whole—especially by keeping our workforce young, in contrast to an increasingly geriatric Europe and Japan—it also threatens to depress further the wages of blue-collar Americans and put strains on an already overburdened safety net.”

If these feel like the words of one of Obama’s opponents, it’s because they’re the exact argument the president’s critics have been making as he now rushes to announce a sweeping executive order that would give work permits to millions of illegal immigrants in the country.

In the passage, Obama also reveals that he personally feels “patriotic resentment” when he sees Mexican flags at immigration rallies.

“Native-born Americans suspect that it is they, and not the immigrant, who are being forced to adapt” to social changes caused by migration, he said.

“And if I’m honest with myself, I must admit that I’m not entirely immune to such nativist sentiments,” Obama wrote. “When I see Mexican flags waved at pro-immigration demonstrations, I sometimes feel a flush of patriotic resentment. When I’m forced to use a translator to communicate with the guy fixing my car, I feel a certain frustration.”

Obama’s frank statements were written in 2006, as he was eying a run for the presidency.

Those worries are mainstream, according to recent polls. Obama now presides over a very porous southern border, and he’s allowed 130,000 Central American migrants across since October 2013.

Via executive order, he is also about to provide work permits to at least 3 million illegal immigrants, allowing them to compete against the very Americans — black, white, Latino and Asian — who he once said would be harmed by such a move.

The new work permits would be in addition to the 600,000 work permits given to younger illegals under the 2012 “Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals” program.

Roughly 4 million Americans will enter the job market this year.

Careful observers of Obama’s modern-day immigration rhetoric will note that he does not discuss the impact millions of formerly-illegal immigrants would have on the wages of American workers. Rather, Obama has repeatedly declared, “It’s the right thing to do.”

Obama has even justified his planned unilateral amnesty as a border control measure.

“In terms of immigration, I have consistently said that it is my profound preference and interest to see Congress act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill,” he said Nov. 5, at his post-defeat press conference in the White House.

That bill, he said, “would strengthen our borders; would streamline our legal immigration system so that it works better and we’re attracting the best and the brightest from around the world; and that we give an opportunity for folks who’ve lived here, in many cases, for a very long time, may have kids who are U.S. citizens, but aren’t properly documented.”

Obama’s plan reportedly would also allow companies to hire up to 500,000 foreign professionals to compete for jobs sought by the roughly 800,000 Americans who will graduate from universities in 2015, often carrying heavy debts, with degrees in medicine, business, science, math, engineering or architecture.

Back in 2006, Obama dismissed the current guest worker programs as unfair to Americans.

A 2006 immigration bill “included a guest worker program that would allow two hundred thousand foreign workers to enter the country for temporary employment,” he wrote.

“The guest worker provision of the bill troubled me,” Obama wrote, “it was essentially a sop to big business, a means for them to employ immigrants without granting them citizenship rights—indeed, a means for business to gain the benefits of outsourcing without having to locate their operations overseas.”

Obama is already expanding those guest worker programs by at least 100,000 jobs, and he backed the Senate’s 2013 bill that would have boosted the number of guest workers above 1 million each year.

Under current law, the U.S. accept 1 million immigrants and 650,000 non-agricultural guest workers each year. Many of the guest workers stay for six years.

Obama “Hopeful” Immigration Will Drown Conservatism,"The spread of vibrant social diversity is constricting the GOP’s ability to champion conservative causes, such as smaller government and independent families, President Barack Obama said in a softball media interview.

“Over the long term, I’m pretty optimistic, and the reason is because this country just becomes more and more of a hodgepodge of folks,” Obama told Vox editor Ezra Klein.

“People are getting more and more comfortable with the diversity of this country, much more sophisticated about both the cultural differences but more importantly, the basic commonality that we have,” he said in his talk, which was recorded Jan 23.

But for Obama, “commonality” is a go-to euphemism for big, intrusive, nation-wide government by progressive experts.

The nation’s governors “all have a common interest, and that is making sure that their constituents — who are also my constituents — are able to gain opportunity, work hard, prosper, feel secure,” Obama said in a Dec. 5 comment about visiting governors. “That happens best when we work together, whether we’re talking about Democrats and Republicans and independents working together, or whether we’re talking about state, federal and local officials working together,” he said.

“What our country needs from us right now is a common purpose –- a higher purpose,” he said Nov. 20 when he announced his unpopular Oval Office amnesty for eight million foreign migrants working illegally in the United States. “Our history and the facts show that immigrants are a net plus for our economy and our society,” he insisted, even though wages have remained stalled since immigration rose after 1965.

“Everything we’ve done to heal the housing market is… about restoring our common values,” he said in a Jan. 8 speech in Arizona. Those values, he said, include a big government program to reverse the damage caused by the big-government housing bubble. “I want to just tell you a quick story… when things seemed darkest, Lorraine learned about something called the Hardest Hit fund –- it’s a program that we created to help folks in states like Arizona that had been especially hard hit by the real estate crash,” he said about “common values.”

Free-market variety is contrary to a common purpose, Obama said Jan. 21. “Our media is all segmented now so that instead of just watching three stations, we got 600,” he said in an Idaho speech. “You got the [single] conservative station and the liberal stations. So everybody is only listening to what they already agree with. And then you’ve got political gerrymandering… so there are a lot of institutional forces that make it seem like we have nothing in common,” he said.

In his Vox interview, Obama predicted that immigration would overwhelm conservative causes.

If “you go to Tennessee and it turns out that you’ve got this huge Kurdish community. And you go to some little town in Iowa and you see some Hasidic Jewish community, and then you see a bunch of interracial black and white couples running around with their kids… in these little farm communities, and you’ve got Latinos in the classroom when you visit the schools there,” he said.

“So people are getting more and more comfortable with the diversity of this country, much more sophisticated about both the cultural differences but more importantly, the basic commonality that we have,” he said.

That diversity hinders conservative priorities, he said.

Those goals include support for families so they can independently govern themselves and their kids.

“The Republican party, even the most conservative, they have much less ability, I think, to express [opposition to single-sex marriage] than they did even 10 years ago,” Obama said.

Obama also used the interview to declare the free-market has failed to deliver economic opportunities and decent wages throughout society. “A lot of the [economic] distributional questions that used to be handled in the marketplace through decent wages or health care or defined benefit pension plans — those things all are eliminated…the average employee, the average worker, doesn’t feel any benefit,” said Obama.

The market’s failure, he said, requires more progressive government intervention in the economy. “So part of our job is, what can government do directly through tax policy?” he asked. “[E]ven before taxes are paid, are there ways that we can increase the bargaining power: making sure that an employee has some measurable increases in their incomes and their wealth and their security as a consequence of an economy that’s improving.”

“There’s been some interesting conversations globally around issues like inclusive capitalism and how we can make it work for everybody,” said Obama.

But Obama’s progressive deputies and allies have worked with big business groups to depress wages by flooding the labor market with immigrants since 2009. For example, his administration has provided work permits to 5.46 million migrants above the normal 1 million legal immigrants per year.

In 2013 and 2014, Obama tried to provide work permits to at least 12 million illegals, and his Oval Office amnesty would provide another 5 million work-permits to illegals.

His push for more immigration was his top legislative priority over the last two years, but was defeated by public protests.

“Together with the Affordable Care Act — two major pieces of legislation — that when we look back 50 years from now, I think we will all just be extremely proud,” Obama’s top aide, Valerie Jarrett said in August 2013. “It will be a landmark piece of legislation.”

The immigration influx has reduced the proportion of working-age Americans in the workforce since 2010. In November 2014, one in every five U.S. jobs was held by a foreign-born worker, up from one-in-six jobs in January 2010, according to federal data highlighted by the Center for Immigration Studies.

The drop in wages and rise in government dependence caused by Obama’s policy of mass immigration simultaneously gives Obama the opportunity to justify even more immigration and to portray conservative as bigots. “I know some worry immigration will change the very fabric of who we are, or take our jobs, or stick it to middle-class families at a time when they already feel like they’ve gotten the raw deal for over a decade,” he said Nov. 20.

“That’s not what these steps would do. Our history and the facts show that immigrants are a net plus for our economy and our society,” he claimed.

“I believe it’s important that all of us have this debate without impugning each other’s character,” he added in his Nov. 5 speech, slyly suggesting that his GOP critics are bigots.

He replayed the rhetorical trick in his Vox interview, saying “the Republican Party, even the most conservative, they have much less ability, I think, to express discriminatory views than they did even 10 years ago.”

“And that’s a source of optimism. It makes me hopeful,” he said.

Obama Threatens Consequences If Law Enforcement Officers Don’t Enforce Amnesty,"President Barack Obama used a TV interview to describe law enforcement officials as soldiers under his direct command, and he threatened to punish law enforcement officials who try to ignore his November policy barring the enforcement immigration law against millions of illegals.

“In the U.S. military, when you get an order, you’re expected to follow it,” said Obama, who is legally the commander in chief of the U.S. military. “It doesn’t mean that everybody follows the order. If they don’t, they’ve got a problem,” he said during his Wednesday interview that aired on MSNBC and the Telemundo Spanish-language network.

“The bottom line is, is that if somebody is working for [U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement] and there is a policy and they don’t follow the policy, there are going to be consequences,” Obama said.

Obama’s threat followed complaints from the Spanish-speaking audience members about officers who try to enforce the nation’s immigration laws.

Obama doesn’t want protests from Latinos or enforcement by U.S. officials.

His Nov. 20 Oval Office amnesty includes a policy directive to immigration officers directing them to stop repatriating illegals, unless the illegals have recently crossed the border, or have have been convicted of a major crime. “For people who’ve been living here for a long time, they are no longer prioritized for enforcement and deportation,” Obama told the audience.

Recent data shows that Obama is successfully reducing the repatriation of illegals who have been living in the United States for some years.

In 2012, his agencies were repatriating roughly 30,000 illegals per month, out a population of roughly 12 million. But that number fell to roughly 20,000 per month in 2014, and down to 11,000 in January 2015, according to a calculation by the Center for Immigration Studies.

At the record low rate of 10,000 repatriations per month, it will take 100 years for Obama’s administration to comply with federal law, assuming the federal government also ends all other incentives — such as workplace authorization rules — that encourage the return home of the 12 million illegal immigrants.

Obama defended his costly directive by saying he’s focusing law enforcement resources on high-priority threats. “We’re focused on criminals and gang members who are a threat to our community, and we’re focused on the border and making sure the people who’ve just come,” he said.

Immigration officers “are instructed to focus on criminals and people who have just crossed the border,” Obama said. So “if you’ve been here for a long time and if you qualify, generally, then during this period, even with legal uncertainty, they should be in a good place.”

The cost of Obama’s “prioritization” project is likely huge. Each household of low-skill workers — whether native-born of legal immigrants — costs Americans taxpayers roughly $50,000 per year, in various transfer payments, such as IRS rebates, ant-poverty programs, health-care programs and K-12 education costs, according to the Heritage Foundation.

Obama also acknowledged that his “prioritization” argument was pushed only after he decided to stop enforcing immigration law. “We recognize we’re not going to deport 11 million people. And so why we would want to allocate resources in a wasteful way — that doesn’t make sense,” he said.

But he’s also redirecting federal resources from enforcement to give get-out-of-jail residency cards to illegal immigrants. The cards will allow at least 5 million illegals to compete for jobs, get IRS anti-poverty payments, get Social Security Numbers and also get on a fast-track process to citizenship and full access to federal support programs.

“The head of the Department of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, he is absolutely committed to this new prioritization,” Obama said. “More importantly, I, the president of the United States, am absolutely committed to this new prioritization.”

Obama’s Police Task Force Recommends Scrapping FBI’s ‘Immigration Violator’ Database,"A task force appointed by President Barack Obama to reform policing in the U.S. is recommending that the Department of Justice scrap an FBI database that gathers and maintains information on certain “immigration violators.”

The recommendation, handed down by the President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing in an interim report on Monday, pertains to FBI’s National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database.

NCIC is used by local law enforcement officers during traffic stops and other encounters with the public. The database, developed in 1967, allows officers to find out if the individuals are wanted for crimes in other jurisdictions.

An immigrant violator database was added to NCIC in 2002. That particular database tells officers if a person has an outstanding removal order, whether the person failed to complete a special post-9/11 registration requirement or whether the individual was previously deported with a felony conviction.

If NCIC returns a positive hit for an immigration violation, local law enforcement officers are supposed to contact U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Some cities have policies requiring officers to do this, while others have policies against it.

Despite the usefulness of the tool in tracking immigration violators and possible terrorists, the Obama-appointed task force is suggesting it be put on ice.

The task force’s recommendation is based on testimony provided by an immigration activist at a recent listening tour.

Javier Valdez, of Make the Road New York, testified in front of the task force last month arguing that the database “exacerbated the fear that immigrant communities feel towards local police and remains a significant impediment to effective community policing.”

Valdez asserted in his testimony that Bush adopted the policy “without lawful authority” and “began entering civil immigration information regarding thousands of non-citizen [sic] into the NCIC database.”

Because of this strategy, “local officers now routinely make civil immigration arrests when they encounter individuals whose names produce hits in the NCIC database,” Valdez asserted.

He also argued that the number of people incorrectly identified as immigration violators is “extremely high,” citing a study that purportedly found that the error rate on immigration entries was 40 percent.

The task force’s new recommendation is part of a larger immigration strategy — one embraced by the Obama administration — of taking immigration enforcement out of the hands of local and state law enforcement agencies.

One of the task force’s recommendations is that the Department of Homeland Security terminate its policy of allowing local law enforcement to detain immigration status violators.

Another recommendation is that “law enforcement agencies should ensure reasonable and equitable language access for all persons who have encounters with police or who enter the criminal justice system.”

Most of the task force’s policy recommendations pertain to how police officers interact with the communities they serve. Obama set up the task force in the wake of several police-involved deaths last year.

Scott Walker’s Populist Immigration Pander,"Life moves pretty fast. Just after I submitted my column on soon-to-be-presidential candidate Mike Huckabee’s appeal to populist conservatives, Scott Walker (who already has a blue collar thing going for him) started questioning the impact legal immigration might have on American jobs.

This can be seen as both a flip-flip and a demagogic pander. There’s actually a debate to be had over whether or not illegal immigration costs jobs in the long run. Most people only do the part of the math that says more workers equals more supply (of labor), and thus lower wages. They don’t do the part of the math that says more people equals more demand for all sorts of products and services. Or the part that says more people equals more ideas. (There is more to this, of course, but the long and short of it is they are looking at this from a static perspective instead of a dynamic one.)

It’s interesting that having spent the last few years worrying about illegal immigration, we’re now getting around to hand-wringing about legal immigration. From a branding perspective, it is one thing for the GOP to be the “anti-illegal immigration” party, and quite another to be the “anti-immigration” party. This only serves to confirm deep-seated suspicions about the GOP. But branding be damned — there are votes to get!

Now, I could go into much greater detail about why I think Walker’s ostensible worries are misplaced. One could certainly argue that automation poses a more serious long-term threat; would he propose we ban creative destruction? In any event, I can only make these arguments so many times (if you care to hear more, here are 5 reasons conservatives should support more Hispanic immigration).

Putting aside our major differences over the substance of this policy, as well as the long-term problems this creates for a Republican Party that has lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections, the plain truth is that this is probably smart short-term politics for a candidate hoping to win the Republican nomination.

This only confirms to me that Walker’s team is spotting the same opening to attract an under-served constituency that I write about in my Huckabee piece: “As a political observer, I can’t help but suspect that there is a huge opening for a conservative candidate willing to be the working man’s conservative.”

The fundamental problem for the GOP might be that there is an incentive problem. There’s a huge difference between what makes smart short-term sense for an individual candidate hoping to win a primary, versus what makes smart long-term sense for a party and a movement hoping to win the future.

So there’s essentially a conflict between what is urgent and what is important. And anyone who’s ever tried (and failed) to actually apply the lessons taught in leadership books and business seminars knows that — in the real world — the urgent almost always takes precedence over the important.

"Donald Trump Releases Immigration Plan, Including Ending Birthright Citizenship","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump Sunday released his campaign’s immigration plan, which includes ending birthright citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants.

“This remains the biggest magnet for illegal immigration,” Trump says in the plan posted on his website.

“We are the only country in the world whose immigration system puts the needs of other nations ahead of our own,” Trump also said. “That must change.”

Here is how Trump describes the three principles of his plan:

A nation without borders is not a nation. There must be a wall across the southern border. A nation without laws is not a nation. Laws passed in accordance with our Constitutional system of government must be enforced. A nation that does not serve its own citizens is not a nation. Any immigration plan must improve jobs, wages and security for all Americans.

Trump’s plan includes his frequent call to make Mexico pay for a wall across the southern border. “For many years, Mexico’s leaders have been taking advantage of the United States by using illegal immigration to export the crime and poverty in their own country (as well is in other Latin American countries),” Trump says.

Says Trump: “We will not be taken advantage of anymore.”

Trump is also calling for the government to triple the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, mandate nationwide e-verify systems for employers, deport criminal illegal immigrants, end catch-and-release of people caught trying to enter the country illegaly, defund sanctuary cities and implement harsher penalties for immigrants overstaying visas.

Speaking of legal immigration, Trump says, “We need to control the admission of new low-earning workers in order to: help wages grow, get teenagers back to work, aid minorities’ rise into the middle class, help schools and communities falling behind, and to ensure our immigrant members of the national family become part of the American dream.”

Speaking of the H-1B non-immigrant visa program that allows companies to hire foreign workers, Trump says there needs to be a requirement to “hire American workers first.”

“Too many visas, like the H-1B, have no such requirement,” Trump said. “In the year 2015, with 92 million Americans outside the workforce and incomes collapsing, we need to companies to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed. Petitions for workers should be mailed to the unemployment office, not USCIS.”

Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions, who has met with Trump to discuss immigration, released a statement Sunday evening praising the plan:

“This is exactly the plan America needs. Not only would the plan outlined in this paper work, but more quickly than many realize. Most importantly, this plan reestablishes the principle that American’s immigration laws should serve the interests of its own citizens. For too long, ‘immigration reform’ plans in Washington have served the special interests at the expense of working Americans. By contrast, this plan puts the needs of working Americans foremost, and develops an effective strategy for improving their wages and job prospects. Crucially, this plan includes an emphasis on lifting struggling minority communities, including our immigrant communities, out of poverty — by preventing corporations from bringing in new workers from overseas to replace them and drive down wages. When the labor market is oversupplied, it tilts the balance of power away form workers and towards employers. In combination with a smart, fair trade policy this proposal would reinvigorate the middle class. Polling shows this plan will appeal broadly to all segments of the electorate: prioritizing the just demands of loyal, everyday Americans who have been shunned by a governing elite.”

Scott Walker: My Immigration Plan Is ‘Very Similar’ To Donald Trump’s,"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker on Monday responded to Donald Trump’s newly-released immigration position paper by saying the plan he is offering is “very similar.”

Asked on “Fox and Friends” if he gives Trump’s plan a thumbs up, Walker said: “I haven’t looked at all the details of his, but the things I’ve heard are very similar to the things I mentioned.”

Walker, speaking to host Steve Doocy, referenced his appearance earlier this year on “Fox News Sunday” when he “laid out what I thought we should do” on immigration.

Walker said that includes securing the border “which means build the wall, have the technology, the personnel to make sure it’s safe and secure.”

The governor said he would enforce the law, “which I’ve said for some time means … making sure we don’t have sanctuary cities.”

As for the 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country, Walker said “I’ve said no amnesty. I don’t believe in amnesty, which I think is similar to what he said.”

Walker said he and Trump also agree “we should give priority to American working families and their wages, in a way that will improve the American economy.”

"This Labor Day Weekend, Remember How Immigration Depresses Workers’ Wages","Millions of Americans have little reason to celebrate this labor day weekend. Years after the economy supposedly recovered from the recession that began in 2007, we have yet to see the robust job creation that typically follows a recession.

The employment situation continues to be particularly grim for low-skilled workers, teenagers and African-Americans. The July 2015 unemployment rate for African-American men was 8.7 percent, and the labor force participation rate was only 67.4 percent. The unemployment rate for workers with less than a high school diploma was 8.2 percent, and their labor force participation rate was a mere 45.3 percent. The unemployment rate for 16-19 year olds is 14.4 percent, and they have a labor force participation rate of 44.1 percent.

Meanwhile, in the middle of an increasingly bitter public debate about illegal immigration, President Obama continues to refuse to enforce the immigration laws. The dim employment outlook for African-Americans, young people, and low-skilled workers may seem to be unconnected to illegal immigration, but the two issues are related. In 2008, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights held a briefing on the effect of illegal immigration on black unemployment. The briefing witnesses, well-regarded scholars from across the ideological spectrum, were unanimous: illegal immigration has a quantifiable negative effect on both the employment opportunities and wages of African-Americans. Similarly, over the past few years several economists have posited that high levels of low-skilled immigration – and illegal immigrants are predominantly low-skilled – contribute to low levels of teenage employment.

The reason illegal immigration has a disproportionate effect on the employment of African-American men, low-skilled workers, and young people is that all three groups are competing for the same jobs. Both illegal immigrants and African-American men are disproportionately likely to be poorly educated and therefore be in the low-skilled labor market. A 2012 Census Bureau report found that 50.9 percent of native-born blacks and 75.5 percent of foreign-born Hispanics had not continued their education beyond high school. Although the report did not disaggregate foreign-born Hispanics who are legal immigrants from those who are illegal immigrants, Professor Vernon Briggs estimated that illegal immigrants or former illegal immigrants who received amnesty constitute a third to over a half of the total foreign-born population.

This means that illegal immigrants and African-Americans compete against each other for the same jobs. Professor Gordon Hanson testified that between 1980 and 2000, low-skilled immigration (which is heavily comprised of illegal immigrants) “reduced the employment rate of low-skill black men by about 8 percentage points,” which “accounts for about 40 percent of the 18 percentage point decline in black employment rates” since 1960.

Similarly, teenagers are almost by definition less likely to have a high school diploma, and other young people without high school diplomas are considered low-skilled. In 2012, economist Christopher Smith estimated that “the fraction of teens employed in the previous week would have been about 6.5 (males) and 7.1 (females) percentage points higher in 2005 had immigration remained at its 1990 levels.” In 2014, a group of economists (of which Smith was one) cited Smith’s earlier work in their own discussion of declining youth labor force participation rates, noting that competition from low-skilled adult immigrants may contribute to the “crowding out” of 16-24 year old workers in lower-skilled fields. The economists stated that the declining labor force participation rate among 16-24 year olds is probably not entirely due to young people spending more time in school, as labor force participation has also declined among those who are not enrolled in school.

This bodes ill for the future of these young workers, particularly those who do not go on to college. Smith found that “a 10% reduction in average annual hours worked for 16 and 17 year olds is associated with a change in annual earnings ten years later of between -2.9% and 1% for males and -2.4% and 0.7% for females.” This makes sense – if someone does not go on to college, it is even more important that they get on the employment ladder at an early age.

The data are clear. Employment prospects for young people, low-skilled workers, and African-Americans continue to be dismal. When the unemployment rate in a population is over 8 percent, as it is for all three groups, you don’t have a shortage of labor – you have a surplus. It is clear that illegal immigration, and low-skilled immigration generally, has a devastating effect on the jobs and wages of low-skilled Americans, particularly low-skilled African-Americans and young Americans. Yet Big Business, Big Labor, the tech elites of Silicon Valley, politicians from both parties, and racial solidarity organizations continue to prioritize their narrow sectarian interests over the well-being of American citizens. This Labor Day weekend, I ask: Who will speak for the American worker?

"Immigration Has Such A Giant Backlog, Asylum Seekers Can Work For YEARS While Being Processed","The U.S. immigration system is in such disarray, and backlogs are so large, that asylum seekers are now able to legally work in the U.S. for two years as of Oct. 5.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that, “effective October 5, 2016, USCIS has increased the validity period for initial or renewal Employment Authorization Documents for asylum applicants from one year to two years,” in an Oct. 6 press release. USCIS is contending with many delays and inefficiencies as evidenced with 524,014 people waiting for citizenship that may not get it in time to vote in the upcoming presidential election.

Before the USCIS announcement, work permits for asylum-seekers were only valid for one year, but the backlog forced the organization to double the length of the work permit. Federal immigration courts are also increasingly backlogged with some cases not being decided until 2020.

Immigration reform and border control is a central issue in the 2016 presidential campaign, especially in light of GOP nominee Donald Trump proposing a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. Trump is promising that Mexico will pay for the construction of the border wall if he is elected president.

The GOP nominee is also committing himself to getting rid of the Obama administration’s executive orders that give temporary amnesty to many illegal immigrants. The New York billionaire is even endorsed by the National Border Patrol Council, a union made up of Border Patrol agents, as well as the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, whose members are thousands of ICE employees.

EXCLUSIVE: Immigration Official Okays Syrian Immigrants With Fake Passports [VIDEO],"An undercover video exclusively obtained by The Daily Caller Tuesday claims to show an immigration official in New York giving advice on how illegal Syrian immigrants can receive asylum with fake passports.

Laura Loomer, an undercover activist for Pamela Geller’s American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), visited a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office Jan. 6 in Port Chester, N.Y. Loomer told an employee who AFDI identified as “Sergio” that she knows a family from Syria who is afraid to come into the office because they are in the country illegally. She said that she wants to make sure the family is “integrated” and has “immigration services.”

“The issue with them is that they have fake passports,” Loomer says in the video. The man identified as Sergio responded, “We waive sometimes the passports or whatever because they are unable to provide that documentation.”

He asked when the Syrian family arrived, presumably to see if they would be eligible for Temporary Protected Status, which protects Syrian immigrants, of illegal or legal status, from deportation. The status is available to Syrians who have been in the U.S. since Oct. 1, 2016. and the date to register ends in a few weeks.

“The fake passport is one thing, we are going to use the name that is on the passport as AKA, also known as,” the USCIS employee responded. He added, “chances are considering the situation in Syria, they are not going to be sent back.”

The man identified as Sergio said the family could get a work permit and that Loomer should “file accurately” the paperwork and make sure that she uses their correct names or “the names they used with these passports, which are not their own names.”

The USCIS employee went on to say, “Was there ever a situation where people came with fraudulent documents and qualified for asylum? Yes, because it’s understood that they can not always obtain genuine documents. So it’s far from being unique.”

The Daily Caller asked the USCIS if giving asylum to immigrants with fake documents is “far from unique” like the USCIS employee said in the video. A spokesperson responded by saying they do not “publicly discuss individual immigration cases” and giving a link to a information on their refugee and asylum programs. Nearly 85,000 Syrian refugees were resettled in Fiscal Year 2016 and the Obama administration has sped up resettlement in the president’s last days in office.

A USCIS spokesperson also said that the agency cannot confirm the authenticity of the video as they claim it is heavily edited. The USCIS did not confirm nor deny that Sergio is an employee with the agency.

TheDC has previously reported on an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo which states difficulty in preventing fraud in the refugee program as “bad actors” use false biographies and “produce and submit fictitious supporting documentation.” It has also been reported that the Islamic State has a thriving fake passport industry.

Immigration Hawks Fear Trump Will Abandon Promise To End ‘Dreamer’ Amnesty,"Groups that want a tougher approach to illegal immigration are worried that President Donald Trump will renege on one of his signature policy promises: ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive amnesty program.

During the presidential campaign, Trump vowed to “immediately terminate” the DACA program, which former President Barack Obama created in 2012 to give illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. as minors a two-year period of deferred action on deportation and access to work permits.

Five months into his presidency, Trump has not moved to cancel DACA protections, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced earlier in June the policies would remain in place for an indefinite period of time. That inaction has convinced many immigration groups that the Trump administration has no intention of eliminating the program.

“If the president had decided to end DACA, it would have happened. I don’t know what they are waiting for. He promised to end DACA,” Rosemary Jenks, director of government relations for NumbersUSA, told the Washington Examiner.

“Once you say something is illegal and unconstitutional, you can’t just keep doing it” she said.

As a candidate, Trump ripped DACA as an illegal “amnesty” and said he would discontinue the program. To the dismay of immigration hawks, the president has since softened his rhetoric on DACA recipients — commonly known as ‘Dreamers’ — and DHS continues to process DACA applications as it had under the Obama administration.

Immigration authorities granted 107,524 DACA renewals and processed 17,275 new applications from January to March, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. About 70 percent of those cases were approved under Trump’s watch.

Organizations such as Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) see the continuation of DACA as a betrayal of the administration’s promises to crack down on illegal immigration. FAIR president Dan Stein told The Daily Caller editor-in-chief Vince Coglianese that Trump’s lack of action on the issue is a “complete flip flop” that preserves the Obama administration’s amnesty for illegal aliens. (RELATED: Key Immigration Hawk: Trump Admin Is Following Obama’s Position On Amnesty)

The administration did follow through with its promise to end the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program, which would have allowed as many as five million illegal aliens with children who are citizens or lawful permanent residents to remain in the U.S. if they fulfilled certain criteria. But many groups saw it as a hollow victory because DAPA had already been blocked by the federal courts and had little chance of overcoming a legal challenge from 26 states.

Ending DACA is the bigger priority for immigration skeptics, says Jenks.

“I certainly am very happy that Secretary Kelly ended DAPA … that is a good thing and needed to happen, but it does not fulfill Trump’s campaign promise. DACA needs to be ended,” she told the Los Angeles Times.

“It is clear the decision on DACA has been made at the White House,” Jenks added. “That is truly on Trump, and he needs to do it.”

For some immigration hawks, Trump’s inaction on DACA is especially frustrating because the administration could use the program as leverage to pry concessions on immigration policy from Congressional Democrats. Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center For Immigration Studies (CIS), says that Trump is missing an opportunity to further his immigration agenda by not threatening to end DACA.

“I knew he [Trump] was going to sell us out on some things,” he told The Atlantic. “I just didn’t think DACA was going to be what he sells us out on.”

If the Trump administration won’t unilaterally cancel DACA, Krikorian says, it should prod lawmakers to deliver a compromise that legalizes DACA recipients in exchange for long-term policy fixes such as workplace enforcement, caps on guest worker visas, and reduced levels of legal immigration. DHS Secretary John Kelly has also argued in favor of a legislative solution to the DACA problem, calling on Congress to pass a law that would clarify the status instead of “beating up” on DHS for following existing immigration law.

While Krikorian would prefer to see Trump use his own executive authority to pull the plug on DACA, he thinks the program could be useful if Trump were willing to use it as a bargaining chip.

“Though I was initially skeptical, it might even make sense to try to trade a real, lawful amnesty for the DACAs in exchange for important immigration changes only Congress can pass – specifically, universal E-Verify and cuts in legal immigration,” Krikorian wrote in a blog post. “In that case, announcing that renewals would continue until, say, the end of the year could be a powerful motivator for congressional Democrats.”

Trump Backs ‘Comprehensive Immigration’ Reform,"President Donald Trump indicated he may support amnesty when talking to reporters aboard Air Force One Wednesday night.

The president was asked about Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly’s comments to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that President Obama’s amnesty for illegal immigrants who arrived as minors, DACA, might be terminated due to legal challenges from Republican states.

“It’s a decision that I make and it’s a decision that’s very very hard to make. I really understand the situation now,” President Trump replied. “I understand the situation very well. What I’d like to do is a comprehensive immigration plan. But our country and political forces are not ready yet.”

“Comprehensive immigration reform” is used in modern American politics as a euphemism for giving illegal immigrants currently in the U.S. a path to legal status or citizenship.

During his run for the presidency, Trump took a hardline stance on immigration and pledged to deport all 12 million or so illegal immigrants in the country. He also said he would “immediately” end DACA.

However, he has reneged on this promise, and in his first few months in office nearly 100,000 illegal immigrants benefited from the amnesty program.

Trump added, “There are two sides of a story. It’s always tough.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2017/07/13/trump-backs-comprehensive-immigration-plan/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjRrYCJgbT9AhVjF1kFHdHhBSY4ZBAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw0pdEBCIQQk3SkDYabukfuz,2017-07-13
CNN Accidentally Makes The Case For Limiting Immigration,"CNN joined the ranks Thursday of The Washington Post, The New York Times and other national media outlets in warning about the supposedly harmful economic effects of the RAISE Act, a Trump administration-backed bill to reduce legal immigration levels by half over a decade.

In a report titled “Trump immigration plan to cost 4.6 million jobs, Ivy League study finds,” CNN highlighted an analysis of the bill by the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. The Wharton study projects that by 2040, the American economy would lose more than 4 million jobs and be 2 percent smaller under the RAISE Act than it would be under current immigration levels.

Even assuming Wharton’s predictive model is accurate, CNN unquestioningly relies on the study’s jobs and GDP figures, and then misreads what they actually portend for the U.S. economy.

Steve Camarota, the director of research at the Center For Immigration Studies (CIS), says CNN is ignoring the fact that there will be 4.6 million fewer workers in the U.S. under the RAISE Act precisely because there will be roughly 10 million fewer immigrants. In other words, a smaller population will have fewer workers than a larger population, but that fact illustrates nothing about the the bill’s effect on the native population.

“It looks like what they’re arguing is that that the U.S. population will be somewhat smaller, and the overall GDP will be somewhat less, but all of that is absorbed by the people that don’t come,” Camarota told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “There’s nothing in there that says the existing population of native-born and legal immigrants will in any way be harmed.”

“In fact, it all looks like good news because it states that the employment rate — that is the share of people with a job — is going to go up,” Camarota added. “They inadvertently make the case for the RAISE Act.”

According to the study’s authors, the domestic worker participation rate wouldn’t increase enough under the RAISE Act to fill the jobs that immigrants would have filled. That means the job market will become more favorable for native-born Americans, as CIS fellow Jason Richwine noted in a blog post Thursday.

“That suggests not only that Americans will work more under the RAISE Act, but also that the ‘lost jobs’ will be lost not by Americans, but by the immigrants who would not arrive,” Richwine wrote.

As for the lost economic output that results from lighter immigration, Camarota says the media’s focus on gross domestic product (GDP) is highly misleading.

“Adding people to the United States, as a general proposition, doesn’t raise the standard of living,” Camarota explained. “If it did why wouldn’t Bangladesh be richer than New Zealand? After all, it’s got a lot more people, and its GDP is slightly larger. But nobody says ‘Oh, Bangladesh is a richer country than New Zealand and the people are better off.’ What matters is per capita.”

The Wharton analysis does address GDP per capita, finding a negligible effect from reduced immigration under the RAISE Act. According to the study, the bill would cause per capita GDP to be 0.02 percent higher in 2027 that it would have been under current policy.

Massachusetts Cops Back Governor’s Immigration Detention Bill,"Police chiefs in Massachusetts are lining up behind Gov. Charlie Baker’s proposal to let state and local police honor immigration detention requests for criminal aliens deemed to be public safety threats.

Leaders of the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association and the Major City Police Chiefs Association wrote a letter to state legislators calling Baker’s bill a “commonsense” approach to cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, reports Masslive.com.

“This change will enhance public safety in our respective communities by preventing these dangerous criminals from being released back into our cities and towns to potentially commit further crimes,” the police chiefs wrote.

The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled last month that state law does not give police the authority to honor ICE detainers, which are formal requests to hold criminal aliens in local jails for up to 48 hours until immigration agents can take custody of the suspect. Justices found that holding a person beyond the expiration of a jail sentence amounts to a fresh arrest for a civil violation, which is not permitted under state law.

Baker responded by introducing a bill that would give police the explicit power to honor ICE detainers for certain categories of criminal aliens. Under Baker’s proposal, local jails could hold for up to 12 hours those suspected of terrorism or participating in a criminal street gang, domestic violence or sexual abuse offenders, convicted felons and other “high priority” inmates. (RELATED: Massachusetts Governor Crafting Bill To Override Court Ban On ICE Detainers)

The bill is currently pending before the state legislature’s Judiciary Committee. Massachusetts police chiefs say it would fix a “gap” in the law that forces local law enforcement to release criminal aliens with a “demonstrated propensity for violence.”

“While we are in agreement that civil immigration enforcement is primarily a federal law enforcement responsibility which should be decoupled from state and local police enforcement priorities, we remain steadfast in our commitment as officers sworn to protect and serve the public that we should be utilizing every strategic resource at our disposal to optimize and enhance the safety and security of our communities within legal boundaries,” the police chiefs wrote.

The letter was sent Friday to Democratic lawmakers Sen. William Brownsberger and Rep. Claire Cronin, the co-chairs of the Joint Committee on the Judiciary. The committee has not yet held a hearing on Baker’s proposal.

DOJ Says Immigration Judge Surge Has Been Effective,"“Comparing the results of the surge to historical scheduling and outcome data, EOIR has projected that the mobilized immigration judges have completed approximately 2,700 more cases than expected if the immigration judges had not been detailed. This means that completed cases by detailed immigration judges have outpaced expected home court deferrals, resulting in a positive net effect on the nationwide caseload,” The Justice Department said in a press release. “Also, immigration judges mobilized to surge sites completed approximately 21 percent more cases on detail than the historical, expected performance of nondetailed immigration judges at the same base locations.”

The intense court backlog has been blamed by acting ICE Director Thomas Homan for slowing down deportations.

“Everybody wants their day in court,” Homan told The Daily Caller in July . “When they’re nationals of Mexico, they are easy removals, they’re quick removals. Non-criminals are quick removals. Nowadays we got a lot more Central Americans, a lot of them are claiming fear. So their immigration proceedings are a lot longer. They’re playing the system and criminals take a little longer to remove because of certain proceedings they have to have.”

An executive order signed by Trump in January allowed DHS to expand the amount of illegal immigrants who can be deported without a court hearing, however, it has yet to be implemented.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2017/10/04/doj-says-immigration-judge-surge-has-been-effective/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwidyNWHgbT9AhWHEVkFHQT9Abg4UBAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw3X1tcCfwLaisfrqNLENwcP,2017-10-04
Trump’s Enforcement Plan Would Virtually Eliminate Incentives For Illegal Immigration,"The White House gave Congress a wish list on Sunday of border security and immigration enforcement policies that, if passed, would constitute the most significant overhaul of the U.S. immigration system in a generation.

Some of the recommendations focus on the removal of illegal immigrants who have managed to evade immigration authorities at the border or in the interior of the U.S., but the list is notable for policies that would deter them from coming in the first place.

Immigration hawks cheered the Trump administration’s approach, which they say would finally eliminate the incentives for unauthorized migration that are baked into the system. Among dozens of specific proposals, there are four key policies that would discourage illegal immigration by either creating new deterrents or closing loopholes in existing law.

Workplace enforcement

Immigration skeptics have long said that the greatest magnet for illegal immigration to the U.S. is lax enforcement of work authorization laws.

Groups such as the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), the Federation for American Immigration Reform and NumbersUSA have unanimously called on Republican lawmakers to require universal employment verification a part of any deal to legalize recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

The White House is proposing to achieve that goal through the mandatory use of e-Verify, a system that allows employers to check the employment eligibility of new hires. Only a handful of states currently require employers to use e-Verify, and only half of all job applicants nationwide are run through the system, according to Chris Chmielenski, director of content and advocacy at NumbersUSA.

“We think you can’t even talk about a DACA amnesty until you pass e-Verify because if you pass DACA without shutting off the jobs magnet you’re just going to be talking about amnesty 10 years from now,” Chmielenski told The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The Trump administration is also promising to punish employers who skirt employment laws to hire illegal immigrants. The new immigration principles include expanding the definition of employment discrimination to include cases where businesses hire foreign workers at the expense of available, qualified American citizens.

To the delight of immigration hawks, the Department of Justice has already taken action on this front, slapping a national tree services company with a $95 million penalty last month for employing illegal alien workers.

“Most politicians who have been commenting lately on immigration policy have failed to show the compassion and support that the Trump Administration is offering the women and men of America who want a decent shot at a decent job without having to compete with millions of new foreign workers being added to compete with them,” NumbersUSA president Roy Beck said in a statement Sunday.

Visa overstays

About 40 percent of all illegal immigrants are people who entered the U.S. on a legitimate non-immigrant visa and never returned to their home countries, according to the Trump administration.

The Department of Homeland Security found that more than 600,000 non-immigrant arrivals had no recorded departure from the U.S. after their visas expired, according to its Fiscal Year 2016 Entry/Exit report. Immigration authorities typically apprehend only a tiny fraction of those cases, while the rest remain in the U.S. and potentially become eligible for immigration benefits if they can successfully adjust status.

In order to eliminate that incentive, the White House is asking Congress to make overstaying a visa a misdemeanor offense and to bar anyone who violates visa terms from receiving immigration benefits.

Asylum claims

The Trump administration is proposing to tighten rules governing the asylum system, which it says is often exploited by illegal immigrants who don’t have legitimate claims of persecution in their home countries.

When an asylum officer determines that an applicant has a “credible fear” of persecution, the applicant receives a hearing before an immigration judge. These credible fear cases often take years to resolve due to the enormous backlog in immigration court.

Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge and current resident fellow at CIS, says the “credible fear” process is vulnerable to fraud because aliens are often released from detention before the court judge can hear their asylum claims and sent to a “non-detained court.”

“This gives an alien in expedited removal proceedings even more reason to make a fraudulent credible fear claim, because if that claim is successful, the alien can remain in the United States for a significant period of time before even having a hearing on his or her asylum claim, allowing the alien to work (which is usually the goal of an illegal entrant), build up equities, or become eligible for another immigration benefit,” he wrote in an April 2017 report.

To close the loophole, the White House wants to “elevate the threshold standard of proof in credible fear interviews” and impose penalties on applicants who file “frivolous, baseless, or fraudulent asylum applications.”

Unaccompanied children

Under current U.S. law, unaccompanied minors (UAC) from countries other than Canada and Mexico are processed into immigration court and then transferred to the the custody of the Department of Health and Human Service’s Office of Refugee Resettlement. HHS then hands the minor over to a sponsor in the U.S. while the case awaits a hearing before an immigration judge — a process that can take years.

Often times, UACs are resettled with sponsors who are themselves in the country illegally. Federal records obtained by the Associated Press show that 80 percent of the 71,000 mostly Central American children placed between February 2014 and September 2015 were sent to illegal immigrant sponsors.

The UAC program is also notorious for losing track of migrants once they’ve been assigned to immigration court. In a February 2017 study, the Center for Immigration Studies found that more than a third of completed UAC cases ended up with an order of removal issued in absentia, meaning the subject failed to appear for a court hearing.

The administration says current UAC policies encourage families in Central America to send their children on a dangerous journey to the U.S, knowing that the law does not allow the children to be immediately returned home.

“These loopholes in current law create a dramatic pull factor for additional illegal immigration and in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the apprehensions of UACs at our southern border,” the White House wrote in its statement on immigration principles.

EU Official: Europe Has No Strategy For Impending Wave of African Immigration,"Europe remains unprepared for a massive surge in immigration from Africa, according to a top European Union official.

Antonio Tajani, the president of the EU parliament, said overcrowding, poverty and war and will likely push “millions” of people from Africa to Europe in the coming decades. Ahead of the annual EU-Africa summit this week, Tajani called for improved coordination among EU members and a “Marshall Plan” for Africa to help stem the flow of migrants.

“Without a strategy we will have terrorism, illegal immigration, instability,” he said, according to Financial Times. “There are too many voices on Libya, on Africa.”

Immigration remains remains a potent issue in European politics, even as migrant flows have subsided from the height of the refugee crisis in 2015. Right-wing and immigration skeptic parties have enjoyed a surge in popularity in response to decisions by EU leaders, particularly German Chancellor Angela Merkel, to admit more than 1 million refugees and economic migrants from the Middle East since 2015.

Although the EU has since managed to reduce the flow of immigrants via the land route through Turkey, illegal immigration from Africa across the Mediterranean Sea is surging. The number of African migrants arriving via the Libya to Italy sea crossing is up 40 percent from 2016, EU officials said this summer. Most of the immigrants are coming from West African states such as Senegal, Guinea and Nigeria in order to escape economic hardship and overcrowding. (RELATED: EU Official: Migrants Still Pouring Into Europe, Only Now They Are Mainly Coming From Africa)

Demographic trends in Africa suggest the flow of migrants will intensify in the coming years. The continent-wide population is expected to double from 1.2 billion to 2.5 billion by 2050, with most of the growth concentrated in Africa’s least-developed countries, according to UN projections.

Africa’s pending population boom takes on additional significance for Europe in light of the wave of migrants and asylum seekers that have arrived in the continent in recent years. Many European countries have already exhausted their capacity to absorb the flow of immigrants, forcing even centrist, pro-immigration leaders to address the problems posed by continued migration from Africa and Asia.

‘First Stop To Hell’: Father Of Son Killed By Illegal Immigrant Slams Sanctuary States,"The father of a young man killed by an illegal immigrant slammed California’s sanctuary state law on “Fox and Friends” Wednesday, and said Democratic Governor Jerry Brown should go straight “to hell.”

“I wish he would get on the bullet train, first stop to hell, and he should get off and stay there,” Don Rosenberg said. “His concern for criminals, be they legal or not, is outrageous and has cost the live of many Californians.”

Rosenberg’s son, Drew Rosenberg, was killed by Roberto Galo in 2010, an illegal immigrant from Honduras. Drew was on his motorcycle in San Francisco, when Galo made a last-second turn and collided with him. Galo continuously ran over Drew’s body in an attempt to flee.

Galo was stopped by the San Francisco Police months earlier for driving without a license and going the wrong way down a one-way street. Instead of being arrested, Galo was cited and released, according to CBS News.

Rosenberg said the charge against Galo was originally vehicular homicide, but was then reduced to misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter. Galo only spent 43 days in jail for killing Drew, and was allowed to continue living in the United States for two more years until he was deported.

“When Obama was president we couldn’t even talk to anybody,” Rosenberg said. “There was no response whatsoever.”

He also expressed concern over a potential deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and said the government should fix the rest of the immigration system before addressing the issue.

“Our position is you don’t do anything about DACA until you take care of everything else with illegal immigration and I’m very nervous about that one,” Rosenberg said.

San Francisco is a sanctuary city, and recently came under fire for finding Jose Ines Garcia Zarate not guilty for the murder of Kate Steinle. A jury found the illegal immigrant not guilty on all counts, except for felony possession of a weapon. Steinle’s murder sparked a national debate about the legality of sanctuary cities and the politicization of immigration.

Rosenberg appeared in a television ad in May where he referenced Steinle and his son, saying “California should be a sanctuary, for Californians.” He appealed to Brown not to sign the bill making California a full sanctuary sate, but Senate Democrats passed the bill on a party line vote and Brown signed the bill into law in October.

REPORT: Chain Migration Pushed US Immigration Levels To Record High In 2016,"The U.S. system of extended family migration contributed to surge in immigration in 2016, with the number of entries likely surpassing a previous record set nearly two decades ago, according to a new analysis of Census Bureau data.

An estimated 1.8 million immigrants — legal and illegal — settled in the U.S. in 2016, about 53 percent more than in 2011, when a still-historically high 1.1 million people immigrated.

The 2016 figure comes courtesy of a report from the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), which crunched recently released data from the American Community Survey for the first six months of 2016, and then projected a full-year total based on historical patterns. The total number of immigrants includes green card holders, long-term “temporary” visitors like guest workers and foreign students, new asylum seekers, and illegal immigrants.

As the CIS analysis shows, immigration has rebounded from a recent low point in 2011, reaching a level not seen even during the era of mass immigration through Ellis Island in the early 20th century. The number of immigrants entering the U.S. has risen every year since 2011, and nearly 14 million immigrants settled here in the decade between 2006 and 2016, according to the CIS report.

“These dramatic increases are truly extraordinary,” said Steven Camarota, the director of research at CIS. “Our generous legal immigration system allows in a huge number of immigrants and then permits them to sponsor their relatives causing a multiplier effect.”

Camarota and co-author Karen Zeigler attribute the recent surge in immigration to policies for long-term temporary visa holders, who are able to adjust status to permanent residency, and new green card holders. Under U.S. system of extended-family immigration — or chain migration — these recent arrivals can sponsor relatives for immigrant visas of their own.

Critics of the system say it allows too much immigration on the basis of family ties alone, instead of potential economic contributions or likelihood of assimilation. About 70 percent of all immigrants admitted to the U.S. over the last decade were chain migration immigrants.

Chain migration has come under closer scrutiny in recent months, after immigration officials revealed that the suspects in several terror attacks came to the U.S. on extended family visas. The Trump administration has called for tighter controls on chain migration, largely on the basis of security concerns. (RELATED: DHS: Suspects In Terror-Related Crimes Came To US Through Chain Migration)

The national security vulnerability built into chain migration is just one reason to consider reforming immigration laws, Camarota says. He also points to the fiscal burden imposed by very high levels of immigration on the U.S. education and welfare systems.

“The numbers have profound implications for American schools, taxpayers, workers as well as our culture and national security,” he said. “Yet the whole system is allowed to run largely on autopilot with few asking whether any of this makes sense for our country

Poll: 72 Percent Of Hispanics Want Merit-Based Immigration Over Chain Migration,"While Democratic politicians have attacked President Trump as racist for his plan to move America away from a family-based chain migration system and towards a merit-based immigration system, it turns out that Hispanic voters agree with the president.

Just under three-quarters of Hispanic voters say that America’s immigration system should be merit-based rather than family-based, according to a recent Harvard-Harris poll.

The survey found that 72 percent of Hispanic voters say immigration policy “should be based on a person’s ability to contribute to America as measured by their education and skills,” rather than “based on a person having relatives in the U.S.”

Just 28 percent said that immigration should be family-based. The poll also found that 81 percent of Hispanic voters say they prefer a secure border over “basically open borders.”

The poll’s findings are bad news for Democrats who have sought to portray President Trump as racist for his immigration proposals.

When Arianna Huffington Sounded More Extreme Than Donald Trump On Immigration,"It’s not necessarily news that Arianna Huffington once held conservative views, but a clip from “Firing Line” with William F. Buckley Jr. discovered by The Daily Caller News Foundation shows the media entrepreneur and Huffington Post cofounder once took far more radical positions on the issue of immigration and multiculturalism than any prominent voice in today’s Republican Party.

Huffington appears to take the most aggressive positions on the question of immigration throughout the debate. While others on the anti-immigration side of the panel, like far-right author Peter Brimelow, focus on specific data like census numbers, Huffington discusses deeper questions like American identity in seemingly racial terms, and says the United States can no longer “assimilate immigrants.”

“The last 30 years have changed our history and made us a kind of gray society,” Huffington says at one point during the two-hour debate.

The episode, which aired June 6, 1995, was uploaded in 2017 to YouTube as part of the Hoover Institute’s “Firing Line” archive project and features a number of prominent pundits and advocates, including Federation for American Immigration Reform President Daniel Stein, Brimelow, scholar Leon Botstein, former New York City Mayor Ed Koch, National Immigration Forum Executive Director Frank Sharry and former American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Executive Director Ira Glasser.

Hosted at Bard College, the episode revolves around the question “Should We Drastically Reduce Immigration?” with Brimelow, Huffington and Stein taking the affirmative and Koch, Sharry and Glasser disagreeing.

Throughout the debate, Brimelow and Huffington share a clear ideological affinity. At the beginning of the second hour, even Buckley notes how Huffington “agrees a great deal” with the then-Forbes columnist and National Review editor.

“[Many immigration advocates are] ignoring the fact of the millions of people who have been on welfare who have been a burden on the already over-burdened services provided by California,” Huffington says about the surge in illegal and legal immigration in California. “And really anybody who talks to the underclass, that you mentioned, in California, knows they feel very resentful and if we want to avoid an explosion of racism that we should avoid, we need to take care of the problem now.”

WATCH:

The panelists also debated bilingual students in American public schools, which both Huffington and Brimelow dismiss as antithetical to the nation’s values.

“The census bureau is reporting now that about a third [of those] who came since 1980 and became citizens told the 1990 census that they couldn’t speak English,” Brimelow says, “although as you know, until 1990 they were supposed to speak English to become citizens. The system has collapsed.”

Later in the debate, Huffington attacks the “liberal policies” she believes are changing America’s cultural fabric:

“The problem is that many liberals, like Leon [Botstein], always say the same thing: Bilingual education isn’t working, let’s try a better policy. Let’s try a better affirmative action, let’s try better welfare policies. At what point, and after how many trillions of dollars have been spent, and after how many lives have been destroyed, are you going to be prepared to say that these things don’t work? Period. There’s nothing better to be done about it, let’s just scratch them.”

WATCH:

Huffington’s appearance on “Firing Line” is in stark contrast to the politics she espouses today. Even 11 years ago in 2007, Huffington discussed her experience immigrating to both the United Kingdom and eventually to the United States in a video for the progressive activist group the Courage Campaign.

WATCH:

Ironically, Huffington talks about the anxieties she faced having an accent in a foreign country and eventually “embraced” it because it was “a part of my identity.”

“America is a nation of immigrants. You cannot imagine America separate from the whole story immigration to this country because that was the birth of this country. Very often, our politicians find it easy to appeal to the darkest part of our nature by appealing to the anti-immigrant feeling. They look for scapegoats,” she said.

Thousands Of Protesters March In Germany Against Angela Merkel’s Immigration Policy,"Thousands of protesters marched in Germany on Saturday night to protest German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s immigration policy after a man was allegedly killed by two migrants.

Around 4,500 people marched to protest Merkel’s migration policy in the eastern German city of Chemnitz following the death of Daniel Hillig, 35, who was allegedly stabbed to death by two migrants — one Syrian, the other Iraqi — Aug. 26, the Daily Mail reported. Merkel let in more than 1 million migrants since starting her open door migration policy in 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported.

The protest, called the “mourning march,” was organized by the right-wing, anti-immigration party the Alternative for Germany and the anti-Islam movement PEGIDA, France24 reported. The protesters wore dark suits and carried white roses in remembrance of the victim. The protesters also carried photos of other people allegedly killed from refugee violence.

Protesters also waved the German flag and sang the national anthem. (RELATED: German Cabinet Minister Says ‘Islam Doesn’t Belong To Germany’)

“Merkel must go!” the protesters chanted.

Around 2,500 people from Germany’s left marched in support of Merkel Saturday. The protesters used the slogan the “Heart instead of Hate.” Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas from the center-left Social Democrats party helped organize the pro-immigration protest.

Neo-Nazis led a separate protest Monday causing a stir after making “Heil Hitler” salutes, CBS News reported.

Twitter Bans Center For Immigration Studies From Promoting Tweets About Illegal Aliens,"Twitter would not allow the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) to promote tweets for advertisement purposes about illegal aliens Tuesday, the CIS confirmed to The Daily Caller News Foundation.

CIS Executive Director Mark Krikorian called attention to the promotion ban in a tweet at 10:08 a.m. on Tuesday after CIS could not promote a tweet that included TheDCNF’s obtained video of trespassers crossing the southwest border through a rancher’s farm in a tweet on Monday at 5:53 a.m. (RELATED: 25 Straight Minutes Of Illegal Aliens Crossing Into US Through Arizona Ranch)

“Twitter just rejected paid promotion of the tweet below, saying: ‘This determination is based on the following Twitter Ads policy: Hateful Content’,” Krikorian tweeted. “It’s because it contains the phrase ‘illegal alien’, which @TwitterAdsHelp deems unacceptable.”

“1/ Twitter is not allowing us to promote any tweets including the phrase ‘illegal alien(s)’, citing it as Hateful Content,” CIS tweeted Tuesday. “However, the phrase ‘illegal aliens’ has been used in both federal law and by the Supreme Court.”

CIS claimed that three other tweets, spanning from Sept. 6 to Sept. 11, were rejected from receiving promotion, though many other tweets they had were approved, CIS said in a statement Sept. 12. The four tweets that could not get promoted, but are still on Twitter, contained the terms “alien,” “illegal alien” or “criminal alien” along with reference to law enforcement.

“Twitter advertises that the ads ‘can get you more likes, amplify your message, and get more people talking about the things that matter to you most — your cause, project, business, or brand,” CIS said in the statement. “This is exactly why the Center selected these specific tweets to be placed as ads.”

CIS is a non-profit organization that focuses on providing information on the “social, economic, environmental, security, and fiscal consequences of legal and illegal immigration,” to policymakers, academics, members of the news media and citizens, according to the organization’s website.

“We don’t have a comment. For background, our ads policies are enforced dispassionately and are detailed here for all advertisers,” Twitter said in response to a request for comment.

ICE: More Than A Quarter Of Illegal Immigrant Families In Alternative To Detention Skip Court Hearings,"A senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official told lawmakers that “alternatives to detention” do not have a good record of ensuring migrant families show up at court hearings.

The absconder rate for families in ATD was 28 percent for the first 10 months of FY2018, according to ICE official Matthew Albence.

The Trump administration says the high rate of no-shows is one reason why the Flores Settlement Agreement should be overturned.

A significant share of illegal immigrant families released from federal detention have failed to show up for their immigration court hearings this year, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said Tuesday.

The family units in question are placed in programs collectively known as alternatives to detention (ATD), which allow people with pending deportation cases to avoid detention in favor of some other non-custodial monitoring. Alternatives include community monitoring through nonprofit organizations and GPS tracking with ankle or wrist bracelets.

ATD programs are frequently touted as a humane and cost-saving way to monitor migrant families while they await a decision on their asylum claims, a process that can take years. But ATD often leads to family units’ skipping immigration court hearings and, ultimately, ignoring removal orders issued in absentia, according to Matthew Albence, the executive associate director of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations Division.

Between Oct. 1, 2017 and July 31, 2018 — the first 10 months of fiscal year 2018 — the absconder rate for family units in ATD was 28 percent, Albence said in prepared testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. That was significantly higher than individuals in ATD, who had an absconder rate of about 16 percent over the same time period, Albence said.

Tuesday’s Senate hearing centered on the Flores Settlement Agreement, a federal court order that governs detention policy for unaccompanied alien children and people arrested while traveling in family units. Under Flores, the government cannot keep migrant children detained with their parents for more than 20 days, forcing immigration officials to either separate families or release them pending a court date.

The Trump administration is seeking to abrogate Flores, arguing that its special treatment of families creates a “pull factor” for illegal immigration. After federal Judge Dolly Gee denied the government’s bid to revise her previous Flores rulings earlier this summer, the Trump administration proposed regulatory changes that would make it easier to keep families in detention for the entirely of their immigration court proceedings. (RELATED: Illegal Immigration By Family Units Surges To Highest-Ever August Total)

Immigration activists and civil rights groups say the administration’s focus on family detention is misplaced because ATD programs have proven effective at getting migrant families to comply with immigration court orders. As evidence, they frequently cite an Obama administration initiative known as the Family Case Management Program, in which families in certain cities were released and monitored by contracted social workers.

The contractor that administered the program claimed 99 percent of the families under its watch successfully attended their court appearances and ICE check-ins, according to a November 2017 Department of Homeland Security Inspector General report.

However, the duration of the pilot program was much shorter than the average time it takes to complete a case in immigration courts’ “non-detained” docket. That means the high success rate only covered a “very short portion” of the full timeline of the participants’ removal and asylum cases, according to Dan Cadman, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies.

“We don’t know, then, whether or not they did, or will, actually show up for removal … when ordered,” Cadman wrote in a June report. “After all, it’s one thing to continue reporting to your NGO contact as long as there is hope of relief from deportation, but when that hope evaporates, are they really going to stick around and report for their removal? It’s doubtful.”

Migrant families in ATD typically linger for years in immigration proceedings because they are placed in the non-detained docket, which has a backlog of more than 700,000 cases, according to Albence. By contrast, illegal immigrants in detention have an average length of stay of about 40 days before their cases are adjudicated either way, he said.

MIT Study: The Number Of Illegal Immigrants Could Be Double Previous Estimates,"The true number of illegal immigrants living in the U.S. — long a subject of intense debate — could be twice as high as commonly accepted figures, according to a study by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher.

The study published Friday by Mohammad Fazel-Zarandi, a senior lecturer at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, estimates there are about 22.1 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. today. Most frequently cited estimates put the number between 11 and 12 million.

Even the lower bound of the MIT study’s range, 16.7 million, is nearly 50 percent higher than the 11.3 million estimated by the Pew Research Center for 2016.

Such a wide discrepancy is explained by deficiencies in the methods researchers have used to arrive at previous estimates, according to Fazel-Zarandi and his co-authors, Edward Kaplan and Jonathan Feinstein of Yale University. In the past, researchers typically extrapolated the total number of illegal immigrants from population surveys and legal immigration records.

Fazel-Zarandi and his colleagues used mathematical modeling based on “operational data” — border apprehensions, deportations, visa overstays and demographic data — to arrive at their estimate. The approach eliminated the uncertainty found in methods that rely on surveys, which are a less reliable gauge of the illegal immigrant population, according to the researchers.

“It’s very likely that undocumented immigrants are more difficult to locate and survey than other foreign-born residents, and if contacted, they might be inclined to misreport their country of origin, citizenship, and number of household residents fearing the legal consequences of revealing their status,” Fazel-Zarandi in a news release. “Any of these circumstances would lead to underestimating the true number of unauthorized immigrants.”

The MIT study, which spans 1990 to 2016, also used newly available arrest data to estimate the number of illegal border crossings during that time period. It found the number of illegal immigrants coming into the U.S. rose steadily throughout the 1990s, peaked around 2008, and has leveled off and stabilized since then. (RELATED: Illegal Immigration By Families Surges To Highest-Ever August Total)

If corroborated, the numbers reported in the MIT study could have major implications for immigration policy under the Trump administration, which has made a crackdown on illegal immigration a centerpiece of its agenda. President Donald Trump has repeatedly painted illegal immigration as threat to public safety and the economic well-being of American workers, while administration critics contend he is exaggerating the scope of the problem.

“Debates about the amount of resources to devote to this population and the relative benefits and disadvantages of alternative policies — including deportation, amnesty, and border control — depend greatly on having a correct estimate,” Fazel-Zarandi said. “The number sets the scale.”

Some immigration experts contend the MIT-Yale study’s estimates are the result of flawed methodology. The authors failed to account for circulatory migration patterns in the 1990s, overestimating the number of people who arrived in the U.S. illegally and remained in the country, according to the Migration Policy Institute.

“In this accounting method, any error in estimating border crossers or those who leave the country … gets compounded over time, leading their mistakes to snowball,” MPI wrote in a formal response published in the same academic journal that published the MIT-Yale study. “By the time they build their estimate of the unauthorized population in 2000, their number is far higher than could be validated by any other means.”

OPINION: Barring Immigrants Who Are Likely To Become Public Charges Is Good Policy,"Immigration is a public policy, but that reality is largely ignored in the ongoing debate. Ideally, public policies are supposed to serve identifiable public interests. At a very minimum, they are expected to do no harm.

Recent data indicate that about half of all immigrant households in the United States rely on at least one form of public assistance to meet their basic needs. That compares with about 30 percent of native households.

Given that the foreign-born population of the United States now stands at about 45 million people, the disproportional reliance of immigrants on public assistance falls way short of the minimal expectation that our policies do no harm.

The Trump administration is undertaking an effort to limit further damage by enforcing laws that have been on the books, in form or another, since 1882 and reaffirmed by Congress as recently as 1996.

Last month, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a proposal to change how the public charge rule is applied to prospective immigrants.

According to DHS, a public charge refers to a person “who is likely to become primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either the receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or institutionalization for long-term care at government expense.”

The DHS proposal attempts to more realistically define the sorts of programs that would categorize immigrants, or prospective immigrants, as being primarily dependent on the government to meet basic needs.

Under the proposed rule, very expensive public programs like Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicare Part D, and some housing programs would be added to the list. People who are unlikely to be able to afford food, basic medical care or a place to live can be reasonably defined as public charges.

Predictably, advocates who view immigration solely from the perspective of the immigrants themselves argue that the proposed rule change amounts to punishing people for being poor. What is ignored, however, is that immigration is not a right but a privilege.

Withholding a benefit, based on objective criteria (such as someone’s likelihood to be self-sufficient) is not a punishment. It is a reasonable step to protect public interest and prudent stewardship of public benefit programs that many Americans rely on.

Immigration presents an asymmetrical relationship between immigrants and the receiving society. Immigration, by definition, always benefits immigrants. Nobody leaves their homeland and settles in another country unless it serves a substantial interest. And if that interest is not served, chances are they will not stay.

It does not automatically follow, however, that the opposite is true. Immigration may (and often does) benefit the receiving society. But it also may not (and often does not) benefit the greater good of the receiving society.

Moreover, immigrants whose expectations are not being met by the United States can essentially fire us by returning to their homelands, but we cannot fire them. As such, the United States, like every immigrant-receiving nation, has a legitimate and compelling interest to employ objective criteria for selecting who comes here.

A big part of the problem that has created the need for the new DHS rule is our fatally flawed family chain-migration policy, which bestows benefits on people because they are lucky enough to be related to someone else who arrived recently while shutting out others who objectively have more to contribute.

Adopting a merit-based immigration system would be fairer to prospective immigrants and certainly more beneficial to American society.

We must stop viewing immigration as a debt we owe to our immigrant ancestors, but rather as a trust we owe to current and future generations of Americans. When half of the unprecedented number of immigrants living in our country rely on public assistance for their basic needs, we are doing a disservice to Americans who rely on these programs, and those who have to pay for them.

The long-standing laws against the admission of people who are likely to become public charges were adopted for good reason.

In legislation enacted in 1996, Congress asserted that there is “a compelling government interest to enact new rules for eligibility and sponsorship agreements in order to assure that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy.”

The new rules proposed by DHS would carry out this expressed will of Congress and the American people.

"OPINION: Understand The Cost Of Trump’s Immigration Policies, And Vote With Your Wallet","The president of the United States exercises significant fiscal power in signing an executive order, and last year, President Trump signed more than any president in a quarter century.

What are the financial costs of the president’s immigration policies that are being implemented without review and approval from Congress? How shall we grade the president on his spending choices? Do his financial expenditures meet your expectations and budget priorities?

You should care about this. It is your money being spent.

Trump says we need to spend more to stop the MS-13 criminal gang from entering the United States, but he is shelling out billions of your hard-earned tax dollars targeting foreign national students, engineers, postdoctoral researchers, scientists and entrepreneurs.

He is using your money to deport parents with U.S. citizen children and spouses, even if they have no criminal record; we are paying for it and failing to receive the return that was promised. The costs are staggering in taxpayer contributions, lost human capital and lost opportunity.

If you do nothing else, consider this when you vote:

In alignment with Trump’s policy of stepping up immigrant detentions, a record-smashing 13,000 children are now in federal custody (a fivefold increase over last year). Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reports it has cost upwards of $775 per bed each day to keep these children locked up.

Some may applaud the president’s effort to not let a single child be released until the fullest possible extent of misery has been doled out, but I say this is nuts.

Does HHS spending $458 million of your money in a year to pay a contractor to incarcerate children between the ages of six months and 17 years make any sense? Why is this a good thing for America? What is the benefit to our national security?

It gets worse.

Our president has decided to end Temporary Protected Status for hundreds of thousands of Latinos and Haitians legally residing in the United States. He is using DACA recipients as pawns, threatening to deport millions of Dreamers if he does not get his wall.

The Immigrant Legal Resource Center at Harvard Law School found that deporting all Salvadoran, Honduran and Haitian TPS holders would cost taxpayers $3.1 billion, resulting in a $6.9 billion reduction to Social Security and Medicare contributions and lead to a $45.2 billion reduction in GDP over a decade.

The conservative CATO Institute estimates that ending DACA would cost our economy another $200 billion.

Disturbing? Consider this: in June, Trump stated that undocumented immigrants should be immediately returned “from where they came” with “no judges or court cases.” What? The Fifth Amendment states that “no person … shall be … deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.”

The Fourteenth Amendment grants to any person within the jurisdiction of the United States “the equal protection of the laws.”

Over the past six months, the president and his senior advisor Stephen Miller, who reportedly enjoyed watching children ripped from parents’ arms at the border, have intentionally violated the Constitution by deporting asylum seekers without a hearing; by separating families without due process; and by committing intentional infliction of emotional distress without providing equal protection of the laws.

Their strategy is backfiring, costing taxpayers millions as lawsuits are being filed to force President Trump to respect the Constitution, which he took an oath to do.

All of this doesn’t happen in a vacuum. The Trump administration just diverted $260 million from cancer research, HIV/AIDS prevention, and the Medicare and Medicaid programs to cover the costs of the president’s immigration agenda.

This must be part of Trump’s “fantastic,” “incredible,” “huge,” financial wisdom and decision-making, which he says are taking our country to new heights.

In reality, this is the kind of lip service a billionaire president pays to the everyday people who fund an immigration agenda grounded in mean-spiritedness, deception, and fiscal insanity — all to recruit and pacify the worst elements of our society.

So, if nothing else, think of your wallet when you vote.

American University Students Try And Guess Who Said What About Immigration,"Students at American University in Washington, D.C., tried to guess who said what about immigration to The Daily Caller News Foundation.

Most of the students guessed the quotes read to them came from President Donald Trump. The quotes actually came from former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, as well as former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Many students were surprised to find today’s Democrats speaking with such enthusiasm when it came to cracking down on illegal immigration only two decades ago.

“Negative immigration quotes are only associated with the Republican administration or Donald Trump administration,” a young woman told TheDCNF. (RELATED: MAGA Hats Vs. Swastikas: Which Is Worse? We Asked And They Compared Trump To Hitler)

REPORT: Trump Will Sign Order To Change Asylum Rules Ahead Of Caravan Arrival,"President Donald Trump is expected to sign a directive that will bar migrants who cross the U.S. border illegally from applying for asylum after they are detained by immigration authorities, according to U.S. officials.

Trump could sign the order as early as Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday night, citing administration officials. Trump promised on Nov. 1 to implement sweeping changes to asylum rules before the arrival of a caravan of Central American migrants traveling through Mexico with the aim of applying for asylum in the U.S.

The directive under consideration requires asylum seekers to make their claims at a port of entry along the border, according to TheWSJ report. Those who cross illegally and turn themselves into border agents will be deemed ineligible for asylum.

Under current law, a migrant can request asylum if he is in U.S. territory, regardless of how he got there. If the asylum seeker is found to have a “credible fear” of persecution in his home country, he is permitted to remain in the U.S. as he waits for his case to play out in immigration court, a process that can take months or years. (RELATED: ‘Non-Meritorious’ Asylum Seekers From Central American Crowd Out Legitimate Applicants)

The Trump administration argues U.S. policy encourages people who don’t meet the legal standard for asylum to cross the border illegally, in hopes they will get credible fear status and be allowed to stay. As evidence, administration officials point to the wide disparity between credible fear pass rates, which are often above 80 percent for Central American asylum seekers, and ultimately successful asylum claims, which are well below 20 percent for the same demographic.

Trump’s impending directive comes after he ordered thousands of active duty troops to the southwest border, saying they were needed to help law enforcement agents deal with the “invasion” of illegal immigrants. As of early November, roughly 8,000 troops were deployed to Texas, Arizona and California and were mostly shoring up border security infrastructure and laying barbed wire.

Prior to Trump’s asylum order, the Department of Homeland Security had already been telling asylum seekers to make their claims at ports of entry, saying it was the only legal way to do so. Administration officials say the new directive is intended to enable more orderly processing of asylum claims and more efficient allocation of resources at the border, according to The WSJ report.

Critics say border authorities have an unofficial policy of “metering” — essentially creating long lines at the ports of entry by admitting just a handful of asylum seekers each day.

Kris Kobach Sends A Powerful Message To Those Who Say Our Immigration System Is Broken,"Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach on Wednesday defended current immigration law saying that, if it were enforced, it could “reinforce our rule of law in this country” when it comes to border security.

WATCH:

“One of the things I think we need to consider now is something that Congress wisely put in federal law back in 1996,” Kobach told “Tucker Carlson Tonight” guest host Mark Steyn. “It’s not too often you use the word ‘wisely’ when talking about Congress, but they actually planned ahead, and they said in federal statute if ever there is a mass influx of aliens at our border the president has the authority — the secretary of homeland security has the authority — to call up state and local police to help repel this invasion or this influx. And right now that’s necessary because ICE agents and border patrol agents who I’ve spoken to say they are overwhelmed.”

Steyn, familiar with the issue, pointed out that there would be no need to deputize local law enforcement in precincts that disagree with Trump administration policy. (RELATED: Tucker Asked Jorge Ramos How Many Caravan Migrants He Planned To Take In – Things Got Awkward Fast)

“I guarantee that if President Trump made a national appeal to sheriff’s departments across the country,” Kobach said. “I guarantee that there would be hundreds of deputies, hundreds of sheriff’s departments saying yes, we will help.”

Steyn pointed out the “obvious contradiction” in highly-enforced laws governing Americans and border laws, which are often sparsely enforced at best.

Stating that the approaching caravans are a “general mix of illegal aliens,” not a “mass of people who are fleeing oppression,” Kobach said that most will “do what they were planning on anyway” and sneak across when they realize they are unlikely to get asylum.

“There are actually more immigration laws than any functioning society would need,” Steyn pointed out. “It’s the fact that there’s not the political will to enforce the immigration laws that’s the issue.”

Kobach agreed. “We often hear this cop-out, ‘Oh, our immigration laws are broken.’ No, they’re not broken. If you actually read them, Congress over the many decades that we’ve had these laws has inserted a lot of really good provisions in there that if we have the will to actually use them, we could reinforce our rule of law in this country.”

Trump Plans To Get Even Tougher On Illegal Immigration,"President Donald Trump is preparing to roll out new executive orders to help the government better manage the record influx of illegal immigration at the southern border.

The White House is looking to make it more difficult for low-skilled migrants to gain entry into the U.S. while making it easier for high-skilled migrants who are more likely to be self-sufficient, according to sources who spoke with Axios. The administration also wants to make it harder for asylum seekers to claim fear of returning to their home country, and it wants the ability to detain migrant children longer than the current 20-day limit.

The proposed changes come after Trump ousted Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and pulled Ron Vitiello’s nomination to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The president was frustrated with Nielsen’s handling of the immigration crisis at the southern border, and he told reporters he nixed Vitiello’s nomination because he wants to go in a “tougher direction.”

“[Vitiello is] a good man,” the president told reporters on Friday. “But we’re going in a tougher direction. We want to go in a tougher direction.”

Other immigration overhauls are also under consideration.

The president’s aides have reportedly expressed interest in ending birthright citizenship, deploying more troops at the U.S.-Mexico border, expediting wall construction, and closing ports of entry along the border. Senior administration officials claimed to the New York Times that Trump has also expressed interest repeatedly in restarting family separation.

Trump, under intense scrutiny from progressive groups, ended family separation in June 2018. A revamped version of this policy reportedly being discussed in the White House is known as “binary choice.” The proposal would give illegal migrant parents a choice: voluntarily allow their kids to be separated from them, or waive their protections so they can be detained together. (RELATED: Who Is Kevin McAleenan, The Upcoming Leader Of Homeland Security?)

All of these policy proposals are expected to face intense challenges in the courtroom — a place where the administration’s immigration agenda recently faced a setback.

A federal judge in San Francisco temporarily blocked Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” directive, a policy that mandates asylum seekers to wait in Mexico as their claims run through the immigration court system. However, the ruling is on hold for only several days and is subject to change.

Lindsey Graham’s Immigration Bill Aims To Fix The Issues Fueling The Border Crisis,"South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham introduced an immigration bill that addresses numerous issues law enforcement officials say are driving the U.S.-Mexico border crisis.

Graham outlined the four main points of his proposal during a Wednesday press conference, addressing the “broken and outdated” immigration laws that attracts illegal immigration from Central America. Overall, the bill calls for doubling the number of immigration judges, allowing those in ICE custody to be held for as long as 100 days, more readily deport unaccompanied children, and require those seeking asylum to do so in their home countries.

“What I’m trying to do is explain how to stop the flow from Central America, to regain control of our border, and stop a humanitarian crisis that I think is just going to get worse over time,” Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said during the press conference.

Migrant children, whether they arrive at the border alone or with a family, cannot be detained for longer than 20 days. Leaders within the Department of Homeland Security have long urged Congress to extend this timeline, claiming it forces them to release illegal migrants into the U.S. while their cases are process. An extension to 100 days, Graham argues, would alleviate this issue.

The bill would also dramatically change the process for asylum seekers.

Currently, thousands of Central Americans are reaching the U.S. border and applying for asylum — clogging U.S. immigration courts and essentially allowing many applicants to enter the country unabated as they wait for their cases to be adjudicated. Graham’s bill would mandate that applicants make their claims at American consulates in their home countries. He added that a facility in Mexico could possibly be established as well.

The proposal would also treat unaccompanied minors from noncontiguous countries the same as those from Canada and Mexico, making it much easier to deport them in a timely manner. The South Carolina Republican also wants to add 500 new immigration judges, bringing relief to a system that is dramatically backlogged with around 900,000 applicants. (RELATED: Thousands Booted Out Of US Under Trump’s ‘Remain In Mexico’ Policy)

“To those who want to give more money to Central America: It won’t stop the problem. They’re going to keep coming to the United States because life is better here than it is there, and no amount of money is going to stop people from coming,” Graham stated.

“If you do these four things, then the incentives that’s created by our laws will cease to exist,” he went on. “This humanitarian disaster will begin to repair itself.”

DHS Inks Deal With Guatemala To Combat Immigration Crisis,"U.S. and Guatemalan officials signed an agreement Tuesday that aims to stem the flow of illegal migrants leaving the Central American country en masse.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan signed a Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) on Tuesday alongside his counterparts in the Guatemalan government. The MOC calls on Guatemala to better enforce its borders, reducing the number U.S.-bound immigrants who leave the country illegally.

In return, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has agreed to more cooperation with Guatemala regarding drug and human trafficking issues.

“I am proud to sign this agreement with Minister Enrique Antonio Degenhart,” McAleenan stated Tuesday. “Through our continued collaboration and partnership, the U.S. and Guatemala are formalizing a number of initiatives to improve the lives and security of our respective citizens by combating human trafficking and the smuggling of illegal goods, helping to limit ‘push’ factors that encourage dangerous irregular migration to the U.S., perpetuating the ongoing crisis at our border.”

The agreement will target the operation of transnational criminal organizations. Much of their involvement in human and drug smuggling contributes to illegal immigration.

The MOC signing kicked off McAleenan’s four-day trip in the Northern Triangle, where he will meet with leaders in the region to find solutions to the immigration crisis. The acting secretary is expected to finish his trip by Thursday.

The Northern Triangle nations of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, have been the epicenter of the U.S. border emergency.

McAleenan revealed earlier in May that over 1% of the population of Honduras and Guatemala has left for the U.S. since September 2018. Many of the people remaining in these impoverished countries still wish to leave. A survey in Guatemala found nearly 40% of respondents wanted to emigrate, with a vast majority of those choosing the U.S. as their destination.

Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants reach the U.S.-Mexico border every month. April marked the second consecutive month where migrant encounters with Border Patrol topped 100,000. Migrant apprehensions have continually risen since January.

A large bulk of the migrants are family units and unaccompanied minors from the Northern Triangle, wreaking havoc on a U.S. system designed to handle only adult Mexican nationals. DHS leaders have begged Congress for more money to fund border operations, and for changes to immigration laws that would better reflect the demographics of the current immigrants. (RELATED: Border Patrol Creating A New Position To Stymie The Immigration Crisis)

“Family units have reached a record level: 59% so far this month of our total crossings on the border,” McAleenan told lawmakers earlier in May about the crisis. “That is a direct response to the vulnerability in our legal framework.”

Trump Officially Taps Ken Cuccinelli To Lead Citizenship And Immigration Services,"Former GOP Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli officially began leading the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on Monday, making him a key player in the Trump administration’s immigration agenda.

“I am honored to be given the opportunity to lead U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services at this critical time and serve alongside this agency’s dedicated workforce,” Cuccinelli said in a Monday statement distributed by the agency. “USCIS has the extraordinary responsibility to administer and protect the integrity of our nation’s lawful immigration system. Our nation has the most generous legal immigration system in the world and we must zealously safeguard its promise for those who lawfully come here.”

USCIS, an agency with in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is tasked with managing the country’s legal immigration system.

Cuccinelli is expected to hit the ground running on a number of policies backed by the White House — such as finalizing the public charge rule, which blocks visa applicants who are determined to be likely dependent on public safety net programs, and implementing reforms to the country’s guest-worker program.

The now-acting director of the agency has long been known as an immigration hardliner. He has publicly opposed birthright citizenship and unemployment benefits for immigrants. Cuccinelli’s promotion is the latest in President Donald Trump’s overhaul of top positions within DHS, where he aims to go in a “tougher” direction on immigration policy.

Trump previously considered forming an “immigration czar” position and appointing Cuccinelli to it. However, it was revealed in May that the president would instead give then-USCIS Director Lee Francis Cissna the boot and replace him with Cuccinelli. Trump had become aggravated with Cissna’s slow walk of immigration reforms, and officials within the agency told The Daily Caller that Cissna’s leadership was to blame for the lack of progress.

While Cuccinelli enjoys support from immigration hardliners within the Trump administration and a cadre of conservative activists, the same can’t be said for Senate GOP leadership. (RELATED: ‘First Time We’ve Heard Anything Like This’: DHS Chief Applauds Immigration Deal With Mexico)

Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell has stood opposed to Cuccinelli’s appointment to a DHS position for months. The Kentucky Republican blames him for endorsing a number of hard-right GOP Senate candidates who went on to lose their general elections to Democrats. Their rivalry reached a peak when Cuccinelli led an effort to oust McConnell in the 2014 primary elections.

"Josh Hawley Tears Congress Apart For ‘Refusal’ To Address Immigration Crisis, Child Smuggling Rings","Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley vehemently criticized lawmakers for failing to address one of the darkest results to emerge from the current immigration crisis: child smuggling rings.

“It seems to me that the exploitation of children by cartels, human smugglers on the scale that you’re describing is absolutely unbelievable, and quite frankly, the refusal of this Congress to act to do something about this humanitarian crisis is absolutely unbelievable and absolutely indefensible,” Hawley said during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday.

The hearing featured testimony from Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan. The DHS chief broke down how the immigration crisis is escalating and how Congress must make take action in order for the country to manage the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants reaching the U.S.-Mexico border.

Thousands of migrants are appearing with a child, he said, knowing full well that current U.S. laws will allow them to be released out of detention before their case can be processed.

“In May, we had 88,000 families cross the border. That’s incentivized by the fact that they can’t be held for the full court proceeding,” the acting secretary told the committee. “It’s not a great leap of imagination to think that people might try to exploit that fact and bring a child who’s not their own — maybe even the same child more than once.”

McAleenan said his agency has uncovered three “significant” child smuggling operations in recent time. The same children are used numerous times by smugglers to bring in different migrants. In one child smuggling ring, eight children were used to bring 36 different adults into the U.S.

In another notable example given during the hearing, a 51-year-old man who was subject to a DNA test admitted to law enforcement that he actually wasn’t related to the six-month-old child he brought along with him. That man, in fact, had paid roughly $80 to rent the baby.

“They advertise it. They promote it,” McAleenan said of migrant smugglers who promote their services to locals. “It’s ubiquitous in Central America – advertisements on radio, advertisements on social media. … This is a very well-known fact.”

Hawley, a first-term senator, made the case that the immigration crisis was more than just innocent people in search of a better life.

“We’ve heard it said that crossing across the southern border is an ‘act of love,’ but for the cartels, it’s an opportunity for exploitation of children. It’s an opportunity to cash in,” Hawley said. “It is about profit. It is about money. It’s about their criminal enterprise.”

Hawley then ripped Congress for its “refusal” to pass legislation that would fix the humanitarian crisis.

“The idea that you would have children recycled, purchased, used for profit by these cartels and by these smuggling rings and that this Congress would sit by and say, ‘We’re just not going to do anything. There really is no crisis. There’s nothing we can agree on,’ is absolutely unbelievable to me,” he stated. (RELATED: House Democrats Appeal Court Ruling That Rejected Their Bid To Stop Trump’s Wall)

“It is the worst failure of leadership that I can think of,” Hawley said.

African Asylum Seekers Stuck In Mexico ‘Not Happy’ With US Immigration System,"African migrants are expressing frustration over the Trump administration’s metering policy, which caps the number of asylum seekers who can enter the U.S. each day.

“We are not happy with the U.S. system, especially for the fact that you see that the number is not moving. Very few people are taken,” Luis, a migrant from Cameroon, said to the Los Angeles Times. “If you see people jumping over the river, it is because they are tired of staying here.”

Luis and hundreds of other migrants have set up camp in the Mexican border town of Ciudad Acuna as they wait for their turn to cross the border and lodge an asylum claim in the U.S. He is also one of a growing number of African migrants who have traveled thousands of miles to reach the U.S.-Mexico border — a perplexing phenomenon as the immigration crisis has largely been made up of families and children from Central American.

Border Patrol is reporting a “dramatic” rise in the number of African migrants appearing before agents. More than 500 individuals from the continent were apprehended in the Del Rio Sector alone between May 30 and June 5, according to Customs and Border Protection. In the first four months of 2019, the number of African migrants registered by Mexican authorities tripled in comparison to the same time period last year.

Most of these African migrants are from Cameroon, Congo and Angola.

President Donald Trump implemented metering in his first year in office. Under the policy, only limited number of asylum seeker can pass through a port of entry and make their claim. In the meantime, would-be asylum seekers on the Mexican side of the border are put on a list and must wait until their turn is next — a process that could take months.

The policy has proven effective at keeping migrants at bay.

The Associated Press estimated in May that around 13,000 people were waiting in Mexico to claim U.S. asylum. Thousands of immigrants have been sent back to the other side of the border under another policy known as “Remain in Mexico,” a program that mandates immigrants wait in Mexico as their asylum claims are processed through the U.S court system. More than 15,000 migrants who illegally entered the U.S. and claimed asylum have been booted back to Mexico since January.

In the city of Ciudad Acuna, the wait list reportedly reached 500, with the Los Angeles Times guessing the actual number was closer to 700. People waiting to get in have since formed a camp near the Rio Grande, where hundreds live until their names reach the top of the list.

While African migrants are reportedly dissatisfied with the long wait times and unsanitary conditions of the camp, many of them are choosing to stay put.

“It is far better than anything we have seen in our country,” Luis said to the Los Angeles Times. “In our nation, we slept with corpses.”

DHS Credits Illegal Immigration Crackdown For Drop In Border Apprehensions,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is crediting a drop in illegal immigrant encounters to increased border security and agreements made with Latin American governments.

“DHS has been taking a ‘whole of government’ approach to confront the ongoing crisis and fulfill our humanitarian and security obligations, including surging personnel from across the Department to high capacity locations on the Southwest border,” DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan said in prepared statement released Tuesday.

“We are also continuing our collaboration with our international partners, formalizing a number of initiatives with Northern Triangle countries to improve the lives and security of our respective citizens by combating human trafficking and the smuggling of illegal goods, helping to limit ‘push’ factors that encourage dangerous irregular migration to the U.S.,” McAleenan continued.

The acting secretary’s comments come after the release of June’s apprehension numbers, showing a decline in illegal alien encounters for the first time in six months.

Border Patrol agents apprehended or turned away a total of 104,344 unauthorized aliens in June, a 28% drop from the 144,278 encounters that took place in May. The decrease comes after apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border had been increasing each month since January.

President Donald Trump, who made immigration reform a major part of his campaign platform, has followed through by battling congressional Democrats for wall funding, sending more DHS personnel to the border, limiting the number of asylum applicants who cross into the country, entering into bilateral agreements with Mexico and Guatemala to stop the flow of migrants and numerous other measures.

While apprehension numbers historically drop from May to June, DHS noted that this year’s decline outpaced last year’s by 11%, arguing that more than just seasonal change is involved.

Nevertheless, the number of unauthorized migrants coming into the country are still at historical highs. Encounters along the southern border topped 100,000 each month in March, April, May and June. Border Patrol agents have made a total of 688,375 arrests this fiscal year since June, an apprehension rate that is 140% higher than the same time period year. (RELATED: DHS Wants An Additional 1,000 National Guard Troops On The Border)

Numerous leaders within DHS have said more funding and manpower is not enough, and have asked Congress for legislative reform to fix the immigration crisis.

“We are past the breaking point and in a full-blown emergency. This situation should not be acceptable to any of us,” McAleenan continued in his statement. “However, in order for us to solve this crisis and to create lasting change at the border, we must address the vulnerabilities in our legal framework.”

Injured Illegal Immigrant Moved To Longterm Care Facility Instead Of Being Deported After Activists ‘Made A Stink’,"A hospitalized illegal immigrant was transferred to a long-term healthcare facility instead of being deported after activists “raised a stink,” The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

The 48-year-old illegal immigrant from Guatemala, identified by his family as A.V., was originally taken to the Jefferson Torresdale Hospital in Northeast Philadelphia where he was treated for a neurological trauma, two broken legs, and fractured ribs after a motorcycle hit him, the Inquirer reported. Activists reportedly organized at the hospital to physically block any potential efforts to medically repatriate A.V.

“If we had not gone to the hospital and raised a stink, he would be in Guatemala right now, and might not be alive right now,” Director of the Free Migration Project and Philadelphia immigration lawyer David Bennion said, the Inquirer reported.

The patient’s immigration status, and 2. The undocumented patient’s ability to pay — Tina Vasquez (@TheTinaVasquez) June 25, 2020

The Free Migration Project is an advocacy organization, they support “the right of all people to freely migrate,” according to their website.

Bennion would not say where A.V. was transferred so that Immigration and Customs Enforcement couldn’t find him, the Inquirer reported.

“My uncle is much better, is better attended, and when we talk on the phone he can recognize me, but he is still quite confused,” A.V.’s niece Claudia Martinez said, the Inquirer reported.

“What I want to happen is that he recovers, that he has the care and attention that he needs no matter how long it takes. … My family is in total agreement on what is best for my uncle,” she added. (RELATED: LA Sheriff Refuses To Surrender 25,000 Illegal Immigrant Detainees To ICE: Report)

A spokesperson for Jefferson Torresdale Hospital told the Inquirer, “Jefferson Health transfers patients in coordination with the patient, or if the patient cannot consent, a family member or their legally appointed decision maker. … Jefferson works very closely with family members to develop transfer or discharge plans, no matter how complex.”

Medical students started an online petition against the deportation of A.V. on June 23, according to the Inquirer.

"Releasing Immigrants Without Court Date Is A ‘Systemic Failure,’ Experts Say","Releasing illegal immigrants without scheduled court dates is a failure of the immigration system, experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Border patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley Sector have been releasing adult migrants out of detention facilities without an official notice to appear because of the overfilled detention facilities, agents told Fox News. Immigrants often face obstacles in arriving at court even with a notice to appear.

“It’s almost entirely a systemic failure,” Ahilan Arulanantham, an immigration expert at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law, told the DCNF. “If you just give them [illegal immigrants] a piece of paper and tell them to come to court, a lot will fail to do that.”

Arulanantham said immigrants had been released without a notice to appear long before President Joe Biden’s presidency. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have frequently arrested immigrants for failure to show up to their court date when they check in with ICE agents, he said.

I just sent a letter demanding answers from @SecMayorkas regarding the report that illegal aliens are being released without court dates. The Admin must be held accountable to enforce the law. See below ⬇️https://t.co/M5PJ2Wy5uw #FoxNews — Rep Andy Biggs (@RepAndyBiggsAZ) March 23, 2021

“If you want to make sure they [immigrants] appear you have to provide legal representation and intensive supervision,” Arulanantham told the DCNF. (Related: REPORT: Illegal Immigrants In Rio Grande Valley Being Released Without Court Date)

Only 37% of immigrants and 15% of detainees show up to court with a lawyer, according to a 2016 American Immigration Council (AIC) study.

The percentage of immigrants who show up to court is 83%, and that rate increases to 97% if they have an attorney, according to AIC.

Arulanantham said that many illegal immigrants do not speak English or know that there are multiple agencies around the country if they move away from border cities. Roughly one-third of illegal immigrants are proficient in English, according to the Pew Research Center.

Ira Mehlman, media director at the Federation For American Immigration Reform (FAIR), told the DCNF that releasing immigrants without notices to appear is a result of Biden’s immigration policies.

“The policy of releasing people without even the formality of issuing them notices to appear (that few of them are likely to show up for anyway) just compounds his administration’s self-induced crisis,” Mehlman said. “It is just one more signal that the border is open in spite of the president and Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas claiming that it isn’t.”

House Republicans wrote a letter to Mayorkas Tuesday requesting answers regarding immigrants being released without court dates, Fox News reported. Rather than Border Patrol agents issuing immigrants notices to appear, the undocumented migrant’s information is recorded through biometrical data including fingerprints and photographs.

The lawmakers demanded answers on the number of immigrants released, whether they were eligible to work and if they fear prosecution, according to the letter.

STEIN: Democrats’ Divisive Push To Jam Mass Immigration Amnesty Bill Through Budget Reconciliation,"No one could confuse the political discussions in the U.S. today with those of even 25 years ago. Nothing has remained the same. Things unthinkable then are commonplace now.

Consider the old bromide that “politics ends at the water’s edge.” This was rooted in the idea that while there may be robust discussion internally on issues of international import, there is an assumption that in the end a bipartisan consensus must be established around policies that touch upon our international relations.

A corollary to that is policy issues that define us as a nation in the eyes of the world – concerns like foreign affairs, national defense and immigration – should not be decided solely on a polarized and partisan basis.

So now we find a concerted effort by Democrats and their tech oligarch allies pushing a deeply polarizing amnesty program for millions who’ve broken our immigration laws. Rumor has it that they are trying to justify such a divisive move by claiming amnesty has budgetary impacts. Obviously, this is a ruse: Amnesty has grave substantive impacts on virtually the entire range of U.S. public policy interests – criminal justice, law and order, social cohesion, environmental stewardship, public education, labor fairness, infrastructure burdens, etc.

Any such amnesty bill would alter future immigration patterns virtually forever. Because these are partisan proposals, they lack the necessary balance to assure that all stakeholders’ interests are represented. The concerns of most Americans a) that lawbreakers not be rewarded; b) that an amnesty not incentivize more illegal immigration; c) that the program won’t be riddled with fraud; and d) and that chain migration can’t mean that amnesty sets off a virtually tsunami of uncontrolled future immigration with no shut-off mechanism.

The budget reconciliation process has become a tempting target for opportunists to try to get around the Senate rules for conventional debate. Doing so, they hope, would mean no minority votes would be required.

Cynically pushing a bill of this kind through a partisan budget reconciliation is both unwise and dangerous. It creates an impression that our entire society is no longer built on fairness, fair play and honesty; that one party can simply use immigration for partisan gain. It treats lawbreakers better than those who’ve respected our borders and legal system.

Against the backdrop of the Biden administration immigration enforcement collapse and its complete abdication of its responsibility to execute our immigration laws in the manner Congress intended, such an amnesty program looks horribly irresponsible at best, downright sinister at worst.

A bill of this kind passed on a party line vote should tell Americans everything they need to know about the motivations at work here. Repeating the mistakes of the past to try to ensure Democrats can re-engineer the electorate to guarantee a century of one party control is hardly what the people deserve.

Immigration Attorneys Refuse To Be ‘Complicit’ In Biden’s Restarted Trump-Era Migrant Removal Program,"Some immigration attorneys are refusing to be “complicit” in former President Donald Trump’s Migrant Protection Protocols that were reinstated by the Biden administration and expected to go into effect as early as mid-November, BuzzFeed News reported Thursday.

The attorneys said they won’t offer pro bono legal assistance to migrants enrolled in Trump’s Remain in Mexico program because of the alleged dangers and rights violations migrants are subjected to, according to BuzzFeed. Immigration advocacy groups said they will keep assisting migrants at the southern border, but worry the reinstatement of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) will result in more people than attorneys can effectively represent.

Though the attorneys describe MPP as dangerous to migrants, according to Buzzfeed, people not enrolled in the program crossing into the U.S. are also exposed to significant dangers, including extortion and kidnapping, the Daily Caller News Foundation previously reported. Most migrants deny paying someone to help them illegally cross the border, but a few said they were kidnapped and kept in stash houses for over two weeks.

One migrant said they’re more likely to be targeted by cartels if they use a coyote so a lot of them try to travel alone, the DCNF reported. (RELATED: Biden Admin Is Still Using A Trump-Era Order To Expel Migrants Despite Ending ‘Remain in Mexico’)

“Anyone who needs RAICES assistance will be helped as much as our capacity allows. Just because we are not on the MPP list does not mean that our information is unavailable to migrants in MPP, who may need legal assistance,” Refugee And Immigrant Center For Education And Legal Services (RAICES) family detention attorney Nicole Morgan told the Daily Caller News Foundation on Friday.

“To be clear, we are willing to serve any and all people who need our assistance to best our ability and capacity,” Morgan added. “What we will not do is be used by the government as a facade by putting our name on a list that distracts from the real due process and access to counsel issues that persist in the MPP process. “

Over 71,000 migrants were enrolled in MPP since Trump started the program in January 2019 and waited for months as U.S. judges considered their immigration cases, Buzzfeed reported. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas ended the program in June, but a federal judge ruled in favor of bringing the policy back.

Mayorkas announced an end to the program for a second time on Oct. 29, according to the DHS, though it will not cease until an earlier court injunction is lifted. He said the benefits of Trump’s MPP “do not justify the costs” or align with the Biden administration’s goals.

Around 10% of the 71,000 migrants enrolled in MPP had legal representation and were more likely to be granted asylum, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

Josh Hawley Grills Biden Judicial Nominee Kenly Kato On Illegal Immigration: ‘Are Those Crimes Or Not?’,"Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley pressed Judge Kenly Kiya Kato, President Joe Biden’s judicial nominee for the Central District of California, on her stance regarding illegal immigration Tuesday.

“38 percent of your docket would be offenses like immigration and fraud, and I’m worried, frankly, given your statements and record on this issue that something that’s going to make up a huge portion of your docket is an issue in which you have said that you’ve expressed concern about whether these things are really crimes, whether they should really be prosecuted,” Hawley said during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, bringing up Kato’s stance on illegal immigration.

“And you just amply described your efforts to make sure that folks were not prosecuted. Is there anything you can say to convince us that you’d be able to do your job here with such a large portion of your docket in the midst of one of the worst crime waves in this country’s history?” he pressed.

WATCH:

﻿

“The statements and the advocacy that I engaged in were when I was serving in my role as a deputy federal public defender,” Kato responded. (RELATED: Biden Nominee Jessica Clarke Muffs John Kennedy’s ‘Basic’ Question During Hearing: ‘You Want To Take Another Crack At That?’)

“Have you changed your views since then?” Hawley asked.

“My role has changed,” Kato said. “For the past seven and a half years I have served as sitting United States magistrate judge. And my record demonstrates that I was able to put aside my advocacy role, and now my role is solely one where my duty of loyalty is to the law and the law alone.”

Hawley again grilled Kato on her previous positions, asking if she would now disagree with her statement that “these people haven’t done anything wrong.” He asked Kato if she agreed that issues like fraud and illegal immigration were crimes.

Kato responded by saying that, as a former counsel to individuals Hawley described, it would be “inappropriate” for her to respond to his question.

Hawley pushed back, arguing that she made clear these positions to a newspaper, not in a courtroom. He then demanded to know whether the instances he described were “crimes or not,” or if they were “serious or not.”

“I’m just trying to understand where you’re actually coming down on this,” Hawley said.

Kato again argued that these positions were expressed during her time as an advocate and that she’d served as a United States magistrate for seven and a half years.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/02/01/josh-hawley-kenly-kato-nominee-biden-california-judicial/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjmk6yIgbT9AhV-K1kFHSrYDhY4WhAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw1MzcmrFIOVC8TH0_3NtHTU,2022-02-01
Border Authorities See Record Number Of Migrants Crossing From Mexico,"The number of migrants authorities encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border in May shattered all Department of Homeland Security (DHS) records.

During the month, border authorities encountered 239,416 migrants at the southern border, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced Wednesday. May’s encounters exceeded April’s record of 234,088 migrants encountered since DHS began recording southwest border encounters. (RELATED: Biden DHS Wants To Ramp Up Efforts To Flood US With Illegal Immigrants)

Roughly one quarter of those encountered at the southern border had already been encountered in the last year by border authorities and 69% were single adults, according to CBP. The number of unaccompanied children was 14,699, a 21% increase from May.

BORDER REPORT: The first group of migrants I encountered last week in Yuma, AZ were from China, Peru, Georgia, Venezuela, Cuba, and India Only a few dozen migrants out of the ~1,500 crossing each day into the Yuma border sector are being returned under Title 42 pic.twitter.com/iqdwAX0QKH — Jennie Taer (@JennieSTaer) May 31, 2022

The Daily Caller News Foundation observed hundreds of migrants crossing into the Yuma sector in late May from mainly Colombia and Peru, while others were from Central America, Eastern Europe and South Asia. The crossings occurred when the pandemic public health order Title 42, which used to quickly expel migrants, was set to end before a federal judge intervened.

Migrants TheDCNF interviewed after they crossed into Yuma were taken into Border Patrol custody and later released to nongovernmental organizations, where they obtained travel and made their way to family and friends in the U.S. Many of them were released with court dates in 2023, they told TheDCNF.

CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus claimed that single adults and families are “expelled, where appropriate, under Title 42.” There were 100,699 migrants expelled under the order in May, according to CBP.

“As temperatures start to rise in the summer, human smugglers will continue to exploit vulnerable populations and recklessly endanger the lives of migrants for financial gain,” Magnus said. “The terrain along the Southwest Border is extreme, the summer heat is severe, and the miles of desert that migrants must hike after crossing the border are unforgiving. Our message to those who would try and gain illegal entry to the United States remains the same – don’t make the dangerous journey only to be sent back.”

CBP didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ousted Immigration Judge Sounds Off On Biden Administration Purge,"A former immigration judge who was fired by the Justice Department claimed that the Biden administration was packing immigration courts on Fox News Tuesday.

“The Biden Administration is trying to turn the court into essentially a free candy store so that anyone who appears in front of the immigration court winds up getting some benefits or winds up being allowed to stay in the United States,” Matthew O’Brien told Fox News host Laura Ingraham. “That is not what the courts were designed to do.” (RELATED: Biden DHS Wants To Ramp Up Efforts To Flood US With Illegal Immigrants)

“They also seem to be in the strange position of dismissing immigration judges appointed by President Trump and then trying to replace them with people who meet their own ideological framework,” O’Brien claimed.

At least six judges were removed from positions at the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR), the Washington Times reported Monday. O’Brien, who was approaching the end of a two-year probationary period, was ousted this month after the Justice Department refused to appoint him to a permanent position.

“The Biden Administration is in the process of ordering ICE to dismiss all the cases that are before it,” O’Brien told Ingraham. “They seem to be taking a creative approach to reducing the backlog by simply not pursuing the cases and releasing these people into the interior of the United States.”

Officials in border towns have expressed concerns about the overwhelming number of migrants entering the U.S. after U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that agents encountered a record 239,416 migrants in May. In addition to the flood of migrants, CBP seized 22 pounds of fentanyl earlier this month.

For perspective, just two milligrams of fentanyl can be a potentially fatal dose, according to The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Daily Caller News Foundation.

POLL: Majority Of Voters View Biden’s Handling Of Immigration As ‘Poor’ Or ‘Fair’,"Voters are increasingly worried about illegal immigration and say it will affect their vote this upcoming election cycle, according to a new Rasmussen Reports poll released Thursday. A majority of people from the survey said they do not think Biden is doing a good job on the issue.

The poll found 52% of likely U.S. voters think illegal immigration is getting worse, while just 11% think it’s getting better, according to the poll. Sixty-seven percent said President Joe Biden’s handling of immigration was “fair” or “poor.”

The issue of immigration is set to affect voters in November, with 73% saying immigration would be an “important” topic in the elections, while 42% said it would be “very important.” When broken down amongst party lines, 85% of Republicans think the issue will play some role in the midterms, compared to 69% of Democrats and 90% of unaffiliated voters.

The poll was conducted between June 28-29 among 1,000 likely voters and has a +/- 3% margin of error. (RELATED: GRAPHIC: Illegal Migrant Trying To Run Away From Agents Gets Hit And Killed By Car)

The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Biden administration can stop the implementation of the Trump-era “Remain in Mexico” policy. The policy forced migrants to wait in Mexico as their asylum cases were being processed.

The border has seen an influx of migrants, with at least four human smugglers arrested earlier in the week after smuggling in dozens of illegal migrants in a tractor-trailer. Fifty-three of those migrants were found deceased.

MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough criticized progressives for their stance on immigration, saying the tragedies will continue to happen so long as the U.S. “keeps sending the message” that the nation does not “have laws.”

“There’s also nothing progressive about encouraging migrants to risk their lives going across the desert to come into the United States illegally,” Scarborough added.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/07/01/rasmussen-reports-poll-voters-illegal-immigration-border-biden-fair-poor/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjRrYCJgbT9AhVjF1kFHdHhBSY4ZBAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw3ULu_nTs0utN9fEPQfSSEu,2022-07-01
"EXCLUSIVE: Biden Admin’s Border Policies Aren’t As ‘Humane’ As It Thinks, Two Migrants Say","The Biden administration’s border policies aren’t as humane or secure as it says they are, two migrants told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Elio and Bleisker, who are both from Venezuela, came to the U.S. legally and illegally, respectively, and spoke with the DCNF about the differences in their experiences.

Since March 2019, Venezuelan migrants have lacked the legal pathways to come to the U.S., making the dangerous illegal trek almost the only option to escape threats and corruption.

Stafford, Texas — Elio and Bleisker grew up together in Venezuela, but fled the country at different times to come to the U.S.: Elio, legally under the Trump administration, and Bleisker, illegally under the Biden administration.

The Biden administration has been open to illegal migrants, which isn’t necessarily the best way to protect them or U.S. national security, Elio and Bleisker explained in an interview with the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: Biden-Appointed Border Patrol Chief Admits There’s A ‘Crisis’ At The Southern Border)

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in May that the Biden administration is committed to ensuring migrants are able to come through “humane pathways.”

“I think the current policies, they can benefit people like Bleisker, he’s a young person and I believe has very good intentions in coming here, but it could also benefit someone completely different,” Elio said. “It can benefit a criminal.”

“They don’t have any documents to tell if they are criminals or not,” Bleisker added.

WATCH:

Elio had the opportunity to come legally by obtaining a travel visa in Venezuela and applying for asylum on U.S. soil. But Bleisker was not as fortunate.

The U.S. Embassy in Caracas, Venezuela, closed in March 2019, leaving displaced Venezuelans with “insurmountable obstacles” to coming legally, Cato Associate Director of Immigration Studies David Bier told the DCNF.

“When they can get to another country, they’d almost always have to prove that they have a residence that they have no intention to abandon, an impossible burden for someone who’s already fled their home,” Bier said.

The number of Venezuelan migrants encountered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the southern border began surging in February 2021. Between October 2021 and July 2022, 176,406 Venezuelan migrants have been encountered at the southern border, which is almost triple the number encountered the previous fiscal year.

“Unlike Ukrainians, the administration is making no accommodations for Venezuelans. Even in the rare cases when they have US citizen family, there are massive backlogs and waits that can last decades,” Bier said.

Since Biden took office, his administration has sought to scrap a number of Trump-era border policies. It most recently ended the Migrant Protection Protocols, which forced certain illegal migrants to await court proceedings in Mexico.

The Biden administration enacted a 100-day moratorium on deportations in January 2021 and limited who Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) could arrest.

“Although this country has faced lots of changes through the years, it’s still the country where the constitution protects their people to live and grow well. It’s a country where anyone -no matter where you come from- can prosper and grow as long as they follow the rules (and learn to adapt). It’s a beautiful and organized country,” Bleisker said.

Elio spoke with the DCNF before heading to his job a hospital in the Houston area, where at 19-years-old, he works as a nurse assistant and translator. It’s a stark contrast to the 15-year-old Elio who arrived in the country just a few years before not knowing the language.

“We got here after problems in Venezuela started rising up back in 2018 … I thought it was hard until I got to hear my friend’s story,” Elio said.

When he arrived in the U.S. in 2018, Elio was told that the Trump administration was against migrants, which he said wasn’t the reality of his experience.

“Coming here and all you hear from everyone is that Trump was bad towards immigrants, it was an absolute lie. And I’m not saying this in a bias position, I’m saying this because I lived both administrations,” Elio said.

Bleisker didn’t have the same opportunity as Elio, but still hopes to contribute to American society and encourages other migrants like him to do the same.

“I believe he didn’t have the same opportunity we had to have all these legal means,” Elio said.

Elio said he must support Bleisker because every employer they’ve called requires applicants to have a social security number or a work permit. On top of that, Bleisker continues to face trauma from not only being threatened by criminals in his home country, but from his experiences along the weeks-long lone trip to the U.S.

He said he had trouble sleeping because of his experience just days before the interview, before he crossed into Yuma, Arizona, where he was taken into Border Patrol custody and later released to Catholic Charities, where he was able to purchase a flight to Houston.

Bleisker met a man along the way, who criminals in Panama’s Darien Jungle seemingly threatened by saying they would rape his young daughter. The man stood up to the criminals, who forced him to watch as they raped his daughter and then forced his daughter to watch as the man was raped.

But Bleisker hasn’t lost hope. He’s excited to learn English and become a productive member of American society.

“Just like Elio did, I will grow too,” Bleisker said. “Opportunities are endless here. Even with all the political changes it’s still one of the most beautiful countries on Earth.”

Illegal Immigration Under Biden Admin Costs Taxpayers More Than Trump’s Border Wall: Report,"Illegal immigration under President Joe Biden in 2022 is costing American taxpayers more than former President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall, according to a report conducted by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR).

The 1.3 million illegal migrants released into the country under the Biden administration will cost taxpayers $20.4 billion this year, with each migrant costing $9,232 per year, according to the report. (RELATED: Democrat-Run Border City Will Ask The Biden Admin To Pay Millions For Illegal Migrant Charter Buses Across The Country)

The Trump administration appropriated $15 billion for the construction of a border wall. But on Biden’s first day in office, he terminated the funding allocated for the border wall, pausing its construction.

Biden recently directed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Defense (DOD) secretaries to come up with plans to fund the border wall amid a record surge in illegal immigration, but appears to not have followed through with many recent construction plans.

Between October 2021 and July 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) encountered over 1.9 million migrants at the southern border.

Republican Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford said in July 2021 that the Biden administration had been spending around $3 million a day to pay DOD contractors to not finish construction on the southern border wall since January 2021.

The Biden administration said in December that it would begin filling gaps in the border wall in Yuma, Arizona. The gaps remained in August, leading Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey to place shipping containers in them.

Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has also utilized shipping containers in place of the border wall.

“Even in an age in which trillion dollar spending packages are considered modest, the additional $20.4 billion the Biden Border Crisis has heaped onto the backs of American taxpayers is still staggering,” FAIR President Dan Stein said in a statement Tuesday. “$20.4 billion could address some very important needs of the American public, instead of covering the costs of the surge of illegal migration triggered by this administration’s policies.”

The Biden administration recently amended the “Public Charge Rule” to allow illegal migrants to receive certain public benefits without risk of deportation. The rule is applied to noncitizens, who are seen as “likely at any time to become a public charge,” according to DHS.

“We are excited and welcome to see the new rule from the Biden administration updating the barbaric weaponizing of public charge used by the former administration. This allows our borders to remain open to a large portion of the world where immigrants struggle and seek the American dream,” American Immigration Lawyers Association Immediate Past President Allen Orr recently told the Daily Caller News Foundation of the rule change.

DHS didn’t immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Dem Senator Dismisses Opposition To Immigration As A ‘Far-Right’ Concern,"Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio claimed that concerns about immigration only came from the “far right” during a Sunday appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

“I think my voters in Ohio are reasonable. We’re a slightly lean Republican state now,” Brown told host Chuck Todd. “I don’t hear much about immigration from voters, except for people on the far right that always want to gain political advantage by talking about it.” (RELATED: ‘Total Dishonesty’: Fox News Hosts Hammer Homeland Security Over Misreported Data Revealed By DCNF)

“When serious-minded people talk about it, they’re looking for something like Thom [Tillis] and Kyrsten [Sinema] were suggesting, and they’re also emphasizing the dreamer kids, the DACA kids, who are, as I said, essentially Americans except for the paperwork,” Brown continued.

WATCH:

Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina reportedly started work on compromise legislation that would legalize those in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program while reinstating Title 42, a Trump-era program that expelled migrants that is set to expire Dec. 21 following a ruling by United States District Judge Emmet Sullivan.

United States Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) encountered over 2.3 million migrants in Fiscal Year 2022, with another 230,000 in October, the first month of the new fiscal year, according to official figures, while another 600,000 migrants evaded CBP, Fox News reported.

“Maybe with this new Republican House and Democratic Senate, we finally get serious about the immigration reform, instead of pointing fingers, saying disaster is about to happen,” Brown said. “I think the administration will figure it out short term. Instead of bashing on immigrants or appealing to new citizens, whatever, we’ve got to get serious about it.”

‘Confusion’: Trump-Era Border Policy’s Uncertain Fate Is Only Worsening Illegal Immigration,"The number of illegal immigrant crossings is surging at the southern border as the fate of a major Trump-era immigration order known as Title 42 remains uncertain.

A federal judge recently ruled that the Biden administration must end the policy, which former President Donald Trump invoked in 2020 to expel certain illegal immigrants to prevent the spread of COVID-19, on Dec. 21 before Republican states asked the Supreme Court to intervene, which resulted with a temporary pause on the order. Areas like El Paso, Texas and Yuma, Arizona, have seen surges that have overwhelmed local resources surrounding the previous Dec. 21 deadline even as some illegal immigrants continue to face expulsion.

In Yuma, Arizona, Mayor Douglas Nicholls says a recent surge in illegal immigration will lead to the release of migrants onto the town’s streets. Yuma County Supervisor Jonathan Lines says the surge coincides with “confusion” over when Title 42 ends.

“There is so much confusion from the illegals coming across the border regarding Title 42 , numbers continue to climb as many believe they will be granted permission to stay. The President must address the open border and the consequences of illegals pouring into our communities overwhelming the Hospitals and NGOs. If DHS proceeds with street releases the burdens will be placed on the already strained resources of local cities. This is not sustainable,” Lines told the DCNF.

Federal border authorities in El Paso have moved roughly 10,000 illegal immigrants that crossed into the area recently, as many released from custody were sleeping on city sidewalks and on the floors of the local airport.

Migrant encounters at the southern border typically decrease at this time of year. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) encountered over 45,000 migrants at the southern border in October 2019, over 71,000 in October 2020 and over 164,000 in October 2021.

CBP encountered a record of more than 230,000 migrants in October 2022.

As of publication, CBP hasn’t officially released encounter numbers for November 2022. However, the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) says border agents arrested more than 209,000 illegal immigrants during that time period.

The encounters during that time period are up from more than 174,000 across CBP in November 2021, more than 72,000 in November 2020 and more than 42,000 in November 2019.

ICE Admits It Has ‘No Records’ For Hundreds Of Thousands Of Illegal Immigrants Released With Electronic Monitors,"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) admitted to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) that it has “no records” of 377,980 illegal immigrants enrolled in its “Alternatives to Detention” program.

TRAC sent a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for data on the program, which used to electronically monitor illegal immigrants into the country.

“ICE’s response that they could no longer find records on immigrants in Alternatives to Detention (ATD) that they had previously released came as a shock, particularly after they informed us recently that they had been misleading the public for several months by releasing extremely inaccurate ATD data. The agency really needs to come clean. The American public deserves to have accurate data about the ATD program,” TRAC assistant Professor Austin Kocher told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) admitted it has “no records” of hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants released into the country with electronic tracking devices, the agency said in a Dec. 22 letter to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC).

ICE informed TRAC that it had “no records” of the 377,980 individuals monitored by the agency’s “Alternatives to Detention” (ATD) program used to electronically track illegal immigrants released into the country. TRAC had asked for data via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request on those in ATD custody from the start of fiscal year 2019 to August 2022.

“ICE’s response that they could no longer find records on immigrants in Alternatives to Detention (ATD) that they had previously released came as a shock, particularly after they informed us recently that they had been misleading the public for several months by releasing extremely inaccurate ATD data. The agency really needs to come clean. The American public deserves to have accurate data about the ATD program,” TRAC assistant Professor Austin Kocher told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

ICE started the ATD program in 2004 to monitor illegal migrants released into the country using ankle monitors, GPS tracking and cellphones. With limited detention space, ICE relies on the program to hold those awaiting the years-long backlogs in immigration courts.

The agency has previously provided TRAC with data on individuals enrolled in ATD, disclosing which technology was used, dates of entry into the program among other key details.

Just days after announcing that the agency had been misleading to the public for months about how many immigrants were on gps ankle monitors, @icegov claims it can’t find records on over 350,000 immigrants in alternatives to detention program.https://t.co/UVzYiyklLG pic.twitter.com/mAJKz9UfPw — Austin Kocher, PhD (@ackocher) December 28, 2022

TRAC’s latest issue with ICE isn’t the first time the data on the ATD program has faced scrutiny.

The DCNF recently reported on errors and miscalculations in the ATD data on illegal immigrants not tracked with any technology and others tracked using GPS monitoring. At the time, ICE had privately disclosed different data to participants of a private event that showed an over 18,000% discrepancy in public data on those not tracked with any technology and another roughly 600% difference in publicly disclosed GPS tracking data.

ICE later apologized for the issue and updated the data.

“Upon further inspection of what participants were provided against what was publicly available online, it became clear there was a data miscalculation. Teams worked quickly to address and reconcile the issue, now updated on ICE.gov. We regret ICE provided erroneous ATD enrollment data and worked to resolve the miscalculation going forward,” an ICE spokesperson told the DCNF at the time.

TRAC is concerned over ICE’s consistent errors.

“When Congress ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to publish data on immigrant detention, perhaps it should have been clearer that it expected ICE to produce accurate data—not inconsistent, error-ridden, and misleading data that the agency currently provides to the public on a regular basis. These sloppy, uncorrected errors—more of the norm rather than the exception—demand immediate attention from both the public and from Congress,” TRAC wrote on Sept. 20 after ICE incorrectly released data from May 2021 instead of September 2022.

ICE didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Mayorkas Says Illegal Immigration Crisis Has ‘No’ Effect On DHS’ Ability To Seize Deadly Fentanyl,"Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas claimed Wednesday that the surge in illegal immigration at the southern border has “no” effect on federal capabilities to seize fentanyl.

Federal border authorities are unfazed in their efforts to catch fentanyl being smuggled into the country, Mayorkas said in a livestreamed interview with The Washington Post. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) encountered a record of more than 2.3 million migrants at the southern border in fiscal year 2022 and the surge is only on pace to worsen in fiscal year 2023, former CBP acting Commissioner Mark Morgan told the Daily Caller News Foundation Wednesday. (RELATED: Biden Admin To Hike Fees On Legal Immigration To Fund Processing Of Illegal Migrants Who Claim Asylum)

“No it doesn’t,” Mayorkas said in response to a question about federal border authorities’ ability to handle both the surge in fentanyl and illegal immigrants. Only 2 milligrams of fentanyl is enough to potentially kill an adult, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

“I mean we have a workforce that stays true to the mission that is tireless. We have surged personnel to the border, not only in between the ports of entry, but at the ports of entry, where we’re deploying an increasing amount of technology. We have our field officers at the ports of entry, we have our Border Patrol agents in between the ports of entry, the number of encounters does not take our eye off the ball of battling the scourge of fentanyl,” Mayorkas added.

Law enforcement officials at the border have contradicted Mayorkas’ claim, saying border authorities can’t address both issues to the best of their abilities.

“When you know you have a small contingent of Border Patrol agents that you can inundate quickly, by doing mass quantities at one time, that ties up Border Patrol’s resources so they cannot be out there,” Yuma County Sheriff Leon Wilmot previously told the DCNF of Border Patrol’s ability to interdict smuggling attempts.

The large southern border illegal immigration surge in fiscal year 2022 coincided with CBP seizures of more than 14,000 pounds of fentanyl, more than triple the amount seized in fiscal year 2020. Fentanyl was largely responsible for the more than 100,000 drug-related deaths in the U.S. in fiscal year 2021, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data.

CBP seized 656,000 pounds of drugs during fiscal year 2022.

Law enforcement capabilities have also been stretched due to the U.S. Air Force’s recent move to quickly scrap a spy plane used to detect the cross-border drug smuggling operations, according to one expert who recently spoke with the DCNF.

“Do I think it’s going to stretch already stretched assets further? Yes,” Retired Air Force Col. Dan DeBree, a professor at Texas A&M University and former Department of Homeland Security officer, recently told the DCNF.

Mayorkas Says Illegal Immigration Crisis Has ‘No’ Effect On DHS’ Ability To Seize Deadly Fentanyl,"Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas claimed Wednesday that the surge in illegal immigration at the southern border has “no” effect on federal capabilities to seize fentanyl.

Federal border authorities are unfazed in their efforts to catch fentanyl being smuggled into the country, Mayorkas said in a livestreamed interview with The Washington Post. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) encountered a record of more than 2.3 million migrants at the southern border in fiscal year 2022 and the surge is only on pace to worsen in fiscal year 2023, former CBP acting Commissioner Mark Morgan told the Daily Caller News Foundation Wednesday.

“No it doesn’t,” Mayorkas said in response to a question about federal border authorities’ ability to handle both the surge in fentanyl and illegal immigrants. Only 2 milligrams of fentanyl is enough to potentially kill an adult, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

“I mean we have a workforce that stays true to the mission that is tireless. We have surged personnel to the border, not only in between the ports of entry, but at the ports of entry, where we’re deploying an increasing amount of technology. We have our field officers at the ports of entry, we have our Border Patrol agents in between the ports of entry, the number of encounters does not take our eye off the ball of battling the scourge of fentanyl,” Mayorkas added.

Law enforcement officials at the border have contradicted Mayorkas’ claim, saying border authorities can’t address both issues to the best of their abilities.

“When you know you have a small contingent of Border Patrol agents that you can inundate quickly, by doing mass quantities at one time, that ties up Border Patrol’s resources so they cannot be out there,” Yuma County Sheriff Leon Wilmot previously told the DCNF of Border Patrol’s ability to interdict smuggling attempts.

The large southern border illegal immigration surge in fiscal year 2022 coincided with CBP seizures of more than 14,000 pounds of fentanyl, more than triple the amount seized in fiscal year 2020. Fentanyl was largely responsible for the more than 100,000 drug-related deaths in the U.S. in fiscal year 2021, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data.

CBP seized 656,000 pounds of drugs during fiscal year 2022.

Law enforcement capabilities have also been stretched due to the U.S. Air Force’s recent move to quickly scrap a spy plane used to detect the cross-border drug smuggling operations, according to one expert who recently spoke with the DCNF.

“Do I think it’s going to stretch already stretched assets further? Yes,” Retired Air Force Col. Dan DeBree, a professor at Texas A&M University and former Department of Homeland Security officer, recently told the DCNF.

EXCLUSIVE: GOP Senator Demands Answers From Biden Admin After DCNF Exposes Major Errors In Illegal Immigrant Data,"Republican Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford is demanding answers from the Biden administration over inaccurate data on illegal immigrants released into the U.S. that the Daily Caller News Foundation previously exposed, according to a letter exclusively obtained by the DCNF.

Lankford asked that the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) provide information about its process for providing data on illegal immigrants released from federal custody, according to the letter. The DCNF previously discovered that ICE was publishing erroneous data on the number of illegal immigrants released into the U.S. with GPS monitoring and without any tracking technology as part of the agency’s Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program. (RELATED: Republican Rep. Andy Biggs Introduces Impeachment Articles Against Mayorkas)

The DCNF found that ICE was underreporting the number of illegal immigrants released without tracking technology by more than 18,000%. The agency also was misreporting the number of illegal immigrants released with GPS tracking devices by roughly 600%.

The agency subsequently corrected the data and apologized for the errors.

“It has come to my attention that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) may have been providing the public with inaccurate data regarding the populations of migrants who are monitored through ICE’s Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program. According to these reports, ICE significantly overstated the population that is being monitored by the Global Positioning System (GPS) ankle monitor technology,” Lankford wrote.

ICE also recently said it has “no records” of hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants released into the country with electronic monitoring, in response to a request from Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC). Lankford expressed concerns about that issue as well in his letter.

“I am concerned that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) may have filed ICE’s inaccurate data on ATD to either special masters who assess ICE’s compliance with settlement agreements and stipulations or to judges as part of briefings in immigration litigation. It is possible that ICE’s long-standing data integrity issues have led to false or misleading court filings in these cases,” Lankford wrote.

Lankford’s letter comes after U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) had its highest month on record with more than 250,000 migrant encounters in December. CBP also recorded more than 2.3 million migrant encounters in fiscal year 2022.

EXCLUSIVE: Rep. Jeff Duncan Introduces Sweeping Border Security Package To Stop Record Illegal Immigration,"Republican South Carolina Rep. Jeff Duncan introduced a series of bills Thursday to secure the southern border and crack down on illegal immigration.

The package includes six bills introduced in the last Congress that seek to ban access to Social Security for illegal immigrants, allow authorities to deport illegal immigrants who are listed on the national terrorism database, permit funds from the cartels to be used to build a border wall, revoke passports from members of foreign terrorist groups, punish illegal immigrants who overstay visas and make sanctuary cities ineligible for federal funding, according legislation obtained by the DCNF. Duncan’s plan follows U.S. Custom and Border Protection’s (CBP) highest month on record for migrant encounters, which topped more than 250,000 in December. (RELATED: Republican Rep. Andy Biggs Introduces Impeachment Articles Against Mayorkas)

“Our nation is being invaded at our southern border due to open border policies and a lack of enforcement,” Duncan said in a statement to the DCNF.

One of the bills to fund the building of a border wall instructs the Department of Justice (DOJ) to take funds from forfeited Mexican cartel assets in order to build a barrier and roads to prevent illegal crossings. Another bill that seeks to punish sanctuary cities makes states and local governments that don’t cooperate with immigration enforcement actions ineligible from receiving federal funds for a period of at least one year

“The southern border crisis threatens our national security, and we have no idea who is in our country due to the surge of illegal immigration since Joe Biden took office,” Duncan said.

CBP apprehended 38 individuals whose names appeared on the national terrorism database at the southern border in the first three months of fiscal year 2023, according to agency statistics.

“Border security is national security, and I am confident my immigration legislative package will begin to take necessary steps to combat the southern border crisis and safeguard our national security,” he added.

Biden Says Illegal Immigration Is ‘Down’ In SOTU,"President Joe Biden claimed he’s succeeded in driving illegal migration “down” during his State of the Union Tuesday night.

Biden attributed his success to a new program allowing migrants from Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Haiti to qualify for parole if they have a sponsor. The president’s statement follows a record surge in illegal immigration in fiscal year 2022, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded more than 2.3 million migrant encounters and in December, when the agency recorded more than 250,000 migrant encounters, marking the highest month on record. (RELATED: Illegal Immigrants Believe The Border Is ‘Open’ Under Biden, Official Tells Congress)

“We now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers and seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months. Since we launched our new border plan last month, unlawful migration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela has come down 97%. But America’s border problems won’t be fixed until Congress acts,” Biden said.

Following the launch of the latest parole program, illegal migrant encounters at the southern border dipped from a seven-day average of 3,367 per day on Dec. 11 to a seven-day average of 115 on Jan. 24, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Biden pressured Congress to pass immigration reform in addition to amnesty for Dreamers and certain migrant workers.

“If you won’t pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border. And a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers,” he added.

EXCLUSIVE: ICE Chief Admits To Enormous Illegal Immigration Data Errors Exposed By DCNF,"The head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) admitted to the agency’s errors in publishing incorrect data previously exposed by the Daily Caller News Foundation on illegal immigrants released into the interior of the country, according to a letter exclusively obtained by the DCNF.

“This mishap was due to an oversight and was promptly corrected once ICE became aware,” Deputy Director and Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Director Tae Johnson wrote to Republican Texas Rep. Pat Fallon Wednesday.

The DCNF earlier discovered that ICE was underreporting the number of illegal immigrants released from custody without any electronic monitoring by more than 18,000% and was underreporting the number of illegal immigrants released with GPS trackers by roughly 600%.

The head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Tae Johnson, admitted to major errors in illegal immigration data recently exposed by the Daily Caller News Foundation, according to a letter the agency sent to Republican Texas Rep. Pat Fallon obtained exclusively by the DCNF.

The DCNF earlier discovered that ICE provided the public with erroneous data, underreporting the number of illegal immigrants released into the country without any tracking technology by more than 18,000% and misreporting the number of illegal immigrants tracked with GPS technology by roughly 600%. Fallon first sent a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas requesting answers about the issue on Dec. 19, then again on Jan. 26. (RELATED: ‘Bullsh*t’: Border Agency Circulates Anti-Law Enforcement, ‘BLACK RESISTANCE’ Flyer, Document Shows)

Johnson’s letters followed an apology from ICE and a subsequent correction of the data.

“ICE strongly emphasizes there was no intent to suppress or mislead elected officials, the public, or symposium participants. This mishap was due to an oversight and was promptly corrected once ICE became aware. The data provided to participants at ICE’s ATD symposium on December 1, 2022, were conect [sic], and ICE made corrections to ICE.gov by December 2, 2022. These ATD data are refreshed bi-weekly, except for court appearance data, which are refreshed monthly,” Deputy Director and Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Director Tae Johnson wrote in his letter to Fallon regarding the error involving data on illegal immigrants released with GPS monitoring.

Johnson blamed the error involving the number of illegal immigrants released without tracking technology on a surge in illegal crossings at the southern border, as well as supply chain issues that made it difficult for ICE to obtain tracking technology.

“As for data regarding noncitizens released without tracking technology, during the summer of 2022, an increase in U.S. Border Patrol arrests and ATD technology supply chain issues led to ICE releasing noncitizens on the Southwest Border without ATD technology and later reevaluating the case for technology once they reported to ICE. This change led ICE to report data on noncitizens released without ATD technology in addition to those released with technology,” Johnson wrote.

“As ICE ingested the data into its databases from the ISAP-ATD contractor, the data for noncitizens released with a GPS device and those released with no technology was reported in a similar format. This resulted in an oversight between our two contractors that initially led ICE to report incorrect data. Once ICE was made aware of this data reporting error, it was immediately rectified,” he added.

ICE implemented the “Alternatives to Detention” program in 2004 to monitor illegal immigrants released into the country awaiting years-long court proceedings. The program employs a number of forms of tracking, including ankle monitors and cell phones.

Johnson argued that the program is effective in getting illegal immigrants to show up to court hearings.

In the first three months of fiscal year 2023, of the 507 hearings held for illegal immigrants in Alternatives to Detention with GPS monitors, 500 saw attendance, Johnson wrote. For those in the program tracked with other forms of technology or no technology at all, there’s a more than 99% hearing appearance rate during that same time frame.

However, there’s more to the data on court appearances that tells the full story, former Acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Mark Morgan told the DCNF.

“The data he provided was factual, there’s nothing indicating it’s not factual, but again what congress needs to ask is the real crux of the question is regardless of if they show up or not how many are actually removed once they get a court order of removal? And the answer to that is very few,” Morgan, who also previously served as the acting ICE Director, said.

American Dissatisfaction With Immigration Levels Increases As Border Crisis Continues: POLL,"Americans are increasingly growing less supportive of U.S. immigration levels as the crisis at the southern border continues, according to a Gallup poll released Monday.

Roughly 63% of Americans are dissatisfied with U.S. immigration and for the most part want it at lower levels, according to the poll. The finding comes as authorities at the southern border face record levels of illegal migration. (RELATED: The Biden Admin Is Making It Easier For Illegal Immigrants To Roam The US Without Tracking Them)

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) encountered a record of more than 2.3 million migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2022. Federal authorities also recorded their highest month on record for migrant encounters in December, with more than 250,000.

January’s migrant encounters dipped due to the Biden administration’s new policies to increase the number of people paroled into the country.

The number of Americans dissatisfied with current immigration levels has increased in the last two years from 19% in 2021 to 35% in 2022, and now 40%, according to Gallup, which notes that the number of Republicans opposed is reaching a new high.

“Republicans’ displeasure with immigration for being too high is now the highest Gallup has recorded for that party. On the other hand, despite increasing in recent years, this viewpoint is less common today among independents and especially Democrats than it was in the post-9/11 years,” Gallup noted.

Gallup surveyed more than 1,000 adults living in every state between Jan. 2 and 22. The margin of error was four percentage points.

Dozens Of Dem Lawmakers Push To Increase Funding For Immigration Program Led By ‘Abolish ICE’ Group,"Dozens of Democratic lawmakers are pushing to increase funding for an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) program led by a group that has advocated to abolish the agency.

Democratic Reps. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Jerrold Nadler of New York, and Nanette Diaz Barragán of California and 33 other Democratic members of Congress sent a letter Monday to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Shalanda Young asking for “robust funding” of Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Case Management Pilot Program (CMPP), which aids illegal immigrants awaiting their court dates in the U.S. by providing legal resources, mental health support and connections to social services. The Church World Service (CWS), a group that has previously advocated to abolish ICE, is a CMPP board member, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). (RELATED: The Biden Admin Is Making It Easier For Illegal Immigrants To Roam The US Without Tracking Them)

CWS’ role as also both the Board’s Secretariat/Fiscal Agent on the CMPP board means the group has been charged with deciding which nongovernmental organizations to provide with federal funding. The faith-based organization received over $114 million from the U.S. government between July 2021 and June 2022, according to its website.

In 2021, CWS tweeted a hashtag with the words “AbolishICE.” The group also previously requested that the Obama administration end ICE “raids” on illegal immigrants.

A new report by @ACLU & @P4HR reveals @ICEgov force-fed hunger strikers by threatening them with deportation, excessive force, or relocation to other facilities. This cruelty and coercion is unacceptable. #AbolishICE #FreeThemAllhttps://t.co/XdX2GjAWx3 — CWS (@CWS_global) June 24, 2021

“Secretary Mayorkas was right when he said we overuse immigration detention,” Jayapal said in a statement regarding the letter, which CWS endorsed, Monday. “Studies consistently show that most people are best equipped to successfully complete their removal proceedings when they have full access to the support of their families and communities and legal representation. Cost-effective, humane options like CMPP are crucial to reduce our reliance on for-profit detention facilities.”

The fiscal year 2023 congressional spending bill gave $20 million to CMPP, and Democratic lawmakers want to keep that level of funding in the next fiscal year’s budget, according to the letter.

Republican Texas Rep. Lance Gooden, however, told the DCNF he believes that the program is only incentivizing illegal immigration.

“These FEMA grant programs are nothing more than a slush fund for NGOs and nonprofit organizations that are actively facilitating the invasion at our southern border. There is zero accountability or oversight of these programs and Congress should not appropriate another cent until FEMA stops financing the perverse incentives that encourage migrants to make the journey to the United States,” Gooden said.

CWS didn’t respond to a request for comment. ICE didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

EXCLUSIVE: There’s A Massive Loophole In Biden’s Immigration Parole Program,"Migrants applying to receive humanitarian parole in the U.S. can be in a safe third country before they apply, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) confirmed to the Daily Caller News Foundation.

President Joe Biden announced the beginning of the program in January to allow migrants from Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Haiti to qualify for the program if they have a sponsor in the U.S. after record encounters at the southern border.

“Our clients, some of them, they just arrived to a third country. Let’s say they buy a plane ticket,” Immigration attorney Maria Herrarra Mellado told the DCNF, adding “It happened. They just happen to be in the Dominican Republic or [on a] short vacation.”

A massive loophole exists in the Biden administration’s latest program to admit certain migrants into the U.S. has a massive loophole that allows for applicants to be in another safe country before when they apply, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) confirmed to the Daily Caller News Foundation.

President Joe Biden announced in January the process for Haitians, Cubans, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to apply for humanitarian parole as illegal immigrants from those countries surged the border. Immigration attorney Maria Herrara Mellado told the DCNF that she’s had clients approved for the program while in safe third countries, and one from Venezuela who has a pending application while vacationing in Mexico. (RELATED: Biden’s Border Admissions Program Is Leading To Family Separations)

“Our clients, some of them, they just arrived to a third country. Let’s say they buy a plane ticket,” Herrarra Mellado told the DCNF, adding “It happened. They just happen to be in the Dominican Republic or [on a] short vacation.”

“At the end of the day, a lot of people who are coming here are not the ones who are in great need to come here. They happened to be in another country and they have a wealthy immediate relative,” she said.

Former acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan believes the loophole is illegal, he told the DCNF.

“You could be anywhere and still apply for parole, even though they’re in a safe third country, which is yet another example of why we say this is a perversion, violation of the law that they’re using as a shell game to claim victory that they’re addressing the crisis,” Morgan said.

The revelation comes as the Biden administration plans to implement a rule disqualifying migrants seeking asylum in the U.S. who already passed through other countries deemed to be safe to reside.

If Venezuelan, Cuban, Haitian or Nicaraguan migrants cross illegally into the U.S., they will be expelled immediately under Title 42, a Trump-era public health order used to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The new process requires that the parolees have a sponsor in the U.S. to support them financially for the two years they’re allowed live in the U.S.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment to provide data on how many parolees have been in safe third countries. The agency’s website, however, does state that it is a disqualifier if a parole applicant is a resident, dual national or refugee of another country, but not so if you are the immediate family member of a Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, or Venezuelan and you are living in another country.

“An individual is ineligible to be considered for parole under these processes if that person is a dual national or permanent resident of, or holds refugee status in, another country, unless DHS operates a similar parole process for the country’s nationals. This requirement does not apply to immediate family members (spouse, common-law partner, or unmarried child under the age of 21) of an eligible national of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, or Venezuela with whom they are traveling,” USCIS states on its website outlining the parole guidelines.

Herrara Mellado, however, believes there are exceptions to that rule, which allows for 30,000 migrants from the four applicable nationalities to receive parole each month, which USCIS will likely grant.

“I’m pretty sure we’re going to get lots of people now with that situation. People either claim they have a second nationality. And how is this government gonna know that they don’t?,” she said.
