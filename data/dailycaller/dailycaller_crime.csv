"Gun crime continues to decrease, despite increase in gun sales","Despite increases in gun sales, gun crimes continued to decrease in the United States for the fourth straight year in 2010, according to the FBI.

The FBI recently released its Crime in The United States statistics for 2010. Overall, murders in the U.S. have decreased steadily since 2006, dropping from 15,087 to 12,996. Firearms murders — which made up 67 percent of all murders in the U.S. in 2010 — have followed this trend, decreasing by 14 percent.

At the same time that firearms murders were dropping, gun sales were surging. In 2009, FBI background checks for guns increased by 30 percent over the previous year, while firearms sales in large retail outlets increased by almost 40 percent. The number of applications for concealed carry permits jumped across the country as well.

“There was a huge spike,” NRA spokesperson Rachel Parsons said. “It’s probably mellowed out and gone back to normal now.”

There is no national registry of guns, but based on sales-tracking and other figures, the National Rifle Association estimates there are 80 to 90 million gun owners in the U.S.

Naturally, there is dispute over the significance of the surge in gun sales. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, for instance, says gun ownership in America is actually declining.

“While there are more people with concealed carry permits and there has been an increase in gun sales, the research indicates overwhelmingly that the same people are simply buying more guns and that there has been a sharp decline in the percentage of Americans who own guns,” Brady Campaign spokesperson Caroline Brewer said. “So while there may be more guns, they are in the hands of a smaller percentage of Americans.”

Pro-Second Amendment advocacy groups have used the decrease in gun crime, and crime in general, as a counter to gun control advocates’ claims that more firearms lead to more gun violence. They also point to the statistics as evidence of the ineffectiveness of gun control laws. (RELATED: Widow of ‘Whitey’ Bulger victim suggests foul play in payment of $2.1 million FBI reward)

The top three states for gun murders in 2010 were, in order, California, Texas and New York. While Texas has lax gun control laws, California and New York are among the strictest gun-control states in the country.

“California is in a category of its own as far as gun control laws there,” Parsons said. “New York is a little bit better, but they still have discretionary concealed carry laws.”

According to FBI data, California had the most gun murders last year —- 1,257, which is 69 percent of all murders in 2010.

Nevertheless, California gun murders are still down by 8 percent from the previous year.

Broken down by firearms murder rate per 100,000 people, the District of Columbia is number one, with 16 firearms murders per 100,000 people in the District.

D.C. also topped the list of firearm robberies per 100,000 people with 255.98.

Yet D.C. arguably has the tightest gun laws in the country. Although an outright ban on handguns was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2008, legislators ensured the new regulations for obtaining a registered handgun would be anything but easy.

Like California, the number of firearms murders in D.C. — 99 in 2010 — dropped by 12 percent from the previous year.

However, the Brady Campaign argues cities with high rates of gun crime, yet strict gun laws, suffer from being next to states with more lax gun control.

“You’ve got states with weaker laws right at the border and have populations that are constantly coming in and out,” Brewer said. “Chicago is right next to Indiana, which has almost no gun laws.”

Likewise, Washington, D.C. is sandwiched between Maryland and Virginia.

The Brady Campaign also points to the Brady Law, which was enacted in 1993 and requires background checks for firearms purchases, as a reducer of gun crime.

Assigning causes to increases or decreases in the national crime rate is a notorious fool’s errand because of the amount of variables at play, but what the numbers don’t suggest is any clear correlation between gun crime, gun ownership and gun-control laws.

It bears noting that the FBI’s data, based on reports from local law enforcement, is far from comprehensive. There are no numbers for Florida on firearm murders, and the data for Illinois is “incomplete.”

The FBI also warns against using the data to rank areas against each other, noting that rankings “are merely a quick choice made by the data user; they provide no insight into the many variables that mold the crime in a particular town, city, county, state, region or other jurisdiction.”

“Consequently, these rankings lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting cities and counties, along with their residents,” the FBI continued.

Blind Chinese dissident’s crime: Challenging China’s one-child policy,"Chen Guangcheng — the blind, and now famous, Chinese dissident — garnered global attention last week when he escaped to the U.S. embassy and set off an international diplomatic firestorm. But the matter he fought for, and which brought the full might of his government down on him, has gone relatively unnoticed: the brutality of China’s one-child policy.

A 2005 report written by Chinese human right activist and professor Teng Biao featured Guangcheng’s research, which uncovered 130,000 cases of forced sterilizations and forced abortions in the Linyi County of the Shanghai Province in 2005. The report, released just before Guangcheng’s four-year imprisonment and detention, documents graphic examples of nighttime raids, murder, torture and intimidation.

Because of his focus on China’s one-child policy, Guangcheng earned himself and his family the special ire of the Communist government authorities, Reggie Littlejohn, president of Women’s Rights Without Frontiers, told The Daily Caller. (RELATED: Chinese dissident: US official said wife would be killed)

While protesting many issues — such as religious persecution, censorship and corruption — attracts scrutiny and punishment in China, the one-child policy, Littlejohn said, may top the list.

“In my opinion,” Littlejohn told TheDC, “the reason that the full weight of the Chinese Communist Party is coming down on Chen is because he has dared to fight back against the one-child policy — which is probably the most central policy of the Chinese Communist Party.”

While experts have pointed out that the policy is leading to an unsustainably aging population and civil unrest, Beijing clings ferociously to the one-child rule, Littlejohn said, because “it is the glue that’s holding the government in power.” (RELATED: Global risk consultant: World is changing but ‘absolutely foolish’ to bet against the US)

“The institution of coercion required to maintain the one-child policy can be turned to put down any sort of democracy, so it’s maintained because of the infrastructure,” Littlejohn told TheDC. “Secondly, the one-child policy has maintained a system of paid informants — of neighbors, friends, coworkers, people just walking down the street — who may notice you look bigger. And what having these paid informants does is it tears apart the natural sort of affection, loyalty and trust in Chinese society. If people don’t know who they can trust, they can’t organize for democracy.”

In 14 notes in the report, Guangcheng specifically referenced, among other brutalities, the kidnapping and two-day beating of a 59-year-old man whose daughter was not home when a sterilization squad came at 6 a.m.; a twenty-day campaign of nighttime forced-sterilization raids; the forced abortion and sterilization of a seven-month pregnant woman and the detention of 22 of her relatives because of “implication”; a “woman kidnapped and tortured for 30 days because her brother” in another city “had an ‘extra child’”; “villagers detained, tortured and required to pay ‘tuition’ in [a] Linyi ‘Family Planning Learning Class’”; and birth quotas resulting in the forced sterilization of “12 percent of the total population.”

Report: Violent crime rates rose nationwide in 2011,"Violent crime rates are up across the United States, the first time in ten years those statistics have shown an increase.

According to a report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, violent crime increased 17 percent from 2010 to 2011.

Approximately 23 of every 1,000 Americans were victims of violent crime in 2011, compared to 19 in 2010. Overall, nearly 6 million Americans were victimized last year.

The number of assaults increased 22 percent, the largest increase documented in the report.

“We don’t know if this is the beginning of a trend,” Daniel Schneider, an American University transnational crime professor, told The Daily Caller.

“That said, there are a couple things that could be at play here. One is a higher unemployment rate, which often leads, but not always, to higher crime rates.”

Schneider is also a former legal adviser for the Justice Department.

According to the report, the majority of these victims of violent crime are whites, males, Hispanics, and younger people. The highest rates of serious violence were among Americans living in urban areas.

Schneider also cited drugs as a possible factor for higher crime rates. “A possible reason is drug related offenses, particularly drugs that are from Mexico with the drug traffic organizations in Mexico bringing them across the border for distribution,” he said.

“For instance there has been an increase in murder in Chicago, some are attributing that to drugs in Mexico,” Schneider added.

About 17 million Americans were victims of a property crime in 2011, an 11 percent increase from the year before. Close to 140 of every 1,000 American households saw a property crime in 2011, compared to 125 in 2010.

Household burglary alone increased by 14 percent. Thirty of every 1,000 households saw break-ins in 2011. That robbery statistic was 26 in 2010.

"Report: In Virginia, more guns, less crime","As gun ownership has increased dramatically, gun-related violent crimes have gradually decreased over the past six years in the state of Virginia, according to a new analysis.

From 2006 to 2011, the total number of guns purchased in Virginia increased 73 percent, while the total number of gun-related violent crimes decreased 24 percent over that period. And when adjusted for population growth, the number of crimes further decreases to more than 27 percent, with 79 gun-related offenses per 100,000 in 2006 dropping to 57 by 2011.

Virginia Commonwealth University professor Thomas R. Baker conducted the analysis at the request of the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Baker told the paper that the findings appear to contradict the popular premise that more guns cause more violent crime.

“While there is a wealth of academic literature attempting to demonstrate the relationship between guns and crime, a very simple and intuitive demonstration of the numbers seems to point away from the premise that more guns leads to more crime, at least in Virginia,” said Baker.

Baker examined data from the Virginia Firearms Transaction Center, which tracks the number of gun transactions for every federally licensed Virginia firearm dealer, to state crime data from 2006 to 2011. That data demonstrated that an increase in gun purchases one year was often followed by a decrease in gun crime the next year.

“So the only thing it could be is that more guns are causing less crime,” Baker concluded, noting that the data is “pretty overwhelming.”

Additionally, this trend held true when comparing purchases of all types of firearms, including pistols, revolvers, shotguns and rifles, to gun crime during that period.

The number of gun purchases in the state rose to a record-breaking 420,829 purchases last year, according to gun-dealer transaction data.

Baker believes guns become a political issue because criminals use them and the notion that guns cause crime is “persuasive.” But he notes those individuals focus on the wrong component.

“Instead of trying to figure out why are these people committing crimes — and using the most effective tool to commit those crimes — they focus on the tool,” he continued. “So the gun is causing the crime.”

Coulter slams media for hyping rare white-on-black crime while ignoring black-on-white crime,"On Saturday’s broadcast of “Justice with Judge Jeanine” on the Fox News Channel, conservative commentator Ann Coulter took aim at the media for its handling of interracial crime, accusing it of playing up rare white-on-black crime while ignoring the more prevalent black-on-white crime.

Coulter, author of “Mugged: Racial Demagoguery from the Seventies to Obama,” blamed President Barack Obama for the phenomenon and cited Justice Department statistics on interracial rape to make her case.

“It was much worse in the ’70s, ’80s,” Coulter said. “We’re getting back to it. Obama brought it all back and that’s this racial etiquette from the media. They don’t report on the much more common black-on-white crime, but the very rare man-bites-dog story of white-on-black crime — that gets covered hysterically not because it is a man-bites-dog story, but they act as if, ‘No, this is all too common, it’s the racism in America.’ No, it is very rare. In one example of my book — rape cases, interracial rape cases, the number of black-on-white rapes going back 15 years, 15 years there are about 1,000-to-2,000 a year black-on-white rapes. For 15 years according to the Department of Justice victimization surveyd, the number of white-on-black rapes are either 0.0 or sample too small for a number.”

Coulter referenced the beating death of 88-year-old World War II veteran Delbert “Shorty” Belton and the lack of coverage of it in places beyond the Drudge Report and Fox News as evidence that the media tend to ignore white-on-black crime.

Watch:

“Well, you technically introduced the subject, but I do think it has been covered a lot more on Fox News than it has been other places,” she said. “And part of the reason this and the ‘Shorty’ case — I don’t think the ‘Shorty’ case has shown up anyplace on MSNBC. Yes, it was the cover of Drudge. We do have some of our own media now. The only reason it they’re being covered by Fox News and by Drudge is because it is in the wake of Trayvon Martin when we were told that, you know, black people in America have to be afraid of whites murdering them.”

As for what motivates those types of crimes, including the Belton murder and the murder of Australian baseball player Chris Lane in Oklahoma, Coulter blames the destruction of the black family, adding that whites are catching up with blacks in that category.

“I just want to answer why quickly because that goes back, two books back to ‘Guilty,’” she added, referring to one of her previous books. “It is very, very heavily associated with single motherhood and the destruction of mostly the black family, but the white families are catching up.”

"FBI: More guns, less violent crime","By NRA-ILA

Two sets of data published by the FBI seven months apart show increased gun ownership coinciding with a reduction in violent crime.

Last July, the FBI completed its monthly update of an online table showing the number of firearm-related checks conducted through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The new numbers showed that the number of checks increased from 8.9 million during the first six months of 2012, to a whopping 11.4 million during the same period in 2013, an increase of 29 percent.

Gun control supporters pretend that NICS checks that result in denials perfectly correspond with the denial of firearms to aspiring violent criminals, while denying that the numbers of approved checks indicate anything at all about trends in firearms purchases. However, while not as reliable an indicator of firearm purchase trends as the Annual Firearms Manufacturers and Export Reports and Firearms Commerce in the United States reports complied by the BATFE, the FBI’s NICS numbers provide a fair indication of such trends. Even though not all approved checks result in the acquisition of firearms, some checks result in the acquisition of multiple firearms. And even though some checks are conducted for carry permit purposes, some firearms are acquired through licensed dealers without a NICS check, based upon the exemption available in some states for persons licensed to possess or carry a firearm.

This week, the FBI issued a report comparing the numbers of violent and property crimes reported by law enforcement agencies during the first half of 2012 to the numbers reported during the first half of 2013. According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports Section, “Preliminary figures indicate that, as a whole, law enforcement agencies throughout the nation reported a decrease of 5.4 percent in the number of violent crimes brought to their attention for the first 6 months of 2013 when compared with figures reported for the same time in 2012.”

Under the Uniform Crime Reporting System, violent crime consists of four categories of crime, each of which experienced decreases during the first half of 2013. Murders decreased 6.9 percent, rapes decreased 10.6 percent, robberies decreased 1.8 percent, and aggravated assaults decreased 6.6 percent. Of 30 cities of 500,000 or greater population, 20 reported decreases in murders, two reported no change in their numbers, and only eight reported increases.

Given these figures, we shouldn’t be surprised that a prominent gun control messaging guide counsels its readers to “[a]lways focus on emotional and value-driven arguments about gun violence, not the political food fight in Washington or wonky statistics.” This is sound advice from their perspective, as the facts sure don’t support what they are trying to do.

"Rocky Mountain High: After 6 Months, Crime Down, Tax Revenue Up In Colorado","Six months after Colorado became the first state to sanction the legal sale of recreational marijuana, it is nearly $11 million richer in retail sales taxes.

The state also has another $1.9 million in excise taxes earmarked for school construction, according to a report card by the Drug Policy Alliance.

The organization also reports a 5.2 percent decrease in violent crime in Denver, where most marijuana stores are located, and a savings of $12 million to $40 million by years’ end for not having to enforce old marijuana possession laws.

The report also cites the Marijuana Industry Group’s estimation that 10,000 people are directly employed by the legal pot industry and quotes Gov. John Hickenlooper — who opposed the passage of Amendment 64, which legalized sale and possession for adults — saying, “While the rest of the country’s economy is slowly picking back up, we’re thriving here in Colorado.”

And just recently, regulators with the state Marijuana Enforcement Division announced that all marijuana stores inspected for compliance in not selling pot to minors passed the test. (RELATED: Colorado Pot Shops Pass ‘No-Kids’ Test With Flying Colors)

“I think so many things people were scared about have been shown to be nonsense,” Michael Elliot, executive director of the Marijuana Industry Group, told Denver’s 7News.

But drug counselors caution that other consequences of the new law present concerns.

A Denver detox facility reported that 15 percent of its patients arrested for driving under the influence had been smoking marijuana — an increase from 8 percent during the first three months of 2013.

“This percentage increase is significant because recreational marijuana legalization is in its infancy, and there has clearly already been an impact on public safety,” Art Schut, the CEO of Arapahoe House, told USA Today. “Our hope is that this new data will create awareness so that if Coloradans choose to use marijuana, they do not get behind the wheel.”

The state is also still tweaking its regulations, especially around the sale and packaging of edible marijuana found in cookies, candies and other products that can be easily mistaken for benign treats.

The Rocky Mountain Poison Control Center has reported 19 cases so far this year of children under five accidentally eating marijuana-laced food, according to 7News, The center also reported that 11 kids were treated for marijuana ingestion at Children’s Hospital Colorado, six of whom were critically ill.

DNA Testing Shut Down At DC Crime Lab Due To ‘Incompetent’ Analysts,"D.C.’s expensive new crime lab has been ordered to stop all DNA testing after an audit found the lab’s procedures to be “insufficient and inadequate.”

The audit, published Friday by ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board, which oversees the nation’s DNA testing labs, found that the District’s Department of Forensic Science did not comply with the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s standard practices, the Washington Post reported.

All the insufficient analyses performed by DFS are in the process of being reviewed, but the review will not stop the investigation or prosecution of crimes in the district.

However, it is possible that hundreds of criminal cases in D.C., including murders and sexual assaults, could be affected if evidence involved in the cases was handled at the tainted lab.

The audit said analysts in the lab’s DNA testing operation “were not competent,” and Mayor Muriel Bowser, who commissioned the report, gave the lab 30 days to correct its misdeeds.

Issues concerning the lab’s DNA mixture interpretation protocols were first raised last year by the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, and as a result the USAO stopped sending new DNA cases to the lab in January. The USAO commissioned its own audit in conjunction with the mayor’s.

At the time, the Post reported interpretation errors were found in six different cases, with the most egregious error involving DNA found on the gearshift of a stolen car. Analysts at the D.C. lab said a DNA sample from the car had a 1-in-3,290 chance of belonging to someone other than the car’s owner, while an third-party expert said there was just a 1-in-9 chance.

“I am troubled by the longstanding issues at DFS as identified in the audits,” Bowser said in a statement. “District residents spent $200 million to build a state-of-the-art facility and expect its work to be beyond reproach.”

Deputy City Administrator Kevin Donahue will oversee a thorough review of all forensic and scientific practices performed at DFS and implement a corrective action plan that addresses concerns raised in the audit.

According to the Bowser statement, the analysis will review training and management protocols, and another third-party investigation will focus on all of the other forensic activities carried out by the agency, including fingerprints and firearms, to make sure they are up to par.

D.C. Councilman Kenyan McDuffie, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that ensuring the integrity of the DNA testing is a top priority for him and he will be pursuing the issue with committee colleagues.

“Any deficiencies in the work performed by the (DNA testing lab) must be immediately addressed due to the broader implications of inaccurate forensic testing on the fair administration of justice in our courts,” he said.

De Blasio: What NYC Crime Spike?,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio disputes that crime in New York City is on the rise despite the recent Central Park muggings, spike in shootings, the rise in murders, and subway vandalism, among other criminal acts.

There were 44 shooting victims last week. This is a 76 percent increase from the prior week, New York’s CBS channel 2’s Diane Macedo reported.

“Well the NYPD statistics say — and Commissioner Bratton has made it quite clear that the overall crime rate of the major index crimes is going down in New York City even compared to last year, which was a record year in crime reduction,” de Blasio told The Daily Caller at a presser in Washington D.C.

“There are some areas where we clearly have to do better. We’re implementing a host of new strategies including freeing up an immense amount of police time to address serious crime, because we’re not doing the stop and frisk policy of the past,” he said.

De Blasio, who was in the nation’s capitol promoting the Progressive Agenda To Combat Income Inequality, noted that the NYPD is no longer arresting large numbers of young people for having a low amount of marijuana.

“So, a lot is being done right now to put additional resources out to address the problems we do have, but the fact is, and please check with the NYPD with this, overall index crime in New York City has gone down this year compared to the same time last year.”

As Mayor de Blasio becomes more of a national political figure, some in New York City are concerned he is spending too much time on the road campaigning on national liberal issues and not spending enough time in the city taking care of the crime issues at home.

“He’s entering a path that can be dangerous for big-city mayors,” Kenneth Sherrill, a retired political science professor at Hunter College, told CBS New York. “It’s not unusual for a New York City mayor to be a national speaker for urban issues. But it is unusual for one to be so concerned about his national political party and its issues.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2015/05/12/de-blasio-what-nyc-crime-spike/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj7-Z74gLT9AhWwFlkFHYzZCsE4RhAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw0X5iaApfQjF4ZX7TlhmBpF,2015-05-12
Ben Carson Calls Planned Parenthood Shooting A ‘Hate Crime’ [VIDEO],"Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson weighed in Sunday on Friday’s shooting a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, calling it a “hate crime” and saying that both sides of the abortion debate should “tone down their rhetoric.”

“Any hate crime is a horrible thing no matter from where it comes and should be condemned very strongly,” Carson said during an interview on ABC’s “This Week.”

Robert Lewis Dear, 57, killed three people and wounded nine more in a shooting which began shortly before noon on Friday near the Planned Parenthood clinic. (RELATED: Colorado Springs Shooter Robert L. Dear Was An Accused Peeping Tom Once Arrested For Animal Cruelty)

It is still unclear where the shooting started and whether any Planned Parenthood employees or patients were injured. But Dear did surrender inside of the Planned Parenthood facility after a five hour standoff. Anonymous sources have told several news outlets that Dear made a comment about “no more baby parts,” an apparent reference to videos which show Planned Parenthood officials negotiating the sale of fetal tissue.

During during his ABC News interview, Carson was quick to add that “there is a lot of extremism from all areas.”

“We get into our separate corners, and we hate each other…it comes from both sides,” Carson said.

WATCH:

In a separate interview, Carson said that the abortion debate has given way to “hateful rhetoric” from both the pro-life and pro-choice sides.

“There is no question that hateful rhetoric, no matter which side it comes from, right or left, is something that is detrimental to our society,” Carson told CBS “Face the Nation” host John Dickerson.

“No question, the hateful rhetoric exacerbates the situation,” he added.

Asked by Dickerson if abortion opponents should tone down their rhetoric, Carson agreed, though he hedged his response to include abortion supporters.

“I think both sides should tone down their rhetoric and engage in civil discussion,” Carson said.

WATCH:

In calling the shooting a hate crime, Carson joins fellow social conservative, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, as the two Republicans who have most strongly condemned Dear’s actions.

During an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Huckabee called the shooting “domestic terrorism.”

“There’s no legitimizing, there’s no rationalizing. It was mass murder,” Huckabee said. “It was absolutely unfathomable. And there’s no excuse for killing other people, whether it’s happening inside the Planned Parenthood headquarters, inside their clinics where many millions of babies die, or whether it’s people attacking Planned Parenthood.”

In a third interview Carson conducted on Sunday, he declined to go as far as Huckabee in calling the shooting “terrorism.”

“Planned Parenthood is calling this now an act of domestic terrorism. Do you agree with that assessment?” CNN “State of the Union” host Brianna Keilar asked Carson.

“It certainly is an act of extreme hatred and violence,” Carson responded.

BLM Organizer: ‘The Myth Of Black-On-Black Crime Is Just That — A Myth’ [VIDEO],"Aaron Goggans — the core organizer of Black Lives Matter, DC — told CNN’s Carol Costello Thursday that black-on-black crime is a myth.

Goggans was responding to a video former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis posted earlier in the week in which he called for removing guns from the streets as a key part of solving the problem of black-on-black crime. (VIDEO: Ray Lewis Calls For 25 Year Mandatory Prison Sentence For Illegal Firearm Possession)

“It’s important to talk about the myth of black-on-black crime as just that — a myth,” Goggans explained. “Any Google search of the term comes up with a lot of different articles.”

“So, Ray Lewis is wrong?” interjected Costello.

Goggans responded that “Ray Lewis is talking about a lot of myths and preconceptions about what the [Black Lives Matter] movement is.”

“Intercommunity crime happens in all communities across the country, and it is a problem that the movement of Black Lives is focusing on,” he added. “The movement of black lives is also focusing on state sanctioned violence. It’s a different thing.”

“It’s not just a few white cops killing a few unarmed black men. It’s actually the state systematically creating up systems that are killing black people, both black women, black children, black queer, black men, black trans and black gender non-conforming folks.”

Judge Rules ‘I Hate White People’ Attack Not A Hate Crime,"A Calgary provincial court judge ruled that an aboriginal woman knocking out the tooth of a white woman while yelling “I hate white people” does not constitute a hate crime.

Judge Harry Van Harten stated clearly in his decision that the attack on November 1, 2015 had nothing to do with racial bias, saying there was insufficient evidence to support that classification, the Calgary Sun reports.

“There is no evidence either way about what the offender meant or whether … she holds or promotes an ideology which would explain why this assault was aimed at this victim,” Van Harten said.

“I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that this offence was, even in part, motivated by racial bias,” he added.

Tamara Crowchief approached Lydia White outside a pub Nov. 1, yelled “I hate white people” and punched her right in the face. White lost a tooth.

Police quickly arrived on the scene and arrested Crowchief, who said that “the white man was out to get her.”

None of that convinced Van Harten that the incident was a hate crime. Instead, Van Harten decided a proper punishment for Crowchief was probation for 12 months and an order to get psychological counseling. Crowchief also can’t consume intoxicating substances.

Prosecutor Karuna Ramakrishnan was hoping for a sentence of 12 to 15 months and a declaration that the attack was a hate crime.

“I still get angry when I think about it,” Lydia White said in a statement. “I don’t understand why this woman did this.”

“I never did anything to her,” she added. “Never even spoke to her.”

Ferguson’s Violent Crime Rate Skyrockets In Aftermath Of Brown Shooting,"The city of Michael Brown’s death experienced an almost 65 percent increase in violent crime in the year following the fatal shooting.

Ferguson, Mo. experienced 900 violent crimes per 100,000 residents in 2015, a sizable increase from 545 violent crimes per 100,000 residents in 2014. This represents a surge of 65 percent, as noted by Heather Mac Donald in National Review.

Compared to Ferguson, the national averages for violent crimes were far less. The national average was 362 per 100,000 residents in 2014, while seeing 373 violent crimes per 100,000 residents in 2015, according to FBI statistics.

In 2014, the year Brown died, Ferguson had a total population of 21,090. FBI crime statistics revealed that the city experienced 115 violent crimes and two murders.

The year after Brown’s death, 2015, the city had a population of 21,059 and saw 190 violent crimes and five murders.

Officer Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown Aug. 9, 2014. Prosecutors and the Department of Justice investigation found that despite the clear instructions, “Hands up, don’t shoot,” Brown tried to grab Wilson’s gun. Wilson fatally shot Brown after he tried to charge Wilson. (RELATED:Michael Brown’s Family To File Wrongful Death Lawsuit Against Ferguson)

The Ferguson protests that occurred after contributed to the Black Lives Matter movement, with protesters chanting,”no justice, no peace” in the streets.

The year after Brown’s death also saw a rise in robbery and aggravated assault. Aggravated assault went up 58 percent in Ferguson; there were 60 aggravated assaults committed in 2014 and 95 aggravated assaults committed in 2015.

Robberies rose 60 percent as well. Ferguson saw 51 robberies committed in 2014 and 82 robberies done in 2015.

Ferguson witnessed an increase in the rise of violent crime the year before Brown’s death, though not at the rates seen after his death. From 2013 to 2014, Ferguson experienced an almost 14 percent increase in violent crimes.

2016: The Year Of The Hoax Hate Crime,"The 2016 year saw an explosion in “hate crime” accounts that turned out to be hoaxes. Many of those accounts were attributed to supporters of Donald Trump.

TheDC compiled some of the best — or worst — hoaxes of 2016.

Albany University Race Hoax Fools The Media — And Hillary Clinton

Three black women at the University of Albany earned media coverage from liberal outlets like CNN in February when they claimed a white mob followed them onto a bus, hurling racial slurs and later attacking them. The alleged attack even caught the attention of Hillary Clinton, who sent a personal tweet stating that “There’s no excuse for racism and violence on a college campus.” There’s just one problem: the students made the whole thing up.

BuzzFeed Falls For Hoax Cliven Bundy Story

Shortly after the Bundys seized control of a federal building in Oregon, BuzzFeed ran a story titled “Cliven Bundy Claims Obama Threatened Donald Trump In Bizarre Hand-Written Lawsuit.” According to the original story, Bundy filed a bizarre lawsuit claiming — among other things — that President Obama forced Bundy to perform oral sex on Obama’s dogs. As it turns out, Bundy never filed such a lawsuit. A prankster felon named David Rothrock who has nothing to do with Bundy filed the hoax lawsuit in his name in 2014, fooling BuzzFeed with it almost two years later.

Lesbian Professor Fakes A Hate Crime To ‘Raise Awareness’

A lesbian professor at the University of Central Michigan claimed to have been the victim of a hate crime at a Toby Keith concert in which a random man called her a “cross-dressing fag” before beating her up. The professor, Mari Poindexter, admitted in March that she had, in fact, punched herself in the face and invented the story. Poindexter claims she made up the story in order to “raise awareness about the social hardships of people in the LGBTQ+ community.”

Salisbury Hate Crime Involving Noose And Racial Slurs Turns Out To Be A Hoax

In April, ths campus police department at Salisbury University opened a “hate crime” investigation after a noose was drawn on a university white board, alongside the word “Nigger!” and the hashtag “#WhitePower” As it turns out, the “hate crime” was the handiwork of two black students (who were not charged).

Gay Man Fakes Whole Foods’ Anti-Gay Cake

Also in April, a gay Texas pastor named Jordan Brown sued Whole Foods claiming that he had ordered a cake with the words “LOVE WINS” written on it in icing, only to receive it with the words “LOVE WINS FAG” written instead. Brown later dropped the lawsuit and admitted Whole Foods “did nothing wrong” after the company filed a counter-suit and released footage showing when Brown picked up the cake, sans homophobic slur.

Student Loses Fight, Concocts Race Hoax To Cover It Up

A black student at the University of Iowa generated outrage in May when he claimed to have been attacked by three white men spitting racial epithets, sending him to the hospital. As it turns out, the black student’s facial injuries were the result of him starting a fight and then losing it. The student, Marcus Owens, reportedly made up the fictitious hate crime in order to cover up the truth about the original fight.

Black Activist Jailed For Hoax Racist Death Threats

In June, a black activist named Kayla-Simone McKelvey was sentenced to 90 days in jail for using a Kean University computer — her alma mater — to tweet death threats to black students, threatening to “kill all the blacks tonight.”

‘Racist Middle Schoolers’ Story Turns Out To Be A Hoax

Arlington, Massachusetts police opened an investigation in late June over a series of racist text messages allegedly sent by a 12-year-old girl to an Indian student. That, too, turned out to be a hoax.

Bisexual Student Fakes Trump-Inspired Hate Crime

The aftermath of Donald Trump’s election last month saw an explosion in “hate crime” reports supposedly inspired by The Donald. Many Trump-inspired “hate crimes,” however, turned out to be hoaxes. In one such instance, Taylor Volk, an openly bisexual senior at North Park University claimed to be the target of hateful notes and emails, telling NBC News that “I just want them to stop.” But the “them” referenced by Volk turned out to be herself, as the whole thing was fabricated.

Prankster Tricks Liberal Journalist Into Spreading Hoax Trump-Inspired Hate Crime

As tales of Trump-inspired “hate crimes” were spread far and wide by liberal journalists, one Internet prankster decided to test just how committed those journalists were to their narrative. The prankster sent Mic.com writer Sarah Harvard a fictitious story in which a Native American claimed to have been harassed by an alleged Trump supporter who thought she was Mexican. Despite no evidence backing up the claim, Harvard spread the fake story. (RELATED: Journalist Trick Into Spreading Hoax Trump-Inspired Attack [VIDEO])

Muslim Woman Robbed Of Her Hijab And Wallet — NOT!

An 18-year-old Muslim woman in Louisiana claimed two white men, one of whom was wearing a Trump hat, attacked and robbed her, taking her wallet and hijab while yelling racial slurs. She later admitted to the Lafayette Police Department that she made the whole thing up.

Gas Station Racism Goes Viral, Is Later Exposed As A Hoax

In a Facebook post that went viral, a black woman in Philadelphia claimed she was harassed by white, Trump-supporting males, one of whom pulled a weapon on her. The woman, Ashley Boyer, claimed that the men “proceeded to talk about the election and how they’re glad they won’t have to deal with n—–s much longer.” Boyer deleted the post after it went viral, later claiming the men had been caught and were facing criminal charges, before local police debunked her account.

Anti-Muslim Hate Crime In Michigan Turns Out To Be A Hoax

A Muslim woman at the University of Michigan received national attention from liberal outlets like The Washington Post after claiming a drunk 20-something man threatened to light her on fire and forced her to remove her hijab. The university condemned the “hateful attack,” which turned out to be a hoax.

‘Drunk White Men’ Attack Muslim Woman In Story That Never Happened

An 18-year-old Muslim woman named Yasmin Seweid was the subject of breathless headlines after she claimed to have been attacked by a group of Donald Trump supporters on a New York subway while onlookers did nothing. She, too, would go on to confess that she made the whole thing up.

Trump-Inspired Racist Blaze At Black Church Was Carried Out By Black Churchgoer

A week before the election, liberal news organizations ran headlines like “A Black Church Burned in the Name of Trump” after a black church in Greenville, Mississippi was set on fire and spray painted with the words “Vote Trump.” The Washington Post’s coverage of the incident read in part, “Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons called the fire a ‘hateful and cowardly act,’ sparked by the incendiary rhetoric of GOP nominee Donald Trump during his presidential campaign.” But the church was burned down by one of the church’s own congregants, who is black.

Media Buys A Hoax From Muslim YouTube Star Known For Hoaxes

"Hate Crime Charges Filed In Torture, Kidnapping Of White Man In Chicago [VIDEO]","Hate crime and kidnapping charges have been filed against four African-Americans who abducted and tortured an 18-year-old white man with special needs in Chicago.

Chicago police charged three 18-year-olds — Jordan Hill, Tesfaye Cooper and Brittany Covington — with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, according to NBC Chicago. Tanishia Covington, 24, faces similar charges.

CPD Arrested and Charged all four offenders with Hate Crime, as well as other charges, from West Side kidnapping and attack. Presser@2:15 pic.twitter.com/EoYnluf573 — Chicago Police (@Chicago_Police) January 5, 2017

The four were arrested on Wednesday after a video from Facebook Live surfaced of the suspects shouting “fuck white people” and “fuck Donald Trump” as they tortured 18-year-old Austin Hilbourn.

Hilbourn, who lives in a Chicago suburb and has been described as having “mental health challenges,” was shown bound and gagged as the suspects beat him, cut him with a knife and forced him to drink water from a toilet.

Hilbourn disappeared on Dec. 31 after his parents dropped him off at a McDonald’s. One of the suspects later called Hilsbourn’s parents to say that they had his son in captivity. The kidnappers released Hilbourn who was found by police in a state of shock. Investigators believe that he was held captive for at least 24 hours. They also believe that one of the suspects knew Hilbourn from school. (RELATED: 4 People Arrested After Anti-White, Anti-Trump Torture Video Surfaces)

Police on Wednesday declined to characterize the brutal torture as a hate crime. Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson also declined to speculate whether the attackers, despite yelling anti-Donald Trump rhetoric, were politically motivated.

The suspects are expected to appear in court on Friday, NBC Chicago reported.

COULTER: Tips For Hate Crime Hoaxers,"In a country of more than 320 million people, everything must happen once. So it’s somewhat surprising that not one of the alleged post-election hate crimes committed by Trump supporters has turned out to be true.

They are false in one of two ways: Either they aren’t “hate” or they aren’t true. This week, we’ll provide tips for selling a hate crime that didn’t happen.

Hate Crime Hoaxer Tip No. 1: Don’t invent hate crimes that could form the opening of a Harlequin Romance.

Liberal girls always seem to be imagining strong, rough, Heathcliff-type white men demanding that they disrobe or become “sex slaves.” (Oddly, Heathcliff keeps doing this in well-trafficked areas in the middle of the day with no witnesses.)

The hijab hoaxer at the University of Michigan described her imaginary Trump-supporting pursuer as white, in his 20s or 30s, with an athletic build, unkempt and intoxicated. He demanded that she remove her hijab. (After a police investigation, she admitted she made it up.)

The alleged hijab victim at University of New Mexico, Leena Aggad, said her hijab was ripped off by “a really buff guy wearing a Trump shirt.” (The attack was serious enough for her to tell the media about it, but not serious enough to report it to campus security, much less the police.)

A 28-year-old black woman, Kara Stevens, claimed three Trump-supporting white men in their 30s approached her in a Safeway parking lot in Hillsboro, Oregon, mentioned Donald Trump — then threatened to turn her into their “sex slave”! (Investigation suspended with no video, no witnesses and no evidence.)

With a little more imagination, these stories could become the new “Fifty Shades of Grey.”

Hate Crime Hoaxer Tip No. 2: Don’t accuse white men of throwing things at you — even if it allows you to issue inspirational quotes, suitable for framing, like: “It’s going to take more than a brick to break me!”

An African-American woman, Eleesha Long, claimed that, the day after the election, three white men in Trump shirts threw rocks at her on the campus of Bowling Green State University.

The Safeway “sex slave,” Kara Stevens, claimed the Trump-supporters threw a brick at her. (She, of the inspirational quote.)

We’ve seen lots of rock-, bottle- and brick-throwing recently — in Ferguson, Baltimore, Charlotte, Oakland, Chicago — in fact, pretty much whenever disaffected urban youth encounter the police.

We’ve seen Mexicans throw eggs at Trump supporters and rocks at the police.

(See, e.g., videos here http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/protesters-assault-trump-supporters-eggs-bottles-punches-after-rally and here, http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/chaotic-scene-erupts-trump-rally-mexico/story?id=39354635 .)

We’ve seen Brazilians throw rocks at journalists at the Olympic Games in Rio, Palestinians throw rocks at the military in Israel, and Muslim “refugees” throw rocks at the police in Europe.

But throwing things at people never really caught on with white men over the age of 6. (NOTE: Sen. John McCain’s bellicose sidekick is a notable exception — CNS News: Sen. Lindsey Graham, “I’m Ready to Throw a Rock” at Russia.)

Even sad, directionless, white (alleged) “men” at Occupy Wall Street protests — i.e., the molecular opposite of a Trump supporter — don’t seem to have thrown rocks at cops. The rock-throwing was done by their minority backup.

(See, e.g., videos here: youtube.com/watch?v=cdhBxQlzIgI, and here: youtube.com/watch?v=CaSjw1tgGOI.)

Again, we’re a country of 320 million people, so it must have happened sometime, but the 21st-century white American male is the most pacific — and least rock-throwing — Y-chromosomed being ever to walk the Earth.

Black women accusing white men of throwing rocks at them are thinking of what they would do, not what their athletically built, white male, Trump-supporting Lotharios would do.

Hate Crime Hoaxer Tip No. 3: Don’t post your tale of victimology on Facebook if your father may read it, worry about you and call the police. That’s what Eleesha Long’s father did, which — to Miss Long’s eternal embarrassment — led to a police investigation.

The cops found clear evidence of hate — hers. She’d texted her boyfriend such sweet nothings as, “I haven’t met a decent Trump supporter yet” and “I hope they all get AIDS.”

More significant in terms of the penal code, police determined from her cellphone records that she was nowhere near the site of the alleged rock-throwing incident.

Hate crime hoaxers, I don’t think I need to tell you this, but you do NOT want a police investigation. Much better to send anonymous reports into America’s leading hate group, the Southern Poverty Law Center, so your story can appear in The New York Times, The Washington Post, ABC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, the “Today” show, “Good Morning America,” etc., etc.

A brick might not break you, but a police investigation will.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2017/01/12/coulter-tips-for-hate-crime-hoaxers/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwicoPT2gLT9AhV5LFkFHSMPB0Y4MhAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw1pId9VOM-7h7-3zreV-A8W,2017-01-12
STUNNER: Allegedly Muslim Student Faked Vile Hate Crime To Get People To Pay Attention To Him,"A Muslim student at a liberal arts college in Wisconsin has been arrested for spray painting reprehensible anti-Muslim messages on his own dorm room door and then filing a report claiming that he was the victim of a hate crime.

The totally fake hate crime occurred last weekend at Beloit College, a 1,400-student bastion bursting with idiosyncratic individualists who enjoy leftist politics.

The student who falsely claimed that he was a victim of a terrible hate crime is Michael Kee, campus police told regional Fox affiliate WQRF-TV.

There were three spray-painted messages — all in bold red. In addition to “Sand nigger go home,” the other two messages read “#muslimban” and “Die,” according to a contemporaneous account by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

There was also a red swastika spray-painted on a wall across from Kee’s room on the third floor of Bushnell Hall, an ugly slab of concrete on the Beloit campus.

The Journal Sentinel identifies Kee as Muslim.

A campus security officer found the messages on Kee’s dorm room door at around 2:30 a.m. on Monday morning.

The discovery came three days after Beloit campus police had opened a separate investigation into an anti-Semitic note that another student found slipped under a dorm room door.

“Kike, You should be gassed for what you say & do on this campus. Be worried cunt,” the anti-Semitic note read, according to The Times of Israel.

Investigators say Kee, 20, eventually admitted that he perpetrated the hoax because he hoped to receive the same kind of attention received by the student who allegedly received the anti-Semitic note.

“There were certain indicators that led us to believe there was a little more to the story,” Beloit police chief David Zibolski told WQRF-TV.

“We were already investigating the first incident when this one came up, which obviously ratcheted up the fear and concern on campus,” Zibolski said.

Here is Kee:

Beloit campus police say they believe the anti-Semitic note slipped under the dorm door is a legitimate hate crime. They have named no suspects. They say they continue to investigate.

Prior to the police revelation that Kee himself scrawled the anti-Muslim messages on his own dorm room door as well as the swastika across the hall, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel suggested that Kee’s hoax hate crime was part of “chaos” building “around the country over President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily banning immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.”

Beloit police responded to the anti-Semitic note and Kee’s spray-painting hoax by ramping up campus patrols and adding residence hall entry limitations.

Beloit College president Scott Bierman sent a campus-wide email lamenting the “horrifying hate-filled threat” police now say Kee perpetrated on himself.

“I am, we are, overcome with concern for the well-being of our students and filled with anger and outrage because someone in our community feels emboldened to attack them,” Bierman pontificated, according to the Journal Sentinel.

“Let us reject hate together.”

After the hoax was exposed, Beloit College released a statement indicating that the school vows to crack down on hate crimes.

“This situation does not diminish the college’s resolve in resisting xenophobia, anti-Semitism, racism, and Islamophobia that aims to intimidate and silence its targets,” reads the statement obtained by Madison, Wisconsin NBC affiliate WMTV.

The Beloit campus police department issued a similar statement.

“Kee’s incident does not diminish our resolve going forward with these reported incidents and any other reported crimes of this nature,” the campus police said.

Meanwhile, Kee faces a trio of charges: criminal damage to property, disorderly conduct and obstruction.

The cost for a single year of tuition, fees and room and board at Beloit is $55,206, according to the school’s website.

The school is located in a pleasant Wisconsin town, just over the Illinois border.

The hoax at Beloit adds a fresh chapter to the ever-growing throng of alleged hate crimes that turned out to be hoaxes. (RELATED: 2016: The Year Of The Hoax Hate Crime)

Some hoaxes of recent vintage have involved threats or attacks — which totally did not happen — against Muslims.

In December, a Muslim woman at the University of Michigan received national attention after claiming a drunk twentysomething man threatened to light her on fire and forced her to remove her hijab. The university condemned the “hateful attack,” which turned out to be a hoax. (RELATED: Anti-Muslim Threat At University Of Michigan Was A Huge Hoax)

Also in December, an 18-year-old Muslim woman named Yasmin Seweid was the subject of breathless headlines after she claimed to have been attacked by a group of Donald Trump supporters on a New York subway while onlookers did nothing. She, too, would go on to confess that she made the whole thing up. (RELATED: Muslim Woman Reportedly Admits To Fabricating NYC Subway Attack)

In November, another 18-year-old Muslim woman, this one in Louisiana, claimed two white men, one of whom was wearing a Trump hat, attacked and robbed her, taking her wallet and hijab while yelling racial slurs. She later admitted that she made the whole thing up. (RELATED: Here Are All The Hate Crime Hoaxes That Have Plagued The Country Since Trump’s Election)

Last this month, a hate crime narrative pushed by several media outlets vanished into thin air when police arrested a twentysomething man with previous domestic violence convictions for the brutal, senseless murder of Hussain Saeed Alnahdi, a University of Wisconsin–Stout student from Saudi Arabia. A complete lack of evidence of any hate crime did not stop local police investigators and The Washington Post from raising the possibility of a hate crime. “Many” unidentified “advocates” who are concerned about hate crimes “point to rhetoric from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has at various points called for a complete ban on Muslim immigrants,” the Post proclaimed in a November story just after the murder.

Canadian Anti-Muslim Protesters Could Face Hate Crime Charges,"Police in Toronto, Ontario might charge a group of anti-Muslim protesters for violating hate crime laws.

A group with placards stating “Say No to Islam” was standing outside of Toronto’s Masjid mosque on Friday, and police say they received multiple complaints about the demonstration from some in the mosque and others who weren’t present.

Toronto Mayor John Tory, a former leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, criticized the protest, calling it “Islamophobia” in a Tweet:

Islamophobia has NO place in our city. I’ve visited Masjid Toronto many times & denounce all acts of hatred towards our Muslim citizens. — John Tory (@JohnTory) February 17, 2017

Constable Allyson Douglas-Cook told CBC News Saturday that the incident is being examined by police as a potential hate crime. The police constable claimed that there is a “fine line” between free speech and breaching hate crime laws but refused to specify what constitutes that distinction, adding, “That’s a conversation we’ve been having all day.”

The investigators plan to speak to witnesses, take statements and collect evidence if necessary. Mosque spokesman Abdul-Basit Khan claimed the protest was the worst he has seen since the mosque was built 15 years ago.

“You’re used to seeing this kind of vitriol in the comments sections of newspapers or online. You don’t necessarily see it in person. So that’s what was surprising about yesterday,” he said. “Especially in light of Quebec City…”

The event came just days after a Toronto-area Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) officially tabled a motion in the Canadian House of Commons that could potentially make “Islamophobia” another hate crime. Debate on Iqra Khalid’s motion began last Wednesday, with only the opposition Conservatives refusing to endorse the potential legislation because they say the definition of “Islamophobia” is too flexible and not even spelled-out in the motion.

Critics are wondering why an Islamophobia motion is necessary if people could be charged with a hate crime for a simple protest under existing law.

Conservative Party leadership candidate and Quebec MP Maxime Bernier told The Daily Caller that the motion represents a gross violation of free speech and said that he will fight it.

“I was one of the first in the Canadian leadership to oppose that motion. It is not good for freedom of speech and freedom of opinion in this country — the most important right that we have. We have the right to say what we want to say… so we don’t need a motion like that. I will vote against it and I’ll be proud to do it,” Bernier said.

Yet Another Hate Crime Turns Out To Be A Hoax,"A church organist was arrested Wednesday after he vandalized his own church with a swastika and pro-Trump graffiti in order to “mobilize a movement.”

George Nathaniel Stang, 26, admitted in a handwritten statement to spray painting a swastika, “fag church,” and “heil Trump” on St. David’s Episcopal Church in Bean Blossom, Indiana. “I suppose I wanted to give local people a reason to fight for good, even if it was a false flag,” Stang wrote, according to a local NBC report. “To be clear my actions were not motivated by hate for the church or its congregation. I of course realize now, this was NOT the way to go about inspiring activism.”

The incident occurred in November shortly after President Trump was elected and was widely covered by the press. The Washington Post reported on it and connected it to Trump’s victory, “The offensive graffiti at St. David’s is among numerous incidents that have occurred in the wake of Trump’s Election Day win.”

They also mentioned the vandalism in a piece entitled, “The postelection hate spike: How long will it last?” It was mentioned in 15 articles by The Post, yet, as of publication time, they have yet to write about Stang’s arrest.

The vandalism was also covered by CNN in the story “‘Make America White Again’: Hate speech and crimes post-election.” Just like the Post, CNN has yet to write an updated story. (RELATED: Guy Named Jasskirat Saini Arrested For Writing ‘KKK’ On College Campus)

In the wake of Trump’s election there has been a surge in reported hate crimes, however, they frequently end up being hoaxes. The Daily Caller News Foundation reported on five hoaxes in the weeks after the November election, including a Muslim woman who lied about her hijab being stolen by Trump supporters. Just two weeks ago, a Muslim professor at an Indiana university was arrested after he fabricated anti-Muslim crimes.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2017/05/04/yet-another-hate-crime-turns-out-to-be-a-hoax/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj7-Z74gLT9AhWwFlkFHYzZCsE4RhAWegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw1yjjHKmexKSxXAc8HIyCla,2017-05-04
"Another Day, Another Fake Hate Crime","When I’m right, I’m right. (It’s been known to happen!) Last week I made the following prediction about a “hate crime” at St. Olaf College in Minnesota. Students protested after a racist note was left on a student’s windshield, and it all seemed so familiar:

1. Racist rhetoric found on campus

2. Students draw up list of demands

3. Yelling, and plenty of it

4. Hoaxer wanted to raise awareness https://t.co/9Fnfvcxt0A — Jim Treacher (@jtLOL) May 1, 2017

And that’s exactly what happened. Nathan Rubbelke, College Fix:

A note that used the n-word and threatened a black female student at St. Olaf College — sparking an intense protest that led to classes being shut down for a day as student demonstrators accused the school of institutional racism — “was not a genuine threat,” the school’s president said Wednesday.

President David Anderson said in an email to students that an investigation into the note identified a person of interest “who confessed to writing the note…”

In a second campuswide email sent later Wednesday, Anderson used stronger words to explain what happened: “The reason I said in my earlier note that this was not a genuine threat is that we learned from the author’s confession that the note was fabricated. It was apparently a strategy to draw attention to concerns about the campus climate.”

In other words: There was no racism to protest, so somebody created some. To raise awareness.

Anderson isn’t identifying the culprit, but I’m not sure why. If you concoct a hate-crime hoax that brings an entire college campus to a standstill, you should be punished. The hoax is the real hate crime.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2017/05/10/another-day-another-fake-hate-crime/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjXrMj3gLT9AhXcEVkFHa6RBHg4PBAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw0UjoLxZ28W86dLly4EvvJc,2017-05-10
Texas Man Indicted For Hate Crime Faces 40 Years In Prison,"Marq Vincent Perez faces up to 40 years in prison after his Thursday indictment on hate crime charges and two other crimes for destroying an Islamic mosque in Victoria, Texas.

Perez is charged with damaging religious property, use of fire to commit a federal felony and possession of an unregistered destructive device, collectively amounting to a potential 40-year sentence. He also faces up to $750,000 in fines, the Victoria Advocate reports.

Perez has been held in a county jail since March 3, when he was arrested by officers investigating the January 28 burning of the Islamic center.

The center’s president, Dr. Shahid Hashmi, said in February that his community would forgive whoever set the fire. “But there’s no way we can forget. There’s no way our children can forget,” he told the Texas Tribune.

Police said in a Thursday press conference that the investigation is still ongoing and other defendants may be charged in the crime.

The hate crime indictment comes after four churches in New York were defaced with satanic graffiti over Father’s Day weekend in what is also being investigated as a hate crime.

Still-unidentified vandals spray painted pentagrams and “hail Satan” on the exteriors of the four churches June 17, but congregations were able to clean the buildings before services.

“We are disturbed by this. It is disrespectful,” Detective Lt. Bob Donohue told the New York Post. “I am asking pastors to speak to their parishioners, and find out if anyone sees or heard anything on social media.”

Police Report Contradicts ‘Hate Crime’ Narrative In Milwaukee Attack On Muslim Woman,"A Muslim woman who was attacked by a stranger in Milwaukee in April told police that she did not believe that she was targeted because of her religion, a statement which is at odds with how her story was portrayed in the media by local and national Muslim civil rights groups.

“In this attack of the Muslim woman, we know of no evidence that would indicate that this attack was anything but a hate crime,” Munjed Ahmad, a lawyer for the woman and board member of American Muslims for Palestine, claimed at a press conference held on April 14, four days after the 58-year-old woman was assaulted while walking home from prayer services at the Islamic Society of Milwaukee.

But police incident reports, obtained by TheDC through an open records request, paint a different picture.

The documents show that in the days after her April 10 attack, the woman told detectives that she “disagreed” with media reports claiming that she was the victim of a hate crime attack.

The woman, whose name is redacted in police reports, told investigators that she did not believe she was attacked because she is Muslim. Instead, she suspected that the assault had something to do with her estranged daughter, who had just divorced her husband and entered a relationship with another woman.

Despite those statements to police, Ahmad and groups like the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Milwaukee Muslim Women’s Coalition and the left-wing Jewish Voice for Peace, all called the incident a hate crime. Milwaukee government officials echoed the claim.

“I call for this to be investigated and prosecuted as a hate crime,” Milwaukee county supervisor Jason Haas said at the April 14 press conference organized by Ahmad, who is also a board member of the Islamic Society of Milwaukee.

“It concerns us tremendously because what we’re seeing again is specifically attacks and hate targeting Muslim women,” Janan Najeeb, the president of the Milwaukee Muslim Women’s Coalition, said at the event.

***

According to the incident reports, the woman told police that her attacker pulled up beside her in a car while she was walking home from a 6 a.m. prayer service at the Islamic Society of Milwaukee, the city’s largest mosque.

The woman, who suffers from epilepsy, said that the man called her over to his vehicle.

“I don’t know you,” she told the man. He responded as he approached: “but I know who you are.”

The woman said that the man, who was described as Hispanic and in his 20s, grabbed her and threw her to the ground and began to strike her in the head and body. Nothing was stolen during the attack, said the woman, who went to the hospital and was interviewed by police that day and several days after.

On April 12, a Milwaukee police detective visited the woman at her home. By that point, the attack had been reported in the news, and civil rights groups had started calling the incident a hate crime.

But during the police interview, the victim disputed the hate crime claims.

“They wanted to make it clear they did not contact the media, they were not the source categorizing this as a ‘hate crime’ and disagreed with the assessment,” reads the police incident report.

During a police interview the next day, the woman said again that she did not believe she was targeted because of her religion. She also said that her attacker did not try to take her hijab, as had been reported in the press.

“[Redacted] stated she does not feel she was attacked because she is Muslim. It should be noted that contrary to what was reported on the news, according to [redacted], the man who attacked her did not try to take her hijab,” the incident report reads.

The woman’s comments to police about her hijab do appear to conflict with statements she made in TV interviews on April 11 and April 12. In one, the woman suggested that her attacker did go for her hijab.

“I tried to fight him. Do not take my hijab, you know,” she told Milwaukee’s Fox6Now in an April 11 interview.

The attacker did not leave with the hijab, which ended up covered in blood from the assault.

In her April 13 police interview, the woman again said that she believed the assault was linked to her daughter.

“She stated she doesn’t approve of her daughter’s lifestyle and she is appalled by the fact that her daughter recently left her husband and she is now in a lesbian relationship with another woman,” the report reads.

“She feels that is why she was targeted.”

Reached for comment on Monday, Ahmad, the victim’s lawyer, disputed the information in the police reports. He said that the police department’s translator inaccurately translated his client’s remarks.

“When she was told about the discrepancies she was surprised and extremely unhappy,” Ahmad told TheDC of his client.

He claimed that the Milwaukee police department’s translator “decided to insert her opinion into the discussion rather than translate what the victim was saying.”

“That seems to be the reason for the discrepancy,” says Ahmad.

Asked about those claims, a spokesman for the Milwaukee police department said the agency is confident that the police reports and translations are accurate. The spokesman said the investigation is ongoing and a suspect is still being sought.

Ahmad has been in the news before. At a conference hosted by American Muslims for Palestine (AMP) in 2014, Ahmad, the group’s vice chairman, gave a talk in which he accused the U.S. government of labeling some pro-Palestinian relief organizations as terror groups at “the behest of the Israeli government, its lobby.”

“What’s very sad to me when we talk about terrorist organizations is that the state of Israel is not considered a terrorist organization. Uh, with our government, but it truly is the largest terrorist of all. Truly,” Ahmad said at the conference, according to The Daily Beast.

In the talk, Ahmad offered advice on how to contribute to pro-Palestine groups without violating anti-terrorism finance laws.

According to the Anti-Defamation League, AMP was organized from the Islamic Association of Palestine, a group which served as the American propaganda arm of the terror group Hamas until it shut down in 2004.

Haas, the Milwaukee county supervisor who also called the April 10 incident a hate crime, did not respond to a request for comment.

Families Launch Advocacy Group For Victims Of Illegal Alien Crime,"Six American families whose relatives have been killed by illegal immigrants announced Tuesday the formation of a victims’ advocacy group, responding to what they see as indifference among elected officials to the dangers of illegal alien crime.

The members of Advocates for Victims of Illegal Alien Crime (AVIAC) say they are joining together in order to provide a support network for other families and to educate the public on the effects of lax immigration enforcement. The nonprofit organization plans to lobby Congress on a wide range of illegal immigration bills, including measures to punish sanctuary cities and provide funding for President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall. (RELATED: WH: Signing Anti-Illegal Immigration Bills Is A Priority)

In an emotional ceremony at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., mothers and fathers recounted stories of how their children were slain. Many laid blame for the killings at the feet of government officials, who they said have pursued sanctuary city policies in order to score political points.

“My son is dead because politicians in local jurisdictions have put illegal aliens ahead of Americans,” said Maureen Maloney, whose son Matthew was killed in Massachusetts in 2011, when an illegal alien ran him over in a hit-and-run incident.

“My son’s killer had a lengthy criminal record, and with each offense only received a slap on the wrist from lenient judges, and local law enforcement was prohibited from communicating with ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement],” she added. (RELATED: Nashville City Council Passes Bill Stopping Assistance To Feds On Immigration)

Iowa Republican Steve King, one of Congress’ most strident immigration hawks, praised the creation of AVIAC, saying that it will prod Congress to “restore the rule of law” to the U.S. immigration system. By documenting crimes committed by illegal immigrants, AVIAC will help “build a strong database, so America understands the price Americans have paid for the failure to enforce immigration law,” King said during introductory remarks at the AVIAC launch event.

In addition to support from King, AVIAC also has a willing ally in the White House. The group’s formation comes after Trump authorized the creation of Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE), an office within the Department of Homeland Security that provides support to the families of victims of removable criminal aliens. AVIAC co-founder and vice president Mary Ann Mendoza was invited to attend Trump’s signing of executive orders on immigration enforcement in January, and she was present at DHS Secretary John Kelly’s announcement of the VOICE office in April.

The families of AVIAC were encouraged by Trump’s tough rhetoric on illegal immigration during the campaign, especially his promises to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and to pull funding from cities that don’t cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. His stance was a welcome change from “former administrations who had not been doing that,” Mendoza told The Daily Caller News Foundation.

Mendoza, whose son was killed by a drunk driving illegal alien on Mother’s Day 2014, believes AVIAC is needed because there has been a “backlash” from the media and some politicians to the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

“We are trying to get Americans to back our president up,” she told TheDCNF.

Members of AVIAC say shining a light on illegal alien crime is not intended to demonize all immigrants, as some critics have alleged, but rather to draw attention to the public safety problems caused by criminal aliens.

“The amount [of crime] that happens on a daily basis will stagger the American public when we start to get this information out there,” Mendoza told reporters at the National Press Club. “It’s time for American victims to be more important to their fellow Americans than illegal aliens that our in our country. It’s time to to stand up for your fellow Americans.”

U.S. On Pace To Have One Of Its Lowest Crime Rates In 3 Decades,"The United States is on track to have one of its lowest crime rates in decades, according to a new research study published on Wednesday.

Researchers at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law surveyed police departments in America’s 30 largest cities and used historical trends to predict end-of-year crime totals for 2017.

Researchers Ames Grawert and James Cullen estimated that for 2017 the overall crime rate will be fewer than 4,000 crimes per 100,000 people – a drop of 1.8 percent which would rank as the second lowest crime rate since 1990.

The projected murder rate is expected to decrease by 2.5 percent which is due to a sharp decline in murders in “Detroit (down 25.6 percent), Houston (down 20.5 percent), and New York (down 19.1 percent).”

Despite constant media buzz from right-of-center media outlets about shootings and murders in Chicago, the city is expected to see a 2.4 percent decrease in the number of murders it sees for 2017.

Overall, the violent crime rate is expected to remain stable with only a .6 percent decrease.

“This result is driven primarily by stabilization in Chicago, and declines in Washington, D.C., two large cities that experienced increases in violence in recent years,” the study notes. “The violent crime rate for this year is projected to be about 1 percent above 2014’s violent crime rate, the lowest recorded since 1990.”

While crime is down in 2017, some cities are seeing an increase in crime. The study highlights Charlotte’s murder rate as an example, citing that the cities murder rate has nearly doubled so far in 2017.

"One Of Georgia’s Safest Cities REQUIRES Its Citizens To Own A Gun, But CNN Doesn’t Know Why Crime Is So Low","When it comes to America’s response to gun crime, one Georgia town has been thinking outside the box since 1982, when its leaders passed a law requiring it citizens to own a firearm.

The Kennesaw, Georgia, law states that “every head of household residing in the city limits is required to maintain a firearm,” according to CNN, and was reportedly passed as a deterrent to crime.

“It was meant to be kind of a crime deterrent,” Kennesaw Police Lt. Craig Graydon, a 30-year law enforcement veteran, told CNN. “It was also more or less a political statement because the city of Morton Grove, Illinois, passed a city ordinance banning handguns from their city limits.”

As for would-be criminals looking for an easy mark, judging by the crime statistics it seems most have bypassed the Georgia town and moved on to easier targets. Even CNN was forced to admit that Kennesaw, populated by 33,000 people, has only had “one murder in the last six years and a violent crime rate of below 2%.”

“But,” writes CNN, “it’s unclear whether that has anything to do with the gun law.”

Kennesaw’s mayor sees it differently.

“If you’re going to commit a crime in Kennesaw and you’re the criminal — are you going to take a chance that that homeowner is a law-abiding citizen?” asked Mayor Derek Easterling.

“It gives me the ability to protect myself as opposed to being somewhere where you weren’t allowed to have a firearm or it was frowned upon,” said Wayne Arnold, a local resident who is a fan of the law.

With the gun issue being in the spotlight of late, town officials have been getting plenty of attention from all over the world about their law.

“We get a lot of calls, conversation, and it seems to keep crime control, gun safety, things like that on the minds of many of the residents, because people are constantly talking about the gun law,” Lt. Graydon told CNN. “So that’s been somewhat of a benefit to us.”

Arnold noted the expectation of a “Wild West” environment with everyone walking around “with a firearm strapped to their side.”

“And it’s not like that,” said Arnold. “It’s strictly a home defense system type of deal. There’s no shootouts down the street.”

Kirsanow: Illegal Immigrants ‘Commit More Crime’ And ‘More Serious Crimes’,"Peter Kirsanow, a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, provided evidence that illegal immigrants in the United States commit crimes more frequently — and commit crimes of a more violent nature — than citizens during his appearance on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Thursday.

WATCH:

“The overwhelming amount of data that shows that illegal aliens commit not only commit more crime at a higher rate that is, than lawful residents, but more serious crimes at a far higher rate,” Peter Kirsanow, the author of Second Strike, said. “We are not talking about a little bit, he conveniently mentioned Texas to claim that the homicide rates among illegal aliens is 44% lower that that for lawful residents. He chose the one state where it is true.”

He continued, “The homicide rates are lower for illegal aliens, by 15%, not 44%. But if you look at every other state, it is significant how much more, not just the homicide rate, but every other serious crime, rape, aggravated assault, you name it. So much more for example. In New York, 27% of incarcerated illegal aliens are incarcerated for murder, not jaywalking.”

Tijuana Official Provides Update On Spike In Crime,"A Tijuana official gave an update on the recent increase in the local crime rate during an interview with Tucker Carlson on Thursday night.

Genaro Lopez was on Carlson’s show about two weeks ago and shared that there were 6,200 migrants staying in Tijuana at that time.

WATCH:

“There have been like 280 arrests. Before it was only for drug possession and being drunk in the streets. Now it’s for breaking and entering into the homes. People have made citizens arrests,” Lopez stated.

“So you’ve had home break-ins. Are you certain it was migrant caravan members who broke into those homes?” Carlson asked. (RELATED: U.S. Border Agents Arrest MS-13 Gang Member ‘Intending On Filing For Asylum In The United States’)

Lopez responded, “Yeah. There’s a video on Facebook and in the video he says his name and says he’s from Honduras.”

“How are the police handling them?” Carlson followed up.

Lopez added:

“Also we had — the police are on 24 hour alert on this end. They’re worried about this. We don’t want the crime rates to go up here in Mexico. We’re tourist town. We live on tourism and Christmas season is one of our best times for tourism here and for sales. Things are not very good right now. Also, we don’t want the migrants to make the U.S. nervous. They have two marches this Sunday from the other, the new shelter. They made a march to the U.S. Consulate. They delivered two letters. One was directed directly to President Donald Trump. They were demanding that he didn’t give them — they didn’t get political asylum from the U.S., he should pay them to $50,000 to go honorably back home.”

Carlson said, “So they’re demanding money or they won’t leave. That sounds like an extortion attempt.”

The issue of the caravan and border security reached a new peak on Tuesday when President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and House Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi held a televised meeting in the Oval Office. (RELATED: Trump Brawls Face-To-Face With Pelosi, Schumer Over Wall Funding)

“Sounds like a ransom, yeah. You want them to go back, you have to give them $50,000 to each one of them. Like 700 have been,” Lopez continued. ‘Tijuana is a great town. It opens its arms to anyone that wants to come here in peace. And to live here, no problem. If you come here in a violent mood, if you come here against our sovereignty, you’re not welcome here. We dont’ want this problem, we have our own problems.”

Transgender Activist Accused Of Burning Down Own Home In Hate Crime Hoax,"Police have reportedly arrested a Jackson, Michigan transgender and gay rights activist for allegedly burning down his own home.

Authorities accuse Nikki Joly, who organized a series of pro-LGBTQ events and initiatives in the socially conservative town, of intentionally setting fire to their own residence in 2017, The Detroit News reported Monday. Five pets perished in the inferno and the FBI investigated the incident as a hate crime, given that Joly had allegedly received threats prior to the fire.

But a police report indicates that Joly was looking for further publicity to advance his cause.

The arrest has shocked locals on both sides of the LGBTQ rights issue, especially in the wake of actor Jussie Smollett being accused of staging his own hate crime in order to promote his career. (RELATED: Jussie Smollett’s Legal Team Won’t Admit He Isn’t A Victim)

Joly has been celebrated in the local LGBTQ community for helping build a gay community center, organizing a gay pride parade and advocating for a municipal ordinance forbidding discrimination based on sexual orientation. Joly was even named Citizen of the Year, The News notes.

“It’s embarrassing? How do you do it to the community you have put so much effort into helping?” Travis Trombley, who is homosexual, asked The News. (RELATED: Here’s. A List Of Hoax Hate Crimes In The Trump Era)

But police investigating the charge offered a possible motive.

According to a police report, referenced by the News, two members of the St. John’s United Church of Christ, where the gay community center is located, believe that Joly was anxious to generate more news about LGBTQ rights. Barbara Shelton and Bobby James say Joly was visibly disappointed that the 2017 Jackson Pride Parade and Festival did not generate more publicity — good or bad.

According to Metro News, investigator Aaron Grove, who interrogated Shelton and James, said the pair described Joly as “very deceptive” and possessing “layers of manipulation.”

Joly had just been married before the fire, and the two were the recipients of $58,000 in fundraising from supporters, Metro News noted.

Activist Says He Falsely Confessed To War Crime As Part Of Anti-War Efforts,"Kristofer Goldsmith, now with Vietnam Veterans of America, said in 2008 that while serving in Iraq, he sabotaged the weapons of Iraqi allies while they slept, leaving them defenseless. A former military lawyer said this is a war crime that could lead to a death sentence or life in prison.

Goldsmith blamed Republicans for leading him to commit the atrocities. He had expressed a desire to commit atrocities and “kill Muslims” before serving.

Goldsmith now says he did not actually commit the war crime he confessed to.

A veterans activist with the Vietnam Veterans of America, Kristofer Goldsmith, described in a previously unreported 2008 video committing acts that an expert said could be a war crime that could carry a punishment of death or life in prison.

Goldsmith said in the video that, as a soldier, he sabotaged Iraqi allies’ rifles while they slept so that they were rendered defenseless. He said he spread the idea to platoon members who joined in, disabling the rifles of an entire Iraqi company fighting on the same side as the U.S.

Goldsmith is now the associate director for policy and government affairs at VVA, a congressionally chartered group that was involved in a town hall with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on April 17. The New York Democrat said of the Department of Veterans Affairs, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” — a position on the VA at odds with the majority of veterans groups.

Goldsmith is married to the editor of The New York Times’ At War blog, Lauren Katzenberg. He has testified before Congress and has done research into internet hoaxes that has spurred a congressional investigation. Numerous major news outlets, including CNN, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal have featured Goldsmith.

He’s also been fiercely critical of the last two Republican administrations.

Goldsmith now says his claim that he sabotaged Iraqi troops’ rifles was fake.

“Yeah, so there was a time when I was an anti-war activist,” he told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “No, it is not true … I wish that stupid shit would go away.”

He said the FBI’s recently disbanded war crimes division investigated his confession since the Army did not have jurisdiction because he was out of the service. He told TheDCNF that the bureau interviewed some of his platoon members and found no evidence his claim was true.

Shortly after the phone conversation, Goldsmith tweeted a somewhat different version of the story.

“In the video I talk about disassembling my Iraqi counterparts’ firearms to spite them when I was deployed in ’05,” he wrote. “I believed I did this. A few years ago, Army Criminal Investigation Command investigated these allegations and couldn’t validate them. They told me I imagined it.”

Retired Lt. Col. J.W. Kastl, a former military lawyer, said if Goldsmith did commit the acts in the video, it “could be attempted murder or manslaughter. … It’s a prosecutor’s dream in terms of how you charge it.”

“It seems extraordinary,” he said, noting that Goldsmith’s claimed acts could amount to war crimes. “That could call for maximum punishments,” meaning a sentence to death or life in prison. “Whatever you think of the Iraqis, they were our allies, and that might turn the stomachs of people who might be on the military jury on a court martial.”

In the video, Goldsmith said the following:

These Iraqi soldiers who fall asleep … I was infuriated. And my way of teaching them a lesson was to disassemble their AK-47 while they slept. I would take out the bolt from their weapon and I would throw it off the roof. I would then reassemble their weapon and put it back where it was. When they would wake up, they would grab their weapon not knowing the difference. They would go back on patrol on the streets of Iraq for hours a day in unarmored trucks. The Iraqi soldiers’ only defense was aggressive fire. I removed that ability. When I went to my friends feeling a little guilty for what I’d done, they thought it was a great idea. So we all did it. My entire platoon disassembled every single AK-47 for an entire company of Iraqis and we sent them back out on patrol with no way to defend themselves in unarmored vehicles. This is what my country has done to me. This is the guilt that I live with for the rest of my life. This is what my brothers and sisters have experienced. We are not born monsters, monsters are created.

The video of Goldsmith’s so-called “Winter Soldier” testimony was recorded in Denver and uploaded to YouTube in August 2008. He was then with the group Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW).

“No amount of therapy will ever change the fact that I may have killed men that I don’t even know,” he said. He blamed the Bush administration for his self-proclaimed atrocities.

‘The only people who welcomed me home’

Goldsmith told TheDCNF he was deployed for one year in 2005 and then received a less-than-honorable discharge after attempting suicide and deliberately missing his flight to a second tour of Iraq. He attracted media coverage by telling Congress of “lawless murders, looting and the abuse of countless Iraqis.”

He found that liberal activists who wanted to end the Iraq War were eager to have a soldier’s negative experience they could cite. “Hence my reason for associating with people who were the only people who welcomed me home,” he told TheDCNF.

In May 2008, Goldsmith testified before the House Progressive Caucus that Army recruiters had not pressured him to join, but rather he sought it out and had a pre-existing desire to commit atrocities.

“I joined the army to kill people. To kill Iraqis, to kill Muslims,” he said. “I remember … standing up the day after 9/11 and talking about how we should use chemical weapons or biological weapons over the entire Middle East to make it so the religious land, the Holy Land, is not an issue that harms Americans.”

“I want to state that I have since changed, I am no longer a racist, I am no longer filled with hatred like that,” he continued. “I blame the people of America and their apathy” for not ending the war because “they have not done a good enough job to convince the rest of your peers, mainly Republicans, to fight to bring our troops home.”

Goldsmith quit IVAW in 2009, saying others in the group were telling lies about their experience in Iraq, inflating their combat experience and advocating for criminal sabotage in the military theater.

TheDCNF asked Goldsmith why he quit that group over made-up stories considering his claim that his own story of wartime atrocities was made up. Citing his post-traumatic stress disorder, he said: “I can’t say I wasn’t still fucked up.”

Goldsmith told Congress he served during a ceasefire and his unit wasn’t authorized to use artillery. “The violence was very low due to the cease fire. … My primary mission was humanitarian aid,” he said. “My platoon would be assigned to escort pump trucks such as these to clear the streets … sucking up a puddle of sewage.”

Vietnam Veterans of America

In recent years, Goldsmith has refashioned himself into an official for Vietnam Veterans of America, a nonpartisan group representing veterans of that era, who tend to be conservative.

Just after the November 2016 election, he posted online a picture of himself with Hillary Clinton and wrote that he was “disgusted” and “enraged”: “It’s no secret that I was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton throughout this race, despite the complications that it could potentially cause in my work in Washington. I felt what was at stake was worth it, and I have no regrets.”

VVA is congressionally chartered, which means Congress authorized its mission. Congress frequently looks to it and other Veterans Service Organizations to represent the interests of veterans and help shape policy. However, the D.C.- and New York-based class of professional government relations men who run the groups do not always relay the opinions of the thousands of veterans who make up their membership to Capitol Hill. (RELATED: American Legion Downplays Death of Vet Waiting For Care, Calling Him A Mooch)

In 2016, the American Legion conducted a survey of its member, who said they overwhelmingly wanted the option of choosing private doctors instead of VA doctors — a plan pushed by Republicans. The top brass of the Legion went against the survey anyway and, joining with VVA, wrote a letter saying their national executive boards did not favor the policy.

Goldsmith used his perch at VVA to raise concern about Russian trolls online, leading to a congressional investigation. House Committee on Veterans Affairs Chairman Mark Takano compared the culprits in Goldsmith’s trolling investigation to enemy combatants.

“Our veterans served in uniform to guard against threats to our democracy just like those posed by these internet bots and trolls intent on sowing division and spreading misinformation,” the California Democrat said.

On Twitter, many of Goldsmith’s missives oppose President Donald Trump, with frequent talk about the Mueller investigation.

“I separate my personal politics from my work,” Goldsmith told TheDCNF. “When I put on a suit and go to Congress, I’m working for VVA. When I’m sitting drinking a beer and tweeting, I’m not acting on behalf of VVA.”

He declined to characterize the politics of other top VVA officials.

Goldsmith is also the co-founder of High Ground Veteran Advocacy. He co-founded it with Alexander McCoy, who held a “veterans against Trump” protest and “went to great lengths to hide the Clinton campaign’s involvement with organizing the demonstration,” the Daily Beast reported.

For 10 years, Goldsmith’s pet issue has been that less-than-honorably discharged veterans are being harmed because they do not have access to free college in the same way as those honorably discharged.

But Goldsmith told TheDCNF that the government has in fact footed much of the bill for his ongoing Columbia University education, though it didn’t give him additional cash on top of tuition like other veterans would get.

“I’m using [vocational rehabilitation] for people with a general discharge. If you’re disabled like with PTSD, you’ll qualify for voc rehab but it won’t pay for cost of living,” he said.

On April 19, he described how he has used the opportunity to write a 20-page paper on “the study of dicks in sculptures,” such as one in which “16 children all have dicks out.”

"Bernie Defends Vote For 1994 Crime Bill, Admits It Contained ‘Very Bad Stuff’","Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders defended his vote for the 1994 Crime Bill during a Tuesday afternoon appearance on “CNN Newsroom.”

Sanders explained to anchor Brooke Baldwin that while he realized that the bill contained “some very bad stuff,” he had to weight that against what he saw was ultimately a good thing — in that particular case, the ban on assault weapons.

WATCH:

Baldwin began by noting that even former President Bill Clinton, who signed that bill into law, thought in retrospect that it had gone too far and had a disproportionate impact on minorities. “My question is, do you regret that vote?” she asked. (RELATED: Trump Accuses DNC Of Trying To Oust Bernie Sanders Once Again)

Sanders initially tried to direct Baldwin to his YouTube channel, but she didn’t bite. “I’m looking at you now, senator,” she pressed.

“I voted for that bill because it included the Violence Against Women’s Act and it included a ban on assault weapons,” Sanders said, adding, “And Brooke, you would be asking me today, ‘Senator, why did you not vote for a ban on assault weapons —'”

“I’m asking you today if you regret your vote,” Baldwin pressed again.

“Sometimes you have legislation which includes very good stuff and very bad stuff,” Sanders explained further. “That legislation included very bad stuff. I had to make the choice whether I voted to ban assault weapons, something that I promised the people of Vermont I would, and I also had to vote to make sure that we had a Violence Against Women provision in there.”

Sanders went on to assert that he had, at the time, taken to the floor to warn that the bill could result in mass incarceration. He then pivoted, claiming that he was one of the leaders for criminal justice reform and doubling down on his promise to fight for voting rights for the incarcerated.

“We have got to make it clear if you are an American citizen and even if you do something bad, we can’t take away the right to vote, whether you are in jail or left jail,” Sanders argued, implying that Republicans opposed this plan on racial grounds rather than legal. “Clearly, what Republicans are doing is trying to deny people of color the right to vote and this is an issue I think we have to address head-on,” he concluded.

In spite of claiming that he had opposed some of its parts at the time, Sanders touted his support of the 1994 Crime Bill when he ran for Senate in 2006.

TIME.com reported in 2016:

During his 2006 campaign for Senate, Sanders appealed to Vermonters by touting his record on crime and pointing in particular to his support for the 1994 crime bill that former President Bill Clinton has been criticized for and since renounced. Sanders’ website during that race even touted his “strong record of supporting tough on crime legislation.”

New York City Police Department’s Hate Crime Racial Statistics Highlight Lie In De Blasio’s Narrative,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio blamed “forces of white supremacy” for an attack on a group of Hasidic Jews in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, last month, even though the actual attackers were black.

“It’s really clear that forces of white supremacy have been unleashed,” the 2020 presidential candidate said. “A lot of folks used to be told it was unacceptable to be anti-Semitic, it was unacceptable to be racist and now they’re getting more permission.”

While it is true in some cases that hate crimes involve the narrative of the “angry white male” wreaking havoc on marginalized victims, the actual statistics of New York’s police department appear to tell another story.

In de Blasio’s own city, NYPD crime reports cite hate-crime victims as being “most frequently [w]hite” at 46.1% and hate crime suspects as “most frequently Black” at 55%.

From the NYPD’s analysis:

Hate crime victims are most frequently White (46.1%) while Black (24.7%) and Hispanic (20.1%) hate crime victims account for a significant portion of all hate crime victims. Asian/Pacific Islander hate crime victims (9.1%) account for the remaining portions of hate crime victims. Hate crime suspects are most frequently Black (55.0%), White (23.6%) or Hispanic (20.0%). Asian/Pacific Islanders

accounted for (1.4%) of the remaining suspects. The hate crime arrest population is most frequently White (51.3%) or Black arrestees (44.7%). Asian/Pacific Islander arrestees (2.7%) and Hispanic (1.3%) account for the remaining portions of the hate crime arrest population.

Here are New York City’s current demographic estimates, according to World Population Review:

White: 42.78%

Black or African American: 24.32%

Other race: 15.12%

Asian: 14.00%

Two or more races: 3.33%

Native American: 0.40%

Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander: 0.05%

In the first quarter of 2019, there were 49 total hate crime arrests: 25 arrestees were white (51% of hate crime arrests, 42.78% population), 17 were black (34.7% of hate crimes arrests, 24.32% of population), and five were Asian (10.2% of hate crime arrests, 14% of population).

Yearly 2018 statistics tell a similar tale. Of 151 total crimes resulting in arrest, 77 arrestees were white (51% of hate crime arrests, 42.78% population) and 67 were black (44.4% of hate crime arrests, 24.32% of the population). Only four of those arrested were of Asian ancestry. (RELATED: Reason Editor Explains How Hate Crime Statistics Are Misrepresented, Give Shocking Guess On How Many Are Actually Real)

It was unclear why only 23.6% of hate crime suspects were white while 51% of hate crime arrests were also white. Nevertheless, the breakdown of even white arrests for hate crimes as a percentage of the white population (51% vs 42.78%) is still lower than that for blacks (44.4% vs 24.32%).

The Daily Caller asked The Manhattan Institute’s Heather Mac Donald for some insight into why this could be:

If the NYPD characterizes domestic stalking and other types of non-violent domestic disputes as a hate crime based on gender — and I don’t know if this is the case — it would be easier to arrest suspects, since the suspect would be known. There may be more whites proportionally involved in non-violent domestic abuse than in stranger hate crimes, on the analogy with stranger street crime. A larger proportion of white committed homicides than black committed homicides are domestic violence, because whites are only negligibly involved in street crime. In New York City, for example, blacks are 72% of all shooting suspects, and whites less than 3%, though the black and white proportions of the city’s population are around 24% and 43%, respectively.

“But if non-violent domestic abuse were included in the hate crime category, you would expect to see a higher percentage of Hispanic suspects, since they have high rates of domestic violence,” she continued.

Mac Donald said she supposes “it’s possible” that police might decide not to characterize an assault as a hate crime after picking up a minority suspect but there’s “no evidence” to support such a claim: “I suppose that is possible, but I have no evidence for that. A portion of black-on-white street violence may have some element of contempt that rarely is acknowledged or charged. But that is a different matter. I wish I had an answer, but it is a very interesting discrepancy.”

The Daily Caller has reached out to NYPD for comment but did not receive an answer in time for publication.

Semi-Automatic Rifle Ownership Has Increased And Violent Crime Has Decreased,"By Elizabeth McGuigan

The FBI has released its crime data for 2018 and the news is good. Violent crime dropped 3.3 percent in 2018 compared to 2017. According to the report, a decrease was seen across nearly every type of violent crime.

Looking at a 10-year trend, the numbers of violent crimes were down a full 9 percent from 2009 through 2018. The rate shows a more dramatic drop: “There were an estimated 368.9 violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants in 2018, a rate that fell 3.9 percent when compared with the 2017 estimated violent crime rate and dropped 14.6 percent from the 2009 estimate.”

Homicides with firearms were down 7 percent from 2017. And in stark contrast to the theatrics of last week’s House Judiciary Committee on banning modern sporting rifles, rifles were again only used in 2 percent of homicides, far less than the share committed with knives (11 percent) or hands and feet (5 percent).

MSR Ownership Up. Crime Down

This chart says it all. Through 2016, there have been over 16 million modern sporting rifles in the hands of law-abiding citizens. Meanwhile, violent crime is declining. The message is clear. Tragic criminal actions must be addressed. Banning certain types of firearms is not the answer.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2019/10/03/semi-automatic-rifle-ownership-has-increased-and-violent-crime-has-decreased/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjXrMj3gLT9AhXcEVkFHa6RBHg4PBAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw0O6baTrpOeE22Y7p9VuK0q,2019-10-03
Some Violent Crime Is On The Rise As Coronavirus Engulfs America,"As most of the U.S. is shut down over the coronavirus pandemic, some violent crime rates continue to rise.

While the virus has slowed overall crime in some major cities, certain types of violence has increased. Just days after the White House released its strict coronavirus guidelines, domestic violence rates surged across the country.

The Seattle Police Department reported a 23% increase, while a domestic violence hotline in Nashville reported a 55% increase in calls over the first few weeks of March. Those numbers have only continued to surge as the U.S. and other parts of the world have been put under a quasi-form of indefinite house arrest. (RELATED: FLASHBACK: Jan. 21: Fauci Says Coronavirus ‘Not A Major Threat’ To U.S.)

The U.N. warned of a “horrifying surge” of domestic violence occurring across the globe, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the U.S. was increasing its funding of anti-domestic violence initiatives.

“We’ll continue our efforts to protect women and girls during this critical time,” Pompeo said.

Concerned that #COVID19 social distancing measures may put women at a higher risk of domestic violence, we’ve increased our already significant funding for prevention of domestic violence. We’ll continue our efforts to protect women and girls during this critical time. https://t.co/TQTIUvdumI — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) April 11, 2020

Domestic violence isn’t the only form of violence seeing a surge. President Donald Trump warned late last month that suicides could increase by the thousands in the U.S. if the economic crisis brought upon the country by government shutdowns worsens. Suicide rates in the U.S. have already skyrocketed 35% over the past two decades, with nearly 50,000 Americans having claimed their own lives in 2018. These numbers are expected to continue to rise due to the pandemic, and parts of the country are already seeing alarming surges.

Studies have shown that debt and joblessness can lead to suicide, and joblessness is rising in the U.S. at a rate never seen in the nation’s history. Nearly 17 million people have filed for unemployment in recent weeks, more than the entirety of the 2008 Great Recession. A study conducted around that time found that for every 1% increase in the unemployment rate, there was a 1% increase in the suicide rate. In late March, more people in Tennessee died from suicide than from the actual virus as the state forced businesses to shut down and citizens to stay in their homes.

Meanwhile, in one of the hardest hit parts of the country, burglaries and carjackings have gone up by as much as 50%. The Daily Mail reported last week that Queens saw a 50% increase in burglaries and car thefts, while parts of Harlem saw burglaries up nearly 20%. The New York Police Department (NYPD) reported earlier this month that major crime was up 12% in New York City, despite the entire city being largely shut down.

Complicating matters is that some major cities across the country, including Philadelphia and New York City, are releasing hundreds of criminals from prison to protect them from getting the virus. Law enforcement throughout the country have announced they are no longer enforcing certain types of crime, and instead turning their attention to enforcing social distancing orders.

"‘There Are No Consequences’: California Grocery Stores Push For Tougher Crime Laws, Citing Safety Concerns","California grocery stores are pushing for tougher laws on crime, citing safety concerns and merchandise losses from increased crime.

The stores are supporting Proposition 20, a ballot measure that would increase penalties for crimes like shoplifting and make it more difficult for people convicted of crimes to get parole, the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday. Law enforcement groups are the primary sponsors of the bill, but several large grocery stores have supported the measure, claiming that recent criminal justice reforms that reduced penalties had created more incentive for people to commit crimes. (RELATED: Homicides Skyrocket In Dozens Of Nation’s Largest Cities, Analysis Finds)

Albertsons, Kroger, and the California Grocers Association all announced their support for Proposition 20 in statements, according to the report. Grocery chain Safeway donated $100,000 to the campaign, Ralphs donated $91,800, and several local and regional chains also donated, the LA Times reported. The stores say that they have suffered significant merchandise losses and felt that the safety of their employees was threatened following a rise in shoplifting and other retail crimes.

In 2014, California passed Proposition 47, which made it so that only shoplifting more than $950 worth of merchandise could be charged as a felony, whereas previously the limit was $450. As a result, most shoplifting crimes were charged as misdemeanors. Proposition 57, which made thousands of prisoners eligible for early release, was passed 2 years later.

Retailers and law enforcement say that Proposition 47 led to an increase in shoplifting, a claim that some experts dispute, the LA Times reported. In 2016, Safeway, Target, Rite Aid, and CVS all said that there was at least a 15% increase in shoplifting since the measure had passed. Theft reached an all-time high in 2019, according to a National Retail Federation survey, which found that shoplifting had cost retailers around $61.7 billion in 2019. (RELATED: ‘Not The Mask Police’: Grocery Workers’ Unions Want Store Owners To Deny Non-Mask Wearers Entry)

“People are stealing, and there are no consequences,” Yes on Prop. 20 campaign spokesperson Richard Temple said.

Opponents of Proposition 20 say that the measure, which would make theft of over $250 worth of merchandise a felony, is unnecessary given that prosecutors can already increase penalties for theft if they choose to do so. They also argue that it would keep people from achieving rehabilitation after committing crimes and lead to overpopulation in prisons.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2020/09/16/consequences-california-grocery-stores-tougher-crime-laws-safety-concerns/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjRj536gLT9AhWUGVkFHQTtCME4ZBAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw1-CSMVxDwGDMFPfnAArPKp,2020-09-16
Scottish Hate Crime Bill To Prosecute People Who Use Hate Speech Even While Home,"A hate crime bill in Scotland is stirring up controversy after the Justice Secretary said “hate speech” in the home must be prosecuted.

“Are we comfortable giving a defense to somebody whose behaviour is threatening or abusive which is intentionally stirring up hatred against, for example, Muslims? Are we saying that that is justified because that is in the home?” Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said, according to The Times.

Artists and journalists could also be in trouble should the bill become law, with Yousaf saying they shouldn’t be able to stoke tensions under the guise of free speech.

“We wouldn’t want to give the likes of Tommy Robinson a defense by saying that he’s ‘a blogger who writes for The Patriot Times so my reasonable defense is that I am a journalist.”

The Hate Crime and Public Order Bill is in stage one in the Scottish Parliament. The bill introduces new hatred offenses for characteristics like disability, sexual orientation and age, according to The National.

Yousaf said the Scottish government will include an amendment in the second stage that would mean an offender would have to intentionally stir up hatred to be prosecuted after free speech groups complained the laws would severely restrict free expression, per the same report.

The change comes after the original bill had a lower threshold that would nab offenders whose behavior was “likely to” stir up hatred, according to The Times.

Conversations over the dinner table that incite hatred must be prosecuted under Scotland’s hate crime law, the justice secretary Humza Yousaf has said https://t.co/0FBmwUDOX8 — The Times Scotland (@thetimesscot) October 28, 2020

Other new offenses that could become law in Scotland include “possessing inflammatory material” which covers people who “have in their possession threatening, abusive or insulting material with a view to communicating the material to another person,” according to BBC.

However, free speech advocates argued that the definition of “stirring up hatred” is too vague and could lead to people being prosecuted for simple jokes, per BBC. (RELATED: Textbook Crackdown: Hong Kong Publishers Allegedly Told To Alter Textbooks)

Earlier this month The Scottish Police Federation warned the bill “could lead to police officers determining free speech and thereby devastate the legitimacy of the police service,” BBC reported.

General Secretary Calum Steele agreed with the federation’s sentiment, noting the bill could “cost” free speech.

“We do not for one second suggest that prejudice, racism or discrimination are desirable qualities in our society but the need to address those matters when they reach a criminal level is met by laws already in place and the cost to free speech of going further with this bill is too high a price to pay for very little gain,” Steele said, per the same report.

The Law Society of Scotland also voiced similar concerns over the “lack of clarity” that could “lead to restrictions in freedom of expression, one of the foundations of a democratic society” back in July.

Amanda Miller, President of the Law Society of Scotland, said the bill could be risky.

“We have real concerns that certain behaviour, views expressed, or even an actor’s performance, which might well be deemed insulting or offensive, could result in a criminal conviction under the terms of the Bill as currently drafted.”

However, Yousaf said he is open to expanding protections of free speech to cover all the protected characteristics in the bill as well as protections for acts that express “antipathy, dislike, ridicule or insults,” per The National.

“I’m very actively considering both the breadth and the depth of freedom–of–expression clauses. We have to be aware of some of the concerns that may be expressed if we were to have a generic freedom–of–expression clause, would that be specific enough to give people the reassurances that they desire?” Yousaf asked.

“We’re looking at all those issues in the round, I would anticipate some further change around the freedom-of–expression clause probably coming at stage two, be it from members or possibly from the Government, but it is an area under active consideration,” he said, according to The National.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2020/10/28/scotland-hate-crime-bill-free-speech/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwit9qT2gLT9AhUmF1kFHbsUAXg4KBAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw3I2yppV0XFZcwb33SZYnyk,2020-10-28
‘Endangers Black People’: College Faculty Removes Race From Crime Alerts,"Cornell University’s Faculty Senate has approved a resolution that would no longer allow campus police “CRIME ALERT” emails to use race as an identifier when alerting students and faculty to a crime.

Resolution 158, also titled “Regarding Crime Alerts and Race” passed last week after being introduced earlier in February, Fox News reported on Monday. The resolution stated it sought to end the “false association of Blackness with criminality” and stop the justification of the “violent policing of Black people.”

“Whereas, the knowledge that a crime may have been committed by a Black man does not make CRIME ALERT recipients any safer, but instead endangers Black people in the community, reinforcing the common phenomenon of violence against Black people on the grounds that they look like suspected criminals,” the resolution read in part.

One background document for the resolution said that 75% of suspects were identified as black and male, according to Fox.

The document also suggested that some of the alerts were “too vague” and could lead to targeting of other black students on campus. (RELATED: REPORT: Investigation Clears Cafeteria Worker At Elite College Smeared As Racist By Student, But Now She Has Trouble Finding A Job)

Bill Jacobson, a Cornell law professor, told Fox News that the sponsors of the bill “never demonstrated a causal connection” between alerts and lowered risk, and that the purpose of the descriptions was to “narrow the range of potential suspects.”

“The more identifying features, the less likely that negative stereotypes would play a role,” Jacobson said.

In March, professors at the university protested a degree program with China’s Peking University over concerns of human rights and interference with the academic programs. The proposal was eventually rejected early in April, according to the Cornell Sun.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/04/12/cornell-university-campus-crime-alerts-race-bill-jacobson/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjRj536gLT9AhWUGVkFHQTtCME4ZBAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw3mBVpdPIeWj-Oz7diw3g3N,2021-04-12
"Violent Crime Surged In These Cities After Mass Black Lives Matter, Anti-Police Protests","Violent crime surged in several U.S. cities that saw massive Black Live Matter and anti-police protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death last summer.

“We are definitely at a critical manpower shortage here,” Louisville police union spokesperson Dave Mutchler told the Daily Caller News Foundation last week. “The climate that we all find ourselves in right now is a lot more demanding and stressful on officers.”

Protests, in which demonstrators alleged widespread police brutality, occurred in about 1,700 different U.S. municipalities and cities within the span of just a few weeks in June 2020, USA Today reported.

Violent crime surged in several U.S. cities that saw massive Black Live Matter and anti-police protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death last summer.

The upswing of violent crime, including homicides, coincided with the protests, increased anti-police sentiment among Americans and declining morale in police departments, which have since struggled to recruit new officers. The number of murders alone increased by 36.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, according to public information compiled by data analytics reporter Jeff Asher.

“We are definitely at a critical manpower shortage here,” Louisville police union spokesperson Dave Mutchler told the Daily Caller News Foundation last week. “The climate that we all find ourselves in right now is a lot more demanding and stressful on officers.”

“Morale is basically in the toilet,” he continued.

In the wake of the death of George Floyd, who died after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck for about 10 minutes in May 2020, thousands of protests and riots took place across the country. Chauvin was found guilty of second-degree and third-degree murder last month.

Protests, in which demonstrators alleged widespread police brutality, occurred in about 1,700 different U.S. municipalities and cities within the span of just a few weeks in June 2020, USA Today reported. Overall, the protests and riots caused about $1 billion in damage. (RELATED: The War On Police Is In Full Swing. How Does It End?)

In addition to property damage, violent crime increased rapidly last summer. These cities were particularly hit hard by the crime surge.

Minneapolis, Minnesota

Violent crime increased 17% in low-income communities and 30% in high-income neighborhoods in Minneapolis, the site of some of the earliest and most violent protests last year, the Star Tribune reported in September. Some neighborhoods experienced as much as 36% more violent crime.

Homicides, assaults, shootings and robberies all ticked up, according to the Star Tribune. Overall, murder in the city increased 72.3% in 2020 compared to 2019, according to Asher.

“‘I can sell drugs here, I can shoot here,’ they carry guns, they don’t care about anything,” Belal Hijazi, an owner of a gas station in Minneapolis, told the Star Tribune.

Hijazi said criminals were emboldened by the lack of police officers.

The Minneapolis city council voted to dismantle its police department in June. The council also approved a measure to cut the police budget.

As crime increased and law enforcement response time increased, citizens came together to form watch groups and erect barricades defending their neighborhoods.

New York City, New York

New York City also saw a steep increase in violent crime last summer, according to The New York Times. (RELATED: ‘They’re Not Concerned About The General Public’: NY, LA Police Unions Blast Massive Budget Cuts)

Between May and August, the New York Police Department reported 791 shootings, or 140% more than the same period in 2019, and 180 murders, a 51% increase compared to 2019, the NYT reported. By August and with four months remaining in the year, the city had already surpassed the number of shootings that occurred every year since 2015.

Murder increased by 39.2% in 2020 compared to 2019 overall, according to Asher’s database.

But, New York City officials approved a $1 billion cut to the city’s police department on June 30 after dozens of protests and riots. Protesters were filmed setting fires, destroying police cruisers and looting businesses in New York City during one of the riots.

“I took this job after my father did, and I will not let my sons take this job,” New York Sergeants Benevolent Association (SBA) Vice President Vincent Vallelong told the DCNF last summer.

“There’s no respect on the street anymore, which is going to take a lot of time to get back,” he continued.

Chicago, Illinois

Chicago reported more than 500 homicides between January 2020 and August 2020, according to WTTW-TV. The number represented a sharp increase compared to 2019, which saw 495 murders through the entire year.

“This has been an unprecedented year in policing, as coronavirus, civil unrest and violence have all converged in Chicago and in cities throughout the country,” Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said, WTTW reported.

In the first eight months of 2020, shootings increased 52%, the number of shooting victims increased 56% and total homicides increased 49% compared to the same period in 2019, WTTW reported. Chicago concluded 2020 with a 55% total murder increase compared to 2019, according to Asher’s database.

Meanwhile, after a series of riots and demonstrations, the local Chicago branch of Black Lives Matter warned Mayor Lori Lightfoot in August that violent protests would continue unless substantive changes were made, the Chicago Tribune reported. The group downplayed the destruction of businesses “owned by the wealthy.”

“The mayor clearly has not learned anything since May, and she would be wise to understand that the people will keep rising up until the [Chicago Police Department] is abolished and our Black communities are fully invested in,” the group said, according to the Chicago Tribune.

During one protest, hundreds of looters and rioters were seen setting fires and breaking into storefronts. (RELATED: Police Departments Say Budget Cuts Are The Reason They’ve Been Unable To Hire New Officers)

Lightfoot asked the Chicago city council to cut nearly $60 million from the police budget in October, according to CBS Chicago.

Washington, D.C.

In December, Washington, D.C., reached 187 homicides, the highest number of murders in the city since 2005, according to the Washingtonian. Homicides, assault from a dangerous weapon and motor vehicle theft all increased.

Murders increased 19.4% overall in 2020 compared to 2019, according to Asher’s database. Former Metropolitan Police Department Chief Peter Newsham blamed the increase in crime to “repeat violent gun offenders being released back into our community,” the Washingtonian reported.

Washington D.C. saw dozens of protests throughout the summer last year.

In one June protest, tens of thousands gathered to demand greater police accountability, according to the Associated Press. The protest, in which police reported multiple fires and mass looting, required thousands of national guardsmen to help enforce a strict curfew that was ordered by city officials.

Atlanta, Georgia

Last year was Atlanta’s deadliest year in more than two decades, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The city reported 150 murders in 2020, a whopping 58% increase compared to 2019.

“It’s ridiculous that now, even during this pandemic, we got more gun violence going on than ever before,” local activist Columbus Ward told the AJC. (RELATED: ‘Abolish ICE!’: Protesters Crash Biden’s Georgia Rally)

Atlanta experienced multiple protests throughout the summer last year, many of which led to mass violence, according to U.S. News and World Report. In some cases, protests left burned police cars and looted businesses in their wake.

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms characterized one May 2020 protest as “chaos.” During the demonstration, people were seen looting and setting fires as they called for police reform.

“In 2021, we cannot have a repeat of what’s going on this year,” Atlanta City Council President Felicia Moore said, according to the AJC. “And that’s going to mean addressing police accountability, but that’s also going to mean we have to support the police.”

In June, Lance Bottoms promised that the city would continue to reallocate funds from police to “social services and community enhancement initiatives,” which she said the city had been doing for years, according to Reporter Newspapers.

"Psaki Dodges Question On Soaring Crime Rates, Blames ‘Guns Problem’","White House press secretary Jen Psaki said “there is a guns problem” when asked about an uptick in violent crimes during a press briefing Monday.

“This past weekend there were more than a dozen mass shootings across this country. 4000 more people [were] shot and killed by guns in 2020 compared to the year before. Is there a crime problem in this country?,” a reporter asked Psaki.

“Well, I would say certainly there is a guns problem. And that’s something the president would say,” Psaki replied.

Psaki conceded that “violence is an issue” in some local communities, adding that President Joe Biden‘s administration’s decision to increase funding for the so-called “community violence prevention programs” aims to address the violence epidemic. (RELATED: Biden Goes All In On Calls For Extreme Gun Control)

The Minneapolis City Council voted December 2020 to re-allocate $7.7 million from the police department to violence prevention and community programs. Violent crimes in Minneapolis grew by 21% in 2020 from the year before, according to U.S. News & World Report.

“Between mass shootings … that get a lot of attention … there are hundreds of thousands people who lose their lives,” Psaki added. “That’s one of the reasons the president will continue to advocate for the Senate passing universal background checks, but also advocate for action in states.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/05/24/jen-psaki-crime-epidemic-gun-problem/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwicoPT2gLT9AhV5LFkFHSMPB0Y4MhAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw2MN_ZfEVPfsJluQg1Y4soI,2021-05-24
"MSNBC Contributor Says Rising Crime Is The ‘Fault Of The Police,’ Not Defunding","Activist and MSNBC contributor Brittany Packnett Cunningham said Monday morning that rising crime rates are the “fault of the police,” not the fault of movements nation wide calling for the police to be defunded.

MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle brought Cunningham and Center for Policing Equity co-founder Tracie Keesee on her show to discuss community policing and rising crime rates in major cities. Crime has become a key issue in New York City’s mayoral race.

When Ruhle asked about the New York City mayoral race, crime, and the defund the police movement, Cunningham said that everyone wants safer communities, but called policing “ineffective.” (RELATED: Cities That Pushed For Defunding The Police Reckon With Record-High Crime Rates)

“Defunding the police is not just about taking money out of an institution that continues to prove ineffective, it’s also about refunding the people,” she said. “It’s about ensuring that the services that people need to ensure safe communities from the ground up are actually being funded and resourced to their full capacity.”

Cunningham blamed police unions and “GOP operatives” for linking the defund the police movement to rising crime. She said that defunding the police never actually happened because in the 50 largest cities in the United States, police spending as a share of general expenditures rose by 0.1%.

After the death of George Floyd, the defund the police movement took off. Activists called for alternatives such as community policing and redirecting funds to invest in the community. Police departments, including those in Minneapolis and San Francisco, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that they saw a drop in applications during calls for budget cuts.

The police departments in Washington, D.C., and Austin, Texas put in place a hiring freeze after officials cut $15 million and $150 million from the departments’ budgets, respectively. New York City passed a budget bill in 2020 to defund the police by $1 billion.

“So this rising crime is not the fault of the movement, it’s actually the fault of the police and this has been our point all along,” Cunningham added. “Why should we keep funding systems and institutions that keep rendering themselves ineffective? We should be talking about gun control, livable wages, fair housing, education – that’s where we should be moving the money to, to ensure truly safe streets.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/06/21/msnbc-contributor-brittany-packnett-cunningham-rising-crime-fault-police-not-defunding/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjotMr5gLT9AhVOEVkFHeLMD-44WhAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw1o-XiFLoNpUYGYPmKGHXFH,2021-06-21
"Reporter Known For Investigating Gangsters, Drug Lords Dies From Shooting While Leaving TV Station In Amsterdam","A Dutch investigative reporter, who had spent his career covering the criminal underground, has died after being shot July 6 while leaving a TV studio in Amsterdam, RTL reported.

Peter R. de Vries, who covered high profile cases like the kidnapping of beer magnate Freddy Heineken in 1983, was shot just after 7:30 p.m. after appearing on a chat show. Five close range shots were fired, with de Vries being hit in the head, according to BBC News.

The reporter was known to take up cold cases, especially when it involved children or teenagers, and won an Emmy Award in 2005 about Natalee Holloway, a U.S. teenager who went missing in Aruba. He also frequently functioned as a spokesperson for witnesses in police or court cases, and had been acting as an adviser to a former gang member testifying against a drug lord.

Officials said last week that de Vries had been fighting for his life. His son, Royce, had said it was his family’s “worst nightmare come true,” BBC News reported.

“Peter fought to the end, but was unable to win the battle,” his family said in a statement announcing his death to RTL, the Dutch network de Vries routinely worked for. “Peter has lived by his conviction: ‘On bended knee is no way to be free.'”

“We are unbelievably proud of him and at the same time inconsolable,” they added.

Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte called de Vries a “courageous journalist” and the shooting “shocking and incomprehensible.” King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima said they were “deeply shocked” and that “journalists must be free to carry out their important work without threats,” according to BBC News. (RELATED: 20-Year-Old Summer Intern Dies After Getting Struck By Stray Bullet On Chicago Subway)

The International Federation of Journalists labeled the shooting “another tragic blow to press freedom in Europe,” while European Parliament President David-Maria Sassoli said “attacks against journalists are attacks against all of us,” BBC News reported.

Dutch police said two men, one Dutch and the other Polish, are continuing to be held in connection with the shooting, while a third suspect, who is 18-years-old, will be released, according to BBC News.

Crime Is So Bad In Atlanta The State Might Ask Locals To Fund The Police For A Tax Deduction,"Crime has become so bad in Atlanta that Republican Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan announced Thursday he would work with the state assembly to create a program where locals can donate to underfunded police departments in exchange for a tax deduction.

“It should be no surprise that every state leader is concerned with the exponential rise in crime here in Georgia, especially in our Capital city,” Duncan said. “Rising crime is affecting individuals, businesses, and Georgia families, and combatting this problem will not be accomplished by one solution alone.”

“Big problems call for big solutions,” he continued.

Duncan is calling on the state assembly to create a $250 million state tax credit as part of the Law Enforcement Strategic Support (LESS) Crime Act. The legislation would allow “citizens and corporations to write a check directly to their local law enforcement agency” in exchange for a “100% dollar-for-dollar state tax credit.”

The credit would be capped at $5,000 per individual and $10,000 per married couple. The funds will be used to pay officers more, hire more officers and increase officer training.

Atlanta residents fed up with the spike in crime and lack of police support have recently gone as far as threatening to leave the city.

Buckhead City Committee CEO Bill White has blamed Democratic Mayor Keisha Bottoms for the rise in crime, claiming her decision to eliminate cash bail for certain minor offenses and policies that keep low-level offenders out of overcrowded jails has contributed to the dangerous situation.

White argues the Atlanta Police Department is underfunded, which only makes the situation worse. (RELATED: HART: Buckhead – Come For The Shopping, Stay To Fill Out The Police Report)

“They feel demonized, underpaid, under-recognized,” White said in June on Fox. “They are being told basically not to fight crime in the way they would like to.”

“Buckhead City” would have its own court, jail and police system. The area, which was once safe, has seen a 52% increase in aggravated assaults in 2021, according to 11 Alive. Homicides have spiked citywide with a 58% change in the month of May when compared to data from the same time last year.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/07/22/atlanta-crime-high-state-legislation-locals-fund-police-departments-tax-break/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj7-Z74gLT9AhWwFlkFHYzZCsE4RhAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw0m0gPf81wQWt43jcRvcSSz,2021-07-22
‘Crime Is Increasing’: Police Sgt. Says Gov. Newsom Is Living In ‘Fantasy World’,"A senior Los Angeles police union official slammed Democrat California Gov. Gavin Newsom in an interview Friday for saying there is no statewide crime upsurge.

“That’s a fantasy world. Where are we living in? I mean, you could look at the numbers throughout California and the rest of the country. Crime is increasing. It is surging, and there’s no consequences,” Los Angeles Police Protective League vice president Sgt. Jerretta Sandoz told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends.”

“There’s no repercussions for these criminals that feel that they could go in and do what they want. And it’s because of these laws. That statement is not true. The numbers don’t lie,” Sandoz said.

WATCH:

Sandoz made her comment when she was responding to a question on Newsom’s statements to a reporter about the state’s crime problems. The video of Newsom speaking to the reporter is included in Fox News’ clip of their interview with Sandoz.

“There are some people that say that some of the policies championed by Democrats like Prop. 47 and others are making are making crime worse. What do you say to that?” the reporter asked, to which Newsom responded, “Yeah … the evidence doesn’t back it up.”

“The last three decades we have seen a significant decline in crime in the state,” Newsom, who faces a recall election, told the reporter. “You are seeing crime increase in red states that had no criminal justice reform.”

Proposition 47, also known as “The Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act” was a California initiative that brought major changes to felony sentencing laws. It was part of several so-called criminal justice reforms carried out by the state’s Democrat-controlled government.

The Act reclassifies some forms of theft and narcotics possession as misdemeanors instead of felonies. Defendants serving sentences for crimes the proposition reclassified as misdemeanors are allowed to seek resentencing under the proposition. And, defendants who already served their time for the reclassified crimes can, under the Act, seek reclassification on their records.

A 2018 study by the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC), four years after the ballot initiative was passed, found no proof backing the claim that “violent crime increased as a result of Proposition 47.”

“While California saw an uptick in the violent crime rate from 2014 to 2016, this trend appears to have preceded the reform and is due in large part to unrelated changes in crime reporting after 2014,” the study stated. (RELATED: Video Shows Groups Of Shoplifters Looting Store, Getting Into Getaway Cars)

However, the institute found “some evidence that Proposition 47 affected property crime. Statewide, property crime increased after 2014.”

“While the reform had no apparent impact on burglaries or auto thefts, it may have contributed to a rise in larceny thefts, which increased by roughly 9 percent (about 135 more thefts per 100,000 residents) compared to other states. Crime data show that thefts from motor vehicles account for about three-quarters of this increase,” the report stated.

The 2019 average rate of automobile theft in California was one per three and a half minutes, according to a report from the California Highway Patrol.

The state has also been suffering from a rise in shoplifting, causing millions of dollars in annual losses incurred by California businesses, forcing Newsom to sign a law Wednesday that would bring back the “crime of retail theft,” The Associated Press reported.

The state nonetheless has seen a steady decline in violent crime and property crime rates starting around the 1990s, according to calculations of FBI data by the PPIC updated up to 2020.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/07/23/la-police-union-jerreta-sandoz-newsom-crime/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj7-Z74gLT9AhWwFlkFHYzZCsE4RhAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw39oRdU9p93FF9aVk8StxPu,2021-07-23
GAUGHEN: More Prosecutions Of Petty Crime Won’t Curb Violence In America,"Editor’s note: We endeavor to bring you the top voices on current events representing a range of perspectives. Below is a column arguing that prosecuting people for petty crimes won’t reduce violent crime in American cities. You can find a counterpoint here, where former Martinsburg Police Chief Maurice Richards argues that prosecuting petty crimes has been an effective way to reduce violent crime as well.

Since the inception of LBJ’s “War on Crime” fifty years ago and the multiple iterations implemented in recent years, experts in criminology have struggled to find any meaningful reduction in crime. In fact, the opposite has been seen. Incarceration rates have skyrocketed over the years to the point that the United States has the highest prison population in the world — and still violent crime is on the rise. Despite the total failure of these programs, we’ve seen repeated attempts to replicate them across the country, including President Biden’s current appetite for new gun laws and regulations. Why do we keep recycling these failed policies?

To get to the root of the problem, it’s imperative to understand why these policies inevitably fail. First, they are centered around the repeatedly disproven Broken Windows Theory, which holds that petty crimes like vandalism and shoplifting should be harshly penalized in order to deter people from committing worse or violent crimes. The Broken Windows Theory was introduced in the 1980s, but didn’t receive wide attention until the 1990s when then-mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani partnered with New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton to tackle the crime wave they were seeing. Supporters of this policy tout that it led to a reduction in violent crime.

Instead of deterring crime though, what came from this strategy was abusive and racially discriminatory policies like stop-and-frisk. Unarticulated to the public at the time, the real goal was to rid the city of what the mayoral administration identified as “undesirables.” In addition to a sharp spike in incarceration, these “tough on crime” tactics also rapidly accelerated the already-strained relationship between law enforcement and minorities across the U.S.

New York City wasn’t the only place where overzealous policing became the norm. Around that same time, the entire country experienced the advent of “overcriminalization,” or the practice of implementing overly-punitive laws. These practices, all stemming from this “War On Crime,” were meant to reduce crime across the board. But like the Broken Window Theory, overcriminalization did far more damage than improvement to society. It is not “broken windows” that lead to crime — rather, the creation and enforcement of these petty crimes struck at the root of communities across the country by incarcerating wide swaths of mostly harmless people and removing them from their families for decades at a time.

In recent years, prestigious academic institutions like Harvard and Northeastern, along with well-established organizations like Right on Crime, the Cato Institute and the Libertarian Party, have all spoken out on why overcriminalization does more harm than good. Not only are those institutions and organizations speaking out against these failed policies, they are offering and successfully lobbying for the implementation of a multi-faceted approach to preventing crime.

The first step is to overhaul the criminal justice system. Archaic and counterproductive occupational licensing laws and zoning ordinances make it harder for people, especially those in urban communities, to open businesses and should be eliminated. It also means making changes to our legal system so that victimless and petty crimes don’t have life-ruining consequences. When people make a mistake and commit a petty crime, they have a blemish on their criminal record that follows them for the rest of their lives. It’s difficult to find employment. It’s even more difficult to find housing. Shunned from “legitimate” employment, those with convictions on even minor crimes often find themselves making a living in the dangerous underground market for illegal drugs in order to sustain themselves and their families.

The next step, which is reform-based and has been successful across the country, is building strong communities and investing in people. When people are empowered to take ownership of their neighborhoods and cities and when they have a vested interest in their community’s success, they are less likely to commit a crime against that community. For example, communities that have strong juvenile diversionary programs and strong mentorship programs give at-risk youth a fighting chance to stay out of trouble. In fact, young people who go through these programs frequently end up starting businesses of their own in their communities and become quite successful in the process.

As someone who has worked with current and former incarcerated individuals, I’ve seen how the prosecution of victimless and petty crimes ruins lives, livelihoods, and families. It’s part of the reason I came to the Libertarian Party. For the past 50 years, the Libertarian Party has been the only consistent voice on this issue. Our candidates provide an option to voters that they simply do not get from the old parties. We know that people need to be empowered to take care of their communities, and we believe the best way for them to do this is to remove not only big government, but bad government so people are free to realize their potential. We seek a world set free in our lifetime, and that must start here at home.

"Murder Increased Nationwide By Record Rate In 2020 As Police Employment Fell, FBI Report Shows","Violent crime increased for the first time in four years and America’s murder rate increased by a record amount in 2020, according to new FBI data released Monday.

The nationwide violent crime rate increased by 5.6% from 2019 to 2020, according to the FBI’s 2020 “Crime in the United States” annual report. The estimated 2020 rate of violent crime was 387.8 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants, driven by an increase in assault and a record rise in murder.

FBI: Murder increased 29.4% in the United States in 2020 compared to previous year — Lucas Tomlinson (@LucasFoxNews) September 27, 2021

Murder jumped by nearly 30%, the largest increase since recordkeeping began, according to the FBI’s Crime Data Explorer. The arrest rate for murder and non-negligent manslaughter in 2020 was 3.8 per 100,000 inhabitants. The estimated number of aggravated assault offenses jumped by 12.1%, while estimated rates for rape, robbery and property crimes all fell.

The 2020 murder rate was the highest in more than 20 years, but remained lower than peak rates during the 1980s and 1990s, according to the FBI.

Policing tactics and funding levels were a flashpoint of political debate in 2020, particularly following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. A number of large cities reduced police budgets or restricted policing tactics, in some cases corresponding with an increase in crime levels.

According to the FBI, 13,377 law enforcement agencies reported staffing levels to the agency in 2020, and the rate of law enforcement employees nationwide was 3.4 per 1,000 inhabitants.

"FBI Releases Crime Stats, Shows Why Gun Ownership Rises","By Larry Keane

The FBI released the Uniform Crime Report which showed an abrupt rise in crime. It was hardly startling to those reading or watching the news. The report showed a 29 percent jump in murders in 2020. It is reportedly the largest increase since nationwide records began in the 1960s. That’s got gun control proponents banging the same drum: more guns mean more crime.

That’s just not true. A simple look at the data proves it.

The murder rates are still below peaks witnessed in the 1990s, but 2020 reversed a 20-plus year trend of decreasing crime rates.

The overall violent crime rate, which includes murder, assault, robbery and rape, rose 5 percent, according to an NPR report. The narrative, though, that historic levels of gun purchasing is somehow linked to the rise in violent crime is bogus, even if it is conveniently repeated.

“Much of the violence was driven by firearms, with nearly 77% of murders being committed with some sort of gun,” NPR reported. CBS News reported a headline of “Murder rate climbed 29% in 2020 amid gun stockpiling and pandemic pressures.”

Blame The Gun, Never The Criminal

This isn’t a new narrative. It’s one that has been pushed by gun control groups and even by the Biden administration. President Joe Biden labeled the firearm industry as “the enemy” during his run for The White House. Earlier this year, be blamed guns for the crime spike, instead of the criminals illegally misusing them and the failed policies that won’t lock up criminals.

It’s true that gun sales have rocketed to record levels. There were over 21 million background checks for the sale of a gun in 2020 and over 12.4 million through the first eight months of 2021. Attempting to link the rise in gun sales as the cause of crime spikes is nonsensical.

What’s not true is that law-abiding gun owners bear the blame. National Review’s Aron Ravin wrote in July of how Democratic politicians were blaming guns and gun owners instead of failed policies for escalating crime rates.

“But after last summer’s anti-police backlash, leftist legislators and policy designers took the easy way out — they followed the propaganda,” Ravin wrote.

That included hiring fewer police due to police protests, releasing prisoners over COVID contagion fears and eliminating cash bail in the name of equity.

“They’d rather take steps to destroy the system entirely,” he added. “Radical ideas moved from the fringes toward the heart of progressive politics, crowding out common sense.”

Among the lost common-sense ideas is that law-abiding gun owners aren’t criminals. They aren’t committing crimes and gun sales didn’t give birth to the crime but is a reasonable and anticipated reaction to when Americans are concerned for their safety.

Gun sales went from trending along anticipated growth predictions in February 2020 to all-time records a month later. February 2020 saw nearly 1.3 million background checks. It was growth over the same month in 2019 that saw 1.1 million, but nothing close to the 2.3 million background checks in March 2020. That was over one million more than March 2019. The ensuing months all continued to shatter records.

What Changed?

People became concerned for their safety as police were pulled from the streets, prisoners were released over contagion fears and communities were locked down. That reflected in the surveys NSSF conducted to understand the fast pace of gun sales. Customers told retailers they were buying firearms for concerns of their own safety. That bore out in the types of firearms that were sold. Handguns topped the list, which have limited application outside self-defense and recreational target shooting.

Understanding that these gun buyers were also required to submit to FBI National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) verification to prove they weren’t individuals prohibited from possessing firearms also debunks this notion. The rapid rise in crime didn’t turn these law-abiding citizens into instant criminals. Criminals turned law-abiding citizens into new gun owners – to the tune of over 8.4 million in 2020 and over 3.2 million in the first six months of this year.

It’s illogical to propose that gun owners who respect the law would turn into violent criminals overnight. It’s so illogical that no one has presented any evidence it is true. Even if stolen firearms are taken into account, The Dispatch pointed out that the average FBI’s own statistic for time-to-crime for a stolen firearm is over nine years.

Gun purchases rose to historic levels in 2020 and is sustaining near-record figures through this year due to a combination of events, including COVID-related security concerns, rising crime, election-year threats of gun control and maneuvers by the Biden administration to enact some of the most radical gun control ideas proposed that are driving gun sales.

Which came first, the crime or the guns? It’s not even close. Not by a long shot. It’s the crime.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/09/30/fbi-releases-crime-stats-shows-why-gun-ownership-rises/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwicoPT2gLT9AhV5LFkFHSMPB0Y4MhAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw1W6hzIEXhIk_PoKyFJOvS0,2021-09-30
Cities Reconsidering Dem Defund The Police Measures After Spike In Crime,"Several major cities that cut police funding in response to activist pressure are hiring new officers and reversing the cuts due to spikes in violent crime.

The U.S. national violent crime rate increased by 5.6% in 2020, according to FBI data released in September 2021, with murder increasing 30%. With those jumps continuing into 2021, cities that cut police funding in response to Black Lives Matter and Defund The Police protests are rethinking their public safety funding choices.

Major cities, including Dallas, Minneapolis and New York, are restoring police funding in an effort to grapple with the continued increase in violent crime.

The Dallas City Council cut $150 million from its police budget in 2020 and $7 million from the Dallas Police Department’s overtime fund.

Dallas saw a 25% increase in homicides in 2020, with the city at its highest number of killings per 100,000 people since 2004, according to The Dallas Morning News.

“As an African American male who came of age in the 1990s, I remember a lot of people whose lives were devastated by violence,” Democratic Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson told the New York Times of his decision to support the hiring of 250 new police officers. “I don’t want to go back there.”

Following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis Police Department custody, the Minneapolis City Council moved to abolish the city’s police department. It ultimately cut the MPD budget by $7.7 million.

However, following a crime spike, including a 72.3% increase in homicides, a Hennepin County judge ordered the city of Minneapolis to hire more police officers. The judge, Jamie Anderson, ruled that a failure to maintain law enforcement numbers violated the city charter.

Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced in August that he would request $191.9 million for MPD as part of his proposed 2022 budget, a nearly $28 million increase from the $164 million the city council allocated for 2021. MPD was ultimately able to access $180 million for 2021, including money from a reserve fund and the American Rescue Plan, according to The Star Tribune.

Perhaps the most stinging rebuke to the Defund The Police movement came at the New York City ballot box, when Democratic primary voters elected former New York Police Department captain Eric Adams to be their mayoral nominee. Adams ran on a platform of improving the city’s police department and fighting violent crime. (RELATED: Eric Adams Shows Yet Again That Leftists Dominate The Dialogue, Only To Lose Elections)

“Social media does not pick a candidate,” Adams said as voters took to the polls on June 22. “People on social security pick a candidate. I don’t care about what people tweet.

Walgreens Closing 5 More Stores In San Francisco Because Of ‘Ongoing Organized Retail Crime’,"Walgreens announced Tuesday the closure of five more stores in San Francisco due to the surge of shoplifting that has plagued the city, Fox Business reported.

“Due to ongoing organized retail crime, we have made the difficult decision to close five stores across San Francisco,” a Walgreens spokesperson told Fox Business. “Each store will transfer prescriptions to a nearby Walgreens location within a mile radius and we expect to place the stores’ team members in other nearby locations.”

The company has shuttered at least 10 of its San Francisco stores since 2019, Fox Business reported.

Retailers in San Francisco have previously sounded the alarm over an organized crime scheme that stole millions worth of their products to later flip them online.

Apart from closing down the increased number of locations across the city, Walgreens has also ramped up its investment into security measures in San Francisco stores, bringing it to “46 times our chain average,” the spokesperson added.

"Jussie Smollett, Osundairo Brothers Went Through ‘Dry Run’ Of Hate Crime Hoax, Prosecutor Says","Jussie Smollett and the two men who attacked him as part of an alleged hate crime hoax participated in a “dry run” of the incident to ensure that it would go according to plan, prosecutor Dan Webb alleged in his Monday evening opening remarks at the disgraced actor’s trial.

“I want you to attack me, but when you hit me, I want you to kind of pull your punches a bit because I don’t want to get seriously hurt,” Smollett told brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, according to Webb. Webb cited alleged video evidence showing Smollett’s Mercedes circling the location of the faked attack before it happened, and said that would be evidence that the three men knew where they wanted the assault to occur.

The brothers claim that the money was for personal training ahead of a music video the actor was set to appear in.

"Liberal California Politicians Promise To Be Tough On Crime As Thefts, Shootings Increase","California Democrats are toughening their stance on crime amid increasing violence and homicides, with many politicians pledging to invest in law enforcement.

In Los Angeles, city councilmembers have begun redirecting funds from their districts to pay for police overtime in a bid to quell the rising crime.

Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf sent a letter Tuesday to Gov. Gavin Newsom requesting he fund an initiative by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) to use license plate readers and technology that captures a vehicle’s description to catch criminals fleeing Oakland with stolen merchandise, as well as use the state’s retail theft unit to combat the city’s rising larcenies.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed pledged to significantly boost the police presence in the high-crime Tenderloin neighborhood, calling for increased funding for police overtime and efforts to crack down on drug dealing in the area.

California Democrats are toughening their stance on crime amid increasing violence and homicides, with many politicians pledging to invest in law enforcement.

Crime in California has skyrocketed over the past two years, with homicides in San Francisco jumping 15% in 2021 compared to 2020, and over 50% compared to 2019. Statewide, homicides, property crime, violent crime and larcenies have all risen since before the pandemic.

Retail thefts in particular have plagued the state, most notably in Los Angeles and San Francisco, where organized gangs of criminals will break into and loot storefronts of their merchandise. (RELATED: Some Democrats Are Livid With Their Own Party For Denying Crime Problems)

In Los Angeles, city councilmembers have begun redirecting funds from their districts to pay for police overtime in a bid to quell the rising crime, The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday. Councilman Joe Buscaino, a Democrat, spent $1.3 million from his district’s coffers to pay for police overtime, while fellow Democratic Councilman Paul Koretz spent $90,000 and requested an additional police presence to handle crime in the upscale Melrose Avenue area of Los Angeles.

“Once we had the issue of a lot of folks coming to Melrose to do crime, we said, ‘We have to hit this with everything we have,’ so we put in some extra funding,” Koretz told The Times. “They gave us foot patrols and bike patrols and undercover folks and horse patrols.”

San Francisco Mayor London Breed pledged to significantly boost the police presence in the high-crime Tenderloin neighborhood, calling for increased funding for police overtime and efforts to crack down on drug dealing in the area.

In a message posted to her blog Tuesday, Breed expanded on her plans to reduce crime in the city which included “securing emergency police funding to ensure we have the resources to combat major safety problems over the next several months,” as well as plans for “disrupting” organized retail thefts that have been plaguing San Francisco.

“It comes to an end when we take the steps to be more aggressive with law enforcement, more aggressive with the changes in our policies and less tolerant of all the bullshit that has destroyed our city,” Breed told reporters Tuesday. (RELATED: Former Mayor Michael Nutter Writes Scathing Op-Ed After Philadelphia DA Larry Krasner Denies There’s Major Crime Problem)

Breed had previously signed a budget defunding the San Francisco Police Department and other law enforcement agencies by roughly $120 million following the killing of George Floyd and the ensuing Black Lives Matter protests. Breed said the move would be “prioritizing investments in the African American community” instead.

Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf sent a letter Tuesday to Gov. Gavin Newsom requesting he fund an initiative by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) to use license plate readers and technology that captures a vehicle’s description to catch criminals fleeing Oakland with stolen merchandise, as well as use the state’s retail theft unit to combat the city’s rising larcenies. Schaaf argued that criminals were using stolen cars to carry out the thefts, and absconding on Oakland’s off-ramps to evade police.

“This year, Oakland has experienced more combined shootings and homicides than we’ve seen in over a decade,” Schaaf wrote, arguing that “the need for a system that can capture vehicle descriptions and alert law enforcement” has never been more apparent.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the formation of a CHP task force to crack down on organized retail theft, convening with retailers, online platforms which often serve as places to resell stolen goods, and law enforcement officials to develop a strategy to end the retail crime epidemic.

“The coordinated criminal activity we’ve seen in retail stores and online through the resale of stolen goods isn’t shoplifting or petty crime, it’s organized crime, and it’s going to take an organized strategy to put a stop to it,” Bonta said.

Bonta’s efforts follow an initiative announced by Newsom in late November to increase state police funding in order to combat the retail crime gangs.

"It’s The Crime Jen, Naming The Problem Is The Beginning","By Larry Keane

White House spokesperson Jen Psaki should know by now that speaking the truth is much easier than spinning a yarn. Yet, this White House can’t seem to bring themselves to admit crime is a problem.

For the Biden administration, it’s always the gun. Not the criminal illegally wielding a gun.

Psaki made the stunning admission that the Biden administration doesn’t feel crime is a pressing issue The White House has to address. Unless, of course, it comes to blaming the firearm industry and law-abiding gun owners.

No Laughing Matter

Psaki spoke to former Obama speechwriter Jon Lovett, a co-host of the podcast “Pod Save America,” when she attempted to gaslight America on crime concerns by noting mainstream media reporting was focused on the looming Ukraine-Russia crisis, but Fox News was reporting on the administration’s soft-on-crime policies.

“And then on FOX is Jeanine Pirro, talking about soft on crime consequences,” Psaki said according to a RealClear Politics report. “What does that even mean? So there’s an alternate universe on some coverage. What’s scary about it is a lot of people watch that and they think that the president isn’t doing anything to address people’s safety in New York and that couldn’t be further from the truth or other places.”

Psaki doubled down in a press conference when confronted with her flippant remarks about crime. She said President Joe Biden proposed increasing funding for police, calling those “uncomfortable facts” for the president’s detractors. She added, “… that gun crime is a major driver of crime across the country, also a fact.”

Face Facts

Hold on. Psaki didn’t say that criminals were an issue. She said guns were causing the crime. This is a long-standing effort on behalf of the administration and their gun control cabal to paint with a broad brush all gun owners as the same as criminals and ignoring the administration’s refusal to address crime.

Psaki is ignoring that President Biden previously voiced support for eliminating cash bail, which turns criminals back out on to the streets. Vice President Kamala Harris tweeted support and encouraged people to donate for bail money “protestors” to get out of jail during the riots and looting in the summer of 2020. U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) called attention to the bail fund plea, which raised over $35 million. The Minnesota Freedom Fund (MFF), which Vice President Harris promoted, paid $75,000 in bail for Jaleel Stallings, who was charged with attempted murder after shooting at police, according to a fact check by The Washington Post. Local Minnesota television reported the MFF bailed out multiple people charged with violent crimes, including posting $100,000 for a woman accused of killing a friend and $350,000 for a twice-convicted rapist charged with kidnapping, assault and sexual assault in two separate cases. Another man, Lionel Timms, who was bailed out with MFF money after an assault charge, was later re-arrested for third-degree assault, leaving his victim with a traumatic brain injury and a fractured skull.

Just weeks ago, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) lambasted the Biden adminstration’s proposed Executive Order that would, “limit law enforcement access to nonlethal and livesaving resources, and impose greater restrictions on federal grant dollars.”

Time and again, the country is witnessing a duplicitous approach to crime by The White House. On one hand, they claim to be taking crime seriously, but the actions by officials within the administration minimize criminal action and reduce support for law enforcement. The only blame they are quick to assign, though, is on guns.

Law-Abiding vs. Criminal

CNN attempted to make the connection between increased lawful gun ownership and crime, but their own experts, even those within the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said that connection isn’t true. Adam Winkler, a professor at UCLA School of Law who specializes in constitutional law and gun policy stated the obvious.

“We shouldn’t necessarily expect a tight connection between the number of background checks and the number of guns that are found at crime scenes,” Winkler told CNN. “Many criminals do not buy their guns at gun stores.”

Thomas Chittum, acting deputy director at the ATF, told CNN in the same report that the “vast majority” of lawfully purchased firearms won’t ever be used in a crime. The ATF’s own Trace Data, which tracks “time-to-crime” from when a firearm is purchased to when it is discovered at a crime scene is still seven years. Bureau of Justice Statistics surveys have shown criminals don’t buy their firearms legally. Over 90 percent obtain them through other means like theft or the black market.

The firearm industry wants criminals locked up. That includes criminals who misuse firearms to prey on the most vulnerable in our society. That requires a focus on enforcing criminal laws on criminals. Pretending crime isn’t a problem doesn’t solve the problem. Blaming guns and law-abiding gun owners for the criminal misdeeds of others doesn’t stop crime.

Naming the problem is the first step in stopping the problem. The problem is, and always has been, crime. If the press secretary wants to know what the consequences of soft-on-crime looks like, I suggest she step out of the protection of the Secret Service at The White House and witness what’s happening across America.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/02/07/its-the-crime-jen-naming-the-problem-is-the-beginning/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwicoPT2gLT9AhV5LFkFHSMPB0Y4MhAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw3a0hNDdvqBPt5FA6hsAOnz,2022-02-07
‘Sh*t Show’: Ocasio-Cortez Blames Part Of Rising Crime On End Of Child Tax Credit,"Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blamed congressional inaction on the Build Back Better social spending package and the end of the expanded child tax credit for contributing to an increase in crime that predated the legislation.

“We don’t want to say some of the things that are obvious, like, ‘Gee, the child tax credit just ran out, on Dec. 31, and now people are stealing baby formula.’ We don’t want to have that discussion,” Ocasio-Cortez told The New Yorker in an interview published Monday, while blasting Congress as a “scandalizing” “shit show.” The socialist also blamed Democratic Party leadership for not fully embracing the “defund the police” movement, even as some of her colleagues have said that the slogan costs the party elections. (RELATED: ‘Defund The Police’ Is Not The Problem: Cori Bush Refuses To Ditch Unpopular Slogan As Election Season Heats Up)

The expanded child tax credit, included in the American Rescue Plan (ARP), expired at the end of December 2021 after Congress did not pass Biden’s Build Back Better package or a standalone credit. The ARP included a $3,600 a year credit per child for parents of children under the age of six, and a $3,000 a year credit per child between the ages of six and 18. Without the expansion, the benefit reverts to the $2,000 per child credit included in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Some economists blamed the expanded credit for Americans’ slow return to the workforce as COVID-19 cases receded.

According to Ocasio-Cortez, however, a lack of government services, such as the child tax credit, is fueling an increase in crime, despite the fact that violent crimes like murders began increasing even as the federal government offered generous benefits to encourage Americans to stay home at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The surge in violence is being driven by young people, particularly young men. And we allow the discourse to make it sound as though it’s, like, these shady figures in the bush, jumping out from a corner. These are young men. These are boys,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “We want to say these people are criminals or we want to talk about ‘people who are violent,’ instead of ‘environments of violence,’ and what we’re doing to either contribute to that or dismantle that.”

Ocasio-Cortez also blamed Democratic Party leadership for avoiding the “Defund the Police” movement, even as many left-wing members of Congress marched in support.

“Just because there was this large conversation about ‘defund the police’ coming from the streets, the response was to immediately respond to it with fear, with pooh-poohing, with ‘this isn’t us,’ with arm’s distance,” she said, claiming that the election of New York City Mayor Eric Adams was not proof that voters support public safety measures.

“What the public wants is a strong sense of direction. I don’t think that in electing Mayor Adams everyone in the city supports bringing back torture to Rikers Island in the form of solitary confinement,” Ocasio-Cortez added.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/02/14/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-blames-rising-crime-child-tax-credit-end/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwicoPT2gLT9AhV5LFkFHSMPB0Y4MhAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw3YSJ6hgGM8C5ntp0rE9oLk,2022-02-14
"Crime In Washington, D.C., Is Driven By A Small Group Of Known Criminals","By Larry Keane

A new study from the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform revealed who is driving the vast majority of criminal firearm misuse in the Nation’s Capital. Go figure it’s a small number of lawbreakers and not law-abiding gun owners.

Stating that gun crimes in Washington, D.C., are shown to be committed by a “very tightly concentrated” group of individuals, the study’s author said, “This very small number of high risk individuals are identifiable. Their violence is predictable and therefore it is preventable.”

The data demonstrate the irony of Democratic-run big cities with strict Second Amendment restrictions and national gun control groups’ continued drive to force more gun control despite Americans believing in it less and lawfully buying their own firearms at record numbers.

What It Says

Homicide rates rose precipitously in Washington, D.C., in 2020 compared to 2019. That rate set an even higher mark in 2021 when the city had 226 murders. Those rising crime rates, the highest total in nearly 20 years, put D.C. among the nation’s largest cities to experience record crime rates over the past 12 months.

The NICJR study examined all 341 homicides (D.C. data puts the number at 364) from 2019-2020. The average age of victims is 31 and the average age of suspects is 27. The study found that 86 percent of victims and suspects have previously been involved with the D.C. criminal justice system.

“Overall, most victims and suspects with prior criminal offenses had been arrested about 11 times for about 13 different offenses by the time of the homicide,” the study said.

Of all murders examined, approximately 86 percent involved a firearm. The study excluded “cases of justified self-defense.”

Billionaire gun control funder Michael Bloomberg’s gun control propaganda news site The Trace even reported the study’s conclusion. “At least 500 identifiable people annually drive 60-70 percent of the city’s shootings — and likely no more than 200 individuals at any given moment in time.”

What It Doesn’t Say

The survey only included one main recommendation for how Washington, D.C., should best approach criminal misuse of guns and it conspicuously did not include one major theme – more gun control.

“The District should establish a clear citywide strategy that focuses intentional, structured, and intensive intervention efforts on those individuals identified as being at very high risk of being involved in gun violence,” it said.

Washingtonians wouldn’t be blamed if they assumed “intensive intervention efforts” involved more police to keep neighborhoods safe where known suspects would be most likely found. They could blame their Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser, and the city council for exacerbating the crime problem in the first place. After all, they caved to calls of “defund the police” protests and cut millions from the Metropolitan Police Department budget. A fact check from local Washington, D.C., media put it plainly, ruling “Yes, MPD’s budget has been cut by millions in 2020.”

Ensuring Safety

Washington, D.C. is home to some of the nation’s strictest gun control laws. In fact, for years there was only one location where a firearm could be transferred. Because that licensee was not a commercial firearm retailer that doesn’t actually sell guns, it only processed firearm transfers from outside jurisdictions. This forced Washingtonians to pay an additional $125 firearm transfer fee. That retailer closed, but two more opened, however they also do not sell firearms and only perform transfers.

That’s not stopping Washingtonians from exercising their Second Amendment rights and purchasing a firearm to protect themselves, their families and their property, however. According to the FBI National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), District residents have run NICS verifications for a firearm in record numbers in recent years.

In 2021, that total was 5,410. In 2020, it was 3,726. Compare those figures with 2019’s 1,550 and 2018’s 1,108 checks and 2017’s 811 checks. It becomes very clear how much Washington residents value their personal safety and protection from criminals allowed to be released easily, often committing more violence. Just two months ago, the families of murder victims in D.C., protested as the D.C. Council advanced a plan to allow early release for inmates who committed violent crimes before age 25. This age group is right in the wheelhouse of the key focus age of violent criminals examined in the NICJR report for committing murder.

After years of growing crime worsened by the city’s own actions making it easier for criminals to get off easy for their crimes, the NICJR study should make it clear to Washington, D.C. officials – and office holders across the country. Focus on the criminals and hold them to account for their crimes.

New Poll Is Bad News For A Left-Wing DA Facing Recall,"A new poll showed San Francisco voters overwhelmingly back the recall of District Attorney Chesa Boudin.

Roughly 68% of likely primary voters said they would vote to recall Boudin, including 64% of registered Democrats, according to a poll conducted by EMC Research. Nearly three out of four voters had an unfavorable opinion of Boudin, and 61% agreed he was “responsible for rising crime rates in San Francisco, especially burglaries and thefts.”

Boudin has attracted backlash and criticism for his perceived leniency toward criminals, vowing not to prosecute cases involving “quality-of-life crimes,” such as “public camping, offering or soliciting sex, public urination [or] blocking a sidewalk,” according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

“We have a long way to go to decriminalize poverty and homelessness,” Boudin said.

These numbers are very promising, but we still have 82 days to go before Election Day on June 7th. Now is the time to support our effort to #RecallChesa. https://t.co/Ozl51akUdl pic.twitter.com/SAkV36iBDv — Safer SF Without Boudin (@safersfnoboudin) March 16, 2022

Crime has skyrocketed in San Francisco since Boudin took office in early 2020, with burglaries rising to over 7,000 in 2021 and motor vehicle thefts reaching about 6,000, according to data published by the San Francisco Police Department.

Rampant organized retail theft forced Walgreens to close numerous stores throughout the city in 2021. Democratic Mayor London Breed said the city needed to crack down on “all the bullshit that has destroyed our city” and use law enforcement more aggressively in December 2021. (RELATED: San Francisco DA Says His Father, Convicted Murderer And Former Member Of Terrorist Group, Should Get Out Of Prison)

The poll found that 73% of San Francisco voters disagreed that Boudin was “keeping San Francisco safe,” and 69% disagreed with the statement that Boudin “does what is best for the community.”

The poll was conducted from Feb. 17-21 by EMC Research, and it sampled 800 likely primary voters, with a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points.

Boudin’s office declined to comment on the new poll but referred the Daily Caller News Foundation to an anti-recall campaign, which did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

"As Crime Rises In NYC, Eric Adams Struggles To Defend His Agenda","New York City Mayor Eric Adams attempted to defend his handling of rising crime amid a surge of shootings and violence while on “Face the Nation” Sunday.

“We have to stop the flow of guns, but we also must do the jobs of getting the guns off the streets that’s on there now, and my anti-gun unit, they’re doing that,” Adams said.

In February, the city endured a 58.7% rise in overall crime compared to the same period in 2021.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams defended his approach to combating skyrocketing crime on Sunday, as shootings and violence reach record highs.

Adams, who was elected on the promise of decreasing violent crime, touted the NYPD’s new anti-crime unit, alleging it had made tremendous progress in removing guns from city streets while on “Face the Nation” on Sunday.

“We have to stop the flow of guns, but we also must do the jobs of getting the guns off the streets that’s on there now, and my anti-gun unit, they’re doing that,” Adams said. “Just a few weeks out, they removed over 20-something guns off the street. But here’s the interesting number — 70% of those who were carrying the guns had prior violent offenses.”

New York City experienced a 58.7% rise in overall crime in February compared to the same period in 2021, according to NYPD statistics. The city also reported a 40% surge in homicides over the previous two years and the highest number of shootings in a decade, according to “Face the Nation.”

A 12-year-old boy was killed in Brooklyn on Thursday night after his family got caught in the crossfire between two cars, which Adams called “horrific,” CBS News reported. Two New York City police officers, Wilbert Mora and Jason Rivera, were killed after responding to a domestic violence call in Harlem on Jan. 21.

When pressed on why the city’s restrictive gun laws were not stopping the surge, Adams told “Face the Nation” that a small number of gun dealers “skating the law” was one reason, while ghost guns and the kits that assemble them were another.

Adams said the federal government needed to raise funding for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in order to better track the flow of guns into American cities, which he relayed to President Joe Biden on Saturday, Politico reported. (RELATED: ‘Go After The Guns’: Eric Adams Reacts To NYC Shooting That Left 10 Injured)

“Executive orders are crucial,” Adams said. “But while we’re waiting for the president and the White House to continue to do the good things they are doing, I have to do the things we must do on the ground in New York City, and that’s what we’re doing.”

Democrats have criticized Adams for rolling back criminal justice reform in order to combat violent crime. Latrice Walker, an Assembly Democrat from Brooklyn and one of the authors of recent changes to the state’s bail laws, challenged Adams when he appeared before the State Legislature in February and said changes needed to be made to bail laws, The New York Times reported.

“We are seeing crime on the rise all across the country, even in states where bail reform is not a thing,” she said.

Republicans, on the other hand, have gone after Adams for being too soft on crime, with Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York calling on the mayor to be concerned about more than just guns.

“Somebody was stabbed to death in my district over the weekend, and you have all categories of crime, from rape, robbery, assault, and grand theft auto — all increasing,” she said while appearing on Fox Business in February. “And so we need to address all these crime issues and give police the tools they need to do their job.”

Six people were stabbed or slashed in New York City subways over the course of three days in February. Adams had announced a plan for subway safety prior to the attacks, acknowledging the city’s problem of mentally ill homeless people violently attacking subway passengers.

Chicago Crime Spike Forces Rich People To Hire Private Police,"Several neighborhoods in the affluent North Side community of Chicago have hired private police amid an increase in carjackings and other crimes, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.

Crime rates have spiked in several neighborhoods on the North Side, including Lincoln Park, Bucktown and Lakeview, prompting citizens to call upon P4, a private security firm, for protection, according to The Wall Street Journal (WSJ).

Private police officers riding in security vehicles would not make any arrests. Instead, these armed officers, equipped with communication devices and cameras, would call 911 in the case of an emergency, according to WSJ.

The Chicago Police Department has reported 30% more crimes in Bucktown for the first quarter of 2022 compared to this period in the previous year based on data gathered from P4, according to WSJ.

The new measures were met with positive and negative reactions, as some citizens, including restaurant owner Jim Higgins, welcomed the extra protection, WSJ reported. Others are concerned about how the private police force will be held accountable, and that their communities are not gated and should not be treated as such, according to CBS 2 Chicago.

"WEEKEND OF CARNAGE: Liberal Cities See Massive Spike In Murder, Violent Crime Over Holiday Weekend","Violent crime surged across liberal cities during Memorial Day weekend, leaving more than 30 people dead and approximately one hundred injured, according to multiple police departments.

Major cities including Philadelphia, Chicago and New York saw dozens of fatal shootings over the holiday weekend, multiple police departments told The Daily Caller News Foundation, with victims including women and children.

In Philadelphia, fifteen people were killed during the weekend violence, police told TheDCNF.

A 9-year-old boy and his father as they came home from a cookout were among those killed in Philadelphia, CBS-3 reported. Gerald Parks and his son Jamal were sprayed with bullets and killed in their car.

In another incident, three masked men opened fire on a group of people, killing a 56-year-old man, according to NBC Philadelphia. A 33-year-old woman was shot seven times but survived.

Soft-On-Crime LA Mayoral Candidate Making Massive Gains Among White Liberals: POLL,"Democratic California Rep. Karen Bass is gaining ground in the Los Angeles mayoral race among those who are less affected by violent crime: white liberals.

Support for Bass declined from April to May among black and Asian voters and remained stagnant among Latinos, but support among white liberals surged, according to a UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll shared by the Los Angeles Times. Rising violent crime since 2020 has disproportionally impacted black and Hispanic people, and the spike in murders from 2020 to 2021 was heavily concentrated in black and Hispanic neighborhoods, according to The Marshall Project.

Bass’ campaign has focused on social justice rather than crime, and Bass does not believe police are the answer the city’s crime problem, according to her campaign website. She said community organizations and trained experts, not police, should be given resources to deal with the root causes of crime.

Today I announced a plan to combat crime with deep, structural investments for communities across L.A. We have to prevent the conditions that lead to crime and rehabilitate people who have made mistakes. We can have safety and justice at the same time. https://t.co/0MbllPUPgV — Karen Bass (@KarenBassLA) April 6, 2022

Bass saw a 15 to 19 point increase in support among Democrats, white voters and women along with a 33 point increase from white liberals from April to May, according to the poll. Support fell 26 points among black voters and 2 points among Asian voters during the same timeframe, and Latino support remained the same.

CNN Analyst Has A Dire Warning For Soft-On-Crime Democrats In California,"A CNN analyst warned Democrats Tuesday that “voters are demanding” that politicians address “higher crime” and “public disorder” in two key liberal California cities.

“We got here by higher crime and in many ways, public disorder, even more than changes in the crime rate, public disorder as exemplified by homeless encampments that have taken root around the city in Los Angeles,” Ron Brownstein told “CNN Newsroom” hosts Alisyn Camerota and Victor Blackwell.

Blackwell asked how the city could go from cutting the police department’s budget to seeing a mayoral candidate promise to add hundreds more officers.

Brownstein noted a “similar dynamic” in a recall election in San Francisco. (RELATED: ‘Out Of Control’: California DA Blasts George Gascon, ‘Woke’ Prosecutors Amid Crime Surge)

WATCH:

“In Los Angeles and San Francisco, two of the nation’s most liberal large cities, voters are poised to send stinging messages of discontent over mounting public disorder, as measured in both upticks in certain kinds of crime and pervasive homelessness,” Brownstein wrote in an article published Tuesday on the network’s website, discussing the Los Angeles mayoral race and a recall vote against San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin. He noted “a widespread sense” that local authorities in the two cities were failing when it came to providing “public safety and order.”

“If you are in a position where you have impact on public safety, public safety is part of the job,” Brownstein said on “CNN Newsroom.”

Rick Caruso, a former Republican, made addressing high crime and homelessness part of his mayoral campaign in Los Angeles. Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsed Caruso’s candidacy Friday, saying the city was “fortunate” to have him as a mayoral candidate.

Boudin faces a recall vote Tuesday over rising crime rates in San Francisco. The left-wing district attorney’s office reportedly failed to garner any convictions for fentanyl dealing in 2021.

A spokeswoman for Warner Brothers Discovery, the parent company of CNN, referred The Daily Caller News Foundation to Brownstein’s analysis posted on the company’s website.

Nearly 40% Of Law Enforcement Agencies Failed To Report 2021 Crime Data To FBI,"Nearly 40% of U.S. law enforcement agencies did not report any 2021 crime data to the FBI’s crime statistics collection program, The Marshall Project reported.

According to The Marshall Project’s analysis of the agency participation data, the gap included data from New York and Los Angeles — the two most populous cities in the U.S. — as well as the majority of agencies in the six most populous states, including New York, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois and California.

The federal government spent hundreds of millions of dollars helping local police departments switch to the new service, but so far, about 7,000 out of the nation’s 18,000 law enforcement agencies did not successfully send the crime data to the FBI last year. In San Diego alone, the federal government gave over $2.6 million to help the county’s sheriff’s office make the switch.

Reporting from several Axios Local outlets showed the disparity between how different cities and states have adjusted to the FBI’s reporting system change. Most of the Charlotte, North Carolina, area’s law enforcement agencies reported full crime data to the FBI, according to Axios Charlotte. Pennsylvania law enforcement agencies had some of the lowest crime reporting rates, including the city of Philadelphia which experienced a historic high in homicides in 2021, according to Axios Philadelphia.

“The biggest complaint over the last several years has been the amount of time it takes to complete two incident reports when most people feel as if it should be one incident,” Union County Sheriff’s Office crime analyst L. Kiker said, according to Axios Charlotte. (RELATED: ‘Where Is The FBI?’: Republican Rep Whose Home Was Vandalized Unloads On Democrats Over Delay Of Supreme Court Security Bill)

This is due to the new system’s ability to record more than only the most serious offense of a crime. For example, if a robbery and a shooting happened together, agencies would only count the shooting, according to The Marshall Project.

Jacob Kaplan, a criminologist at Princeton University, told The Marshall Project, “I don’t think you could get national numbers, at least not useful national numbers, from this data.”

“It’s going to be really hard for policymakers to look at what crime looks like in their own community and compare it to similar communities,” he added, according to the outlet.

although true that some large states didn’t participate in the FBI’s crime data collection in 2020, the idea this story proposes that therefore we can’t make *any* blanket statements about crime is just preposterous. https://t.co/NcioKoOb09 — Joe Gabriel Simonson (@SaysSimonson) June 14, 2022

An FBI spokesperson said in a statement they have “identified a way forward to account for missing large agencies,” according to The Marshall Project.

People are used to working with “5% or 10% of missing data” but making estimated when 35% of the data is missing is “not malpractice necessarily, but you don’t want to do that” James Lynch, criminology professor at the University of Maryland, said, according to The Marshall Project.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/06/14/fbi-law-enforcement-crime-data/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjN4rT0gLT9AhW9EFkFHQDDAc04ChAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw2Ms93oNIpCE7rBIJYpiEWK,2022-06-14
Federal Hate Crime Charges Filed Against Buffalo Shooter,"Federal prosecutors have filed hate crime charges against the suspected Buffalo supermarket shooter, according to a criminal complaint submitted Wednesday.

Payton Gendron, 18, allegedly shot 13 people May 14 at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York. Ten people, all of whom were black, were killed.

Gendron harbored racial motivations for his attack, according to the criminal complaint.

Gendron was charged with 10 counts of hate crimes resulting in death, three counts of hate crimes involving bodily injury and attempt to kill, 10 counts of use and discharge of a firearm to commit murder, and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.

“Gendron’s motive for the mass shooting was to prevent Black people from replacing white people and eliminating the white race, and to inspire others to commit similar attacks,” the complaint said. (RELATED: Buffalo Shooter’s Personal Diary Is Pretty Clear About His Sources Of Inspiration)

“In the months preceding the attack, Gendron wrote a self-described manifesto containing a detailed plan to shoot and kill Black people at the Tops at 1275 Jefferson Avenue3 using a Bushmaster XM-15 rifle,” prosecutors in the US Attorney’s Office for the Western District of New York wrote.

Included in the manifesto were diagrams of the supermarket where he carried out his attack, discussion of what helmet and body camera he would use during the attack, and explanations of the racial motivations to his crime, according to the complaint.

In the manifesto, Gendron stated that the purpose of the attack was to, “Kill as many blacks as possible.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/06/15/federal-hate-crimes-charges-filed-buffalo-shooter/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjRj536gLT9AhWUGVkFHQTtCME4ZBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw2ccR_1bI9JNsA4s9T27c7p,2022-06-15
‘Laughable’: Crime Expert Refutes Media’s Misconceptions On FBI Crime Data,"The FBI’s crime data for 2021 is missing figures from roughly 40% of state and local law enforcement agencies across the country, leading many to incorrectly speculate that it’s difficult to draw conclusions about nationwide crime trends, according to a crime expert.

The gap created by more than 7,000 law enforcement agencies failing to report crime data to the FBI includes the U.S.’s two most populated cities, New York City and Los Angeles, as well as most law-enforcement agencies from California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Pennsylvania, according to The Marshall Project, who authored a report on the missing data released Tuesday.

Multiple media organizations and commentators, as well as the report’s authors, have claimed the gaps in the data make it challenging to deduce nationwide crime trends.

“The short answer is we may never get definitive evidence on whether the crime rate has risen or declined, because the 2021 national crime data will miss almost 40% of law enforcement agencies,” Weihua Li, the original author of the report for The Marshall Project, told The Daily Caller News Foundation .

Charles Lehman, a crime data expert in policing and public safety at the Manhattan Institute, told TheDCNF that crime trends across the country can still be observed. (RELATED: Chicago Crime Spike Forces Rich People To Hire Private Police)

“We know in national data that murder, shootings, and car theft all rose in 2020, largely following the George Floyd protests,” Lehman said. “We know from city-level data that the homicide trend continued, meaning the shooting trend likely did as well because the only difference between a shooting and a homicide is the aim. We know that many individual cities are struggling with more petty crimes and disorder.”

Lehman said the data failure will shake the public’s understanding of nationwide crime and is bound to be abused by some for political purposes.

“I have no doubt that there will be many in the ‘criminal justice reform’ movement who will argue that claims of rising crime are baseless, given the problems with the FBI’s data—eliding what we know from city-level or state-level data—and then imply that this means violent crime isn’t really going up at all,” Lehman said.

However, Lehman said it was “laughable to suggest” that most Americans won’t recognize a crime problem in their background since most Americans live in an urban environment where crime is a problem in general.

Axios, The Crime Report and The Marshall Project did not definitively write in their reports that the national crime rate has risen. Instead, the organizations focused their metrics on voter interest in the crime rate.

Legacy media outlets like CNN, The Washington Post, the New York Times and Associated Press have neglected to report on the law enforcement agencies’ failure to report crime data.

The FBI and The Crime Report did not immediately respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Axios declined to comment for TheDCNF.

"Congress Has Not Done Enough To Address Gang-Related Violence, NY Crime Commission Says","Congressional focus is directed too much toward mass shootings and has not done enough about gang-related “routine shootings,” a top official at Citizens Crime Commission of New York City told the Daily Caller.

Members of Congress have previously proposed gun control measures after mass shootings, such as banning “assault weapons” and enacting red flag laws after mass shootings in Pittsburgh in 2018 and Dayton, Ohio, in 2019. Meanwhile, at least 58 minors were killed in gang-related violence in 2020, according to data provided to the Daily Caller by the FBI. However, elected officials do not address these events the same, according to Katelyn Greco, Program Analyst at the Citizens Crime Commission.

“I don’t think Congress has done enough. … When mass shootings occur, of course they’re heartbreaking, but I think about the 16- and 17-year-old kids that I work with that experience more routine gun fire, where they lose their best friends every day,” Greco told the Daily Caller.

“And the [minors] watch the news, and they see all of this about the victims of mass shootings, which of course our hearts go out to them, but you don’t have that same concern for them or their friends or their best friends who they have lost,” she added.

Greco said Congress focuses their efforts on mass shootings that are all over the news, but should also pay attention to gang-related shootings that impact minors across the U.S.

There were 5,338 juvenile gang killings 2010-2020 — over 530 per year — according to the FBI. (RELATED: Police Departments In Multiple Major Cities Won’t Say If Gang Violence Is Increasing)

“Congress often focuses their energy on those mass shootings and tries to, you know, put their resources and create policies to address the mass shooting,” Greco said. “But they miss those routine shootings that happen daily in neighborhoods across the United States. There is not as much focus on those routine shootings because they do look different.”

Community gun violence can’t be handled the same way as a mass shooting, Greco noted.

“It’s different drivers, they occur more frequently and it deserves more attention because of the daily occurrence of it,” she said. (RELATED: Mass Shootings And Cases Of Gun Violence Are Skyrocketing In Part Because Of Gangs)

In response to the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, the House passed a bill that would raise the legal age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21 and ban magazines with a capacity greater than 15.

Greco said she believes there needs to be more response from elected officials at all levels when children fall victim to gang violence.

“After mass shootings occur, you see the politicians going out into those communities that experience those mass shootings and trying to gain a sense of what’s happening and what’s going on. And I’m not saying it doesn’t happen on the gang related side. It does … but that’s how you create change: by going out into communities that are experiencing gang violence, routine gunfire, and seeing what’s happening, what’s driving it, and then using your power as an elected official to then create policy shifts or policy changes that actually address those needs,” she said.

Recent victims of gang-related shootings have included children of all ages.

Draya Michelle Guillory, age 6, was killed in a drive-by shooting at her home in Lake Charles, Louisiana, on March 20, according to KPLC News.

Lamar Norman III, a 13-year-old boy, was shot multiple times and killed by an adult man outside an apartment complex on Dec. 27 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, according to Tulsa World.

Eight-year-old Arbrie Leigh Anthony was killed in a drive-by shooting when known gang members gunned her down in the front yard of her home in Augusta, Georgia, in Janunary, WJBF News reported.

Arbrie Anthony’s father, Arthur Anthony, told the Daily Caller he is not satisfied with the response government officials have had to gang violence.

“I think they should be doing more. We do actually have a problem here,” Anthony said. “The police force is kind of short staffed. … There’s just too much crime.” Anthony noted that the Augusta Police Department had put out flyers for recruitment.

“I think after my daughter’s death they’re trying their best,” he added.

Anthony said he “definitely” thinks national leaders need to step up the pressure on local district attorneys to uphold the law. Officials need to be “stricter in the streets” when it comes to preventing crime, he added.

“At 17, [kids] get caught with a gun, they get a slap on the wrist; 18, slap on the wrist. And then finally you end up doing something tragic that could have been prevented when you first got caught,” he said.

Anthony urged members of high-crime communities to speak up to prevent gang violence.

“Report crime,” he said. “You see crime and no one wants to be a ‘snitch’ … but if you see crime that’s going on in your area, don’t be afraid to call. … I know it may not have [anything] to do with you directly, but don’t be afraid to report activity that you see [that is] suspicious or things like that, because it can affect someone else.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/06/17/ny-crime-commission-congress-not-done-enough-address-solve-gang-related-violence/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjotMr5gLT9AhVOEVkFHeLMD-44WhAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw00EW0ifIdoz7zpAQz5uJKs,2022-06-17
Major Hedge Fund Citadel Is Fleeing Crime-Ridden Chicago,"Billionaire Ken Griffin told his employees Thursday that he is moving his hedge-fund firm Citadel out of Chicago and down to Miami.

Griffin announced the move to employees in a letter viewed by the Daily Caller, noting that he had personally moved to Florida, and now Citadel Securities would be heading south too. Though crime was not cited as a core factor in the letter, company officials said that it was part of the consideration given Griffin’s long-running feud with Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker over crime and other issues, according to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).

“Over the past year, many of our Chicago teams have asked to relocate to Miami, New York, and our other offices around the world,” Griffin wrote in the letter. (RELATED: STUDY: Burglaries Drop In Areas With High Gun Permits)

Griffin is the wealthiest resident in Illinois with an estimated personal worth of $28.9 billion, so his departure may have a significant impact on state tax collections both from the personal and corporate side, the WSJ noted. He’s given more than $600 million in his philanthropic endeavors to educational, cultural, civic and medical organizations, the outlet continued.

Citadel manages $51 billion in assets and has over 1,000 employees in Chicago, the outlet continued. Many are expected to remain, WSJ continued, so the organization said they “will provide comprehensive support to meet the needs of our teams,” according to the letter.

The organization is one of many to flee the greater Chicago area in the last year, according to WSJ. Caterpillar Inc. announced in mid-June that it is moving its headquarters from Deerfield near Chicago, to Irving, Texas.

Census data showed that Chicago has lost so many residents over the last year that the population is nearing 2010 levels.

Starbucks Is Closing 16 Stores Amid Crime And Drug Use Concerns,"Starbucks announced Monday that it is closing at least 16 stores across America due to reports of drug use and other safety concerns.

The company will close six stores each in Seattle and Los Angeles, and two more in the Portland area, according to the Wall Street Journal. One store in Washington, D.C. and another in Philadelphia will also close by the end of July, the outlet continued.

Starbucks reportedly received complaints about drug use by customers in some of their locations, WSJ continued.

“We read every incident report you file—it’s a lot,” Starbucks operations leaders Debbie Stroud and Denise Nelson said in a note to employees.

"Democrat-Run Cities Have More Homicides Per Capita, Data Shows","Homicide rates in America’s 50 most populated cities have risen 18% between 2020 and 2022, according to data released Tuesday.

WalletHub compared per capita homicide data from 50 of the largest U.S. cities from the second quarter of 2022 with the same time in 2021 and 2020 to determine the average.

New Orleans, Baltimore, Louisville, Milwaukee and Washington, D.C., topped the list of the highest increase in homicide rates during the time period. Predominantly Democrat-run cities have had the highest rise in homicide rates when compared to Republican-led cities, WalletHub noted.

Tucson, Omaha, Lincoln, Madison, Wisconsin, and Garland, Texas, had the lowest rates of increase, according to WalletHub.

Nearly 50 People Shot In Chicago Over Weekend Amid Skyrocketing Crime,"Almost 50 people were shot in Chicago over the weekend, according to the Chicago Sun-Times, as the city deals with rising crime and elevated homicides.

Two adults and three teenagers died in the shootings, the Chicago Sun-Times reported, citing the Chicago Police Department. However, it was not even Chicago’s most violent weekend this month; shootings struck 65 victims and killed five between the evening of July 22 and the morning of July 24, according to the New York Post.

Memorial Day weekend in 2022 saw Chicago shootings wound 51 people, taking nine lives, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. A spokesperson for Democratic Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the city “safely returned to a series of fantastic events that define summertime in our city,” but there were fewer shooting victims that weekend in each of the previous four years, according to the outlet.

Chicago had already seen 1,518 shooting incidents this year by July 24, a 19% decrease compared to the same date in 2021, according to police data. Theft has increased by 66%, with burglaries and motor vehicle theft rising by 33% and 47% respectively. (RELATED: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot Issues ‘Call To Arms’ Against The Supreme Court)

A 25-year-record 797 people were shot and killed in Chicago last year based on law enforcement numbers, NBC 5 Chicago reported. This total outpaced every other city nationwide, the outlet reported.

Some American cities have recently seen higher per capita murder rates than Chicago. In 2019, Chicago ranked 30th in this category among 65 cities with populations above 100,000, according to CBS News’ analysis of FBI and local police data. St. Louis was first on the list, with a murder rate of 64.54 in 100,000 people.

Lightfoot’s press office and the Chicago Police Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

"As Crime Surges, Mayor Adams And NYPD Say Repeat Offenders Are To Blame","Democratic New York City Mayor Eric Adams and law enforcement said Wednesday that repeat offenders are fueling the city’s historic rise in crime.

Adams wants to change the law in NYC so judges have discretion to consider the level of danger a defendant poses to public safety when setting bail, according to CNN. At present, judges across the other U.S. states may consider the potential risk a defendant poses to the greater public when setting their bail, the outlet noted.

NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell agreed with Adams, furthering that judges should be able to remand defendants at arraignments “based on the severity of their alleged crimes or their history of recidivism,” the outlet continued.

Today we made three major announcements for the upstream justice we deserve. FIRST: Every person under 21 years old on probation will be connected with a credible messenger mentor to help guide them on the right path. Data shows this initiative is key to combating recidivism. pic.twitter.com/34UjCe9kcE — Mayor Eric Adams (@NYCMayor) February 28, 2022

The call for change comes as data showed that the number of people arrested three or more times for repeat offending in cases of robbery, burglary and grand larceny increased significantly since the start of 2022, CNN noted.

“As a result of this insane broken system, our recidivism rates have skyrocketed and those who say the predicted wave of recidivism wouldn’t happen, and the studies that claim to show the rate of arrest for violent felonies has not changed since the reforms were passed,” Adams said during a press conference on Wednesday, according to CNN. “I have one word for you — wrong. You are wrong.”

At least 211 defendants were arrested three or more times for burglary through June of 2022, a 142.5% increase compared to 87 people total between January and June of 2017, CNN continued. NYC is also one of six major U.S. cities reporting historic increases in violent crime since June 2021. The city experienced nearly a 26% increase in violent crime by June 2022 when compared to the same time in 2021.

Despite the overwhelming data supporting Adams’ and the NYPD’s stance, the Legal Aid Society accused his administration of picking out “a handful of cases to misguide New Yorkers and convince them that bail reform is responsible for all of society’s ills,” CNN continued. Those cases include one man who was arrested 101 times, 88 of which arrests occurred since 2020, the outlet noted. (RELATED: MMA Fighter Pins Alleged Serial Puncher In Epic Street Brawl)

New York State passed bail reform in 2019 making release from jail before trial a given for most offenders accused of misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies, the Vera Institute of Justice reported. Within three months of it going into effect, the law was amended to give judges more discretion with cash bail and pretrial release, the Brennan Center noted.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/08/04/eric-adams-nypd-nyc-crime-repeat-offenders-recidivism/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwit9qT2gLT9AhUmF1kFHbsUAXg4KBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw0HTO-lBTQy97pvsb_kmZRB,2022-08-04
Ahmaud Arbery Killers Receive Second Life Sentence For Hate Crime,"A white man and his father both serving life in prison for 25-year-old black man Ahmaud Arbery’s February 2020 murder have been given federal life sentences for the hate crime of interfering with his rights, while their former neighbor already imprisoned for life received 35 years, according to CNN.

Travis McMichael was also sentenced on Monday to 20 years and 10 years for the federal crimes of attempted kidnapping and illegal weapons use, and his father Gregory McMichael respectively received 20- and 7-year sentences for those crimes, the outlet reported. William Bryan received 35 years imprisonment later the same day following federal hate crime and attempted kidnapping convictions, according to CBS News.

The McMichaels chased Arbery while armed in a pickup truck, with the younger McMichael shooting Arbery as Bryan filmed with his cellphone, according to NPR. U.S. District Court Judge Lisa Godbey Wood, who administered Monday’s sentences, said Travis McMichael’s trial had been “fair,” the outlet reported. (RELATED: Deputy Resigns After Calling Arbery A ‘Criminal’ Who ‘Got The Death Penalty’)

A state trial convicted McMichaels and Bryan of murdering Arbery in November 2021.

At the time, President Joe Biden called the murder “a devastating reminder of how far we have to go in the fight for racial justice in this country,” adding, “Nothing can bring Mr. Arbery back to his family and to his community, but the verdict ensures that those who committed this horrible crime will be punished.”

Travis McMichael’s attorney Amy Lee Copeland declined the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment, while Gregory McMichael’s attorney did not immediately respond.

This story has been updated with information about William Bryan’s sentencing.

"While Dems Blast Red States Over Crime, Blue Cities Are The Catalyst, Experts Say","Democratic politicians singling out Republican states for their crime issues fail to adequately address the pertinent and increasing issue in their own cities, according to experts.

Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently questioned why Democrats do not push back on Republican crime messaging when Republican states accounted for 8 of the 10 highest murder rates. Democratic Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner argued Wednesday there was no correlation between “being progressive or traditional” and the crime rate, saying the homicide rate in “MAGA states” is 40% higher than in “Biden states.”

Legal and criminal justice experts contended such arguments left out important context about where crime is happening within states and who governs those areas.

“Newsom’s figure is true enough, but is a pure statistical artifact,” Kentucky State University assistant professor Dr. Wilfred Reilly told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Historically, African Americans and indeed ‘redneck’ whites have had a high murder rate, so the highest MR states tend to be Southern places like Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, etc. In contrast, the lowest murder rates are found in North-Eastern purple states like Vermont and Maine.

“However, it’s just silly to pretend most murderers in the Deep South are Republicans,” he added. “Murder, there and pretty much everywhere else, is concentrated in larger cities with Democratic leaders.”

Gov. Newsom (D-CA) on Dems’ messaging problem: “8 of the top 10 states with the highest murder rates [in 2020] all are Republican states. How did Democrats not know that? … And we’re losing that message? … 67% higher gun death rate in Texas [than CA]. Why don’t we push back?” pic.twitter.com/Oj8DnWBXZI — The Recount (@therecount) September 28, 2022

Out of 50 U.S. cities with the highest number of violent crimes per 100,000 people in 2019, according to data listed by CBS News, only one of the top 10 — Stockton, California — has a Republican mayor.

Rising crime in major cities has disproportionately harmed black people, the DCNF reported. They were victims of increasingly disproportionate numbers of murders across several major cities during the first half of 2021, based on data the outlet highlighted.

Heritage Foundation legal fellow Zack Smith said that he thought points like those touted by Newsom and Krasner were being pushed to obscure policies of officials in left-wing cities leading to a massive violent crime increase. (RELATED: Desperate Blue City To Hire Civilians Amid Police Shortage, Violent Crime Spike)

“If you look at many of the states that are in this higher murder rate bracket, it’s because the crime is concentrated, by and large, in a few very large cities,” Smith told the DCNF. He mentioned Missouri, which had the eighth highest violent crime rate nationwide in 2018, according to FBI data organized by 24/7 Wall St.

“St. Louis is in Missouri, and St. Louis has one of the worst violent crime rates in the country right now, unfortunately. They also have been kind of ground zero in a lot of ways for the defund the police movement,” Smith argued. “This idea that the policies being implemented by those on the Left, the policies to defund the police, the policies to demoralize the police, the policies not to prosecute certain crimes, not to seek due sentencing penalties, not hold the individual without bail pending trial, the idea that those policies don’t have any consequences, that’s just nonsense.”

Manhattan Institute fellow Charles Lehman told the DCNF that crime is happening on a local level, rather than a state level. He found it “hard to imagine” an argument like the one Democrats have posed “being persuasive for anybody but somebody who already wanted to believe it.”

"Murder Rate Rose More Than 30% In Two Years, FBI Report Suggests","The number of murders nationwide rose by approximately 30% during 2020 and 2021, according to the FBI National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS).

The estimated aggregate national murder volume increased by 4.3% in 2021, adding to the 29.4% rise from 2019 to 2020, the FBI’s NIBRS trend analysis report said. The bureau cited a 1% decrease in violent crime in 2021 compared to the year prior, stating that the crime rates were “consistent,” according to a 2021 release.

“It should be noted that the violent crime figures for 2020 have had a significant increase over the respective value(s) reported in 2019,” the report said. (RELATED: Teen Shoplifters Allegedly Murder LA Store Owner Over A Wig)

Criminals appeared to increasingly attack seniors in 2021, the report suggests. The estimated volume of violent crimes against persons aged 65 and up rose 8.9% compared to the previous year.

Illegal drug-related violations seemingly surged as well. Every drug crime category saw an increase in offenses involving stimulant drugs per 100,000 people surging by 17.5% from 2020 to 2021, according to the report. Marijuana is the only drug category that decreased.

“The FBI UCR Program’s role is to collect, compile, and publish crime statistics for the nation,” the FBI’s national press office informed the Daily Caller News Foundation. “The FBI UCR Program does not analyze or comment on the statistics.”

Only 11,333 of the 18,806 law enforcement agencies eligible to report crime data to the FBI in 2021 had done so, calling the statistical reliability of comparing the 2021 and 2020 data into question, the report suggested. Along with New York City and Los Angeles, numerous states including New York, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois and California’s agencies failed to give the FBI’s crime statistics collection program any 2021 data, The Marshall Project reported in June.

Democrat New Mexico Governor Begs For More FBI Agents — Again — Amid Crime Wave,"Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham asked the Justice Department (DOJ) to back her petition for further FBI assistance to combat surging violent crime, she revealed Wednesday.

FBI Director Christopher Wray failed to give Grisham more resources when she reached out to him with similar pleas in June, according to a press release. She recently sent Attorney General Merrick Garland a letter that urged assigning more FBI agents to her state.

“Both New Mexico law enforcement agencies and the FBI are partners in addressing and preventing violent crime,” Grisham told Garland, according to the release. “It is therefore imperative to provide the tools and support to achieve our common goal of ending violent crime in New Mexico.”

New Mexico had the 13th-highest homicide mortality rate nationwide in 2020, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data said. Its largest city, Albuquerque, had an estimated violent crime rate of about 1,043.4 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants in 2019, based on statistics collected by the FBI. (RELATED: ‘The Mayor Just Laughs In Your Face’: Watters Calls Out Dem City Politicians’ Failure To Crackdown On Crime)

After the FBI sent more resources and agents to its Buffalo, New York office, homicides declined by 50%, she cited Wray as claiming.

“Once these resources are allocated to New Mexico, I am confident the FBI and state law enforcement officers will achieve similar success as the Buffalo office,” Grisham stated.

Grisham led her Republican November election opponent, former meteorologist Mark Ronchetti, by about 6.1% in FiveThirtyEight’s polling average Wednesday. In a televised debate Friday, Ronchetti said violent crime continued to rise after her administration came to power.

WATCH:

“What was the answer from this governor?” he argued. “It was to target police, and then make doing their jobs more difficult by removing qualified immunity.”

The FBI, broader DOJ and a representative for Grisham did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

"Zeldin Pledges To Declare Statewide Crime Emergency, Suspend Cashless Bail Laws","Republican New York gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin aims to declare a crime emergency for the state and suspend cashless bail laws upon taking office, he said Sunday.

“I’m going to suspend New York’s cashless bail laws and some other pro-criminal laws that have been passed, force the legislature to come to the table to negotiate an improvement, because we have to take back our streets,” Zeldin told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo. “We need law-abiding New Yorkers back in control of New York streets instead of criminals, and there are people in charge right now, from Kathy Hochul to the Democrats controlling the state legislature, who feel like they haven’t passed enough pro-criminal laws.”

Zeldin seeks to take as much action as possible in his first 100 minutes as governor, he declared. He pointed to his recent announcement that he would declare “a crime emergency.”

New York‘s state Legislature passed a law in April 2019 that banned setting bail for most misdemeanor and non-violent felony charges. Lawmakers have since restored bail possibilities for some offenses, Politico reported.

Police-reported murders and aggravated assaults in New York rose about 4.4% and 9.5% respectively between 2020 and 2021, according to data collected by the State Division of Criminal Justice Services.

Zeldin claimed he would start his term by removing Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg from office “for his refusal to enforce the law.” Bragg announced in January that his office would not pursue prison sentences for many offenses including resisting arrest. (RELATED: REPORT: NYC Subway Murders Hit 25-Year High)

Two people were shot on the afternoon of Oct. 9 outside Zeldin’s home in Long Island while his teenage daughters were inside. He said the next day that many families were “dealing with this reality of rising crime in New York.”

A man tried to stab Zeldin at a July campaign rally, where he spoke about bail reform.

Hochul’s campaign did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

POLL: Majority Blames Crime Spike On ‘Woke’ Politicians,"Sixty-four percent of Americans blame “woke politicians” for the country’s ongoing spike in crime, according to a Harvard-Harris poll released Friday.

Less than a third of the respondents to the poll felt that the country was on the right track, with a majority of Democrats (52%), Republicans (75%) and independents (60%) blaming the historic rise in crime on “woke politicians” rather than “other factors.”

Crime statistics concur with the sentiment uncovered by pollsters, with Democrat-run cities recording larger increases in homicide rates over the past two years than cities run by Republicans.

Cities like Denver, Colorado, are on track for a record-breaking numbers of murders in 2022, while six other major cities (all run by predominantly Democratic leaders) will likely surpass historic violent crime records for the second year in a row. Sixty-six percent of respondents to the poll said that crime is rising, with only 11% saying it’s on the decline.

Police and the military were found to be the most favorably viewed institutions (along with Amazon), suggesting that voters are focused on public safety ahead of November’s midterms. (RELATED: ‘Taking Their Marching Orders From George Soros’: Leo Terrell Accuses Democrats Of Being Bought)

"‘No Consequences:’ Residents Reveal How Portland Has Become Plagued By Crime, Filth And Fear","Residents of Portland, Oregon, blamed the city’s Democratic leadership for rampant crime and poor living conditions in a series of interviews with Daily Mail.

The residents described widespread open drug use, homeless encampments and fear of crime, and some said they would stop voting for Democrats, according to Daily Mail. The declining quality of life, which some residents blame on Democratic policies, may be pushing a rightward political shift in Oregon’s largest city.

Portland took a sharp downward turn in 2020 as the city shut down and its leaders lifted drug restrictions, according to James Posey, whom the Daily Mail describes as a black community leader. He doesn’t plan to vote for a Republican, but he also told the outlet he couldn’t vote for Democrats again in the upcoming election.

An emergency declaration is a powerful tool we need to help homeless Oregonians. We should’ve done this a long time ago, but my Democrat opponents have failed to come through for Oregon families.

“Why did we decide to do this? This has become a Mecca for people who want to live like this,” he told the outlet. ‘They want to bill themselves as progressive. They want to see themselves as out in front of all the racism … But at the end of the day, we’ve seen this whole state with a precipitous decline in the quality of life.”

Loretta Guzman, a 52-year-old Portland business owner had grown tired of crime and organized a “Coffee with a Cop” event so that locals could bring their concerns to police officers; her coffee shop was vandalized soon after she began advertising the event, according to the Daily Mail. A former supporter of then-presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, she no longer feels she belongs to any particular political camp due to her experience with crime.

“Some are scared. Some are mad or sad, some feel helpless,” she told the outlet. “Some feel like they have no voice. Nobody’s listening to them. They’re tired, they’re ready for change.”

‘There’s no consequences. Those who do go to jail, they get right back out,” she said. “They’re free to sit on the street and shoot right up up right. They’re free to stand there. Right there and smoke right in front of you.”

The November Oregon gubernatorial race is unusually tight, and the state may get its first Republican governor since 1982. Republican gubernatorial candidate and former member of the state House of Representatives Christine Drazan had a two point gain on former Democratic Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives Tina Kotek in a recent Emerson College poll; Drazan’s campaign has focused heavily on crime and homelessness.

The Portland city government did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

‘We Have A Great Record’: Doocy Asks Biden About The Crime Surge Ahead Of The Midterms,"Fox News White House Correspondent Peter Doocy asked President Joe Biden on the White House lawn Friday about the significance of the crime surge in U.S. cities ahead of the midterm elections.

“Mr. President, ahead of these midterms, how big of an issue is crime?” Doocy asked.

“I think it’s real important and I think we have a great record on it,” Biden told Doocy.

Crime has become an entrenched issue among likely midterm voters as major U.S. cities have seen an uptick in violent crime and burglaries in the past year. A Harvard CAPS-Harris poll found that 68% of voters consider crime to be a “very important” issue, while 26% consider it to be “somewhat important.” The poll surveyed 2,010 voters between October 12-13.

Republicans have largely centered their campaigns around the issue of crime by framing Democrats as being “soft-on-crime.” Biden has received low approval ratings on the issue of crime. A recent Monmouth University Polling Institute poll found that only 32% of those surveyed hold a favorable view of the president’s handling of the issue. The survey polled 806 adults eligible to vote and had a margin of error of 3.5%. (RELATED: Scarborough Tears Into Left-Wing DAs For Ignoring Crime Spike)

Democrats have narrowed their campaign messaging around abortion following the overturn of Roe v. Wade, though abortion has trailed inflation and crime in the category of key issues to voters.

Crime emerged as a key issue following a 3% rise in overall shootings and 7% surge in violent crime in Philadelphia, with a total of 433 total homicide victims as of Oct. 20, according to the Philadelphia Police Department. Other major cities, including Denver, Colorado, are also on track to have record-breaking crime statistics.

In New York City, the overall crime rate increased just over 15% in September 2022 from the same month the previous year, the New York Police Department reported. Public transportation crimes in the city rose by 57% this year alone, according to Fox 5.

"Now Mired In Crime, The City That Kicked Off The ‘Defund The Police’ Movement Is Struggling To Recruit New Officers","Minneapolis is having a tough time restaffing its police force amid a crime wave after officers left en masse following the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, according to The Associated Press.

Then-Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said the department lost almost 300 officers by October 2021 to causes including retirement, resignation and disability leave for claimed post-traumatic stress disorder following Floyd’s death and large-scale protests, according to Newsweek. The department has reportedly seen applicant numbers drop from 292 in 2019 to 57 this year, with its September graduating recruiting class only featuring six people, according to the AP.

“In Minneapolis, with what we’ve been through for the last couple years, for you to be here and have an interest in law enforcement … I’m impressed with every one of you that’s here,” training officer Matthew Hobbs told attendees at a March recruitment information session, the outlet reported. (RELATED: Police Find Body Of Missing Princeton Student: Report)

The recruitment problems accompany skyrocketing crime in Minneapolis. Murders and aggravated assaults increased by almost 100% and roughly 33% respectively between 2019 and 2021, according to the AP reported.

The Minnesota Supreme Court declared in June that Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey had failed to employ enough officers to satisfy a city law requirement, despite city lawyers saying it only mandated a certain funding level, the outlet reported. Frey proposed raising police funding in August towards reaching an over-800 officer staff by 2025.

“There’s still people who still value us,” Sgt. Vanessa Anderson said at a recruitment event, according to the AP. “The community still values us. I really do think that.”

Minneapolis has seen multiple efforts to defund the police since Floyd’s murder.

The Minneapolis City Council voted in December 2020 to reallocate millions in funding from the police department to violence prevention and community initiatives. However, it voted in February 2021 to avail $6.4 million in funding toward police recruitment, according to the Star Tribune.

Voters rejected a measure in November 2021 to abolish the Minneapolis Police Department and install a Department of Public Safety to fulfill “public safety functions through a comprehensive public health approach.” The proposal was supported by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, according to The New York Times.

The Minneapolis Police Department did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Liberal City Struggling With Rampant Crime Votes To Axe 80 Police Force Positions,"Seattle’s City Council approved their 2023-2024 budget Tuesday permanently removing 80 unfilled Seattle Police Department positions, according to The Seattle Times, despite crime continuing to ravage the city.

Mayor Bruce Harrell’s September budget proposal called for giving the city’s general fund funding that had been reserved for 200 unfilled police department roles, but the newly-approved budget eliminates 80 of those positions, the outlet reported. The passed budget funds Harrell’s police officer recruitment and retention plan and an expected 30-officer increase for 2023 and comes as the city has seen a dramatic crime increase.

The budget process exemplified our #OneSeattle value of collaboration. I am pleased that the final budget passed by Council maintains investments in improving public safety, urgent action on the housing and homelessness crises, and the essential services that residents demand. — Mayor Bruce Harrell (@MayorofSeattle) November 30, 2022

The police department’s budget fell by more than $35 for 2020 to 2021, with the city council later approving a 2022 budget more than $6 million lower, KOMO News reported. Seattle’s violent crime rate hit a 14-year record in 2021, according to the police department’s year-end crime report.

The city has already seen more homicides in 2022 than last year, police department statistics show. The first eight months of this year were plagued with more violent crimes and property crimes combined than the corresponding months of 2021, though September and October 2022 totals fell below the totals for those months last year.

“I believe that eliminating these positions does reinforce a ‘defund‘ narrative that got us here,” City Councilmember Sara Nelson said, according to the Times. She and fellow Councilmember Alex Pedersen voted against the new budget over “weakening” public safety spending.

The police department previously said they lost more than 200 officers in 2020 and early 2021, The Associated Press reported. Seattle saw violence break out amid protests following the May 2020 death of George Floyd, and activists temporarily occupied an area called the “Capitol Hill Organized Protest” (CHOP) that summer after police evacuated it.

The Seattle Police Department and the City Council did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s requests for comment.

Newly-Elected San Francisco DA Promises Crackdown On Rampant Crime And ‘Lawless’ Landscape,"Democratic San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins pledged in a Friday Bloomberg interview to punish the city’s criminals for their actions, admitting that the city had been plagued with lawlessness.

Jenkins vocally championed reform District Attorney Chesa Boudin’s expulsion from office earlier this year, replacing him on an interim basis and ultimately winning election in November. She told Bloomberg’s Karen Breslau in the interview that she thought San Francisco had reached a “lawless” level under Boudin’s watch, advocating for imposing consequences on those who commit crimes, in order to deter further criminality and protect the city’s economic engine.

WATCH:

“I certainly do think we reached that point where we all felt, as residents, as business owners, that it was lawless here,” Jenkins said. “I am doing everything, along with the San Francisco Police Department, amongst others, the Mayor’s Office, and everybody else, to correct that problem, and I do believe, for the past four months, we’ve been on a path to changing that, and to changing it quickly.” (RELATED:San Francisco Supervisors Vote To Approve Use Of Killer Robots)

San Francisco had a higher violent crime rate than New York City in 2020, according to statistics cited by the San Francisco Chronicle. Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in an early November MSNBC interview that New York City “will never be San Francisco” in the area of crime, and a June WalletHub survey ranked San Francisco the second “worst-run” of America’s 150 most populated cities.

“I’ve said, and I’ve made it very clear, all crime is illegal again in San Francisco,” Jenkins stated in the recent interview. “We can’t sit by and allow businesses to feel the need to move to other states because crime is too much of a problem, not only for their business bottom line, but also for their workers, who need to be able to come safely to work.”

Jenkins argued that the district attorney’s office before her had “effectively decriminalized drug sales in San Francisco, and quite frankly also drug use.” She said authorities must enforce city and county laws.

“We shouldn’t be see blocks with 30 people, right dealing fentanyl and act like that is normal,” Jenkins stated.

Jenkins’ office did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

"‘Grossly Inaccurate’: Experts Say FBI ‘Botched’ Hate-Crime Data, Underreported Anti-Jewish Incidents","The FBI released its 2021 crime report amid concerns from the Jewish community that the report underscores antisemitic attacks during that year.

Stop Antisemitism’s executive director Liora Rez called the FBI report “grossly inaccurate.”

“[The FBI] relied upon as the most authoritative source of hate crimes information in the United States, [and] for the justice department to provide this data, which they know to be incorrect, undermines the efforts of those who are concerned about anti-discrimination in this country,” Kenneth Marcus of the Louis D. Brandeis Center said.

After the FBI released its hate crime statistics for 2021, members of the Jewish community expressed concerns that antisemitic crimes were being heavily underreported due to a 22% decrease in reporting from law enforcement agencies across the country.

The FBI published the report on Monday with anti-Jewish crimes ranking the highest among religious hate crimes at 324 incidents reported, over three times higher than anti-Islamic hate crimes at 96 incidents reported. After the report was released, several prominent Jewish organizations criticized the FBI for what one called a “botched” report that did not accurately reflect the anti-Jewish sentiment that has been on the rise in the last several years, according to The Times of Israel.

Liora Rez, executive director of Stop Antisemitism, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the FBI report was “grossly inaccurate.” (RELATED: Perpetrators Of Antisemitic Hate Crimes In New York Routinely Receive No Prison Time)

“The 2021 FBI data on hate crimes is an incomplete report that paints a grossly inaccurate picture of the high level of antisemitism in America,” Rez stated. “When the U.S. cities with the three largest Jewish communities – New York City, Los Angeles, and Miami – are not included in the FBI’s report, then the true number of hate crimes targeting American Jews is underreported which greatly undermines the severity of the situation.”

Rez was referring to the fact that the FBI’s report included 22% fewer agencies than had reported the previous year, agencies from cities such as New York City and Miami with large Jewish populations, according to the Times. NYPD’s annual report on Hate Crime Complaints by Motivation alone showed 198 incidents in 2021, and Miami PD told DCNF that they had three anti-Jewish hate crimes in 2021.

“Without accurate reporting of the high level of dangerous hate crimes targeting American Jews, authorities lack the real-time data that is necessary for the implementation of effective response and solutions,” Rez concluded.

Kenneth Marcus, chairman and founder of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law and former assistant secretary for civil rights with the Department of Education under the Trump administration, voiced similar concerns. Marcus told the DCNF the discrepancy in the FBI’s reporting was “astonishing.”

“I have personally overseen federal civil rights data gathering, and I’ve seen errors in the data, that’s fairly common,” Marcus explained. “What’s not common are two things that we’re seeing here. First, the magnitude of the error is just astonishing. Second, even though the Biden administration is aware of the error they don’t appear to be correcting it.”

Charles Stimson, deputy director of Edwin Meese III Center and Heritage Foundation policy expert on crime, pointed out to the DCNF that the FBI’s system for reporting data had significantly changed for 2021 and that many departments simply didn’t want to use the new system. Stimson also noted that he didn’t believe this was a “plot or deliberate act” by the FBI to deliberately underreport the numbers.

“It has to do with the bureaucratic left hand not talking to the right hand and the fact that there’s no way to compel the 18,000 police departments across the country to disgorge this information to the FBI,” Stimson said.

The FBI explained in a press release that law enforcement participation “fell significantly from 2020 to 2021” as a result of the new National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). The announcement also noted that some of the “nation’s largest law enforcement agencies” had not submitted information regarding their hate crime statistics for 2021.

Miami PD made a similar statement to DCNF. “The Miami Police Department did not participate in the 2021 FBI National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), as was the case with many other major city law enforcement agencies which were not ready to transition from the FBI’s legacy Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Summary Reporting System (SRS). This affected not only our reporting of hate crimes, but our reporting of all crimes.”

Stimson pointed out that the new task forces combating antisemitism announced by the Biden administration and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Monday rang hollow in light of the FBI report. Stimson also blamed “political ass-covering” as partially responsible for the increase in anti-Jewish hate crimes in states like New York.

“I have no faith in this administration by [starting] up a task force. That’s just a political throwaway, to make the problem go away,” Stimson stated. “If they would simply enforce the law and throw the book at people who commit these hateful crimes, there’d be less of those crimes.”

Marcus also criticized the task forces for being politically motivated and said he “would have preferred a more serious approach.”

“Lots of different Jewish organizations urge the Biden administration to develop a task force on antisemitism, but what the Biden administration did is something different, they created a task force on antisemitism and Islamophobia,” Marcus pointed out. “That kind of combined task force makes sense only if the motivation was political.”

Marcus concluded that if the FBI data was not corrected shortly then Congress might be compelled to get involved. Without accurate statistics, Marcus argued, Jewish communities, and all victims of hate crimes, would be undermined.

“The FBI produces this data for a reason,” Marcus said. “It’s relied upon as the most authoritative source of hate crimes information in the United States, [and] for the justice department to provide this data, which they know to be incorrect, undermines the efforts of those who are concerned about anti-discrimination in this country.”

The DOJ, NYPD, LAPD and the White House did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

New York Governor Promises Crackdown On Crime After Violent 2022,"Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul vowed to improve public safety during her Sunday inauguration speech, following a year of high violent crime in the state.

Hochul said authorities must ensure that New Yorkers can be “free from fear” in streets, subways and schools, blaming the COVID-19 pandemic for causing damage to the social fabric that contributed to crime increases. Gun violence killed over 37% more people across 20 police jurisdictions statewide from January through November 2022 than the average for those months over the previous five years, despite a relative decrease compared to 2021, according to New York State Criminal Justice Services Division data.

Violent crime has particularly impacted New York City. Its year-to-date murder complaints through Dec. 25 decreased compared to 2021, while rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny and grand larceny auto complaints all went up, contributing to a more than 30% overall spike across those offenses, police data showed.

Hochul specifically mentioned the recent rise in hate crimes, pledging to combat “antisemitism, Asian hate, anti-LGBTQ hate and the systemic racism that still persists to this day.” New York City hate crimes occurred at a roughly 70% higher rate in November 2022 than during the same month in 2021, based on NYPD statistics. (RELATED: REPORT: 97% Of Anti-Jewish Hate Crimes In New York Were Committed By Other Minorities) Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg issued a memo in early January 2022 saying his office would treat armed robberies without a seriously injured victim or “genuine risk of physical harm” as misdemeanors and not pursue prison sentences for crimes other than murder, other violent felonies, sex offenses or major white collar crimes. Following the killing of a police officer whose widow decried Bragg’s soft-on-crime policies later that month, Hochul warned the district attorney in a private meeting that she could force him to make changes, the New York Post reported. Bragg said in a February memo that his office would prosecute anyone “who harms or attempts to harm a police officer” and charge commercial armed robberies as felonies. He claimed the January memo was supposed to provide a “framework” but had been “a source of confusion.”Hochul’s Republican November election opponent Lee Zeldin vowed to fire Bragg immediately upon taking office and declare a crime emergency. Zeldin ultimately lost by fewer votes than any Republican New York gubernatorial nominee in the previous four elections.

Hochul’s office did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

"Washington, D.C., Tried A New Policing Trick To Curb Violent Crime — And Quickly Got Results","Washington, D.C., authorities started a task force to reduce violence in multiple nightlife centers six months ago, ultimately seeing violent crime decrease in those areas, according to Axios.

In June, Mayor Muriel Bowser highlighted the debut of the Nightlife Task Force, led by the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety and Justice and Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), to address busy nightlife corridors on Friday and Saturday nights. The task force includes police, Department of Transportation, fire and emergency services personnel and alcohol regulators, who patrol nightlife areas around H Street NE, U Street NW, and Connecticut Avenue near Dupont Circle, Axios reported.

Violent crime decreased by 50% or more in each of those areas when the task force was on the streets compared to the same times in 2021, though overall crime rose in the H street area by 8%, according to the outlet’s analysis of MPD statistics. H Street’s Sticky Fingers vegan diner owner Doron Petersan, who was recently carjacked, said a more visible police presence could improve the area, as car robberies, vandalism and pickpocketing caused happy hour and evening service to decrease over the last year. (RELATED: Liberal Prosecutors Helped Fuel Crime Surges In Some American Cities, Experts Say)

U Street’s DC9 nightclub owner Bill Spieler said he noticed reduced gunfire and ATV activity outside the business, but said the task force’s street closures make customer access to businesses harder, Axios reported. MPD Assistant Police Chief Morgan Kane said street closures occur on a case-by-case basis, with patrol cars lit up to lower crime opportunities, and reported that leaders are thinking about using the policing model elsewhere in D.C.

Homicides and overall violent crime fell by roughly 10% and 7%, respectively, districtwide in 2022 compared to the previous year, with burglaries going down by about 10% and overall crime decreasing by about 4%, according to MPD statistics.

Suspect Allegedly Went On Crime Spree Wearing GPS Ankle Monitor,"Police searching for the culprits allegedly involved in a string of car burglaries in Florida were able to nab one suspect who was wearing a GPS ankle monitor during the heists, officials say.

Joshua Reed, 19, already out on bond for grand theft auto in Broward County with a pending case in Palm Beach County was brought before the Miami-Dade County Court on Thursday for his alleged connection to a car heist in that county all because he was wearing an ankle monitor, WPLG Local 10 News reported.

“We were able to track this guy who is responsible for 14 cases,” Sergeant Fernando Bosch of the South Miami Police Department told the outlet.

Reed is allegedly part of a group of criminals whose modus operandi is to break into homes in search of key fobs for luxury vehicles, WPLG reported.

Surveillance video from one of the homes dated Jan 7 shows a group of three men wearing dark-colored clothing attempting to break out the hurricane-proof windows of a newly built South Miami home. One of the individuals picks up a boulder and repeatedly throws it against the glass before using a 2×4 propped up against a tree in the yard to smash into the home all while the family were asleep inside.

In the end, the thieves got away with a Mercedes parked in the driveway, but police believe the crooks were after the Bentley in the garage, the outlet stated.

Reed has been charged with four counts of burglary of an occupied dwelling, four counts of burglary of an unoccupied structure, two counts of first-degree grand theft, two counts of second-degree grand theft, third-degree grand theft of a vehicle, armed grand theft of a vehicle, and criminal mischief, according to the outlet.

Police are still searching for the other two suspects.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/14/suspect-allegedly-went-on-crime-spree-wearing-gps-ankle-monitor/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjN4rT0gLT9AhW9EFkFHQDDAc04ChAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw3GeMXDGV-6dg6RGfMxQ-Ce,2023-01-14
"After Seattle Defunded Its Police, Local Business Owners Say Crime Is Worse Than Ever","Two years after Seattle slashed its police budget, local business owners say crime has skyrocketed, with police unable to deal with thefts, homelessness and open-air drug use that plague the city.

Seattle and broader King County had more than 13,000 homeless people within its boundaries in 2022, more than every other similar area except Los Angeles County and New York City, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, while the Seattle Police Department (SPD) lost more than 130 officers, KOMO News reported, as homicides, shootings and motor vehicle thefts increased. Local business owners say law enforcement is failing to effectively deter the rampant drug use and theft disturbing their livelihoods

Rohan Joseph, owner of Elliot Bay Community Fitness in Seattle’s Belltown neighborhood, has been posting videos on Twitter for months of people doing drugs, trying to sleep or otherwise causing disturbances outside his business.

“I’ll call 9-1-1 often,” Joseph told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Rarely do they come down anytime soon enough for it to matter.” (RELATED: New York Governor Promises Crackdown On Crime After Violent 2022)

Joseph said he called authorities when he found 11 people shooting up drugs outside his door. It took multiple waves of police officers to fully disperse the group, he reported.

“But it was like, they couldn’t do anything but be like, ‘Hey guys, can you please move on,'” Joseph recalled. “I don’t want them to be arrested per se, but by all means, take the drugs from them, make it harder for them to continue this activity. Right? Inhibit the ability to just open-air deal.”

Joseph told the DCNF he has been in business in the area for about nine years, with disruptive incidents surging in the past two years.

“I think that there needs to be more barriers in place that inhibit this type of behavior,” he said.

Joseph reported that an individual hit one neighboring business owner over the head with a hatchet, only to show up outside again days later.

Seattle’s City Council reduced SPD funding by almost 17% in its 2021 budget. The city’s 2023 budget permanently eliminates 30 unfilled SPD positions, but funds Mayor Bruce Harrell’s officer recruitment and retention plan, according to The Seattle Times.

206 Burger Company owner Suren Shrestha, whose business has three locations, complained of repeated break-ins and thefts. He said problems have worsened since the first two locations opened in 2017.

“These days people have no fear, they will just come in,” Shrestha said of disruptive individuals.

Shrestha reported five break-ins at 206 Burger Company’s Queen Anne neighborhood restaurant and five window-breaking incidents at their downtown location. He said a man threw the downtown restaurant’s cash register to the floor last year and dented its soda machine after trying to place an order.

“He grabbed a fire extinguisher that was on the wall and he threw it at my employees,” Shrestha told the DNCF.

Shrestha suggested a police car presence would deter many people from causing disturbances, saying he has become “an expert” at filing police reports after so many break-ins.

“Ten years ago, something happened, the police would come, take fingerprints and everything,” he noted. “Nothing right now.”

Shrestha called for city authorities to focus on crime and people camping on the street, claiming feelings of lacking safety are widespread.

“I support my police, I support my firefighters, I support a lot of local charities, but it’s almost getting impossible to survive these days with a small business,” he said.

Brian Meyers owns Tabletop Village, a Pokemon store and training gym in the Chinatown-International District. He told the DCNF that people often use drugs in front of the building.

The situation has generally worsened since COVID-19 emerged, despite temporarily improving at times, Meyers reported, referencing multiple shootings and drug overdose deaths in the neighborhood. He said someone broke a window at his store in the past year and stole $1,000 worth of merchandise.

Meyers told the DCNF that police are typically quite responsive to incidents but take their time if they learn the criminals have already left.

He recommended increased prevention efforts, better community resources and more places like his business where people can socialize and build a sense of community, rather than placing drug centers and homeless shelters in or near troubled areas.

“I believe that where it’s really going to start is if the city starts spending real money on these issues,” Meyers said. “You come to Chinatown and it’s still underdeveloped.”

Peter Morse, the owner of West Seattle’s Mission Cantina and new board member of the neighborhood’s chamber of commerce, said he and many neighbors struggle with transient people repeatedly stealing from them without sufficient law enforcement deterrence.

“You’re getting robbed, and you’re seeing these people in your neighborhood doing laundry next to you,” Morse told the DCNF, saying one man had stolen from his restaurant’s property multiple times, taking a pressure washer and a box of churros two weeks ago. Morse and an associate forced the man to return the pressure washer after one incident, but police subsequently suggested that the man had not really robbed the restaurant since he gave the property back, Morse reported.

“They will take anything that’s not nailed down,” he said.

In March 2020, King County Executive Dow Constantine ordered jails to stop accepting individuals charged with many nonviolent misdemeanors in response to COVID-19. A King County Sheriff’s deputy reportedly told KTTH in late summer 2022 that King County Jail would not book people for misdemeanor theft, saying, “They won’t accept it unless it’s felony level. So we can’t book any shoplifters when we catch them and we have to just let them go.”

Morse said he now keeps his establishment’s lights on constantly. An intoxicated man recently vandalized the inside of a nearby Pho’ restaurant before breaking bottles at a laundromat, with authorities only agreeing to take the man after he agreed to go to the hospital, according to Morse.

Washington state passed temporary legislation in 2021 deeming drug possession a misdemeanor and mandating police offer treatment or services instead of prosecution for an individuals’ first two offenses after the State Supreme Court overturned the state’s felony drug law, according to Axios.

Morse insisted he is not trying to come down on cops and would hate to be in their position. He said police are overworked, no longer feel the respect they used to and the profession has become incredibly dangerous.

“No one wants to be a police officer now,” Morse told the DCNF.

Morse suggested that violent transients victimizing local businesses should be arrested.

“They don’t take them away,” he lamented.

Morse originally moved to Seattle during the Grunge era, considering it the “craziest, coolest city ever” at the time.

“Everyone was always so proud of it, and now I don’t get that vibe anymore,” Morse explained, describing a now “out of control” homelessness problem. “I think people are a little embarrassed about Seattle.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/17/seattle-businesses-crime-drugs/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjf94b1gLT9AhWcF1kFHdVOAEQ4FBAWegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw0Ncv5BKDVJrrC4LiXud14Y,2023-01-17
D.C. Council Overrides Bowser’s Veto Of Crime Reform Bill,"The Washington, D.C., Council passed the Revised Criminal Code Act on Tuesday, a criminal reform bill that Democratic Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser previously vetoed.

The bill softens penalties for several offenses, including violent crimes involving a gun. It passed in the D.C. council 12-1, reversing Bower’s Jan. 4 decision to veto the reform, ABC7 reported. The council had previously voted to pass the bill unanimously in November, with Councilmember Trayon White switching his vote. The council only needed a two-thirds majority to override Bowser’s veto, according to the outlet. (RELATED: Teen Mom And Her Baby Among Six Fatally Shot In Home ‘Massacre’: Police)

Critics are concerned about the impact of the bill’s reduction of maximum sentences, elimination of nearly all mandatory minimum sentences, and expansion of the right to jury trials to those accused of misdemeanors, according to Fox5. The bill also softens the penalties for carjackings and burglaries, Fox News noted in an earlier report. It is the first comprehensive revision of D.C.’s legal codes since Congress created them in 1901.

“The Mayor is the only elected official listening to District residents on crime and violence. This law, once enacted, will lead to violent crime rates exploding even more than they already have,” the D.C. Police Union stated, Fox5 reported.

Council votes to override Mayor Bowser’s veto of a bill that would overhaul D.C.’s criminal code The bill would eliminate most mandatory minimum sentences and weaken penalties for burglaries, carjackings, and robberies, among other things. — Washington Free Beacon (@FreeBeacon) January 17, 2023

The council’s decision comes as crime in D.C. has seen a 23% uptick, according to data from the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police. In 2023, D.C. has already seen a 100% increase in murders and a 200% increase in sex abuse, though violent crimes are overall down by 9%.

“The Revised Criminal Code Act represents years of work by the Council, the Executive, the Attorney General, public safety and criminal justice experts and advocates, and other District stakeholders to modernize our criminal code … I am moving to override the Mayor’s veto of this legislation. Sustaining the veto would unravel years of careful and thoughtful work over disagreements with a small percentage of the bill,” D.C. Councilmember Brooke Pinto said in a Jan. 10 letter.

In her statement defending the veto, Mayor Bowser referred to the reform as a “complete overhaul of our criminal code.”

“I believe it’s more important to get this opportunity right than to add policies & weaken penalties,” she added.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/17/washington-dc-council-overrides-muriel-bowser-veto-revised-criminal-code-crime-reform-bill/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjN4rT0gLT9AhW9EFkFHQDDAc04ChAWegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw21KEf78LzYXOq8GcCVs9A5,2023-01-17
Candidates Gang Up On Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot For Increasing Crime In First Debate,"Democratic Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot was challenged by her opponents for the city’s crime surge in the first debate ahead of the mayoral election.

Lightfoot took part in the debate against eight other candidates Thursday night on ABC7 Chicago. Each candidate attacked Lightfoot’s record on crime as evidence Chicago needs new leadership, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Lightfoot offered a version of Chicago as a city recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic with plans to improve public safety, the outlet said.

Lightfoot acknowledged “people in the city don’t feel safe,” but urged voters to stick with her for a second term. Her rivals slammed her over high crime rates they say are scaring families and companies away from the city.

https://t.co/eop4BnIsom — Chicago Sun-Times (@Suntimes) January 20, 2023

She acknowledged that “people in the city don’t feel safe” and said, “we have started to change Chicago around for the better” in her pitch for a second term. Lightfoot touted “international household names are coming to Chicago” and named corporations that “could be anywhere in the world,” the Sun-Times reported.

Her opponents, such as former Chicago Budget Director Paul Vallas, presented a more negative view of Chicago under Lightfoot. Vallas, a frontrunner in the race, said the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) under Lightfoot has “failed across the board” and “safety on the CTA has to be a top priority.”

Vallas called for more uniformed police officers on the CTA to address safety concerns. Vallas is leading the competitive field with 26% in a recent poll, FOX 32 Chicago reported. (RELATED: ‘A Mistake’: Mayor Lori Lightfoot Responds To Allegations Her Campaign Asked Teachers To Reward Student Volunteers)

Illinois Democratic Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, the other frontrunner in the race, said that “we can stop the bleeding by making Chicago a safer city. My public safety plan gets to the heart of how we do that.” Garcia, a staunch ally of Independent socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, polled in second place with 19% according to Fox 32.

Third place candidate Brandon Johnson, a Chicago Teachers Union organizer, called for investments in youth employment instead of police funding, unlike most other candidates.

Lightfoot placed fourth at 9.8% in the most recent poll despite spending millions in campaign advertising, Fox 32 reported.

Other opponents such as Alderwoman Sophia King took similar jabs at Lightfoot.

“If we don’t have safe communities in good schools, companies and people are going to continue to leave our city,” King said.

Millionaire businessman Willie Wilson said Chicago needs to “take the handcuffs off the police” and community organizer Ja’Mal Green said Lightfoot “has not been connected to the neighborhoods or to what’s going on on the ground,” the Sun-Times reported.

The mayoral election will take place Feb. 28 and the top two candidates will advance to a runoff on April 4 if no candidate receives a majority.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/20/candidates-chicago-lightfoot-debate-crime/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwit9qT2gLT9AhUmF1kFHbsUAXg4KBAWegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw3GEeoTcZgTGQw6Hr44pDU6,2023-01-20
"New York’s Evidence Discovery Reforms ‘Crippled’ Prosecutors, Coincided With Massive Crime Spike: REPORT","New York passed Law Article 245 in 2020, making the process of discovery significantly more difficult for prosecutors.

This has led to a dramatic increase in the number of cases dropped, despite rising crime.

Law 245 “has crippled the state’s criminal justice system with an untenable compliance burden,” according to a new report by the Manhattan Institute.

New reforms in New York have dramatically diminished the ability to prosecute criminals during historic crime increases, according to a new report by the Manhattan Institute.

In 2019, New York passed Law Article 245, which significantly changed the process by which discovery in criminal cases is handled. Since the change, there has been a 25 percentage point increase in the rate of cases dismissed — from 44% in 2019 to 69% in October 2021, according the Manhattan Institute.

Law Article 245 put in place 21 additional categories of discovery, the process by which the prosecutor submits all relevant evidence against the defendant to the defense attorney, and limits the timeframe to provide it to just 35 days, the Manhattan Institute reported. Discovery documents must include “all statements, transcripts of grand jury testimony, potential witness names and contact information, audio and video recordings, photographs and drawings, reports, exculpatory and impeachment material, tangible objects seized, and search warrant information” according to the District Attorney’s Association of New York.

Before these reforms, assistant district attorneys only had to provide intended trial evidence, witness statements, and exculpatory material.

Law Article 245 “has crippled the state’s criminal justice system with an untenable compliance burden,” according to the report. The new law has dramatically reduced the ability of the prosecution to provide the necessary discovery documents in time for trial, leading many cases to simply be dismissed, according to the study.

This change in discovery has proved a significant hurdle for the prosecution, and the New York Association of Counties estimates that it will cost over $100 million to enforce.

“An unscrupulous defense attorney could delay filing motions to suppress evidence until the last possible moment, all while the window before the ADA must dismiss the case keeps closing,” wrote Hannah Meyers of the Manhattan Institute, a former NYPD analyst.

The report cites a leaked memo from the Legal Aid Society that notes how these new rules are particularly important for misdemeanor cases. In 2021, 82% of misdemeanor cases were dismissed compared to just 49% in 2019.

“Tens of thousands of cases were needlessly dismissed across the city last year because of the reform’s requirement that prosecutors share mounds of inconsequential information. Revisions to the reform are urgently needed,” Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said to the Manhattan Institute.

This vast burden has caused many in the justice system to outright quit. According to the study, Manhattan and Brooklyn lost about a fifth of their prosecutors in 2021, and district attorneys throughout the state report that 40% of their employees have quit.

“In the last three to four years, we have lost scores of staff to the private sector and, dispiritingly, to other roles in government because of the unreasonable and unnecessary demands placed on them by Albany,” Staten Island DA Michael McMahon said to the New York Post.

This comes on the heels of another law passed in the name of “reform.” In 2019, New York passed a law prohibiting judges from considering if a defendant poses a threat to public safety when determining bail. Rearrest rates increased by 3 to 4 percentage points after the reform, according to a separate analysis by the Manhattan Institute. For those on supervised release, 23% were rearrested on felony charges, according to The City.

New York has since seen an uptick in crime. (RELATED: Scarborough Tears Into Gov. Hochul, Progressives Over New York Crime Surge)

The New York Times reported that New York saw an overall 22% increase in major crime last year. Commenting on the crime increases, Mayor Eric Adams said, “We know we have more to do. That is my obligation: to ensure that safety is felt.”

The New York City Police Department and the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James did not respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Dem-Led City Reports Highest Violent Crime Rate In 15 Years After Defunding Police,"Seattle’s violent crime rate rose to its highest point in 15 years in 2022, with reported homicides surging by about 24% compared to 2021, according to the Seattle Police Department’s (SPD) Year-End Crime Report, more than a year after the city cut its police budget.

Rapes and aggravated assaults increased by about 4% and 5% respectively, contributing to 5,591 total reported violent offenses, a roughly 4% spike, the report shows. Though arson and burglaries declined, 1,596 more motor vehicle thefts were reported, and Seattle ended up with an around 4% higher overall crime in 2022 despite a fourth-quarter reduction.

Seattle’s City Council reduced SPD funding by almost 17% in its 2021 budget following the George Floyd protests of summer 2020. The city’s 2023 budget funds Democratic Mayor Bruce Harrell’s officer recruitment and retention plan but eliminates 30 unfilled SPD positions, The Seattle Times reported.

The SPD lost more than 130 officers in 2022, according to KOMO News. (RELATED: Seattle Blames Skyrocketing Drug Overdoses ‘On Structural Racism’)

“It’s no longer theoretical what happens when hundreds of officers leave a police department, we now see the reality of that,” Seattle City Councilmember Alex Pedersen told the outlet. “We know a lot of people are frustrated when they call 911. They are waiting for the police, they know that there’s a staffing shortage.”

Harrell served his first full year as Seattle’s mayor in 2022, claiming in a KOMO News interview released Jan. 3 that he thought the city was on a “good trajectory.” Harrell referenced his administration’s “holistic approach to our public safety” and lamented “the proliferation of guns in the wrong hands,” a trend the new data seems to reflect.

Seattle saw a record number of shootings or shots fired incidents last year, and SPD took custody of 1,349 firearms, according to the year-end report. The city had 39 fatal shootings and 52 total homicides.

Voters Most Concerned About Crime And Public Safety In Chicago Mayoral Race: POLL,"Likely Chicago voters ranked crime and public safety their foremost issue in the upcoming mayoral election, with most expressing worries for their own safety, according to a Chicago Sun-Times, WBEZ, Telemundo Chicago and NBC5-commissioned poll.

Roughly 47% of 625 likely election voters cited crime and public safety as the most important issue in determining their vote, and 50% argued crime reduction should have a higher priority than criminal justice system reform in Chicago while 37% said the opposite, the Jan. 31 to Feb. 3 survey indicated. Nearly 35% and 28% respectively claimed they felt “not too safe” and “not safe” from gun violence and crime in the city.

Chicago’s major criminal complaints spiked by about 41% overall in 2022 compared to the previous year, despite a 14% decline in murders, Chicago Police Department data shows. Poll respondents also criticized Chicago authorities meant to address criminal activity, with approximately 65% reporting law enforcement-community relations are generally negative and 67% voicing disapproval with how the criminal justice system there handles people arrested for violent crimes like carjacking and armed robbery, according to the Sun-Times.

Criminal justice reform was cited as the foremost issue by approximately 31% of black voters, while 30% pointed to crime and public safety as their primary concern, the outlet reported. Nearly 85% of black survey participants characterized police relations as generally negative, compared to 63% of Hispanic participants and 49% of white participants.

House Passes Legislation To Block DC’s New Crime Law,"The U.S. House on Thursday passed a resolution of disapproval to block the Washington, D.C., Council’s Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022, which would lower penalties for a number of violent criminal offenses.

The Daily Caller first broke the news on the legislation on Feb. 2. The vote was 250-173.

Congress can exercise authority over D.C. local affairs, according to the District Clause of the Constitution (Article 1, Section 8, Clause 17), and Congress reviews all D.C. legislation before it can become law. Congress can change or even overturn D.C. legislation and can impose new laws on the district.

In November 2022, the D.C. Council approved the Revised Criminal Code Act (RCCA). The RCCA reduces penalties for certain violent criminal offenses, including carjackings, robberies, and homicides. Democratic Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser vetoed the bill on Jan. 4. The council then overrode Bowser’s veto Jan. 17 by a vote of 12-1.

“This is a major first step for Congress in our fight to save our nation’s capital from being further plagued by violent crime. We have both a constitutional and moral obligation to take action against the D.C. Council’s Revised Criminal Code Act, which will undoubtedly embolden and incentivize criminals to continue terrorizing the streets of D.C.,” Republican Georgia Rep. Andrew Clyde, who introduced the resolution, told the Caller immediately after the vote.

“I’m encouraged that we passed my commonsense resolution with bipartisan support, and I urge the Senate to swiftly follow suit so we can ensure all Americans can safely enjoy our nation’s capital city,” Clyde added.

The bill must go through a 60-day review process in Congress. During this time, each chamber can pass a resolution of disapproval to block the measure. If the bill does receive congressional approval, D.C. would begin phasing in the new criminal code in 2025. The estimated cost is around $50 million.

Violent crime in D.C. surged throughout 2021. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) data shows that the number of homicides increased 19 percent in 2020 and remained constant into 2021, the Washingtonian reported. Carjackings have tripled since 2019. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: House Oversight Republicans Demand Mayor Bowser Provide Plan To Address Rampant Violent Crime In Nation’s Capital)

In March, Republicans on the House Oversight Committee sent a letter to Bowser calling on her to provide them with a plan for how she will address the rampant violent crime in the nation’s capital.

The Caller first obtained the March letter spearheaded by ranking member Rep. James Comer of Kentucky and signed by all Republicans on the committee. In the letter, the lawmakers criticized Bowser and D.C. Democrats for cutting the budget for the MPD.

The House resolution had 19 original cosponsors: Reps.

Crime-Plagued Dem City’s Mayor Pushes $25 Million Police Funding Boost,"Democratic San Francisco Mayor London Breed said Thursday she would put forward a $25 million new police funding measure, acknowledging the San Francisco Police Department’s (SFPD) staffing shortage.

Breed declared plans in her State of City Address to introduce “a $25 million dollar budget supplemental to fund overtime and keep our officers walking beats, making drug arrests, and addressing retail theft,” lamenting that the SPD was “still years away” from full staffing. Crime has increased in San Francisco after Breed pledged to redirect millions of dollars in funding originally meant for the department. (RELATED: House Passes Legislation To Block DC’s New Crime Law)

WATCH:

“I want to make one thing very clear: I am NOT okay with open-air drug dealing in this City. Period,” Breed said. “Yes, we are pushing innovative programs to get people into care and treatment, including working to open overdose prevention programs…but we need to enforce the law. Likewise, home and business break-ins require a TIMELY police response, an investigation, and an arrest.”

San Francisco’s serious crime index increased by roughly 5.7% overall in 2022 compared to 2021, a year that saw a 13.6% rise over 2020, SFPD data shows. Police reported in mid-January that 267 of the department’s funded positions were unfilled, and City Supervisor Matt Dorsey claimed days later that only 1,537 of SFPD’s around 1,923 sworn officers were currently full-duty, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

“Our residents are demanding we build back the police force, and we need to deliver,” Breed said Thursday. “The push for full staffing has to be consistent and it has to be sustained.”

Breed announced in 2020 that the city was redirecting $120 million in law enforcement funding to the black community in the next two years, unveiling a spending plan for those funds the following February.

Breed thanked voters Thursday for electing District Attorney Brooke Jenkins and praised her for “combatting open-air drug dealing,” “taking on the perpetrators of gun violence” and “prosecuting hate crimes.”

Jenkins was elected in November after Breed appointed her the interim replacement of former District Attorney Chesa Boudin, who was recalled from office in mid-2022. Boudin ended cash bail and the prosecution of minors as adults in San Francisco, and critics argued he was not aggressive enough in criminal prosecution, according to CBS News.

The SFPD did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

‘Some People Belong In Jail’: Former Clinton White House Aide Condemns Democrats For Lukewarm Crime Policies,"Former White House aide Paul Begala said Friday night that “white liberals,” not poor and working class voters, were trying to defund police and that the party needed to “get out in front” of the crime issue for 2021.

“Quality of life issues is what we’re going to be – what we’re going to decide the election on,” HBO host Bill Maher said. “I saw this in the L.A. Times yesterday, ‘What’s the matter with Portland?’”

Maher noted increased crime rates and homelessness in Portland, Oregon, as reported by the Los Angeles Times, stating that it and many other big cities with skyrocketing crime were run by Democrats. (RELATED: Tucker Carlson Clobbers Chicago Mayor Over Crime Hurting The ‘Poorest People’)

“They need to get out in front of it,” Begala said. “I want a Democrat to stand and say some people belong in jail.” Begala then claimed that Bakersfield, California, the hometown of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, had a “much higher murder rate” than San Francisco.

“Why aren’t Democrats talking about that?” Begala asked, before claiming that states that voted for Trump had a 40% higher murder rate.

Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson pointed out that a number of Democrats in the House of Representatives voted Thursday to block a D.C. law that would have reduced certain criminal penalties, including Democratic Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota, who had been assaulted in the lobby of her apartment building Thursday.

“For Democrats and my fellow liberals, it’s the people we supposedly care about are the victims of crime,” Begala said. “Elon Musk is not going to get his stupid Tesla carjacked. It’s poor people, it’s working people.”

“They’re the victims of crime, and by the way, if you look at all the polling and the voting, it’s those folks who are voting for more security, more safety, more and better cops,” Begala continued. “It’s the white liberals who want to defund police.”

Los Angeles Tries To Fight Crime With Yoga At A Cost Of $2.2 Million,"Los Angeles launched a new approach to public safety on Monday, a training program that will utilize therapy, yoga, and healing circles to fight crime as an unarmed alternative to law enforcement intervention, according to NBC.

Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez of Los Angeles County announced the Therapeutic Unarmed Response for Neighborhoods (TURN) initiative Monday, according to NBC Los Angeles. The plan is to provide crisis workers with treatment options so they can continue to be at the scene of the crime as a buffer before the police arrive.

“These crisis intervention workers are exposed to trauma with regularity,” Rodriguez told City News Service. “And they’ve never been provided those tools to help manage that.” (RELATED: ‘A Violent Start To The Year’: Murders Are Already Soaring In These Six Major Cities)

The idea behind the program is that therapy options allow crisis workers to continue to be the first point of contact and in some situations avoid police interaction altogether, according to City News. The program kicked off with a three-day training on trauma for the community workers.

WATCH:

The program cost $2.2 million in city funds and seeks to aid retention of the 100 community intervention workers in Los Angeles, according to City News.

“Mediation requires maintenance,” said Co-founder of the Community Based Public Safety Collective, Aqeela Sherrills.

LAPD is aware and supportive of the program, according to the president of San Fernando Valley-based Champions in Service, Bobby Arias. But working with the police isn’t a goal of the community intervention workers because they “can’t be perceived by the community as snitches,” said Arias.

“They know the terrain. They know the families … They’ll have more intelligence in terms of what’s happening in the street than law enforcement will ever have,” said Sherrills.

Rodriguez’s office did not immediately respond to Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.
