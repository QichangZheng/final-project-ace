Arby’s Is Still Paying Employee Who Allegedly Refused To Serve Police Officer,"The Arby’s employee who was suspended more than two weeks ago for allegedly refusing to serve a police officer is still getting a paycheck from the company, two weeks after the incident.

A spokesman for Arby’s told The Daily Caller News Foundation that the company and the employee, Kenneth Davenport, 19, mutually agreed that the he would go on temporary paid leave.

“That’s where things stand at this point,” Jason Rollins, an Arby’s spokesman, told TheDCNF.

The entire scandal started when a Florida police department publicly complained saying one of their female officers was refused service at an Arby’s, simply because she was a cop.

The officer, Jennifer Martin, said she was refused service by Davenport at the Arby’s and when she asked the manager why, he said it was because she was a cop.

The Pembroke Pines police chief demanded an apology and caused a public relations nightmare for the company. Arby’s fired the manager of the store and suspended the employee involved, but Rollins told TheDCNF Davenport is still getting paid.

The employees have since said the entire incident was a misunderstood joke and that he was just too busy to serve her.

He has since said he doesn’t hate police. Arby’s gave the officer a refund and has apologized. Arby’s offered free food to police officers in two Florida counties as a way to save face after the incident, but local news could only find one officer who took the offer.

“We once again apologize to the police officer involved and the Dade-Broward County police community for this isolated incident,” the company said in a statement. “Arby’s has always been and will always continue to be a champion of the police in every community across America.”

A reply to Michael Mann and Eugene Wahl,"Michael Mann has responded to my piece in The Daily Caller accusing Penn State of whitewashing ClimateGate. Mann’s response is typically off point from the question:

The claim by fossil fuel industry lobbyist Chris Horner in his “Daily Caller” piece that I told Eugene Wahl to delete emails is a fabrication — a lie, and a libelous allegation. My only involvement in the episode in question is that I forwarded Wahl an email that Phil Jones had sent me, which I felt Wahl needed to see. There was no accompanying commentary by me or additional correspondence from me regarding the matter, nor did I speak to Wahl about the matter. This is, in short, a despicable smear that, more than anything else, speaks to the depths of dishonesty of professional climate change deniers like Chris Horner, Marc Morano, Stephen McIntyre, and Anthony Watts.

Please state where I “claim . . . that [Mann] told Eugene Wahl to delete emails,” and also what is libelous, Mr. Mann. If you do the latter, I am happy to retract it.

But, “Wahl says Mann did indeed ask Wahl to destroy records, and Wahl did” doesn’t do it, unless you want to crop off one end of the sentence (“Wahl says”) and replace it with something more appealing to your thesis (an inside joke for those familiar with the whole Hockey Stick saga). Chuckle.

Your allegation is false until you somehow demonstrate otherwise, and your problem lies with the NOAA inspector general whose transcript indicates these events transpired.

A guy who has clearly lawyered up probably ought to call his lawyer to see what libel means before accusing someone of it. It actually doesn’t mean accurately using someone’s name in a way that makes them uncomfortable.

Similarly, Eugene Wahl, the NOAA employee who worked for Alfred University (a place that I understand gave Ward Churchill an honorary PhD — while we’re busy making associations — though I’m not sure it was in climate) at the time he deleted the emails, writes in his public reply to the piece:

The Daily Caller blog yesterday contained an inaccurate story regarding a correspondence that was part of the emails hacked from East Anglia University Climate Research Unit (CRU) in November 2009.

Mr. Wahl, please state what the inaccurate statement was. You forgot to.

Wahl goes on:

For the record, while I received the email from CRU as forwarded by Dr. Mann, the forwarded message came without any additional comment from Dr. Mann; there was no request from him to delete emails. At the time of the email in May 2008, I was employed by Alfred University, New York. I became a NOAA employee in August 2008. The emails I deleted while a university employee are the correspondence I had with Dr. Briffa of CRU regarding the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, all of which have been in the public domain since the CRU hack in November 2009. This correspondence has been extensively examined and no misconduct found. As a NOAA employee, I follow agency record retention policies and associated guidance from information technology staff.

But he did delete emails after receiving Jones’ request. He says he deleted the emails cited in the request that Mann forwarded to him from Jones. In response to Jones’ request that Mann ask Wahl to delete emails. But — and here’s where us non-scientists are missing the boat, it seems — Jones’ request was to Mann. You see? To, well, to ask Wahl to do what Wahl did. In response to which Mann forwarded the request. From Jones.

So, really, Mann never asked him to delete the emails, just like you can never be “alone” with someone in the White House. See?



Let’s review the points:

Penn State asked Mann, in pertinent part:

Allegation 2: Did you engage in, or participate in, directly or indirectly, any actions with the intent to delete, conceal or otherwise destroy emails, information and/or data, related to AR4, as suggested by Phil Jones?

Mann gave a non-answer, according to the way Penn State’s panel tells things, which nonetheless lapped it up and repackaged it as new and improved.

Finding 2. After careful consideration of all the evidence and relevant materials, the inquiry committee finding is that there exists no credible evidence that Dr. Mann had ever engaged in, or participated in, directly or indirectly, any actions with intent to delete, conceal or otherwise destroy emails, information and/or data related to AR4, as suggested by Dr. Phil Jones. Dr. Mann has stated that he did not delete emails in response to Dr. Jones’ request. Further, Dr. Mann produced upon request a full archive of his emails in and around the time of the preparation of AR4. The archive contained e-mails related to AR4.

Did you do A or B? I did not do A. OK, he didn’t do A or B.

PSU’s panel accepted the non-response, then dressed it up as claiming something there is no indication it actually claimed.

So Mann yells “libel!” and will figure out where and how later. Wahl says I wrote an inaccurate piece without saying how or where it was inaccurate, but is adamant that no one really asked him to delete the emails he deleted on his own volition or after hearing voices or reading it on a tortilla in Mexico or in an oil stain in the parking lot, but regardless, upon receiving this email, which didn’t ask him to delete any emails but only names the emails that need to be disappeared and expresses a desire that someone ask him to delete them.

I think we understand quite well.

Common Core: In pursuit of the new Soviet man,"The Common Core State Standards Initiative is a federal initiative designed to homogenize diverse state educational curricula.

It is also the latest example of destructive federal overreach into the education system.

Like its predecessor No Child Left Behind, Common Core will not produce vibrant, inspired thinkers eager to tackle the world.

Instead, Common Core is designed to churn out young people who will be educated enough to work, consume, and pay taxes, but who are not encouraged to be creative, or to use critical thinking, or to develop anything remotely characteristic of those who possess superior minds and the ability to achieve great things.

Common Core proponents seem more interested in producing what Russian communists called “New Soviet Men” — people who are selfless, moderately educated, and stripped of all nationalist sentiment — than they are in delivering the next Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Edison, or Steve Jobs.

David Coleman is the architect of the Common Core standards. According to Coleman, supplanting classic literature with mind-numbing material such as government documents, court decisions, and technical manuals is necessary because informational texts are “what will give students the world knowledge necessary to compete as workers in the global economy” (emphasis mine).

Of course, there is nothing wrong with being a worker if that is what one chooses. However, it should be students, not bureaucrats, who determine what path their lives take: be it as workers, scientists, entrepreneurs, engineers, architects, artists, or whatever.

Like most government education programs, Common Core sets a very low bar for students. Its language arts component is so lacking that Dr. Sandra Stotsky, a professor emerita at the University of Arkansas and a member of the Common Core Validation Committee, refused to approve the program.

Common Core’s mathematical component is no better. The Validation Committee’s Dr. James Milgram, a professor emeritus at Stanford University, also refused to sign off on Common Core, saying that the math standards are “as non-challenging as possible. … The Core Mathematics Standards are written to reflect very low expectations.”

Unfortunately, since the mid-1800s, the object of government education in the U.S. has not been enlightenment and diversity of thought, but indoctrination and conformity.

In 1843, Horace Mann, the father of American public education, traveled to Europe to investigate the Prussian education system. Mann thought that American youth were unruly and needed a dose of discipline.

The highly regimented Prussian system provided the answer.

The Prussian model of education included compulsory attendance laws, teachers who specialized in specific subjects, a national curriculum, and national testing standards.

The autocratic Prussian government was not concerned about educating citizens, but controlling them. What better way to produce compliant people who think the same way than to take children away from their parents, limit their exposure to “inappropriate” information, encourage unquestioning obedience to authority, and discourage critical thinking?



In its mission to stunt intellectual growth and standardize diversity, the Prussian system was a spectacular success — a success which Mann and other early education reformers brought to our shores.

In 1852, Massachusetts, with Mann spearheading the effort, passed the nation’s first compulsory attendance law. By the early 1900s, the rest of the country was following suit. Although the federal government was not yet in the picture, many schools were being consolidated and school boards were losing their local flavor.

The Progressive Era brought us John Dewey and his idea that schools should not only be places of learning, but instruments for social reform, i.e., social engineering. Dewey thought that independent people were a danger to the collectivist future he envisioned. Students should only learn from “experts,” and not pursue knowledge for themselves. It was Dewey who advocated replacing the phonics method of teaching reading with “whole word” reading, a technique that Dewey himself admitted was much less effective.

This was a deliberate strategy to dumb down students.

Another progressive, Woodrow Wilson, clearly stated the goal of government education in a 1909 speech to the New York City School Teachers Association: “We want one class of persons to have a liberal education, and we want another class of persons, a very much larger class of necessity in every society, to forego the privilege of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks.” So much for the egalitarian myths about the American public school system.

By the late 20th century, the federal government was insinuating itself in the education system by bribing the states with grant money in return for more standardized testing and a greater say over the curriculum. In fact, Common Core began with a $4.35 billion program called “Race to the Top.” RTTP, which received its funding as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the stimulus bill), awarded the participating states grant money for satisfying certain criteria, including complying with Common Core standards.

Autocrats have long understood that if one controls the minds of its citizens, particularly the youth, one controls the future. Ultimately, the goal of the Prussian education system — the model for our own — was to create a docile populace that wouldn’t cause the ruling class too much trouble.

Sadly, the American education system has been following this same path for quite some time.

In 1889, William Torrey Harris, the U.S. commissioner of education, told railroad baron Collis Huntington that American schools were “scientifically designed” to prevent “over-education,” thus ensuring Huntington content workers who would never be tempted to better their station in life.

While Harris wanted to produce workers for private interests, Karl Marx — who also advocated free, universal government education — wanted to produce workers for the state. Either way, the happiness of the youth is subordinate to the will of central planners.

Instead of further centralizing our education system with programs such as Common Core, the education of our children should be returned to where it belongs: the family and local communities.

Common Core instructs our children not to grow, achieve and reach for the stars, but to keep their heads low, and their expectations even lower. “Lowest Common Denominator” is a far more apt name for it.

Judge won’t allow Trayvon Martin’s texts in Zimmerman trial,"SANFORD, Fla. – Judge Debra Nelson ruled Wednesday against two key pieces of evidence sought by George Zimmerman’s defense team.

Nelson said that text messages from Trayvon Martin’s phone which allegedly showed the slain teen to have a burgeoning penchant for violence will not be allowed into evidence.

Richard Conner, a computer forensics expert hired by the defense, was able to unlock “secret” text messages from the phone number used by Martin.

In those text messages sent from Martin’s phone — which analysts for the state were not able to obtain — Martin was said to have had conversations with friends about getting into fights. Martin’s half-brother allegedly asked Martin, “when you gonna teach me how to fight?”

Martin also sent text messages showing he was looking to obtain a handgun, he said. Those texts were sent in the week before Martin’s February 2012 visit to Sanford.

Nelson had put a decision on Martin’s text messages on hold prior to the trial. Both sides argued late into Tuesday evening over the relevance of the texts. State attorney John Guy argued “we don’t know who typed these messages, we don’t know if they’re connected.”

Nelson agreed, citing the “authenticity issue”.

Nelson also blocked animation created by Daniel Schumaker. The animation relied on witness testimony and statements to re-create the defense’s theory about the altercation between Zimmerman and Martin leading up to Martin’s death.

Schumaker relied on analysis provided by Vincent di Maio, the renowned gunshot expert who testified Tuesday the Zimmerman’s story — that Martin was on top of Zimmerman when he was shot — is consistent with the available evidence.

“This is a murder trial. This isn’t ‘Casablanca.’ This isn’t ‘Iron Man’,” argued state attorney Richard Mantei.

A point of contention Tuesday night was whether Martin first struck Zimmerman with his right or left hand.

Nelson ruled that while the animation cannot be introduced into evidence, it can be used as a demonstrative tool by the defense.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2013/07/10/judge-wont-allow-trayvon-martins-texts-in-zimmerman-trial/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiX-Zj__7P9AhVILVkFHWaFCU04HhAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw03YFyUGs3pf5Y-CJDwrMyn,2013-07-10
Obamacare chief repeatedly dodges questions on number of Obamacare enrollees,"“We’ll have that information available for you in mid November.”

That line was repeated over and over again during a congressional hearing Tuesday by a top Obama administration official involved in the implementation of Obamacare this month.

Marilyn Tavenner, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, repeatedly refused to say how many people have actually enrolled in the new Obamacare exchanges while under questioning from Republican Rep. Dave Camp, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.

Tavenner appeared before the committee to answer questions about the botched roll out of the health care law and problems with its website, which has prevented people from being able to sign up for health benefits.

On Tuesday, Tavenner said: “I want to apologize to you that the website is not working as well as it should.” But she wouldn’t say how many people have successfully enrolled.

Here’s the exchange between Camp and Tavenner:

Camp: Administrator Tavenner, how many people have enrolled in the exchanges?

Tavenner: Chairman Camp, that number will not be available until mid-November. We have over 700,000 who have completed applications.

Camp: So you know the applicants but do you know the enrollees? Do you have any idea of how many of those applicants became enrollees? Because that’s really the number that matters.

Tavenner: We will not have that until mid-November. We have people who are shopping now. We expect the initial number to be small. And I think you’ve seen that in our projections. And that was the Massachusetts experience as well.

Camp: I have to tell you, the numbers I’m hearing from insurers in my home state of Michigan are not good…of enrollees. A very small number. In fact, I think I could have a meeting in my office and have all of them fit in, of the people who have successfully enrolled in the plans. I understand that CMS’s stated goal is 7 million enrollees by the end of March. Is that correct?

Tavenner: That’s correct.

Camp went on to ask about an internal memo predicting enrollment numbers.

Camp: According to the press report, the memo estimated that 494,620 people would sign up for health insurance under the program by Oct. 31. We’re obviously very near that date. Have you met that estimate?

Tavenner: We will not have those numbers available until mid November.

Camp: So do you not know? Do you not ave any idea of how many people have enrolled?

Tavenner: Folks are still in the process of enrolling. Both in the state-based exchanges and in the federal exchange. And we will have those numbers available in mid-November.

Camp: Are you getting those numbers?

Tavenner: Am I getting those numbers? Not yet.

Camp: You have no numbers on whose enrolled. So you have no idea?

Tavenner: We will have those numbers available in mid-November.

Camp: So no one is forwarding even weekly updates?

Tavenner: I think you’ve seen of the press. And I think that was on the graph earlier about what states have listed. We will get those in mid November.

Camp: I understand you are not publicly releasing those numbers, but I’m asking do you have any idea of – on a weekly basis — how many people enrolled. How do you not know how many people enrolled?

Tavenner: Chairman Camp. We will have those numbers available in in mid-November.

Secretary Hillary — Now Decrying ‘Terrorism’ — Refused To Call Boko Haram A Terror Group,"Since the kidnapping of nearly 300 girls, Hillary Clinton has risen to the fore of those demanding international action and calling Nigerian group Boko Haram terrorists.

But during her tenure at the head of the U.S. Department of State, Clinton resisted numerous calls from the CIA, the FBI, the Department of Justice and a number of U.S. senators and congressmen to do just that.

On Sunday, Clinton tweeted:

Access to education is a basic right & an unconscionable reason to target innocent girls. We must stand up to terrorism. #BringBackOurGirls — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 4, 2014

And on Wednesday, Clinton called the kidnappings and threat to sell the girls for $12 each, “an act of terrorism and it really merits the fullest response possible, first and foremost from the government of Nigeria.”

The government of Nigeria, itself a human right abuser, may be somewhat behind Clinton’s refusal to designate the church-bombing, anti-education, al-Qaida-harboring terror group on the official list, The Daily Beast Reports: “Several officials said that the Nigerian government was opposed to the designation and [Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie] Carson was focused on preserving the relationship between Washington and Abuja,” Josh Rogin writes.

Early urging from the intelligence community and Congress to designate the group came after the 2011 bombing of the United Nations HQ in Abuja.

Carson was the most vocal critic of placing Boko Haram on the list. Being placed on the list expands the U.S.’s ability to thwart the group through Patriot Act powers, and by cutting off dealings with all U.S. businesses, thereby making it toxic for other countries’ businesses to deal with the group. Designation is not, however, the only means of fighting organizations.

When Clinton was still in charge, the State Department went so far as to lobby against the Boko Haram Terrorist Designation Act of 2013, introduced by a number of senators to force a designation of explanation, The Daily Beast reports.

Carson stood by the previous decision to not designate Boko Haram a terror group in a Wednesday press call, saying, ““There was a concern that putting Boko Haram on the foreign terrorist list would in fact raise its profile, give it greater publicity, give it greater credibility, help in its recruitment, and also probably drive more assistance in its direction.”

Ten months into his tenure at the helm of the State Department, John Kerry added the group to the list. The designation cited murderous campaigns against civilians, the bombing of the U.N. building, and ties to al-Qaida — all things recognized by the U.S. government during Clinton’s time as secretary of state.

Clinton allegedly made women’s rights, including access to education, a priority for her State Department.

FLASHBACK: Czech Republic Refused North Korean Demands To Ban ‘Team America’,"Here’s an old story with modern implications: back in 2005, the Czech Republic refused North Korean demands that the movie “Team America: World Police” be banned for its depiction of then-leader Kim Jung-Il. (RELATED: US Links North Korea To Sony Hack, ‘The Interview’ Terror Threat)

The movie, written and directed by South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, depicted Kim as a power-hungry and comically inept dictator bent on world domination (and secretly an alien cockroach). “It harms the image of our country,” a North Korean diplomat said according to the Associated Press. “Such behavior is not part of our country’s political culture. Therefore, we want the film to be banned.”

The Czechs refused. “We told them it’s an unrealistic wish,” said a government spokesman. “Obviously, it’s absurd to demand that in a democratic country.” (VIDEO: Gene Simmons On Sony Hack: ‘Cyber War Has Been Declared’)

Obviously, there’s a difference between the government banning a film, and independent companies doing the same. But perhaps Sony, Paramount, and the countless theater chains should be taking notes on how to deal with threats from brutal dictatorships.

Clooney: Hollywood Refused To Stand Up To Threats Against Sony,"George Clooney is angry. The hack of Sony’s computer systems and the following terrorist threats have the A-list actor up in arms not just at North Korea, but at his fellow actors and Hollywood types. In an interview with Deadline Hollywood, Clooney went off on those in his profession and the media for the way they’ve handled the crisis.

“A good portion of the press abdicated its real duty,” Clooney said. “They played the fiddle while Rome burned.”

“Here, we’re talking about an actual country deciding what content we’re going to have,” he said. “This affects not just movies, this affects every part of business that we have. That’s the truth. What happens if a newsroom decides to go with a story, and a country or an individual or corporation decides they don’t like it? Forget the hacking part of it. You have someone threaten to blow up buildings, and all of a sudden everybody has to bow down.”

Clooney pointed fingers at lawyers for Sony canceling the release of “The Interview,” the comedy behind the controversy. “Sony didn’t pull the movie because they were scared; they pulled the movie because all the theaters said they were not going to run it. And they said they were not going to run it because they talked to their lawyers and those lawyers said if somebody dies in one of these, then you’re going to be responsible.”

The veteran actor and his agent, Bryan Lourd, circulated a letter of support for the First Amendment and defiance in the face of terrorist threats against showing “The Interview.” They sent the letter to “a fairly large number” of people in the entertainment business in the hope of getting signatures of support. They got zero.

Clooney’s letter read:

On November 24 of this year, Sony Pictures was notified that it was the victim of a cyber attack, the effects of which is the most chilling and devastating of any cyber attack in the history of our country. Personal information including Social Security numbers, email addresses, home addresses, phone numbers and the full texts of emails of tens of thousands of Sony employees was leaked online in an effort to scare and terrorize these workers. The hackers have made both demands and threats. The demand that Sony halt the release of its upcoming comedy The Interview, a satirical film about North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. Their threats vary from personal—you better behave wisely—to threatening physical harm—not only you but your family is in danger. North Korea has not claimed credit for the attack but has praised the act, calling it a righteous deed and promising merciless measures if the film is released. Meanwhile the hackers insist in their statement that what they’ve done so far is only a small part of our further plan. This is not just an attack on Sony. It involves every studio, every network, every business and every individual in this country. That is why we fully support Sony’s decision not to submit to these hackers’ demands. We know that to give in to these criminals now will open the door for any group that would threaten freedom of expression, privacy and personal liberty. We hope these hackers are brought to justice but until they are, we will not stand in fear. We will stand together.

Clooney was exasperated at the willingness of his fellow celebrities and executives to accept what we’ve been witnessing this last week. “Quite honestly, this would happen in any industry. I don’t know what the answer is, but what happened here is part of a much larger deal. A huge deal. And people are still talking about dumb emails,” he said. “Understand what is going on right now, because the world just changed on your watch, and you weren’t even paying attention.”

“Everybody was doing their jobs, but somehow, we have allowed North Korea to dictate content, and that is just insane,” Clooney concluded. “I wanted to have the conversation because I’m worried about content. Frankly, I’m at an age where I’m not doing action films or romantic comedies. The movies we make are the ones with challenging content, and I don’t want to see it all just be superhero movies. Nothing wrong with them, but it’s nice for people to have other films out there.”

Hannity: Chris Christie REFUSED To Sit Down For An Interview [VIDEO],"Appearing on Fox News’ “The Five,” host Sean Hannity revealed that of all the presumed 2016 Republican candidates at CPAC, Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was the only one who refused an interview with him.

When host Juan Williams asked about an attack Florida Governor Jeb Bush had made on Christie during an interview, Hannity voiced his frustration. “I was a little disappointed with Chris Christie. Chris Christie, of all the candidates here, was the only one that didn’t––refused to do an interview with me.

ESPN: Hey Olbermann… YOU’RE FIRED!!!,"ESPN has cut ties with Keith Olbermann… again.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, ESPN declined to extend Olbermann’s current contract — which expires at the end of July — after he declined to move his show from its current Times Square locale to the network’s headquarters in Bristol, CT.

Olbermann previously worked for ESPN from 1992-1997 before leaving and spent time working for Fox Sports and NBC before returning to ESPN in 2013. By not renewing Olbermann’s deal, ESPN will reportedly save upwards of $40 million.

"White House, Obama Blocked Congress From Reviewing Secret Aspects Of Iran Deal","Republican lawmakers recently learned that the White House blocked Congress from reviewing two key aspects of the Iranian Nuclear Deal.

Under the current Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the International Atomic Energy Agency will pursue independent negotiations with Iran regarding the inspection of the Parchin military complex, a site long-suspected of conducting research on “long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons,” National Review reports.

The IAEA has unsuccessfully sought entry to the Parchin complex since 2005, and the President’s nuclear deal would preclude Congress from being able to review any concessions the IAEA might make to Iran in the hopes of being allowed inside, a preclusion Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo says “not only… [violates] the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, [but also asks] Congress to agree to a deal it cannot review… Even members of Congress who are sympathetic to this deal cannot and must not accept a deal we aren’t even aware of.”

Additionally, Congress will not be a part of negotiations regarding “outstanding issues on possible military dimensions of Iran’s nuclear program,” which again, will be conducted solely by the IAEA and Iran.

Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton joined Rep. Pompeo in condemning the deal’s lack of transparency.

“That we are only now discovering that parts of this dangerous agreement are being kept secret begs the question of what other elements may also be secret and entirely free of public scrutiny,” Cotton said in a statement.

Cotton and Pompeo both learned of these side-deals while meeting with the IAEA in Austria last week.

Obama Administration Refuses To Identify Troubled Healthcare Co-Ops,"Federal officials refuse to identify the troubled Obamacare health co-ops that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has placed in a special risk category requiring “enhanced oversight” due to low profitability or low enrollment.

Last week the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services revealed that 22 of the 23 non-profit co-ops suffered net operating losses last year and that six were so distressed CMS said they were the subject to extra “enhanced oversight.”

CMS spokesman Aaron Albright, however, refused to divulge the names of the struggling taxpayer-supported co-ops.

He suggested The Daily Caller News Foundation file a Freedom of Information Act request. It’s not uncommon for responses to FOIA requests to take months or even years to be processed by federal departments and agencies.

The secrecy surrounding the identity of the six ailing co-ops is not sitting well with government watchdog groups.

“Taxpayers deserve to know when any sort of taxpayer-funded entity is failing,” said David Williams, president of the Taxpayer Protection Alliance. “Taxpayers need to know the success or failure of those co-ops. We have to name names.”

“Certainly, the government should be identifying co-ops that are at risk,” noted Scott Amey, the general counsel for the non-partisan Project on Government Oversight. “The government seems to be just trying to bury its head in the sand.”

Department of Health and Human Services IG Daniel Levinson was the first to report that six co-ops were in a special risk category within CMS.

“CMS recently placed four CO-OPs on enhanced oversight or corrective action plans and two CO-OPs on low-enrollment warning notifications,” he revealed in his July 30 report.

Levinson further criticized CMS officials, noting that the Obamacare program was now in its third year of existence, yet, “CMS had not established guidelines or criteria to assess whether a CO-OP was viable or sustainable.”

Levinson painted a dismal national picture of the Obamacare health co-ops, noting they were suffering from cash shortages and that their enrollment numbers were “considerably lower than the CO-OPs’ initial annual projections.”

Sparse enrollments could imperil most of the non-profit co-ops that were originally designed to compete with traditional health insurance companies.

“The low enrollments and net losses might limit the ability of some CO-OPs to repay startup and solvency loans and to remain viable and sustainable,” Levinson said.

About $2 billion have been issued in start-up and solvency loans under Obamacare.

Rating agency Standard and Poor’s last February identified 10 co-ops that failed to enroll 6,000 or fewer customers through the third quarter of last year.

Those low enrollment co-ops are operating in Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, Connecticut, Arizona, Tennessee, Michigan, Maryland and two in Oregon.

In that report, S&P optimistically claimed that one co-op, operating in Iowa and Nebraska, called Co-Opportunity Health, had enrolled 91,000 customers.

But Co-Opportunity abruptly closed its doors last December and by February the state had liquidated it.

At the time, the Iowa co-op suffered $163 million in operating losses, according to the Iowa insurance commissioner. CMS originally awarded $145 million under Obamacare.

Likewise, S&P also reported that the Louisiana Health CO-OP had successfully enrolled 11,771 customers.

But last month the co-op announced it was shuttering its doors by the end of the year. CMS had loaned that co-op $66 million.

Similar to the experiences reported in Iowa and Louisiana, most of the non-profit health co-ops have been burning through their federal loans at an alarming rate, according to financial reporting agencies.

Insurance ratings firm A.M. Best warned in January that as of Sept. 30, 2014, “the ratio of surplus notes outstanding to capital and surplus exceeded 100% for all of the co-ops.”

A Standard & Poor’s Report on the co-ops reported that the worst performing co-ops that were burning through their existing capital were in Illinois, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and Maryland.

Thomas Miller of the American Enterprise Institute and Grace-Marie Turner, the president of the free market Galen Institute reported that net losses for all the co-ops amounted to $614 million in 2014.

Last year CMS announced that it was replenishing some co-op cash with emergency “solvency loans.”

Five Obamacare health insurance co-ops in Connecticut, Kentucky, Maine, New York and Wisconsin received solvency loans in 2014 amounting to $322 million.

Clinton Campaign Refuses To Disavow Gloria Steinem’s Sexist Remarks [VIDEO],"Clinton campaign spokeswoman Karen Finney refused to disavow the sexist comments and claims made by Hillary Clinton supporters Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright.

Monday on “CNN Newsroom with Carol Costello,” Finney instead called on the “Sanders campaign disavow [the] comments that specifically Ben Jealous has been making since he endorsed Senator Sanders.” (RELATED: Accused Rapist Bill Clinton Complains That ‘Bernie Bros’ Are ‘Profane’ And ‘Sexist’)

Costello noted that “things are getting nastier between the campaigns,” referencing Steinem’s comment that suggested young women support Sanders instead of Clinton because, “When you are young you are thinking where are the boys? The boys are with Bernie.” (RELATED: Hillary Laughs Off ‘There’s A Special Place In Hell’ For Women Who Don’t Vote For Her Comment)

Last Saturday, former secretary of state Madeleine Albright said, “There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other,” referring to the gap in support the Clinton campaign has from young women. (RELATED: Madeleine Albright Tells Young Women Voters ‘There’s A Special Place In Hell’ For Them If They Don’t Support Hillary [VIDEO])

Costello asked Finney, “You know, younger women don’t like to be patronized. Are these comments hurting?”

“Well look, both of these women have been first in their careers and obviously they have strong feelings,” Finney claimed. “I’ve heard former secretary talk about that a number of times before. They have very strong feelings about it. I just want you to point out, these are two women supporting Hillary but you know, we are not accountable, we can’t control what they say, obviously.”

“But you can disavow what they say Karen, you can disavow what they say,” Costello inquired. Arguing, “because they seem to be pitting the older generation of women against the younger and that is never a good thing, frankly.”

“Well, but Carol I would put this to you. Then I would like to see the Senator Sanders campaign disavow comments that specifically Ben Jealous has been making since he endorsed Senator Sanders,” Finney said. “Specifically I’m talking about Saturday in South Carolina, horrendous comments and misinformation about Hillary Clinton’s record on criminal justice reform and the death penalty without recognizing or acknowledging that Senator Sanders voted to expand death penalty at the federal level when he voted for the 1994 crime bill. So you know, I would like to hear his campaign disavow those comments and tell the truth about that.”

“But shouldn’t Hillary Clinton come out and totally disavow what Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright said?” Costello shot back.

“Well look, she talked about it yesterday as you know in an interview, in a couple of interviews actually. And I mean, again, these are women who are passionate advocates. They support Hillary Clinton. We can’t control what they say. And again this is how they feel, they feel strongly–” Finney claimed.

Costello interjected, “But again, you, they can disavow what they say.”

“They feel very strongly about having a woman president,” Finney said. Refusing to disavow the comments, Finney argued, “And I would point to something that Gloria Steinem said which was talking about women in power and how men tend to get more power as they get older. And women don’t always and think there are some realities here but the point is these are women who are you know passionate advocates. We can’t control what they say. They are very passionate about women. They have been firsts throughout their careers. So they know a little something about what that is like and have, certainly have feelings about it.”

Finney then reiterated her call for the Sanders campaign to “disavow comments being made by Ben Jealous, not telling the whole story about Hillary Clinton’s record on social justice and the work done throughout her life on certainly as time as Senator against racial profiling and sentencing disparities and what she is talking about now in her presidential campaign not only about criminal justice reform and how you invest in communities of color. So I’d like to hear some more information there, too.”

"Mad Mom: Teacher Said ‘Go Back To Africa’ After Student Refused To Stand For Pledge, BLAMED TRUMP","A mother in small-town South Carolina claims a high school science teacher urged her son, a freshman, to “go back to Africa” after he refused to stand up for the Pledge of Allegiance because, the student told the teacher, “Donald Trump is going to send us back to Africa.”

The kerfuffle occurred on Tuesday at Battery Creek High School in Beaufort, S.C. (pop.: 12,361), reports The Beaufort Gazette, a local newspaper.

The unidentified 14-year-old boy’s mother, Nicole Whitmore, said about half the students in the — also unidentified — science teacher’s Tuesday morning class at Battery Creek High refused to stand for the Pledge or recite it.

Whitmore told the Gazette her son announced to a friend that the patriotic, 31-word oath is irrelevant to him because “Donald Trump is going to send us back to Africa.”

According to the mad mom, the science teacher then shot back that the student should “go back to Africa.”

Whitmore describes herself as black and Puerto Rican.

The science teacher is white, she said.

“I didn’t take kindly to it, and my son didn’t take kindly to it,” Whitmore told the Gazette. “You don’t tell my son to go back to Africa knowing you’re a different color than he is. I’m Puerto Rican and black, I know what I went through. I don’t want my son going through anything discriminative.”

Whitmore noted that her son has refused to stand up for the Pledge of Allegiance or recite it since he was in the seventh grade. He has several reasons. Among them is his anger about South Carolina’s perpetual debate over the Confederate flag.

Whitmore and her son are also mad because they say Trump has denigrated recipients of food stamps. Whitmore, a full-time employee at a local Burger King, is food-stamp recipient.

School district officials say they are investigating the Tuesday incident, which apparently ended with the freshman serving some sort of punishment in a separate room.

“My son is 14 years old, a freshman at Battery Creek,” Whitmore told the Gazette. “This teacher is supposed to be an educator. He’s supposed to teach him better.”

School district noted that, since the Tuesday fracas, they have also admonished teachers that students don’t have to stand up for the Pledge of Allegiance, or recite it.

A 1943 Supreme Court case, West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, held that the Constitution protects students who don’t want to salute the American flag or say the Pledge of Allegiance in school. That case involved a student who belonged to the Jehovah’s Witnesses.

The Pledge of Allegiance is a source of frequent friction at America’s taxpayer-funded public school.

Last year, for example, several students at Pine Bush High School in the small town of Pine Bush, N.Y. expressed outrage at hearing the recitation of the Pledge in Arabic during routine morning announcements over the intercom on Wednesday. (RELATED: ARABIC Pledge Of Allegiance Recitation Causes Uproar At New York High School)

Also last year, officials with the New York City Department of Education blamed a principal’s incompetence for a ban on the Pledge of Allegiance — as well as Thanksgiving and Christmas — at a Brooklyn public school. The taxpayer-funded principal, Eujin Jaela Kim, came under fire after the New York Post exposed her as the instigator of a politically-correct policy outlawing the all-American triumvirate. (RELATED: NYC School System Blames Principal For Ban On Santa, Thanksgiving, Pledge Of Allegiance)

In 2013, a high school principal in a tiny town in western Nebraska outlawed the Pledge for a day because of the partial shutdown that caused some 17 percent of the federal government (and no part of Nebraska high schools) to cease functioning. One kid stood up in class and said the oath anyway, according to his proud mother. (RELATED: High School Principal Bans Pledge Of Allegiance Over Government Shutdown)

The month before, on the 12th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks, the principal at Concord-Carlisle High School in the suburbs of Boston read a Muslim poem to the entire school instead of the Pledge of Allegiance. He later apologized. (RELATED: Sept. 11, 2013: A Muslim Poem But No Pledge Of Allegiance At Boston-Area High School)

"‘Third World Liberation Front’ Students Stage Hunger Strike, Demand $8 MILLION For Ethnic Studies","A quartet of students at taxpayer-funded San Francisco State University who call themselves the “Third World Liberation Front 2016” have gone on a hunger strike this week until. They have vowed not to eat until administrators provide the school’s College of Ethnic Studies with $8 million in funding.

The four students — Hassani Bell, Julia Retzlaff, Sachiel Rosen and Ahkeel Mestayer — began their hunger strike on Monday, reports The San Francisco Examiner.

They met in San Francisco State’s Malcolm X Plaza — just outside the Cesar Chavez student center — and marched their way around campus to the administration building, protesting prospective tuition increases as they went. About 100 supporters showed up to encourage the hunger strikers.

Once at the administration building, the four students demanded that SFSU president Leslie Wong bankroll the College of Studies with a cool $8 million so it can “not only sustain itself but thrive.”

The big-picture problem is that SFSU’s College of Ethnic Studies has run out of money. School officials have agreed to provide a $200,000 cash infusion for the college to stay afloat.

Obviously, $200,000 is not enough for the students representing “Third World Liberation Front 2016.”

Along with faculty members and other students, they insist that the ethnic studies program will soon be forced to lay off professors, drastically cut courses and discontinue graduate program without a very large infusion of taxpayer largesse.

The College of Ethnic Studies boasts an annual budget of at least $3.5 million per year.

The four hunger-striking students want $8 million in public funds because, they say, that amount would make the College of Ethnic Studies whole again — as it was back in 2009, a magical time before SFSU began experiencing financial problems.

“I’m upset,” Mestayer, the hunger striker who originally conceived the idea not to eat in exchange for $8 million, told the Examiner. “I feel that the administration does not take students seriously.”

Mestayer added that he believes the school is not doing enough to promote social justice.

San Francisco State provost Sue Rosser has noted that every college and department at the public school has faced funding shortages since 2009.

“I have concerns about the health and welfare of these students,” Rosser told the San Francisco daily. “I can only reiterate that we are not cutting the budget of Ethnic Studies, as we have said repeatedly.”

“We don’t have $8 million,” she added.

Nevertheless, the four students are optimistic.

“Hopefully it doesn’t have to last too long,” Bell, another of the hunger strikers, told the Examiner.

The “Third World Liberation Front 2016” has a list of 10 total demands. The demands include adding a graduate advisor to the school payroll and enlarging the College of Ethnic Studies resource center.

The name “Third World Liberation Front 2016” appears to be a tribute to the 1968 version of the Third World Liberation Front, a coalition of several radical organizations at San Francisco State including the Black Students Union and El Renacimiento, a Mexican-American group. The original coalition led a series of demonstrations that prompted school officials to establish SFSU’s College of Ethnic Studies — America’s first.

Among the members of the original Third World Liberation Front was Richard Aoki, a Japanese-American activist who provided the Black Panther Party with weapons and weapons training prior to a shootout between Black Panthers and Oakland police, according to The Huffington Post.

Aoki, a member of the Black Panthers, wasn’t all bad, though. Records from the Federal Bureau of Investigation show he was also a longtime FBI informant.

San Francisco State is a notorious hotbed of leftist activism. (RELATED: The 13 Most Rabidly Leftist, Politically Correct Colleges For Dirty, Tree-Hugging Hippies)

The school most recently made headlines over a viral video showing a black woman on campus verbally badgering a white student for “cultural appropriation.” The woman was mad that the student had dreadlocks. She threatened to cut off the guy’s dreads with scissors. The woman has been identified as an SFSU employee. (VIDEO: Woman Gets In White Student’s Face For Having Dreadlocks)

Restaurant Fires Employees Who Refused Police Officer Service,"Management at a Noodles & Company restaurant in Alexandria, Virginia fired two unidentified employees Thursday who refused service to a uniformed female police officer.

The initial incident unfolded Monday night when a cook came out of the kitchen, pointed at the officer and said they would not serve her. The officer said the employee also made a joke she could not hear and laughed at her along with a cashier. The restaurant released a brief statement Tuesday saying that after conducting an internal review they would take the appropriate actions, reports WJLA.

“You’re going to have to take me off the line, I ain’t serving that,” the unidentified employee allegedly said to the cashier in the store, according to a police union representative.

Management announced Thursday they fired the employees in question and issued a statement decrying discrimination.

“Discrimination of any kind is never tolerated at Noodles & Company,” the statement read. “After completing a thorough investigation into the allegations brought to us by a police officer who visited our Alexandria, VA location, we have concluded the two team members in question acted inappropriately and we immediately terminated their employment. The views and actions of these individuals are in no way reflective of the Company or team at our Alexandria location.”

Alexandria Committee of Police Vice President Peter Feltham and Police Chief Earl Cook met with the manager at the restaurant Tuesday, who apologized for the actions of his employees. He also reportedly agreed to post signs reading “We Support Blue Lives” on the restaurant’s doors.

The company also released a statement Thursday personally apologizing to the Alexandria Police Department.

“We have the utmost respect for law enforcement officials and value the relationship we have built with the local Alexandria Police Department over the years,” read the statement.

Officials with the Alexandria Police Department are pleased with the response from management and stated they do not think the actions of the two employees are representative of the community.

Doctors Without Conscience: Group Refused To Negotiate As ISIS Chief Raped And Killed Kayla Mueller,"Doctors Without Borders had the opportunity to help negotiate the release of American ISIS hostage Kayla Mueller, but left her to be raped and killed by Islamic State leader Abu Bakr Al-Bagdadi.

“I don’t think there was a moral responsibility,” Jason Cone, a U.S. Doctors Without Border’s spokesman told ABC News when confronted. “We can’t be in the position of negotiating for people who don’t work for us.”

Mueller was a humanitarian activist who worked in Southern Turkey assisting Syrian refugees. She traveled to Aleppo, Syria, for a single day along with her boyfriend to help install some Doctors Without Border’s equipment. She was not part of an official Doctors Without Borders delegation, but was abducted by ISIS from one of the non-profit’s vehicles after departing Aleppo on August 3.

Mueller eventually made her way to an ISIS safe house where she was made to be Bagdadi’s personal sex slave. Bagdadi reportedly Mueller upon her arrival, “I am going to marry you by force and you are going to be my wife. If you refuse, I will kill you.”

A freed ISIS hostage, who shared a cell with Mueller, described one instance to CNN in which her and Mueller, “were completely black from the beating. They beat us with everything: cables, belts and wooden sticks.”

Meanwhile Mueller’s parents were trying to secure her release and contacted any organization they thought could assist them. Mueller’s parents told ABC News Doctors Without Borders refused to speak with them, even though they were negotiating the release of seven of their personnel from ISIS. The organization even refused to speak with an FBI case agent trying to facilitate Mueller’s release.

Chris Voss, a retired FBI hostage negotiator who secured U.S. citizen’s release from Iraq, told ABC News, “They could’ve said, ‘Yes, you work for us.’ And they could’ve extended her some sort of protection, some sort of legitimacy that would’ve cost them nothing. And why they leave her out there like that? It’s frightening. It scares me.” Voss elaborated “I think that’s totally abandoning someone that you had no reason to abandon. I mean, it sets that person up for incredibly negative, horrific consequences.”

Alan Dershowtiz, a Harvard Constitutional Lawyer and international law expert, told the Daily Caller News Foundation in November 2015 he regards Doctors Without Borders as “Doctors Without Morals.”

Mueller’s mother told ABC News on Friday “They’re a fabulous organization, and they do wonderful work,” adding “but somewhere in a boardroom, they decided to leave our daughter there to be tortured and raped and ultimately murdered.”

Mueller’s mother learned of her death in 2015 when she received an email from ISIS with three pictures of Mueller’s bruised corpse.

Classy! Ann Coulter Refused To Tell This Hillary Clinton Joke During Rob Lowe’s Comedy Central Roast,"Ann Coulter refused to tell a joke about Hillary Clinton having a penis during Comedy Central’s roast of Rob Lowe.

Mike Lawrence — a professional comedian who helped those invited to Lowe’s roast write their jokes — revealed the quips he wrote that Coulter turned down. (RELATED: Ann Coulter Booed And Heckled During Her Time At The Mic For Rob Lowe’s Roast)

These are the jokes Coulter reportedly turned down:

“I have to say, Rob, it’s nice to finally not be the most hated person in the room.”

“Peyton Manning [a fellow roaster on the show] is a model citizen and his forehead is a model for the wall that Trump’s going to put between the U.S. and Mexico.”

“Ralph Macchio’s [another roaster] first ever credit was in the movie ‘Up the Academy,’ playing a character called Chooch Bambalazi. Are you serious? Even Donald Trump thinks it’s too racist to call a wop Chooch Bambalazi.”

“That would be like if Jeff Ross’ first credit was a character named Mosha Gefilte Fish Streisand Ziegmillianberg. And before you ask, Jeff, I wouldn’t fuck you with Hillary Clinton’s dick.”

“Rob Lowe is like America: He hasn’t been great since Reagan was president and unemployment is becoming more and more of a problem for him.”

“Giving you a roast is the worst decision Comedy Central’s made since they replaced Jon Stewart with a South African child. That’s a Trevor Noah joke, the one immigrant I’m most excited to see deported. Am I white, people? Am I white?” (RELATED: Ann Coulter Left Speechless After Being Mercilessly Destroyed During Rob Lowe’s Roast)",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2016/09/06/ann-coulter-refused-to-tell-this-hillary-clinton-joke-during-rob-lowes-comedy-central-roast/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjCl-yDgLT9AhVPFVkFHY6SBy04ZBAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw1Gbh7led2dOZ4hjZmHFPAq,2016-09-06
"Woman Sues Police, Claims They Refused To Call Her A ‘Real Man’","A transgender man filed a lawsuit against two Houston police officers, claiming they wrongfully arrested her and made fun of her gender identity.

Kris Smith, a 38-year-old transgender man, sued the city and the two arresting officers for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment, reports the Houston Chronicle.

The lawsuit seeks up to $1 million in damages.

Smith, who says she was wrongfully arrested, alleged the arresting officers taunted her about her gender identity. When she asked to be taken to a woman’s jail because she feared going to a man’s, she claims that officers dismissed her request.

“They told me they don’t care if I [don’t] have a penis, they’ll put me in the guys’ side anyway,” she said.

She alleges that they said she’s not a “real man.”

Smith said officers handcuffed her, but did not not buckle her into the seat. As a result, she claims she suffered from a bruised nose, a swollen bicep and bruised and swollen wrists.

Smith claims she walked to the back of a Burger King to answer a phone call about a job. While there, she saw officers walk up to a homeless man. She turned away, only to have an officer call her over and then handcuff her.

The officer told Smith she was being arrested for trespassing, according to Smith. She says that the Burger King manager called the cops to get her off the property, but never asked Smith to leave in the first place.

Smith maintains that she wasn’t even on the property, but outside a small wall that surrounded the property.

Harris County District Attorney spokesman Jeff McShan said there was a sworn statement from authorities saying that the manager called them because Smith had been panhandling and drinking beer.

The statement also alleges that the manager did ask Smith to leave after she saw her panhandling in the drive through line.

The charges were later dropped against Smith after the manager did not show up in court.

EXCLUSIVE: Black Congressmen Refuse To Condemn Ellison’s Past Proposal For A ‘Black State’,"WASHINGTON — Several Democratic members of the Congressional Black Caucus refused Tuesday to denounce Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison’s call for a black state. One congressman stated, “I don’t see anything really objectionable.”

The Daily Caller News Foundation recently reported on columns Minnesota Rep. Ellison wrote under a pen name while in law school. In one of them he called for a black state in southeastern American states.

Under the name Keith E. Hakim, Ellison wrote: “Finally, blacks would have the option of choosing their own land base or remaining in the United States. Since black people toiled most diligently in the southeastern section of the United States, this land, quite naturally, would be most suitable. That means Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi. Blacks, of course, would not be compelled to move to the black state, and, of course, peaceful whites would not be compelled to move away.”

The Daily Caller reached out to Ellison’s office to ask if he still believes in these ideas and received no response. TheDC showed or read to multiple black Democrat congressmen this quote from Ellison and asked them what they thought about it.

Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson said: “I don’t see anything really objectionable. What he apparently proposed was a partitioning of the United States into a southeastern section.”

When asked if what Rep. Ellison proposed was black nationalism, Johnson said, “I don’t know what to call it. It seems to have been born out of academia, a thoughtful discussion on possibilities.”

“These are not ideas that have not been discussed by black folks throughout history,” Johnson added. The Georgia congressman said that while he is not in support of these ideas now, “there was a time when I would have been.” Johnson told TheDC that time was when he is college.

Other congressmen were not as outspoken as Johnson about Ellison’s past writing. Georgia Rep. John Lewis said: “I don’t know what condition he wrote it in, so it’d be hard for me to comment. But many years ago there was other groups suggesting that there was some part of America that would be like a homeland or a state or something.”

The Georgia Democrat said he wouldn’t comment on whether Ellison would have to denounce these comments. While Rep. Lewis said previous groups espoused similar ideas for a black state, the New Black Panther Party currently supports it.

The group’s co-leader proposed an idea very similar to Ellison’s. He said that African-Americans should claim a “black nation” in “Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Alabama, and Georgia.” Ellison’s black state would be in Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi.

Other black Democratic congressmen TheDC spoke to at the nation’s capitol refused to comment on Ellison’s writing. Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson said he would need to read the whole article by Ellison before he could comment, as the two paragraphs calling for a black state could have been taken out of context.

Indiana Rep. Andre Carson looked over Ellison’s writing for multiple minutes and still refused to comment. Missouri Rep. Lacy Clay also refused to comment when told Rep. Ellison supported a black state when he was a law student.

TheDC read out Ellison’s writing to Congressional Black Caucus chairman North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield as he walked to his car. Butterfield responded, “I have to find out if he said it. It doesn’t sound like Keith Ellison to me.” TheDC informed Rep. Butterfield that it was indeed Ellison who wrote the column, Butterfield then said he had to go and climbed into his car.

Rep. Ellison has declared his candidacy for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee. He has been endorsed by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2016/11/30/exclusive-black-congressmen-refuse-to-condemn-ellisons-past-proposal-for-a-black-state/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiX-Zj__7P9AhVILVkFHWaFCU04HhAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw3XEkxEcvfgI0DDCoL0_W-p,2016-11-30
Gillibrand’s Lone Vote Against Mattis Confirmation Explained,"Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand reaffirmed her opposition to confirming James Mattis as secretary of defense Thursday, voting against the recommendation of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, according to reports.

The committee voted 26-1 to recommend the Senate approve Mattis, who is considered to be one of President-elect Donald Trump’s more popular nominees with both Democrats and Republicans. Gillibrand’s vote reaffirms her long-running stance that a civilian should be in charge of the military.

A staffer with the senator’s office told The Daily Caller News Foundation that Gillibrand’s opposition is not because of Mattis’ background specifically.

“As Senator Gillibrand has stated repeatedly, her decision is not about General Mattis’ background, but rather her belief that a civilian should lead the military,” Marc Brumer, a spokesman for the senator, told TheDCNF.

Gillibrand outlined her stance against the Mattis nomination in a speech on the Senate floor last Thursday before Congress approved a waiver allowing Mattis to head the Pentagon. U.S. law states a former military officer must wait seven years before they are allowed to serve as secretary of defense, unless a waiver is passed.

“Now, overwhelmingly the senators [and] members of the armed services committee, me included, have expressed enormous gratitude for the extraordinary service of General Mattis, that is not in debate,” said Gillibrand. “But if there is no civilian, in all the world, as of today in this moment, who can meet the needs of the incoming administration, then who is to say that there will be no civilian in the future who can meet the needs of this administration, should they need another secretary of defense, or the next administration?”

As a member of the committee, Gillibrand has pushed for reform in laws governing sexual assault crimes, arguing that special outside prosecutors should handle the cases. Mattis pushed back against the reforms, and believes the authority should rest with commanding officers.

Brumer told TheDCNF in December that the disagreement is not the basis for Gillibrand’s opposition.

Trump Fires Acting AG Who Refused To Enforce Refugee Order,"President Donald Trump dismissed acting Attorney General Sally Yates on Monday night, after she ordered government lawyers not to defend his executive order on refugees.

In a brazen act of defiance that cost her the post, Yates said she could not enforce a policy that is not “wise or just.” Yates is an Obama-appointee who was serving as acting AG pending the confirmation of Sen. Jeff Sessions.

“The acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s office said in a statement. “This order was approved as to form and legality by the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel.”

“It is time to get serious about protecting our country. Calling for tougher vetting for individuals traveling from seven dangerous places is not extreme. It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country,” the statement added.

The president has designated Dana Boente, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as acting AG in the interim.

“I am honored to serve President Trump in this role until Senator Sessions is confirmed,” Boente said in the statement. “I will defend and enforce the laws of our country to ensure that our people and our nation are protected.”

The Federal Vacancies Act authorizes the president to replace one Senate-confirmed officer with another, as professor Josh Blackman of South Texas College of Law explains on his blog. Boente was confirmed as U.S. attorney by the Senate in 2015.

Trump Administration Fires Prominent Obama-Era Attorney Who Refused To Resign,"The Trump administration fired prominent U.S. attorney Preet Bharara Saturday, after he refused to step down as requested Friday in a Department of Justice sweep of all remaining Obama-era attorneys.

Bharara was blindsided by the letter asking for his resignation Friday, because of explicit assurances from both President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he would be asked to stay on through the transition, reports CNN. He did not send in his letter Friday, and told associates he had no plans to do so over the weekend, sources told The New York Times.

The refusal prompted the administration to fire him outright.

“I did not resign,” Bharara tweeted Saturday afternoon. “Moments ago I was fired. Being the US Attorney in SDNY will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life.”

Bharara has a reputation for aggressively and successfully going after banks and Wall Street insiders, and is finishing up an investigation into New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, as well as reportedly continuing an investigation into the way Fox News handled settlements of sexual harassment claims by some of its employees. He was also about to start trials of two former aides to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

The Justice Department’s move to clear out attorneys from the former presidency has become custom in recent transitions, so it’s not particularly surprising. Former Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton each dismissed about 90 attorneys in the early months of their presidency. Many of the Obama-era attorneys have already resigned, but Sessions asked the remaining 46 appointed prosecutors to leave their post in the letter Friday, including Bharara.

“Been in the works for awhile,” a senior administration official told Politico, referring to the letter sent Friday. “Decided to pull the trigger today. We were always planning for it on about Day 50.”

"VA Kept Child Molester On Payroll, Rehired A Killer After He Got Out Of Prison","A Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital held a job open for its accountant while he served a prison term for killing a man, and also hired a convicted child molester and then kept him on the rolls as a health aide while he repeatedly reoffended, The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Investigative Group has learned.

Kevin Kenja Campbell, the health aide, pleaded guilty to felony sexual abuse of a minor in 2002, according to court records reviewed by TheDCNF. He was later hired at the Anchorage, Alaska, VA. Multiple employees of the hospital said he was subsequently arrested for stabbing a man with a bottle while skipping work, and that the department kept him on the payroll while he went back to jail.

Court records show that in 2001, Campbell was charged with harassment and family violence, and assault in January 2004. He pleaded guilty to DUI in November 2004. He was charged with failing to register as a sex offender in 2005 and in 2009 with an alcohol offense.

He was charged in April 2013 with another incident of family violence and pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was found guilty of violating the conditions of his release. He was charged in October 2013 with DUI and leaving the scene of a crash, and pleaded guilty to refusing taking a breath test.

In January 2015, he was charged with family violence yet again for assault in the presence of a child, and pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct. In February 2015, he was charged with felony assault, drug possession, and failure to register as a sex offender. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault in 2016 to resolve that case.

Campbell could not be reached for comment. VA spokesman Randy Noller refused to provide the dates of Campbell’s employment, but said he is not a current employee. Federal pay records show he drew a salary between at least the years 2010 through 2015.

Noller said the convicted killer, Michael N. Alvin, is still on the government payroll. Alvin works as head accountant at the same federal hospital, which held his job for him while he was in prison and promoted him after his release.

The VA employee union local president at the time, Kevin McGee, admitted to intervening to make it happen. “I said give him a chance, why not,” McGee told TheDCNF. Managers of the VA facility acquiesced.

Alvin “left a man for dead that he hit while driving drunk,” said Tammy Schuyler, who replaced McGee as union president. Another employee said Alvin was unrepentant: “He’s as arrogant about it as anyone I’ve ever met. Not ashamed that he killed a guy.”

Noller said “Mike Alvin worked for the Alaska VA HCS as an account technician from 1995-1996, and as a civilian pay technician from 2000-present.”

Court records show Alvin was charged with manslaughter in 1996 and took a plea deal that resulted in a conviction for criminally negligent homicide. He was released by 2000, but in 2003, prosecutors accused him of violating his probation.

In addition to working as an accountant for the Anchorage VA, Alvin served as vice president of the local American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) union and also operated a side firm that did the union’s taxes. The union was faulted for tax problems and its president, McGee, was convicted of fraud. But the VA did not fire McGee.

The Department of Labor says federal law provides that “conviction for several types of crimes will bar a person from serving [as a union officer], including but not limited to the following examples: Generic criminal offenses; specifically, murder, assault with intent to kill, assault that inflicts grievous bodily injury, rape, arson, extortion, burglary, grand larceny, robbery, bribery, embezzlement” and “any crime that is equivalent to the above crimes … The bar ends 13 years after conviction.”

AFGE union spokesman Tim Kauffman had no response when provided with records documenting Alvin’s conviction and his union role less than 13 years later. Alvin did not respond to a request for comment.

Schuyler told TheDCNF, “Alvin is one of two payroll technicians (the ‘lead’ at that) at the AK VA with access to complete information on every employee to include their full name, social security number, address, grade, payroll deductions, leave balances, etc. Yes, a convicted, dishonest felon with access to confidential information on every AK VA employee.”

Noller didn’t acknowledge any bad hiring judgment, simply saying it “operated within the confines of OPM policies and guidance and complied with federal regulations and hiring practices.”

The VA’s current union contract requires the department give priority to current or former federal employees, including those previously fired–even over veterans–when filling many jobs.

The department employs numerous child molesters, rapists and kidnappers, but justified the practice by saying only those who have turned their lives around are hired. Three sex offenders currently being sought by the local police list the Detroit VA as their work address, but a spokesman for that facility refused to provide information, citing federal employee rights.

The VA has spent significant sums on its “ICARE” initiative, convincing veterans that it accepts only employees who “care about choosing ‘the harder right instead of the easier wrong.’”

AFGE has kept workers charged in deaths on the government payroll with little pushback from management, including Fredrick Kevin Harris, who collected a check from his jail cell while awaiting manslaughter charges in the beating death of an elderly veteran.

The VA contended the death was an accident, but witnesses, the coroner and prosecutors all found clear evidence otherwise.

EXCLUSIVE: Feds Wouldn’t Prosecute NASA Intern Caught Downloading Kiddie Porn,"An intern was caught downloading child pornography at NASA, but officials let him continue working until he was arrested in an agency office a month later, according to documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation’s (TheDCNF) Investigative Group.

Federal attorneys decided not to prosecute Arthemuel Panes Hernaez, despite his possessing around 1,000 pornographic images of children. Hernaez was later prosecuted in a local court but was only sentenced to four months in county jail after the judge feared a longer stretch could cost Hernaez his NASA internship. (RELATED: The EPA PAID A Child Molester To Retire)

A federal investigator discovered “that a NASA intern was downloading child pornographic material onto his personal laptop” on Dec. 5, 2014, according to a NASA Inspector General (IG) report TheDCNF obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.

Hernaez allowed investigators to search his laptop. They “confirmed the presence of images and videos on the computer that appeared to depict naked underage children engaged in sexually explicit conduct,” the report said. Investigators informed Hernaez that “he did not have to say anything and he was free to leave.”

“I made a mistake. I will never do it again. I have child porn. Why am I not getting arrested?” Hernaez told investigators. He confessed to downloading and viewing the porn and said he knew doing so was illegal.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California declined to prosecute Hernaez, but the reason was redacted from the IG report. An Assistant U.S. Attorney encouraged investigators to seek prosecution through the Santa Clara County, Calif., District Attorney’s Office. (RELATED: Feds Charge Postal Worker With Watching Kiddie Porn On The Job)

Hernaez was arrested at a NASA facility on Jan. 14, 2015 – one month after federal investigators caught him downloading child porn. He subsequently pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography and was sentenced to four months in county jail and three years of probation and was ordered to pay $1,930 in fines and fees. Hernaez was also required to register as a sex offender.

The judge was concerned that a longer sentence could cost Hernaez his NASA job, Santa Clara County Assistant District Attorney Terry Harman told TheDCNF. Prosecutors objected to the judge’s sentence and asked for a minimum of six months jail time.

“Four months is not out of the question, but six months to a year is the standard,” Harman told TheDCNF. “Four months is a bit out of range, for sure.”

Harman also noted that Hernaez would have likely faced a longer sentence had he been caught one month later.

“This incident for him occurred in December 2014. In January 2015, the law changed to where we can add enhancement if there were more than 600 images,” Harman said. “That would have applied to this guy, because this guy had about 1,000 imagines.”

Hernaez is not listed in the NASA Ames Research Center directory where he worked in 2015, according to NASA spokeswoman Jessica Culler. She did not answer additional questions by publication of this report.

U.S Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California spokesman Abraham Simmons could not find any public files regarding Hernaez, who could not be reached for comment.

Merkel Will Not Set Limit on Incoming Refugees,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced Sunday that she will not set a cap on the number of refugees migrating to Germany from North Africa and the Middle East, CNN reports.

“On the issue of an upper limit, my position is clear. I won’t accept one,” Merkel told Germany’s ARD

The refugee influx into Germany has been a hot-button issue, and could divide support for Merkel in the federal elections taking place in just two months.

Merkel’s coalition must be aligned with the more conservative party Christian Social Union in order for her to remain chancellor after the September elections. The CSU firmly believes a refugee limit is necessary, though it will refuse to make the issue a red line in potential coalition agreements.

“The [refugee] cap is and remains a goal of the CSU,” the party’s leader Horst Seehofer said in a statement Monday.

In December, however, Seehofer promised to let in no more than 200,000 refugees per year if the CSU has a majority coalition in the German government.

This is not the first rift to come between the two parties in the last month. In June, Merkel received backlash from the CSU after she changed her longtime stance against same-sex marriage, and permitted a parliamentary vote on the issue. A law was passed days later allowing full martial benefits to same-sex couples.

Merkel broke her accord with the CSU not to vote on the issue until after the September elections. Hans Reichhart, member of the regional parliament in Bavaria, southern Germany, commented on Merkel’s decision, “This agreement was broken.”

Concerns about the influx of refugees and migrants is by far the most pressing issue to German voters in the upcoming elections. According to German poll group Forschungsgruppe Wahlen, almost half of Germans surveyed on July 7 said refugees were the most important issue. It got more than three times as many responses as the second most mentioned issue, social inequality (14 percent).

In 2015, Merkel’s “open-door” refugee policy saw nearly a million migrants make their way into Germany. In 2016, the number declined, but was still over 300,000, according to the Guardian.

The next year, migrant crime rate rose by 50 percent, including a number of notable terrorist attacks in Germany committed by migrants.

In July of 2016, an axe-wielding Afghan migrant injured five on a train. The same month, a Syrian suicide bomber killed himself and injured 15 more. On December 19th, a Tunisian asylum seeker drove a truck into a market stand in Berlin, killing 12.

Whataburger Fires Employee Who Refused Service To Police Officers,"Whataburger quickly retaliated by firing a Texas employee after she hurled curses at two police officers and refused to serve them at a location just north of Dallas on Saturday.

Whataburger CEO Preston Atkinson personally called Denison Police Chief Jay Burch to apologize after two of Burch’s officers were refused service Saturday. Whataburger announced Sunday that the unnamed female employee had been fired. She had cursed at the pair of officers because her boyfriend had recently been arrested and “beaten up” by police, the San Antonio Express-News reported. When police reviewed footage of the man’s arrest, however, there was no evidence of any physical altercation.

“If a business does not want police officers as customers, just let us know.” Burch wrote in a post on the department’s Facebook page Saturday. “There’s no need to curse us and make a scene, just let us know you don’t want us there and we’ll go somewhere else.”

The police department initially tried to keep the problem local by speaking to the employee’s manager. The manager said there was nothing he could do, however, because he doesn’t get involved in politics, Express-News reported. It was then that Burch took to Facebook and alerted Whataburger corporate to the issue.

“We immediately launched an internal investigation when we heard these reports,” Whataburger Corporate Communications wrote in a release. “We took swift action and this person is no longer employed by us.”

No action was taken against the location manager.

“I was grateful for the apology but noted concern that as these incidents become more prevalent, apologies can be perceived as just a band-aid to a bigger problem,” Burch wrote. “Many persons responding to the incident called to boycott Whataburger. If Whataburger Corporation ignored the incident, then such an action may be called for but they have quickly and graciously responded.”

EXCLUSIVE: Navy Vet Who Refused NFL Award Over Anthem Protests Wants VA Not To Experiment On Animals,"A Navy veteran who refused an award from the New Orleans Saints over the national anthem protests is now calling for Congress to stop the Department of Veterans Affairs from experimenting on animals.

John Wells, a disabled Navy veteran who turned down the Peoples Health Champion award from the New Orleans Saints last week because he feels the award is tainted by anti-national anthem protests, wrote a letter to Congress Wednesday on behalf of Military Veterans Advocates, a veterans service organization he runs that focuses on Agent Orange exposure.

In the letter, Wells expressed support to Democratic Rep. Dina Titus and Republican Rep. Dave Brat, who have both pushed a bill called the PUPPERS Act, which prohibits the VA from conducting painful experiments on dogs.

“Right now, countless veterans are sick and dying because of harmful exposures to Agent Orange, burn pits and other toxins encountered within the scope of their military duties,” Wells wrote to the legislators. “Various legislative and other efforts to provide benefits, health care and research for these disabled veterans have been stymied, due in large part to cost concerns and VA intransigence.”

“While these veterans are suffering, the VA is expending significant time, money, staff, research space, and other resources to conduct and defend questionable dog experimentation that is opposed by most veterans, ineffective and has little to do with service-related disabilities,” Wells added.

Other veterans’ organizations have recently written similar letters of support to reinvigorate the bill, which is currently stuck in committee. VetsFirst, American Military Retirees Association and The Retired Enlisted Association signed a letter to Titus and Brat saying that they support efforts to end unproductive and painful research. But not all veterans’ organizations back ending this type of research. For example, The American Legion, Paralyzed Veterans of America and Disabled American Veterans have come out in support of dog research at the VA.

And back in September, when the debate reached its peak, VA Secretary David Shulkin wrote an op-ed in USA Today arguing for the necessity of animal research to help “unique conditions affecting our veterans.”

The fight over animal research and the PUPPERS Act is likely to continue.

Lindsey Graham Refused To Debate Stephen Miller On Tucker’s Show [VIDEO],"Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham declined Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s invitation to debate White House adviser Stephen Miller on his show, Carlson said Monday night.

Graham’s refusal to debate Miller, who accepted the debate invitation from Carlson, came after the senator called Miller an “extremist” on the subject of immigration.

“Over the weekend Senator Lindsey Graham announced that White House advisor Stephen Miller is an extremist on immigration. It is Miller’s fault he says that the Senate can’t work out a deal on DACA. He is in the U.S. Senate and Stephen Miller is not. Graham didn’t explain how miller was wrong, he just said he was extreme and should therefore shut up,” the Daily Caller co-founder said.

“We spoke to Stephen Miller and he’s perfectly willing to come on the show and debate Senator Graham directly about their differences on immigration. That would be fascinating, we would all benefit from that but Graham has refused. Why? The truth is that Lindsey Graham is the one with an extreme position on immigration,” Carlson continued. (RELATED: Lindsey Graham Wants Trump To Sign Bigger Amnesty Package Than Even Jeb Wanted)

“Nothing personal, but the numbers show it. The new Harvard Harris poll last week showed that 81 percent of Americans want immigration reduced below current levels, large majorities want skill-based immigration and an end to the diversity lottery and a more secure border.”

Graham, Carlson said, is “on the wrong side of the public on every one of those issues. He is literally an extremist. He is still welcome on the show anytime to explain himself. That invitation stands, as it always has.”

LIST: 5 Things Democrats Refused To Applaud During SOTU [VIDEO],"Democrats refused to stand during a number of key moments in President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, showing their disrespect for veterans, Americans receiving tax cuts and more.

WATCH:

We’ve compiled a list of the worst times Democrats chose not to stand for Trump’s speech.

1. The National Anthem

Trump touted the patriotism of a young boy named Preston who planted flags for veterans.

“Young patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans. Preston’s reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.”

2. ‘In God We Trust’

“In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life. Our motto is ‘in God we trust.'”

3. Tax Cuts

“And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.”

4. Record Low In Black Unemployment

“Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.”

5. Veterans

“And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions. Last year, the Congress passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act.”

Black Caucus Members Refuse To Denounce Hate Group Leader Louis Farrakhan,"Twenty-one members of the Congressional Black Caucus facing questions about their ties to Nation of Islam chief Louis Farrakhan have all refused to condemn the hate group leader.

The CBC, it was recently revealed, held a secret meeting with Farrakhan in 2005 but hid it from the public to avoid controversy. Twenty-one members of the caucus today were part of the caucus at the time of the secret Farrakhan meeting. All 21 declined to denounce Farrakhan when asked by The Daily Caller.

The Nation of Islam is so extreme that even the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center recognizes it as a hate group, citing the group’s “theology of innate black superiority over whites and the deeply racist, anti-Semitic and anti-gay rhetoric of its leaders.” (RELATED: John Lewis Claims Trump’s’‘DNA’ Makes Him Racist [VIDEO])

Farrakhan has praised Hitler, claimed Jews are “Satantic” and said that white people “deserve to die,” among other racist and anti-Semitic statements.

The 21 CBC members, all Democrats, include high-profile Trump critics like Maxine Waters and Al Green, who have long demanded the president’s impeachment.

Both Waters and Green are on tape hugging Farrakhan in 2006, a year after the CBC’s secret meeting with the hate group leader. The videos of Waters and Green resurfaced in a Wall Street Journal column following the publication of a photo of former President Barack Obama smiling with Farrakhan at the 2005 meeting. (RELATED: Journalist Suppressed Obama-Farrakhan Photo For 13 Years)

One veteran CBC member, Illinois Rep. Danny Davis, praised and defended Farrakhan in a phone interview with TheDC. Davis described Farrakhan as “an outstanding human being” and said “it wouldn’t be anything out of the ordinary” for him to meet with Farrakhan.

“I personally know [Farrakhan], I’ve been to his home, done meetings, participated in events with him,” Davis told TheDC.

“I don’t regard Louis Farrakhan as an aberration or anything, I regard him as an outstanding human being who commands a following of individuals who are learned and articulate and he plays a big role in the lives of thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of people,” Davis said.

The other 20 CBC members contacted by TheDC declined to comment on Farrakhan, as did a spokesperson for the CBC.

"DNC Refused To Comply With Dossier-Related Subpoena, So BuzzFeed Sued","BuzzFeed News sued the Democratic National Committee (DNC) Tuesday to force the release of information that the news outlet hopes will help it defend against a lawsuit related to the Steele dossier.

BuzzFeed is seeking digital information that could shed light on the cyber attacks against the DNC during the presidential campaign.

The news outlet faces three separate lawsuits related to its publication of the dossier, which was written by former British spy Christopher Steele and financed by the Clinton campaign and DNC.

The suit against the DNC seeks information that could help defend against a defamation lawsuit filed by Aleksej Gubarev, a Russian tech executive accused in the dossier of using his web hosting companies to hack into the DNC’s computer systems.

Gubarev denies the allegations and has argued that BuzzFeed failed to verify the dossier before publishing the report in January 2017. Steele, a former MI6 officer, has acknowledged in a London court, where he is being sued by Gubarev, that the information about the tech executive had not been verified.

“As part of the discovery process, BuzzFeed is attempting to verify claims in the dossier that relate to the hacking of the DNC,” BuzzFeed spokesman Matt Mittenhal said in a statement. “We’re asking a federal court to force the DNC to follow the law and allow BuzzFeed to fully defend its First Amendment rights.”

BuzzFeed filed the suit after the DNC refused to comply with a subpoena that the website issued in November. DNC lawyers expressed concern that complying with the subpoena would put donor information and voter data at risk.

“If these documents were disclosed, the DNC’s internal operations, as well as its ability to effectively achieve its political goals, would be harmed,” DNC lawyers said last month in response to the BuzzFeed subpoena.

BuzzFeed says it only wants information on the “digital remnants left by the Russian state operatives” that hacked the DNC’s systems.

BuzzFeed also seeks a full version of a report compiled by CrowdStrike, a cyber security firm that the DNC hired to investigate the breach of its computer networks.

The lawsuit follows the revelation Monday that BuzzFeed has hired Anthony Ferranto, a former FBI agent and National Security Council official, to conduct an investigation to help verify the dossier. Ferranto, who left the White House last April to work at FTI Consulting, has been conducting interviews and gathering documents in a search for evidence that Gubarev was behind the DNC hack.

Aussie Diplomat Who Sparked Trump-Russia Probe Doesn’t Want To Talk About It,"The Australian diplomat whose barroom conversation with a Trump campaign adviser was the catalyst for the FBI’s collusion investigation is refusing to talk about the case, saying that discussing his involvement would be detrimental to the relationship between the U.S. and Australia.

During a Monday interview on Australian television, Alexander Downer, who served as Australia’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom until earlier this year, was asked for the first time publicly about his May 2016 conversation with George Papadopoulos.

That conversation, which occurred at Kensington Gardens in London, is said to have led the FBI to open its counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign. That’s because Downer reportedly claimed that Papadopoulos discussed Russians having dirt on Hillary Clinton. (RELATED: In Private, George Papadopoulos Denies Collusion)

“Did you meet with George Papadopoulos in the Kensington Wine Bar in May of 2016? And if so, what did he say to you?” host Ellen Fanning asked the diplomat.

“Well, let me be blunt about this,” Downer began. “Of course, it has been widely reported that I did. But I don’t think talking about it is going to help our relationship with the United States or make any contribution that will advance Australia’s interests.”

He went on to say that questions about whether Russia had a relationship with the Trump team are “a toxic issue in American politics.”

“I don’t think any of us really want to be dragged into that any more than we can help,” he continued, adding that he did not believe it was in Australia’s interests to be seen playing in American politics.

Downer also declined to say whether he has been contacted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible collusion involving the Trump campaign.

“It’s exactly the sort of question that I definitely wouldn’t answer,” Downer said when asked if he’s met with Mueller’s team.

Papadopoulos, 30, has pleaded guilty to Mueller’s prosecutors. On Oct. 5, 2017, he acknowledged that he lied to FBI agents about the timing of conversations he had with a Maltese professor and two Russian nationals.

Joseph Mifsud, the professor, told Papadopoulos during an April 26, 2016 meeting in London that he had been told by Russian government officials that Russia had “thousands” of Clinton emails. It is still not clear whether Papadopoulos told anyone on the Trump campaign about Mifsud’s claim. Sources close to Papadopoulos told TheDCNF that he believed that Mifsud was referring to the highly-publicized 30,000 emails that Clinton deleted from her private email server.

Though Papadopoulos has admitted lying about his encounters with Mifsud, sources close to the former Trump aide say that he is privately denying taking part in any collusion scheme.

Little is known about the Papadopoulos-Downer conversation, which was first reported by The New York Times at the end of December. Downer reportedly passed details of the conversation to other Aussie government officials. That information was passed to the FBI more than two months after the meeting. The bureau opened its counterintelligence probe on July 31, 2016.

The Daily Caller News Foundation recently reported that Papadopoulos was introduced to Downer through Erika Thompson, a diplomat with Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. She was with Downer and Papadopoulos during their visit to Kensington Gardens, which occurred on May 10, 2016.

Trump Refuses To Apologize For Muslim Ban,"President Trump refused to back down when a reporter asked Monday if he thought apologizing for previous statements about a “Muslim ban” might help his travel ban case currently before the Supreme Court.

“There’s no reason to apologize,” Trump said during joint press conference with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. “Our immigration laws in this country are a total disaster. They’re laughed at all over the world, they’re laughed at for their stupidity. And we have to have strong immigration laws. So I think if I apologize, wouldn’t make ten cents worth of difference to them. There’s nothing to apologize for.”

Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts brought up the issue of an apology during a SCOTUS hearing last week, asking an attorney challenging Trump’s travel ban if an apology or disavowal of some of Trump’s inflammatory comments would ease concerns about whether or not the current ban is constitutional, according to Politico.

While Trump arguably could have made his case easier, he instead chose to double-down.

“He’s not into apologizing,” a former administration official told Politico. “Generally speaking, he’s not a big believer in backing down.”

The travel ban policy currently under review is the Trump administration’s third attempt, and includes travel restrictions involving eight nations, including Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen. The ban against Chad was lifted earlier this month following that nation’s review of its immigration and security practices.

A final Supreme Court decision on the current policy is expected in June.

One former administration official called attempts to get Trump to apologize for his previous remarks a “political play.”

“They are trying to get Trump to say something everyone in the world knows he’s not going to do,” the official told Politico. “And, the fact of the matter is it’s not going to matter.”

"Portland Police Refused To Help ICE Agents Who Called 911, Agents Say","Portland, Oregon, police refused to respond to at least two 911 emergency calls from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) employees inside their offices where violent protesters held week-long demonstrations.

The National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, a union representing ICE employees, wrote a cease-and-desist letter to Mayor Ted Wheeler, asking him to ensure the police enforce the law equally and protect innocent people.

“Your current policy forbidding Portland law enforcement agencies from assisting employees of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency who request law enforcement assistance while at or away from work is a violation of the United States Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause,” the letter says.

Demonstrators, some affiliated with the domestic terrorist organization Antifa, set up a city of tents outside the ICE offices. After setting up camp, they became violent and incited violence several times.

“Every person in law enforcement knows there are few things as dangerous or as unpredictable than an angry mob,”said Chris Crane, president of the national union, WWeek reported Monday. “No one could have responded quickly enough to protect our employees who were trapped inside this building. All of this because the Mayor of Portland has a beef with the president of the United States.”

The activists were able to get the government to shut down the Portland ICE offices June 20, but were able to return to work July 3, The Daily Caller News Foundation reported.

The Occupy ICE camp was officially shut down July 25, after more than a month of demonstrations. They infected the area so much, the mayor called it a biohazard.

The activists were there protesting President Donald Trump’s enforcement of current immigration laws, many of which were in place since former President Barak Obama was in office. (RELATED: The Occupy ICE Protest Camp In Portland Has A Border Wall)

“We understand that you have a difference of opinion with the current President of the United States, and some of his policies, but we fail to see why targeting the employees of ICE and leaving them vulnerable to violence, harassment and even death furthers a legitimate government interest,” their lawyer, Sean Riddell, says in the letter. “Your policy has created a zone of terror and lawlessness.”

“We ask that you end your policy of not responding to calls for police services from ICE employees immediately,” the ICE union pleads in the letter to the mayor. “We would like to avoid federal litigation, but we are prepared to protect our membership and their families.”

Portland police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"Christopher Steele Dodged Congress’s Interview Requests, But Chuck Grassley Found A Solution","Christopher Steele dodged all requests to meet with Congress about his dossier.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley found a solution.

Lawyers for a Russian businessman suing over the dossier have agreed to provide Grassley with a deposition Steele gave in June.

A lawyer for a Russian businessman suing BuzzFeed News over the infamous Steele dossier says he will provide the Senate with a video of a deposition that Christopher Steele, the document’s author, gave as part of the BuzzFeed lawsuit in June.

Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the judiciary panel, asked Val Gurvits, a lawyer for Boston Law Group, to provide a transcript and video of a deposition that Steele gave in London on June 18 as part of a lawsuit against BuzzFeed in a July 25 letter.

Gurvits’s client, Aleksej Gubarev, is suing the media company for defamation for publishing the dossier. The 35-page document, which Steele wrote while working for the Clinton campaign and DNC, accuses Gubarev of being a Russian spy and using his web hosting companies of stealing information from the DNC’s computer systems. (RELATED: Russian Suing BuzzFeed Over The Dossier Calls Mueller Indictment An ‘Utter Vindication’)

BuzzFeed published the dossier on Jan. 10, 2017. Gubarev has accused the outlet of failing to investigate the dossier’s claims before publishing the report.

Gurvits tells The Daily Caller News Foundation that the Gubarev legal team plans to comply with Grassley’s request.

“My client has instructed me from the very beginning of this lawsuit to fully cooperate with all US government requests,” he said.

Congressional committees investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election have failed so far to interview Steele, a former MI6 officer based in London.

“It is my understanding that Mr. Steele has refused all Congressional attempts to interview him. Thus, this information is otherwise unavailable,” Grassley wrote to Gurvits.

Using a middleman in 2017, Steele sought to meet with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to discuss his investigation into the Trump campaign’s possible ties to Russian government officials. North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intel panel, recently said the committee has been unable to get an interview with Steele despite being in frequent contact with him.

The Senate Judiciary Committee is interested in finding out more about Steele’s contacts with the FBI and the FBI’s use of the dossier to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants to spy on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Grassley and his fellow Judiciary Committee member, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, have also referred Steele to the Department of Justice for investigation over what they claim are the ex-spy’s misleading statements to the FBI about his contacts with the media.

“The consistency of sworn descriptions of Mr. Steele’s dossier project and attendant media contacts is particularly relevant to the Committee’s inquiry,” Grassley wrote.

Steele, who is also being sued by Gubarev in the U.K., met with several American reporters in September and October 2016 to discuss his investigation of Trump. Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that hired Steele on behalf of the Clinton campaign and DNC, helped arrange the journalist briefings.

Steele revealed in a London court that he met with reporters from Yahoo! News, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The New Yorker, Mother Jones and CNN prior to the campaign.

The FBI cut ties with Steele just before the election after they found out he had contact with Mother Jones reporter David Corn. Corn published an article on Oct. 31, 2016, that cited an unnamed “Western intelligence source” who had compiled information about Trump campaign contacts with the Russian government. (RELATED: Senators: Substantial Evidence That Steele Misled FBI About The Dossier)

Grassley and Graham questioned whether Steele misled the FBI because the bureau’s FISA applications state that Steele denied having contact with the press. It is unclear when Steele offered the denial.

Though the FBI ended a longstanding relationship with Steele, he remained in contact with a Justice Department official named Bruce Ohr. Ohr, whose wife worked for Fusion GPS, gave 12 interviews to the FBI after the election to share information from his interactions with Steele.

“The Colorado civil rights division says [Phillips] has to bake it for them. And he doesn’t want to. Which is really funny,” Kimmel added. “Because this is a guy who spends all day, every day, meticulously designing flowers out of icing. His whole life is gay.”

WATCH:

Kimmel said Phillips might be worried about his own homosexuality coming out if he were to bake the cake and then made fun of his physical appearance.

“I don’t know if he’s worried the wrong cake might bring that to life or what. And I will add, this is Jack Phillips, the totally straight cake baker,” Kimmel continued. “You would think that someone who looks like the Reba McEntire version of Colonel Sanders would be more sympathetic to gender identity issues.”

Dems Threaten To Seize Trump’s Tax Returns If They Take The House,"Democrats are threatening to seize President Donald Trump’s often-requested tax returns if their candidates take the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections.

“I’m definitely going to bring it up if we don’t have them by then — that’s a definite,” Ways and Means panel member Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.), told The Hill.

The Democrats are arguing that legislation already exists to allow Congressional committees to seize a president’s tax returns. They say the Republicans have refused to utilize those powers, but if Democrats assume a majority in the House, they will be more than willing to do so.

Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), who also sits on the Ways and Means committee also told the Hill that a Democratic-controlled House would demand to see the tax returns.

“That’s part of cleaning up Washington, D.C.,” Chu said, referring to a central promise of Democrats on the campaign trail this year. “The appetite is there.”

However, others have banked on finding seismic revelations in Trump’s tax records in the past and been left looking foolish. In 2017, the New York Times claimed that the president had “could have avoided taxes for nearly two decades,” only to be struck dumb by the release of a 2005 Trump tax return that indicated he had paid $38 million in taxes on $150 million in income.

Trump maintains global business interests that include financial ties to 500 businesses.

University Of Michigan Denounces Professor That Allegedly Refused To Write Letter Of Recommendation,"A spokesperson for the University of Michigan denounced a professor who had allegedly refused to write a student a letter of recommendation because that student was planning on studying abroad in Israel.

“The academic goals of our students are of paramount importance. It is the university’s position to take all steps necessary to make sure our students are supported,” Rick Fitzgerald, a university spokesperson told The Daily Caller on Monday. “It is disappointing that a faculty member would allow their personal political beliefs to limit the support they are willing to otherwise provide for our students.”

He continued, “We will engage our faculty colleagues in deep discussions to clarify how the expression of our shared values plays out in support of all students.”

Fitzgerald did not definitively confirm the email was from Professor John Cheney-Lippold but issued the statement anyway.

Cheney-Lippold allegedly refused to write the letter for “Abigail,” because “many university departments have pledged an academic boycott against Israel in support of Palestinians living in Palestine. This boycott includes writing letters of recommendation for students planning to study there.”

Fitzgerald also refuted the professor’s alleged claim that school departments have made pacts to boycott Israel. “No academic department or any other unit at the University of Michigan has taken a position that departs from this long-held university position” of “consistently [opposing] any boycott of Israeli institutions of higher education,” he stated.

Cheney-Lippold did not respond to requests for comment.

"Democrats Refuse To Vote, Walk Out Of Judiciary Meeting On Kavanaugh Because It’s ‘So Unfair’","Two Democrats refused to vote on a motion to advance Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination, and multiple Democrats serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee walked out on the proceedings directly after the vote.

Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris refused to answer when they were asked to vote yay or nay on a motion to schedule a Kavanaugh vote for later in the day. When Booker’s name was called, he shook his head. Harris merely stared at Chairman Chuck Grassley with her hand on her chin.

“They are not answering because this is so unfair, Mr. Chairman,” their colleague Amy Klobuchar explained.

WATCH:

After the motion passed, confirming a 1:30 p.m. EST vote time for Friday, Harris, Connecticut Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Sheldon Whitehouse, and Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono left the room in protest. Harris tweeted soon after, “Moments ago I walked out of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Kavanaugh. This hearing is a sham and Dr. Ford and the American people deserve better.”

Trump Moves On From CNN Reporter Who Refused To Ask Question On Trade,"When a CNN reporter opted to ask President Donald Trump about Brett Kavanaugh instead of trade during a press conference touting the new trade deal reached between United States, Mexico and Canada (USMCA), Trump directed that the mic be given to another reporter.

The back-and-forth occurred during a press conference at the White House over a renegotiated NAFTA deal. Trump gave comments about how good the deal was and how difficult it was to negotiate, and about the “terrible” trade deals the country has entered into in the past.

Trump called on CNN White House reporter Kaitlan Collins, who began by saying, “Now that you’ve answered several questions on trade, I’d like to turn —”

Trump then interrupted Collins, formerly Daily Caller White House correspondent, saying, “Don’t do that. Excuse me. Do you have a question on trade? … Don’t do that. That’s not nice.”

The reporter persisted, saying, “You answered several questions on trade. My question is on Judge Kavanaugh. You said the FBI should interview [whomever] that they believe is appropriate. Does that include Julie Swetnick, the third accuser?”

“Excuse me, don’t do that. Do have a question on trade?” Trump asked. He then turned his attention to another reporter. “Give me a question, please. Give her the microphone, please.”

The CNN reporter handed the mic to a White House aide, who passed it to the other reporter, who asked about border wall funding.

Kyrsten Sinema Won’t Say If She Regrets Taliban Comment,"Democratic Arizona Senate nominee Kyrsten Sinema again declined to say if she regrets saying she would have no problem if Americans wanted to join the Taliban.

Sinema dodged saying whether she regrets the comment, which GOP Rep. Martha McSally compared to supporting treason.

Other radical elements of Sinema’s past have come back to haunt her campaign.

Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, her party’s nominee for Arizona’s seat in the U.S. Senate, declined to say whether she regrets saying she had no problem with Americans wanting to join the Taliban.

Audio from Sinema’s days as an anti-war activist in 2003 includes her saying, “I don’t care if you want to do that, go ahead,” when asked if she would object to Americans abandoning their country to fight with the Taliban.

Sinema was asked in an interview with the Arizona Republic’s editorial board Wednesday whether she regretted her past comments.

“I was opposed to that war in 2003, and 15 years later, that war is still going on and we’ve lost American lives,” Sinema said.

One of the Republic editors jumped in to ask whether Sinema was “just being glib” when she made the Taliban remark.

“That was an off-hand comment that was to direct the conversation back to what I wanted to talk about, which was my concerns about this war. I was against the war — 15 years later, I think there are good reasons for that,” she answered. (RELATED: PolitiFact Botched This Fact-Check About Kyrsten Sinema’s Pink Tutu)

“But you can see how that comment about the Taliban could be offensive to people on the ground?” asked one of the interviewers.

The congresswoman sidestepped that question and stressed the importance of “understanding the context in which that conversation occurred,” which she said was a “very difficult conversation.”

“I was really struggling to talk about what I wanted to speak about, so an off-hand comment to get us back on track was what I did to try to talk about the issue,” Sinema said. She did not apologize or express any regret over the comment.

WATCH:

Sinema’s campaign did not return a request for comment regarding her answer and whether she thinks it’s wrong for Americans to join the Taliban.

The congresswoman’s non-answers on Wednesday came two days after she avoided apologizing for the Taliban comment in Monday night’s debate with Rep. Martha McSally, the Republican candidate for Senate.

McSally, a former Air Force fighter pilot, said during the debate that Sinema’s comments amounted to supporting “treason.”

WATCH:

Sinema claimed during Wednesday’s interview that her critics were unfairly conflating her opposition to the war with opposition to the troops and noted that one of her brother is currently serving in the armed forces.

She did not mention that her anti-war group reportedly partnered with anarchists and witches and published flyers that depicted American soldiers as skeletons waging “terror” against women and children.

Other elements of Sinema’s political past have come back to haunt her campaign.

While serving in the Arizona state legislature, she raised concerns about getting rid of a loophole that allowed men caught with child prostitutes to use the child’s appearance as a defense to claim they were unaware the child was underage.

Sinema claimed it was “not fair” to get rid of the loophole, citing 12- and 13-year-old children she had seen who “look older than me.” However, she ended up voting in favor of an amended version of the bill, despite her concerns.

"Caravan Migrants Headed To US Refuse Mexico’s Offer For Schooling, Jobs And Much More","Caravan migrants heading to the U.S. have refused Mexico’s offer to receive refugee status that would provide schooling, jobs, medical care and shelter.

Thousands of migrants turned down Mexico’s President Enrique Pena Nieto’s program You Are In Your Home, The Associated Press reported Saturday. (RELATED: Another Huge Migrant Caravan Forms In Honduras With Aim Of Reaching US Border)

The program gives refugee status to those who apply and provide migrants access to shelter, medical attention, schooling and temporary employment opportunities to Central American migrants in the Chiapas and Oaxaca states, according to The AP.

“Our goal is not to remain in Mexico,” Oscar Sosa, 58, of Honduras told The AP. “Our goal is to make it to the (U.S).”

Those of working age would clean, repair and maintain infrastructure in the two southern Mexican states, according to the program. Migrants can also obtain Mexico’s version of a social security number called CURP (Clave Unica de Registro Publico). This will allow the migrants to have legal proof of identity, enter and leave shelters and open bank accounts.

The program came in response to the “unprecedented flow of people from Central American countries who have entered [into Mexico] the last few days,” according to the program’s press statement.

“The government of the Republic reiterates that the unrestricted commitment to the human rights or migrants does not mean an endorsement to irregular, massive and undocumented entry into Mexican territory, on the contrary it makes a new call to those who wish to enter Mexico, to avoid risks unnecessary and subject to the procedures that Mexican law establish,” a Ministry of the Interior press statement said.

While over 1,700 migrants applied for refugee status, thousands of migrants turned down the offer because they wanted to keep going North, according to The AP.

The migrant caravan of mostly Honduran migrants are hoping to receive asylum once they enter into the U.S. This is the second large group of migrants attempting to cross over in America in 2018 with a similar movement that occurred in April.

President Donald Trump called the migrant caravan a “National Emergency” on Thursday over Twitter.

The administration is considering to shut down the southern border due to national security risks.

"Trump Goes Off On Acosta, Who Refused To Hand Mic To Female Staffer","The tense relationship between CNN’s Jim Acosta and President Donald Trump reached a new level Wednesday in the president’s news conference after the 2018 midterms.

The often combative Acosta refused to give up the microphone after asking the president multiple questions and being told to sit down. A female White House staffer even attempted to pry the microphone away from Acosta, but he held onto it. The action drew Trump’s ire and the president went on a tirade about CNN and Acosta.

Acosta initially asked to “challenge” Trump on “the statements that you made at the tail end of the campaign in the midterms.”

Trump said, “Here we go.”

Acosta asked about Trump calling the migrant caravan an “invasion.”

Trump said, “I consider it to be an invasion.”

Acosta rebutted, “As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion. It’s a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S. … Why did you characterize that as such?”

“Because I consider it an invasion. You and I have a difference of opinion,” Trump said calmly.

“Do you think you demonized immigrants?” Acosta replied.

Trump said bluntly, “No, I want them to come into the country. But they have to come in legally. They have to come in, Jim, through a process. I want it to be a process. And I want people to come in. And we need the people.”

At that point, Acosta interrupted again and Trump cut him off. “Wait, wait. You know why we need the people? Because we have hundreds of companies moving in. We need to people.”

Acosta then challenged an ad the Trump campaign released featuring migrants climbing over gates and walls. “They were not actors,” Trump said, “They didn’t come from Hollywood.”

Acosta shot back again, “They are hundreds of miles away. That is not an invasion.”

WATCH:

Trump, showing frustration, raised his tone at Acosta, “Honestly I think that you should let me run the country. You run CNN. And if you did it well, your ratings would be much higher.”

Acosta asked for another question but Trump said, “That’s enough.”

At that point, a White House staffer attempted to grab the microphone, but Acosta held onto the mic and would not let her take it from him.

The staffer eventually relented as Acosta yelled about the Russia investigation.

“I am not concerned about anything with the Russian investigation, because it is a hoax. That’s enough. Put down the mic,” Trump said as Acosta kept shouting.

“I tell you what, CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person,” Trump said frustrated, “You shouldn’t be working for CNN. You are a very rude person. The way that you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible. And the way that you treat other people are horrible. You shouldn’t treat people that way.” (RELATED: ‘Trump Sends First Message Victorious Dems Wanting Investigations: ‘Two Can Play That Game!’)

White House reporter Peter Alexander eventually got the mic and came to Acosta’s defense. Trump said, “I’m not a big fan of yours, either, to be honest.” Acosta kept shouting through all of this until Trump shut him down saying, “Just sit down, please. When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.”

"Georgia Gubernatorial Candidate Stacey Abrams Admits She’ll Lose, But Doesn’t Concede The Race","Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams admitted that she will lose the race to Republican Brian Kemp — but still refused to concede — during a press conference Friday afternoon.

WATCH:

“I acknowledge that former secretary of state Brian Kemp will be certified as the victor in the 2018 gubernatorial election, but to watch an elected official who claims to represent the people in this state baldly pin his hopes for election on the suppression of the people’s democratic right to vote has been truly appalling, so let’s be clear. This is not a speech of concession, because concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true, or proper,” Abrams stated.

“As a woman of conscience and faith, I can not concede that, but my assessment is the law currently allows no further viable remedy,” she continued. “Now, I could certainly bring a new case to keep this one contest alive, but I don’t want to hold public office if I need to scheme my way into the post, because the title of governor isn’t nearly as important as our shared title, voters, and that is why we fight on and why I want to say thank you.”

Abrams has repeatedly accused Kemp and his office of suppressing minority voters because of the “exact match” voter ID law that flags voter registrations with any discrepancies from other official identification documents, which she reiterated during her non-concession concession speech. (RELATED: Here’s Exactly How Many Votes Andrew Gillum Gained After Dust Settled In Florida Recount)

Her admission comes after her campaign was reportedly considering filing a lawsuit that could have resulted in Georgia holding an entirely new gubernatorial election. Based on a provision of Georgia election law, Abrams would have been arguing that she lost based on “misconduct, fraud or irregularities … sufficient to change or place in doubt the results.”

Earlier on Friday, Kemp had 50.2 percent of the vote, which would be approximately 18,000 votes above the 50 percent threshold to avoid a runoff that’s already pre-scheduled for Dec. 4.

Had she filed this lawsuit she would have argued that had “misconduct, fraud, or irregularities” not occurred, Kemp would not have been able to reach the 50 percent mark to prevent the addition vote.

If Abrams had won, she would have been the first black female governor in the United States.

New Jersey University Squashes Students’ Hopes Of Bringing Chick-Fil-A To Campus Over Chain’s ‘Corporate Values’,"A New Jersey university is not bringing Chick-fil-A to its campus over the fast food chain’s “corporate values,” even though the restaurant was the students’ top pick.

Rider University surveyed students in the spring and asked which restaurants they wanted the school to bring to campus, Campus Reform reported Tuesday. Chick-fil-A was the top pick.

The school sent an email to students on Nov. 1, however, that told them Chick-fil-A’s “corporate values have not sufficiently progressed enough to align with those of Rider,” according to Campus Reform.

“There are a number of factors that contribute to a campus’ decision to invite a retail partner on campus,” Rider Assistant Vice President of Student Affairs Jan Friedman-Krupnick said, Campus Reform reported. “While Chick-fil-A is among other restaurants preferenced by Rider students, there are members of the community (faculty, staff, and students) who strongly opposed the option as well.” (RELATED: What This Chick-Fil-A Is Planning To Do With Its Employees During A Remodel Says Everything About What It Stands For)

Junior Julia Pickett did not think the decision was fair, according to Campus Reform.

“I think that the administration of Rider felt that having Chick-Fil-A on campus would cause unwanted controversy and felt that the easiest fix was to find another restaurant,” Pickett said, according to Campus Reform. “I wish they would be honest about it though instead of trying to cover it as a deep offense to the school.”

Chick-fil-A has been under fire since 2012 after CEO Dan Kathy defined marriage between a man and a woman. It was ranked the number one fast food restaurant for customer service in 2018 for the third year in a row.

Rider University did not immediately respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

‘Huge Red Flag’: Border Wall GoFundMe Founder Refuses To Answer Basic Questions About His New Nonprofit,"Triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage is refusing to answer basic questions about his new nonprofit organization that will use the funds raised by his viral $20 million GoFundMe to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Kolfage announced We Build The Wall, Inc. on Friday, but documents submitted to Florida reveal the nonprofit was created over two weeks ago in late December.

Kolfage is directing check donations to a separate organization, We Fund The Wall, Inc. with a PO Box in Houston; The Daily Caller News Foundation has been unable to find any record of its existence.

Charity Watch President Daniel Borochoff says Kolfage’s new nonprofit raises a “huge red flag.”

The founder of the viral $20 million border wall GoFundMe campaign is refusing to answer basic questions about his new nonprofit organization that will use donor funds to construct a piecemeal wall mile-by-mile along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage is asking donors to transfer their donations to We Build The Wall, Inc. following his announcement Friday that the federal government will not accept any funds from his viral fundraising campaign, despite his initial claim otherwise.

GoFundMe said Friday that donors will need to opt into transferring their donations to Kolfage’s new Florida-based nonprofit by April 10, when all remaining contributions will be automatically refunded.

Kolfage claims the bylaws of We Build The Wall, Inc. prevent him from taking any salary from donor funds that originate from GoFundMe. But Kolfage has refused to provide The Daily Caller News Foundation a copy of the nonprofit’s bylaws to corroborate his claim.

I thought it was pretty clear. I made a promise that I would NEVER take a penny 100% of fundraising through @gofundme donations will only go towards the wall, 100% means 100% right? Board won’t see any of that money! Donations will be accountable by an audit committee as well. — Brian Kolfage (@BrianKolfage) January 13, 2019

Kolfage’s statement omits the fact that he is now directing check donations to an entirely different organization, We Fund the Wall, Inc. with a PO Box in Houston.

Kolfage has ignored multiple inquiries from TheDCNF asking why he’s directing check donations to a separate organization based in a different state, and whether donations sent to We Fund the Wall, Inc. can be used to compensate him in any way shape or form.

It’s unclear how much money Kolfage has raised via check donations, but his tweets suggest it could be a substantial amount.

Furthermore, TheDCNF has been unable to find any record of We Fund the Wall, Inc.’s formal existence, and multiple inquiries requesting the organization’s founding documents have gone ignored.

Charity Watch President Daniel Borochoff told TheDCNF that raises a “huge red flag.”

“People should give right to the organization that they want to support. Why are they directing money to some other entity?” Borochoff said. “This money could get stolen or misdirected to be used for another purpose.”

“There could be some kind of misdirection of funds or something going on there that people might not be happy about,” Borochoff added. “They really need a good reason for doing that.”

Kolfage has also refused to address why he waited until Friday inform his donors about the existence of his new nonprofit organization, which was founded over two weeks ago on Dec. 28, according to Florida’s Division of Corporations.

The stated purpose for Kolfage’s nonprofit is: “funding, construction, administering, and maintaining a United States Southern Border Wall and the processes associated therewith,” according to its founding documents signed on Dec. 27.

This appears to show that Kolfage was aware the federal government would not be able to accept donations by Dec. 27 at the latest, but despite this, he knowingly raised $2.8 million on GoFundMe between that date and Friday, all the while telling donors that 100 percent of their donations would be handed over to the government for the purpose of funding a border wall.

Kolfage has ignored multiple inquiries asking why he waited over two weeks to inform his donors of his intention to transfer their contributions to his new nonprofit.

We are building the wall mile by mile for half the cost of what the government pays! It’s happening! This has been planned for weeks! IF you want your donation to count to our new mission you need to opt in here: https://t.co/sWaTOtc324@DeplorableChoir @RyanAFournier — Brian Kolfage (@BrianKolfage) January 11, 2019

“We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all the funds will go upon completion. When we get this information secured we will update,” Kolfage claimed at the onset of his fundraiser. (RELATED: Can The $13 Million GoFundMe For Trump’s Border Wall Actually Work?)

Kolfage now says his “highly experienced team is highly confident that we can complete significant elements of the wall in less time, and for less money, than the federal government.”

All contributions collected by Kolfage’s GoFundMe after Friday will be automatically routed to We Build The Wall, Inc., and Kolfage claimed Sunday that one-third of his 340,000 donors had already opted into the nonprofit.

Streisand, who is notorious for her absurd demands and drama behind the scenes, canceled a scheduled appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” because he wouldn’t film from a stipulated angle to show off the good side of her face. (RELATED: Barbra Streisand Rips Donald Trump)

Kimmel recounted the absurdity on “Watch What Happens Live” with Bravo’s Andy Cohen.

“If a guest wants you to swap around your set so the camera gets their best side, do you refuse? I’ve had to switch seats for Mariah Carey four times,” Cohen asked.

“I’ve had a guest ask for that and I said no,” Kimmel shot back.

When Cohen asked if that guest was Barbra Streisand, Kimmel responded, “Yes. It was the condition. The condition was that we couldn’t talk about that we’d switched around [our seats], and I was like, ‘I don’t see how that would work.'”

WATCH:

Streisand has fought hard to dispel rumors about her difficulty, claiming it’s an unfair label put on successful women.

“What does ‘difficult’ mean anyway?” she said in a 2015 interview with The Hollywood Reporter.

“If a man on a set says something — “I want to change this shot” — they do whatever he says. Now, if a woman asks…” she said, trailing off before getting too political.

Iranian Convert Refused Asylum By UK Because Christianity Is Too Violent,"An Iranian man applying for asylum to the U.K. had his application denied because he converted from Islam to Christianity.

According to a report from The Times, U.K. immigration officials wrote back to the man after he sent in his applications, explaining why they were discriminating against him. Immigration officials cited biblical passages from the books of Revelation and Leviticus. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Google VP Stepped In After Employees Offended By Christian Video On Marriage)

The Times reports:

Immigration officials wrote to the man citing violent passages from the Bible to prove their point. They said that the Book of Revelation was “filled with imagery of revenge, destruction, death and violence.”

According to the report, the immigration officials were condemned by the Church of England for their “lack of religious literacy.”

Iran is one of the most hostile countries in the world toward Christians. Last year, Iran arrested more than 100 Christians shortly before Christmas as the faithful were celebrating the birth of Jesus. (RELATED: Iranians Arrest Christians On ‘Blasphemy’ Charges)

Iran has also made a point to target pro-Israel Christians. In 2017, four Iranian Christians were arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison for “promoting Zionist Christianity.”

Arrests for vague crimes such as “blasphemy” are also frequently used by the theocratic state to target Christians.

Stacey Abrams Explains Why She Still Isn’t Conceding Her 2018 Election,"Failed gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams said she’s still refusing to concede her 2018 election defeat because doing so would be an admission that the “process was fair.”

“I run an organization that in 10 days, between election night and the night I refused to concede, we received more than 50,000 phone calls of people who were denied the right to vote,” Abrams, who lost her election in November 2018 by nearly 55,000 votes, said Monday on CBS. “I am complicit if I say that system is fair.”

The Georgia Democrat then hedged her claims somewhat, adding that she does not literally believe she’s occupying the Georgia governor’s mansion.

“I did not deny the legal sufficiency of the election. I am not claiming to be the governor of Georgia,” Abrams continued. “What I have said is that we won the battle of making sure more voices were heard because we had the highest record turnout in Georgia history for Democrats.”

The comments closely mirrored what the former Georgia House minority leader and romance novelist has long said since she lost her election to now-Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. Abrams has maintained, without evidence, that Kemp maliciously leveraged his former position as Georgia Secretary of State to suppress minority and Democratic voters in order win the 2018 gubernatorial election.

Abrams said as recently as Sunday that voter suppression is worse today than it was in the 1960s, presumably speaking of the era before Jim Crow laws were repealed.

“Over the last 20 years, we have seen numerous laws propagated that have eroded your ability to [exercise the right to vote], especially if you’re in a marginalized community — a community of color or from a community that is seen as less valuable to the Republican Party,” Abrams said about voter ID laws, updates to voter rolls, and other basic election regulations.

Despite Abrams’s claims that votes were vehemently suppressed, 2018 election turnout in Georgia reached a record high.

During the 2018 contest, 3.9 million Georgians went to the polls. This was a massive increase from the 2.5 million votes cast in the preceding midterm election in 2014. In fact, 2018’s midterm election in Georgia came close to the 4.2 million votes cast in the 2016 presidential election — midterm cycles historically see far lower turnout than presidential election years.

Abrams herself has extolled the massive turnout of African-Americans, Latinos, and other minorities seen in her state during her election, while simultaneously alleging a GOP conspiracy to block their votes took place.

“But the other thing to remember is, look, because there are more people in the water, that doesn’t mean there are fewer sharks,” Abrams said Monday, explaining the massive turnout in her state during November midterms. “You can have higher turnout, but that doesn’t diminish the fact that voter suppression is real and affecting people across the country.”

Abrams recently announced the launch of a new initiative: Fair Fight 2020. Her organization aims to monitor the election process in numerous battleground states during the upcoming presidential election.

CNN Falsely Reports Boris Johnson ‘Refused To Look At’ Picture Of Hospitalized Boy,"CNN reported Monday that U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson “refused to look at a photograph of” a young boy in a hospital, even though video of the event shows Johnson looking at the picture several times.

ITV News’ political correspondent Joe Pike tweeted out a video of his conversation with the prime minister Monday. Pike wrote that he showed Johnson a photo of a “4-year-old with suspected pneumonia forced to lie on a pile of coats on the floor” of a hospital, and that the prime minister took his phone and put the phone in his pocket.

“Boris Johnson grabbed a reporter’s phone and refused to look at a photograph of a four-year-old boy with suspected pneumonia, forced to lie on a hospital emergency room floor as he waited for a bed,” CNN reporter Amy Woodyatt wrote. “Johnson repeatedly refused to look at the photo when asked to, and then grabbed the journalist’s phone and pocketed it.”

Pike’s video clearly shows Johnson looking at the phone several times after he briefly puts it in his pocket as he finishes his speech. The video is included in CNN’s article. (RELATED: News Outlets Still Peddling CNN’s Debunked Sciutto Russia Story)

CNN declined to comment on the record to the Daily Caller News Foundation.

CNN’s headline also suggests that the video shows Johnson dodging Pike’s question. It reads, “Boris Johnson takes reporter’s phone and dodges question on shocking emergency room picture.” The video, however, includes a segment where Johnson talks about the situation.

“I’m sorry,” Johnson says as he takes Pike’s phone out of his pocket and looks at the picture. “It’s a terrible, terrible photo, and I apologize obviously to the families and all those who have terrible experiences in the NHS [National Health Service]. But, what we are doing is supporting the NHS and on the whole I think patients in the NHS have a much, much better experience than this poor kid has had.”

The article notes in the second to last paragraph that Johnson did, in fact, look at the picture on the phone. Johnson also apologized for taking the phone, as the article noted in the same paragraph.

The picture shows Jack Williment-Barr, a 4-year-old who was sent to the hospital Dec. 3, according to the Yorkshire Evening Post.

Florida Sheriff Issues Arrest Warrant For Pastor Who Refused To Cancel Services,"A Florida sheriff obtained an arrest warrant for a pastor who defied coronavirus social-distancing orders and held church services Sunday.

Florida Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister issued a Monday warrant for megachurch pastor Rodney Howard-Browne after the pastor held two Sunday religious services at the River at Tampa Bay Church in Florida, the Tampa Bay Times reported. A live stream of the service showed that it was widely attended.

“Because of the reckless disregard of public safety and after repeated requests and warnings, I worked with our state attorney, Andrew Warren, to obtain a warrant for unlawful assembly and violation of public health emergency rules, both of which are second degree misdemeanors,” Chronister said at a news conference, the publication reports.

“Our goal here is not to stop anyone from worshiping, but the safety and well-being of our community must always come first.” (RELATED: Southern Churches Draw Hundreds To Sunday Services Despite Coronavirus Restrictions)

Chronister said at a news conference that the Sheriff’s Office had warned Howard-Browne and church attorneys at The River at Tampa Bay Church not to endanger worshipers by holding church services. There have been 5,000 cases of coronavirus and 60 deaths from the virus in Florida, Axios reports as of Monday morning.

“In a time of national crisis, we expect certain institutions to be open and certain people to be on duty,” the River at Tampa Bay Church said in a statement. “We expect hospitals to have their doors open 24/7 to receive and treat patients. We expect our police and firefighters to be ready and available to rescue and to help and to keep the peace.”

“The Church is another one of those essential services,” the church added in the statement. “It is a place where people turn for help and for comfort in a climate of fear and uncertainty.”

The River at Tampa Bay said the church is continuously cleaning and sanitizing surfaces and encouraged parishioners who are not feeling well to stay home and watch services online.

“We feel that it is very important, at this time, that we keep our doors open for anyone who needs prayer or ministry and to make ourselves available to minister hope and healing and comfort to them,” the church added.

“We are the Body of Christ and the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ. We believe God‘s Word to us, which says to trust Him and to not be fearful but to have faith in Him. We are praying — as are our fellow Christians around the world — and we know that God answers prayers.”

Neither the church nor Howard-Browne have responded to requests for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.

"Wisconsin Supreme Court Blocks Governor’s Order, Reinstates Tuesday Primary","Wisconsin’s Tuesday primary election will be taking place as scheduled, the state Supreme Court ruled Monday after blocking Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ executive order to postpone the primary due to coronavirus concerns.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that the governor could not postpone the primary election set to take place Tuesday, overturning his executive order by a 4-2 margin. The decision came five hours after Evers postponed the primary until June 9. (RELATED: Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers Suspends In-Person Voting For Tuesday Primary)

Republicans challenged Evers’ executive order, calling it an “unconstitutional overreach.” Evers had initially opposed moving the election, but he later said that after hearing from constituents concerned about their health while voting during the pandemic, he “felt that the governor is the one who has to step up and stand for those people that aren’t having their voices heard” and that “the virus directs us as to what our decision-making is, not human beings, and clearly I am following the science, as I always have.”

“This is another last-minute flip-flop from the governor on the April 7th election,” the legislature’s Republican leaders, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, said according to MSN. “The governor himself has repeatedly acknowledged he can’t move the election. Just last week a federal judge said he did not have the power to cancel the election and Governor Evers doesn’t either. Governor Evers can’t unilaterally run the state.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2020/04/06/wisconsin-supreme-court-blocks-governors-order-reinstates-tuesday-primary/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiX-Zj__7P9AhVILVkFHWaFCU04HhAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw1qBQuL1i4wxefWOzuEoEtG,2020-04-06
University Of Delaware Refuses To Provide Agreement Detailing Why It Can’t Release Biden’s Records,"The University of Delaware refused Tuesday to provide the Daily Caller News Foundation with an agreement detailing why the university cannot release 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden’s Senate records.

As Biden faces increased scrutiny for allegations of sexual assault made against him by Tara Reade, pressure is mounting for the former vice president to unseal documents related to his time in the Senate — during which period Reade alleges that Biden kissed her, touched her and penetrated her with his fingers without her consent.

These Senate documents are housed by the University of Delaware Library and cover a wide swath of Biden’s political career, but are being kept secret until he “retires from public life,” spokeswoman Andrea Boyle Tippett told The Washington Post in July 2019.

Tippett told the DCNF on Tuesday that the University of Delaware would not share the terms of the agreement between the university and Biden detailing why the Senate records may not be released.

“The gift agreement signed when the papers were donated is not a public document,” Tippett told the DCNF. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: ‘Joe Biden, I Want You To Release The Personnel Records’: Tara Reade Demands Transparency From Biden) The collection of these documents fills 1,875 boxes and includes 415 gigabytes of electronic records, according to WaPo, containing committee reports, drafts of legislation and correspondence. Reade called on the former vice president to release these Senate documents in an exclusive interview with the DCNF. “Joe Biden, I want you to release all the personnel records from 1973 to 2009 and be transparent about your office practices,” Reade told the DCNF on Tuesday. “I would like to hold you accountable for what happened to me, to how your staff protected you and enabled you, bullied me multiple times into silence.” Reade has said that she made harassment complaints to three Biden staffers, none of whom reportedly took action, and that she filed a written complaint with a “Senate personnel office” in 1993, according to The New York Times. Reade told the DCNF that she does not have a copy of this complaint, though she has attempted to track it down, and she believes her complaint is included in these records. “You ended my career,” Reade told Biden on Tuesday through the DCNF. “You ended my job after you assaulted me. You claim to be the champion of women’s rights, but your public persona does not match your personal actions.” She added: “I want this brought to light and I want you to admit it in public. I want a public apology for calling me a Russian agent and having other people try to smear my character in order to cover your crimes.” Biden has not responded to many requests for comment from the DCNF.

"North Carolina Gov. Stands Ground, Says GOP Conditions For Convention Are ‘Very Unlikely’","Uncertainty surrounding the 2020 Republican National Convention increased Tuesday as Democratic North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper rejected the GOP’s request to have a full, in-person convention.

In a letter addressed to the Republican National Committee (RNC), Cooper cited his concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.

“With the nation, the State of North Carolina and the City of Charlotte still under states of emergency it’s important to conduct the RNC convention accordingly. As much as we want the conditions surrounding COVID-19 to be favorable enough for you to hold the convention you describe in late August, it is very unlikely,” Cooper wrote. (RELATED: North Carolina Gov. Cooper Stands Ground On Hosting Republican National Convention)

“Neither public health officials nor I will risk the health and safety of North Carolinians by providing the guarantee you seek,” Cooper wrote before signing.

The letter is the newest chapter in the back-and-forth between Cooper and the RNC, and his refusal to authorize the convention in the ways that the RNC has envisioned has frustrated many prominent Republicans, including President Donald Trump, who has expressed his frustration with Cooper on Twitter.

GOP party officials have insisted that they still want to hold the convention in North Carolina, but say they have received little guidance from the governor as to how do to it safely.

RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel released a statement Tuesday afternoon stating that while North Carolina would likely lose tens of millions of dollars in revenue, the party was obligated to look into hosting its convention in other states whose governors had expressed interest in hosting it, including Florida, Georgia and Tennessee.

GOP leaders are planning on visiting Nashville this week as a potential site as well. “We have an obligation to our delegates and nominee to begin visiting the multiple cities and states who have reached out in recent days about hosting an historic event to show that America is open for business,” McDaniel said.

Wealthy DC Suburb Refused To Hold Over 900 Criminal Illegal Aliens For ICE,"Fairfax County, Virginia refused more than 900 requests from federal immigration authorities to detain criminal illegal aliens in the area over a two-year period, according to an investigation by a conservative immigration group.

The county sheriff’s office received a total of 929 detainer requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), but only 14 (2%) requests were fulfilled in the form of warrants, according to the Immigration Reform Law Institute. Ninety-eight percent of the detainer requests (915) were denied by Fairfax officials from May 2018 to May 2020, the advocacy group found.

“There is nothing unacceptable about any detainer that seeks to remove criminals from our neighborhoods,” senior fellow at Immigration Reform Law Institute and former acting director of ICE Tom Homan said in a statement. “There is nothing unacceptable about law enforcement working hand in hand with other law enforcement to protect our communities and keep our streets safer.

“What is unacceptable is when a law enforcement leader chooses politics over public safety and fails to protect the communities he is sworn to protect,” Homan said.

Fairfax County Sheriff Stacey Kincaid terminated the area’s service agreement with ICE effective May 2018, ending the practice of holding illegal aliens in county facilities past their release date without a court-ordered detainer, which must be signed by a judge, according to a press release from the office. The law enforcement official called the decision “expedient” for her department, the release said.

Fairfax County in June 2020 issued an order that forbids local officers from complying with ICE warrants and prohibits deportation authorities from accessing county buildings, according to the Washington Times.

“Officers may not participate in, or facilitate, the enforcement of federal civil statutes (i.e. immigration laws),” the order directed, according to the Times.

Here Are 7 Times Biden And Harris Refused To Say If They’re Going To Pack The Supreme Court,"Democratic nominee Joe Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, have refused to answer court-packing questions at least seven times since Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death.

Prominent Democrats have embraced the idea of packing the Supreme Court following Ginsburg’s death.

Harris again refused to answer whether she and Biden plan to pack the court during Wednesday night’s debate with Vice President Mike Pence.

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris have repeatedly refused to answer when asked whether they plan on packing the Supreme Court if they win the November election.

Harris, a California senator, refused to answer during her debate with Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday when Pence repeatedly pressed her on the court-packing issue. Other prominent Democrats have publicly embraced court-packing and Harris herself previously expressed openness to it during the Democratic primary.

WATCH:



Harris’s latest dodge marks at least the seventh time that she and Biden have refused to answer the court-packing question since Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death on Sept. 18, a Daily Caller News Foundation review found.

Biden refused to answer when asked about court-packing in a Sept. 21 interview with local Wisconsin outlet WBAY.

“It’s a legitimate question, but let me tell you why I’m not going answer that question. Because it will shift the focus, that’s what [Trump] wants, he never wants to talk about the issue at hand and he always tries to change the subject,” Biden said.

Biden dodged the court-packing question a second time when asked by a reporter on Sept. 27. “I know you’re going to be upset with my answer but what I’m not going to do is play the Trump game—which is a good game he plays—take your eye off the issue before us,” he said.

“If I were to say yes or no to that, that becomes a big issue,” Biden continued. Biden previously opposed court-packing during the Democratic primary, before changing his tune after Ginsburg’s death.

Biden refused to answer a third time whether he plans on packing the Supreme Court when asked about the issue during the first presidential debate on Sept. 29.

“Whatever the position I take, that will be the issue,” said Biden, who in the same debate proclaimed himself as the face of the Democratic Party. (RELATED: Moderator Susan Page Asks Zero Questions About Kamala Harris Raising Money For Bail Fund That Helped Release Domestic Abuser)

“You should go out and vote. You are voting now. Vote and let your senators know how strongly you feel,” Biden continued.

Harris also refused to answer the question following the first Trump-Biden debate.

“Neither you nor Joe Biden are willing to give a straight answer as to whether or not you’re willing to entertain that idea,” CNN anchor Jake Tapper said to Harris in a post-debate interview. Harris dodged the question entirely in her answer.

“We are 35 days away from an election that is probably the most important election of our lifetime and our children’s lifetime, and there is nothing about these next 35 days that Joe or I will take for granted, and so the focus right now is on reminding people that we have this election that it is very much in play,” she said.

“I will respectfully note you also declined to answer that question with me,” Tapper noted.

The day after the debate, Sept. 30, Biden refused to answer the court-packing question in two separate interviews with local news outlets in Pennsylvania.

“I’m not going to play Trump’s game,” Biden told Pittsburgh’s Action 4 News. “Right now, my entire focus is seeing to it that the American people get their chance, the election’s already started, to have their say on who the next Supreme Court Justice is.”

That same day, 6News reporter Crispin Havener noted to Biden that he dodged moderator Chris Wallace’s question about packing the Supreme Court during the first debate. “Do you support the idea of packing the court?” asked Havener.

“I’m not dodging the question,” Biden insisted, “what I’m doing is staying focused.”

“You know, and I’m not being critical of you at all, I give you my word, but if I answer the question no matter which way I answer it, then that becomes the headline tomorrow, that becomes the headline for the next three days, ‘the presidential nominee says he’s going to or not going to do the following,'” Biden added.

His campaign did not return the DCNF’s request for clarification on his position on packing the court.

"Hunter Biden Emails Could Be ‘Absolutely Verified’ If Rudy Giuliani Released The Metadata, Expert Says","Emails from a computer allegedly owned by Hunter Biden could be “absolutely verified beyond a shadow of a doubt” if the metadata for the files were made available to review, a cybersecurity expert told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani reportedly provided the New York Post with a copy of the hard drive the emails originated from. But he has refused to release metadata information for messages the Post described as “smoking-gun” evidence that Hunter Biden introduced a Burisma executive to his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, in 2015.

Giuliani told Daily Caller White House correspondent Christian Datoc during an exclusive interview Thursday that questions surrounding the metadata for the files he provided to the Post were “pettifogging nonsense” pushed by the “liberal press.” (RELATED: 1-On-1 With Rudy Giuliani — What Haven’t We Seen From The Hunter Biden Hard Drive, And Why Won’t He Release It In Full?)

The founder of the cybersecurity firm Errata Security, Robert Graham, told the DNCF that it was anything but nonsense for reporters to ask to review metadata information for the supposedly incriminating emails he’s promoting.

“The fact that these emails can be absolutely verified, beyond a shadow of a doubt, but that Rudy refuses to do so, is important,” Graham said. “Once you produce the original emails, with all the metadata, nobody can claim they are fake.”

Graham explained that emails sent from Gmail accounts, such as the messages reportedly sent from Vadym Pozharsky, an advisor to Burisma’s board of directors, to Hunter Biden in 2015, are each provided a unique DKIM signature from Gmail’s servers that can be used to verify definitively whether the subject, sender, recipients, date and body of the messages are legitimate.

By testing the content of the Hunter Biden emails against their DKIM signatures, which should be present in the metadata Giuliani has yet to release, experts could determine beyond a shadow of a doubt whether any aspect of the message as reported has been altered, Graham explained.

According to the Post, Giuliani obtained the hard drive with Hunter Biden’s emails, text messages and photos from a Delaware computer repair shop owner who had received it in April 2019 from an unidentified customer who then never came back to retrieve the computer. The computer contained a sticker from the Beau Biden Foundation on it, according to the Post.

Hunter Biden has not denied the authenticity of the emails being reported by the Post, but the DCNF has not verified the messages. Joe Biden’s presidential campaign has said the alleged meeting between him, his son and Pozharsky never took place.

Giuliani’s known association with a Ukrainian lawmaker who was sanctioned by the Treasury Department in August due to Russian ties has led critics to question whether foreign actors had any involvement in the dissemination of the alleged Hunter Biden emails.

The FBI is currently investigating whether a foreign intelligence operation is at all connected to the release of the emails, according to The Associated Press and NBC News.

Graham said email metadata would “probably not” provide any indication whether or not hacking has anything to do with their release.

Glenn Greenwald Resigns From The Intercept After Editors Reportedly Refused To Publish Article Critical Of Joe Biden,"Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Glenn Greenwald resigned from the media company he co-founded after editors reportedly refused to publish his article until he removed all sections critical of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

“Today I sent my intention to resign from The Intercept, the news outlet I co-founded in 2013 with Jeremy Scahill and Laura Poitras, as well as from its parent company First Look Media,” Greenwald announced Thursday afternoon. (RELATED: Brazilian Judge Declines To Charge American Journalist Glenn Greenwald With Cybercrimes ‘For Now’)

“The final, precipitating cause is that The Intercept’s editors, in violation of my contractual right of editorial freedom, censored an article I wrote this week, refusing to publish it unless I remove all sections critical of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, the candidate vehemently supported by all New-York-based Intercept editors involved in this effort at suppression,” he continued.

My Resignation From The Intercept The same trends of repression, censorship and ideological homogeneity plaguing the national press generally have engulfed the media outlet I co-founded, culminating in censorship of my own articles.https://t.co/dZrlYGfEBf — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) October 29, 2020

“The censored article, based on recently revealed emails and witness testimony, raised critical questions about Biden’s conduct,” Greenwald added. “Not content to simply prevent publication of this article at the media outlet I co-founded, these Intercept editors also demanded that I refrain from exercising a separate contractual right to publish this article with any other publication.”

Greenwald appeared on the “Joe Rogan Experience” in an episode released Wednesday criticizing media institutions for their coverage of the Hunter Biden controversy, adding he was “disgusted with my colleagues in my profession.” (RELATED: Want To Know Why Media Isn’t Covering Hunter Biden? Glenn Greenwald Has A Theory)

In a “last-ditch attempt to avoid being censored,” the Intercept co-founder claimed he encouraged the editors to write their own articles critiquing his perspective, so readers could decide who was right.

“But modern media outlets do not air dissent; they quash it,” Greenwald said. “So censorship of my article, rather than engagement with it, was the path these Biden-supporting editors chose.”

He revealed his article would be published on Substack “shortly.” (RELATED: Glenn Greenwald To Megyn Kelly: ‘I’m Totally, Formally Banned’ From MSNBC)

“I have been extremely disenchanted and saddened by the editorial direction of The Intercept under its New York leadership for quite some time,” Greenwald wrote. “The publication we founded without those editors back in 2014 now bears absolutely no resemblance to what we set out to build — not in content, structure, editorial mission or purpose.”

Greenwald, who made his career covering the Edward Snowden national security leaks, concluded that he has requested his lawyer to get in touch with First Look Media to discuss how to terminate his contract.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2020/10/29/glenn-greenwald-resigns-intercept/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjX8pWDgLT9AhWsEFkFHfRjBCE4WhAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw1xjKitObNEe4GfTWCdHMDy,2020-10-29
"Starbucks Fires Barista Who Refused To Wear ‘Pride’ Shirt For Religious Reasons, Lawsuit Alleges","A former Starbucks barista alleged that she was fired for her unwillingness to wear a company “Pride” t-shirt for religious reasons, according to a federal lawsuit.

Betsy Fresse was allegedly fired from the Glen Ridge, New Jersey Starbucks in August 2019 after she had inquired about “Pride” shirts that were in the store manager’s office in June 2019, according to the lawsuit filed on Nov. 19. The lawsuit noted that Fresse is a practicing Christian who believes marriage is between a man and woman and didn’t want to wear a shirt that violated those religious convictions.

“The law mandates that every person be free from discrimination based on their sincerely held religious beliefs including in the workplace,” Fresse’s lawyer, Demetrios K. Stratis, told The Daily Caller News Foundation in a statement. “Here, Starbucks failed to comply with the law, and terminated my client because she would not betray her faith, a faith which defines who she is as a person.”

“That is actionable and wrong and Starbucks must be held accountable,” he continued. (RELATED: ‘That Isn’t A Political Thing’: Employees Suing Whole Foods, Amazon Over Black Lives Matter Masks Nearly Doubles)

After Fresse inquired about the shirts and before she was terminated, she received a call from Starbucks’s Ethics and Compliance Helpline, according to the lawsuit. The company representative specifically asked Fresse why she didn’t want to wear the “Pride” shirt.

She explained that it was because her “religious beliefs prevented her from doing so,” the lawsuit stated.

On Aug. 22, 2019, she received a notice of separation informing her that she had been fired. The notice explained that she was fired for “acting in violation of Starbuck’s Core Values.”

“Upon being handed her PRIDE t-shirt Betsy stated she did not want to wear a PRIDE t-shirt and that partners ‘need Jesus.'” the notice of separation said, according to the lawsuit. (RELATED: Kroger Sued Over Alleged Religious Discrimination After Firing Employees Who Say They Refused To Wear Rainbow LGBTQ Symbol)

However, the lawsuit said that she was never handed the shirt. The lawsuit also said that Fresse “holds no enmity toward individuals who ascribe to the LGBTQ lifestyle and/or make up the LGBTQ community.”

“We are aware of the claims by Ms. Fresse, which are without merit, and are fully prepared to present our case in court,” Starbucks spokesperson Jory Mendes told the DCNF in a phone interview. “Starbucks does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, religion or sexual orientation.”

“Other than our green apron, no part of our dress code requires partners to wear any approved items that they have not personally selected,” Mendes added.

In August, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued Fresse the right to sue after reviewing the case, according to court filings attached to the lawsuit.

President Donald Trump Says Capitol Building Riot A Result Of Stolen Election Even As He Calls For Peace,"President Donald Trump said in a now-deleted tweet calling for peace that mob violence and rioting at the Capitol building Wednesday were the “things and events that happen” after an election is stolen

“These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long,” Trump wrote in the now-deleted tweet. “Go home with love & in peace.”

“Remember this day forever!” he added.

Twitter removed Trump’s tweet shortly after it was posted, saying it violated Twitter rules.

All but one of the 62 lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies alleging voter fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election have failed in court, according to USA Today.

One person died after a mob of pro-Trump rioters stormed and occupied the Capitol building Wednesday as lawmakers were meeting to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory. (REPORT: Woman Shot In Neck At Capitol Building Has Died)

Trump told supporters during a speech earlier in the day that he would lead a march to the capitol building to “cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women” challenging his loss to Biden.

The Army activated the entire D.C. National Guard Wednesday afternoon to be deployed at the Capitol and other locations in the city, according to The New York Times. The FBI also sent a SWAT team into the Capitol building later in the afternoon to help quell the rioting.

Other high ranking members of his administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, issued statements strongly condemning what was taking place at the Capitol building.

“The violence and destruction taking place at the US Capitol Must Stop and it Must Stop Now,” Pence tweeted. “Anyone involved must respect Law Enforcement officers and immediately leave the building.”

Acting Homeland Security secretary Chad Wolf said Wednesday that violence “in any form is unacceptable” and that all “violent opportunists at the US Capitol grounds must be held accountable.”

And Robert O’Brien, Trump’s assistant for national security affairs, said “what the mob did to our Senate Chamber today was an utter disgrace.”

"RNC Pushes Back On Trump, Claims It ‘Has Every Right’ To Use His Name For Fundraising","The Republican National Committee (RNC) has responded to a cease-and-desist letter sent by former President Donald Trump’s attorneys this weekend demanding the organization stop using his name and likeness in fundraising efforts.

The GOP “has every right to refer to public figures as it engages in core, First Amendment-protected political speech, and it will continue to do so in pursuit of these common goals,” RNC chief counsel Justin Riemer wrote Monday in a letter to Trump attorney Alex Cannon, Politico reported.

Over the weekend, Trump’s legal counsel sent a cease-and-desist letter to the RNC, the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) insisting the organizations stop using Trump for fundraising.

That letter orders the various GOP campaign arms to “immediately cease-and-desist the unauthorized use of President Donald J. Trump’s name, image and/or likeness in all fundraising, persuasion, and/or issue speech,” according to Politico.

Despite the request, the RNC recently used Trump’s name in fundraising endeavors. A pair of Trump-themed fundraising emails sent over the weekend and on Monday requested donors “defend President Trump’s Legacy,” Politico reported. (RELATED: Donations To Trump’s ‘Recount Account’ Worth Less Than $8,000 Are Going to ‘Save America’ PAC, RNC)

Riemer claims in his letter the 45th president and RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel “enjoy a close relationship, and we understand that President Trump reaffirmed to her over the weekend that he approves of the RNC’s current use of his name in fundraising and other materials, including for our upcoming donor retreat event at Palm Beach at which we look forward to him participating.”

Trump launched the Save America PAC shortly after the November presidential election, raising tens of millions of dollars, as previously reported. Trump can use the committee to bankroll candidates he endorses and future political ambitions.

“There’s only one way to contribute to our efforts to elect ‘America First’ Republican conservatives and, in turn, to make America great again,” Trump told a packed crowd at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, according to the Star Tribune. “And that’s through Save America PAC and donaldjtrump.com.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/03/08/rnc-trump-claims-name-for-fundraising/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiq6Mr-_7P9AhVBk4kEHX0hA5k4FBAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw12Z1LeKWQujNkTjYSfVk0t,2021-03-08
"Six Times In A Row, Becerra Refuses To Admit Partial Birth Abortion Is Illegal","Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra repeatedly refused Thursday to acknowledge that partial birth abortion is illegal in the United States of America.

Becerra falsely denied last month that there is an existing law banning partial birth abortion, apparently forgetting the law that he himself voted against.

“Senator, I could talk to you about the legal cases that have arisen as a result of that particular statute,” Becerra said, “but what it’s probably better to say to you is that a woman has a right in this country to exercise reproductive choice.”

Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra repeatedly refused Thursday to acknowledge that partial birth abortion is illegal in the U.S.

Becerra falsely denied last month that there is an existing law banning partial birth abortion, apparently forgetting the law that he himself voted against. His denial sparked a backlash among conservatives and pro-life advocates and prompted multiple senators to question him about the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act in hearings this week.

During Thursday’s hearing, Republican Montana Sen. Steve Daines asked Becerra whether partial birth abortion is illegal several times. Becerra repeatedly refused to address the question or acknowledge that partial birth abortion is illegal and emphasized that Roe v. Wade is the law of the land.

The Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act passed Congress in 2003, was signed by former President George W. Bush, and was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court as constitutional in 2007. (RELATED: Republican Senators Push Biden Nominee Becerra On His Abortion Record)

The law defines partial birth abortion as “an abortion in which a physician deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living, unborn child’s body until either the entire baby’s head is outside the body of the mother, or any part of the baby’s trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother and only the head remains inside the womb, for the purpose of performing an overt act (usually the puncturing of the back of the child’s skull and removing the baby’s brains) that the person knows will kill the partially delivered infant, performs this act, and then completes delivery of the dead infant.”

Daines pushed Becerra on the matter, asking, “Is it illegal?”

“What I can tell you is that women in this country under Roe v. Wade,” Becerra began, before Daines interrupted him, asking, “Is partial birth abortion legal or illegal in the United States?”

“Senator, again, we are going to get into this technical discussion,” Becerra said, but Daines told him, “It’s not a technical discussion, it’s a question. Is it legal or illegal?” (RELATED: ‘Were The Nuns Going To Get Pregnant?’ Sasse Hammers Becerra On ‘Bullying’ Little Sisters Of The Poor)

“A woman has a right to receive abortion,” the HHS secretary began again, and Daines interrupted him to ask, “So are you saying it’s legal? A partial birth abortion?”

When Becerra again began to discuss a woman’s right to abortion, Daines reminded Becerra of the 2003 law stating that partial birth abortion is illegal.

“Do you agree with that?” Daines asked.

“Senator, I could talk to you about the legal cases that have arisen as a result of that particular statute, but what it’s probably better again to say to you is that a woman has a right in this country to exercise reproductive choice.”

“We would never break the law,” he added. (RELATED: Cotton Slams Becerra For ‘Trying To Ignore’ Partial Birth Abortion Ban: ‘He Doesn’t Get to Pick And Choose’)

Daines asked Becerra a final time whether partial birth abortion is legal or illegal, to which Becerra responded, “Senator, I’ll direct you then to the decisions that the courts have issued with regard to that particular statue if you like, and that’s why I continue to repeat to you is that what is the law is the right of a woman under Roe v. Wade to receive reproductive health care services.”

Republican Indiana Sen. Mike Braun also pressed Becerra on partial birth abortion during a Wednesday hearing, during which Becerra insisted that HHS would do “what the law permits us to do.”

WATCH:

In House testimony last month, HHS Sec. Becerra said ‘there is no law that deals specifically with the term ‘partial-birth abortion.’ There is.

“If I’m doing my job, I’m following the law,” Becerra said. “And right now, Roe v. Wade is the law of the land.”

HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Flight Canceled After 30 Teens Refused To Wear Masks,"A flight from Charlotte, North Carolina, to the Bahamas was pushed back a day after a group of more than 30 high school students refused to wear masks on board the plane before takeoff.

American Airlines Flight 893 was scheduled to leave for Nassau at 9:30 a.m. Monday, but was initially delayed due to mechanical issues. After passengers switched planes, the flight was again delayed after dozens of Boston-area teens refused to wear masks, which are legally required on aircraft by federal regulators, according to WSOC-TV in Charlotte.

The standoff reportedly lasted for hours before the flight was cancelled until Tuesday.

“It was bad. First, they were yelling. They were cursing. They were being very obnoxious,” Malik Banks, who was seated next to the kids, told WSOC-TV. “It wasn’t all of them. I would say 75% to 80% of them were being terrible kids, saying smart stuff.”

“Some people’s vacations are ruined. They were only going for a couple of nights. Now, they have to get rebooked,” another passenger, Stephanie Krzywanski, told the outlet. (RELATED: Poll: 57% Of Republicans Think The Pandemic Is Over — But Only 4% Of Democrats Agree)

Police reportedly said nobody was arrested for the incident. The adults passengers who were stranded were given hotel vouchers, while the students were too young to be eligible and had to spend the night inside the airport, according to WSOC-TV.

Pelosi Says No To Two Republicans On The Jan. 6 Select Committee,"Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi requested House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy select two other Republicans to serve on the House Select Committee to look into the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, saying she rejects the recommendations of Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan and Indiana Rep. Jim Banks.

Pelosi released a Wednesday statement two days after McCarthy selected a group of five Republicans to serve on the House Select Committee. McCarthy’s Republican picks include Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis, North Dakota Rep. Kelly Armstrong and Texas Rep. Troy Nehls.

“Monday evening, the Minority Leader recommended 5 Members to serve on the Select Committee. I have spoken with him this morning about the objections raised about Representatives Jim Banks and Jim Jordan and the impact their appointments may have on the integrity of the investigation. I also informed him that I was prepared to appoint Representatives Rodney Davis, Kelly Armstrong and Troy Nehls, and requested that he recommend two other Members,” Pelosi said in the statement.

“With respect for the integrity of the investigation, with an insistence on the truth and with concern about statements made and actions taken by these Members, I must reject the recommendations of Representatives Banks and Jordan to the Select Committee. The unprecedented nature of January 6th demands this unprecedented decision,” Pelosi added. (RELATED: McCarthy Selects The Five Republicans Who Will Serve On Jan. 6 Select Committee)

Pelosi announced in late June that she would be establishing the select committee. The House then approved a resolution to form the committee weeks after Senate Republicans killed a bipartisan commission in late May.(RELATED: Pelosi Launches Select Committee To Investigate Jan. 6)

The House Select Committee announced it will hold its first hearing July 27. (RELATED: House Select Committee Sets Date For First Hearing On Jan. 6 Riot)

The resolution authorized Pelosi to select eight members to serve on the committee and McCarthy to select five.

The resolution ended up passing in the House 222 to 190, with two Republicans joining all Democrats in voting in favor. Those two Republicans were Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger and Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney.

Pelosi picked her panelists. One of them is Cheney. (RELATED: House Passes Resolution Creating Select Committee Into Capitol Riot)

Pelosi also selected Democratic Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, California Rep. Adam Schiff, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, California Rep. Pete Aguilar, Virginia Rep. Elaine Luria and Florida Rep. Stephanie Murphy. (RELATED: Pelosi Launches Select Committee To Investigate Jan. 6)

"‘I Never Touched Anyone Inappropriately’: Cuomo Refuses To Resign, Denies Investigation Findings","Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo refused to resign and denied Tuesday the findings of an investigation into sexual harassment allegations against him.

An investigation released Tuesday by Attorney General Letitia James found that Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo “sexually harassed a number of State employees through unwelcome and unwanted touching, as well as by making numerous offensive and sexually suggestive comments” and that this conduct “was part of a pattern of behavior that extended to his interactions with others outside of State government.” (RELATED: FLASHBACK: Biden Says Cuomo Should Resign If Investigation Confirms Harassment Claims)

The governor spoke out Tuesday following the results of the investigation, saying his attorneys have compiled responses to the allegations.

Cuomo echoed his previous denials of anyone inappropriate touching, saying in a pre-recorded statement, “I want you to know directly from me, I never touched anyone inappropriately.”

“I am 63 years old,” he said. “I have lived my entire adult life in public view. That is just not who I am. And that is not who I have ever been. (RELATED: Reporter Says Cuomo’s ‘Eat The Whole Sausage’ Comment Wasn’t Harassment)

“I do kiss people on the forehead,” the governor continued. “I do kiss people on the cheek. I do embrace people…men and women. I do on occasion say, ‘Ciao bella.’ On occasion, I do slip and say sweetheart or darling.”

The governor said that he now understands that there are “generational or cultural perspectives” that he did not understand and apologized if any of his well-intentioned actions made anyone uncomfortable.

Cuomo’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.

In May, the governor promised to fully cooperate with an investigation into the allegations, noting that though his lawyers told him not to discuss the matter until the review is over, he wanted New Yorkers to hear his thoughts directly from him. (RELATED: Advocacy Groups That Pushed ‘Believe All Women’ Silent On Cuomo #METOO Accusers)

“I fully support a woman’s right to come forward, and I think it should be encouraged in every way,” Cuomo said. “I now understand that I acted in a way that made people feel uncomfortable. It was unintentional and I truly and deeply apologize for it.”

“I certainly never ever meant to offend anyone or hurt anyone or cause anyone any pain,” he said at the time, asking New Yorkers to “wait for the facts” from the attorney general’s investigation before forming an opinion. “That is the last thing I would ever want to do.”

"Psaki Dodges When Doocy Asks Whether Migrants Are Required To Show Proof Of Vaccine, Negative COVID-19 Test","White House press secretary Jen Psaki refused to say if migrants who are walking across the border are required to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test.

Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy asked Psaki if any of the migrants who are walking across the border and setting up camps were asked to provide proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test.

“First of all, I can re-address for you what steps we take …”

“So if somebody walks into the country, right across the river, does somebody ask to see their vaccination card?” Doocy asked. (RELATED: Immigrants Will Need To Be Vaccinated To Apply For Benefits)

“Well, let me explain to you again, Peter, how our process works,” the press secretary said.

Psaki said that as migrants come across the border, they are screened for symptoms of COVID-19 and quarantined if they are symptomatic.

“They are not intending to stay here for a lengthy period of time,” she continued. “It’s not the same thing. These are individuals, as we’ve noted … we are expelling individuals based on Title 42 specifically because of COVID. Because we want to prevent a scenario where large numbers of people are gathering, posing a threat to the community and also to the migrants themselves.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that Title 42 — a Trump-era public health order that allows border patrol to expel some migrants — stay in place, Psaki said.

Doocy pressed Psaki on why the Biden administration is requiring vaccination for around 100 million American workers but did not implement a similar requirement for migrants. Psaki told him that the more people who are vaccinated, “whether they are migrants or whether they are workers, protects more people in the United States.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/09/20/jen-psaki-peter-doocy-illegal-migrants-vaccine-coronavirus-covid-19-negative-test-camps/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiJouaBgLT9AhWmD1kFHczOBy84RhAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw1YfJWJFeX58iJlrK_rnieP,2021-09-20

"Gorsuch, Sotomayor Push Back On NPR Story Claiming He Refused To Wear A Mask Despite Request","Associate Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Sonia Sotomayor put out a joint statement on Wednesday denying a recent report that Gorsuch refused to wear a mask during oral arguments, forcing Sotomayor to participate in proceedings remotely.

National Public Radio legal correspondent Nina Totenberg claimed in a Tuesday column that Gorsuch refused a request from Chief Justice John Roberts that all justices wear masks during oral arguments as a result of Sotomayor’s fears about the Omicron variant. Sotomayor, who has diabetes, “has not attended the justices’ weekly conference in person, joining instead by telephone” as a result of Gorsuch’s refusal, Totenberg wrote.

“Reporting that Justice Sotomayor asked Justice Gorsuch to wear a mask surprised us. It is false. While we may sometimes disagree about the law, we are warm colleagues and friends,” the two justices said.

JUST IN. SCOTUS releases a short joint statement from Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch: “Reporting that Justice Sotomayor asked Justice Gorsuch to wear a mask surprised us. It is false. While we may sometimes disagree about the law, we are warm colleagues and friends.” — SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) January 19, 2022

Their comment confirms part of a Fox News report from legal correspondent Shannon Bream, who said Tuesday that Roberts did not issue a request that the justices wear masks, and that Sotomayor did not ask Gorsuch to wear one.

“Given that fact, there was also no refusal by Justice Gorsuch,” Bream explained, while noting that all justices have received COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots.

Roberts also pushed back on the report in a Wednesday statement.

“I did not request Justice Gorsuch or any other Justice to wear a mask on the bench,” he said.

When reached for comment, an NPR spokesman said that the organization is standing by Totenberg’s report.

“Totenberg never reported that Justice Sotomayor asked Justice Gorsuch to wear a mask, nor did she report that anyone admonished him. She did report that Chief Justice Roberts; ‘in some form asked the other justices to mask up’—and Gorsuch was the only one who did not. The statement released by Justices Sotomayor and Gorsuch does not contradict the reporting in Mrs. Totenberg’s piece,” the spokesman said.

The NPR report is the second time in recent weeks that Gorsuch has faced scrutiny for his alleged handling and understanding of COVID-19. During oral arguments for the cases National Federation of Independent Businesses v. Department of Labor and Ohio v. Department of Labor, Gorsuch noted that the flu “kills hundreds, thousands of people every year,” but that the federal government does not issue workplace vaccine mandates. (RELATED: Biden Calls On Private Businesses To ‘Immediately’ Implement Vaccine Requirements After Supreme Court Blocks Mandate)

However, after the Supreme Court issued a mistaken transcript, several liberal media outlets accused Gorsuch of saying that the flu kills “hundreds of thousands.” The Court ultimately issued a correction.

REPORT: Plane Turns Around Mid-Flight Because Passenger Refused To Abide By Mask Rules,"An American Airlines plane was forced to turn around mid-flight because a passenger refused to abide by mask rules, The New York Times reported Thursday.

The flight, which was headed Wednesday from Miami to London, was met by police upon landing, the outlet reported. It was unclear whether police had charged or detained anyone in relation to the incident.

American Airlines stated the plane was forced to turn around due to a “a disruptive customer refusing to comply with the federal mask mandate,” The NYT reported. (RELATED: Major Airline CEOs Question The Need For Masks On Planes)

After the flight returned to Miami International Airport, over 100 passengers were told they had to deplane, CBS Miami reported. One passenger told the local outlet they were “disappointed” about the incident.

“They really wouldn’t say anything and I don’t think they told the flight attendants anything because all they would say is there was an extreme incident and they had to turn around,” the passenger said.

The flight was ultimately canceled, according to CBS Miami.

"NBC Refuses To Air Anti-China Ad During The Olympics, According To Congressman Mike Waltz","NBC is allegedly refusing to air an ad critical of the Chinese government during the Olympics.

Florida Republican congressman Mike Waltz tweeted Saturday that NBC, which is the network that airs the games, is refusing to air his ad ripping the CCP to shreds for violating human rights. The ad also features Boston Celtics center Enes Kanter Freedom. (RELATED: David Hookstead Is The True King In The North When It Comes To College Football)

“NBC refused to air my Olympics ad with @EnesFreedom unless we censor U.S. corporate logos of the Genocide Games sponsors. We won’t let them silence us. Here’s the ad that NBC and the Chinese Communist Party doesn’t want you to see,” Waltz tweeted.

He also told the New York Post that the ad cost $40,000. You can watch the ad NBC allegedly refused to air below.

First off, it’s great to see somebody holding a torch to the feet of the CCP. China’s communist dictatorship has trampled on human rights since its inception and the atrocities against ethnic minorities are beyond disgusting. It’s a genocide, and should be called what it is.

As Americans, we should all be outraged that people are covering for the Chinese dictatorship instead of exposing it for what it is.

Unlike what you might hear on ESPN, it’s a brutal government and we should all be willing to say it.

Furthermore, if NBC refused to air this ad, the network should be ashamed. Is this still America or are we now a nation full of corporations that rush to bend the knee to the CCP?

I was raised to believe that America is the greatest country to ever exist and part of our responsibility as Americans is to shine lights on injustices.

Perhaps, NBC executives simply didn’t have the same upbringing I did.

The Olympics being held in China is a GREAT opportunity for American media to expose the horrific crimes of the communist dictatorship. People are being systematically tortured, raped and murdered. Instead, most media outlets are gushing over China’s leadership. It’s disgusting. — David Hookstead (@dhookstead) February 5, 2022

REPORT: Kyler Murray Refused To Go Back Into The Playoff Game Against The Rams,"It sounds like Kyler Murray’s issues with the Cardinals might go back to the playoffs.

There has been a ton of chatter about Murray’s status with the team ever since he nuked his Instagram off all references to the team. (RELATED: David Hookstead Is The True King In The North When It Comes To College Football)

He did just recently add a photo of himself in his Cardinals gear.

With chatter of problems growing louder, a new report indicates the star quarterback might have rubbed the team the wrong way with his behavior during a blowout loss in the playoffs to the Rams.

The odd vibe between the @AZCardinals and Kyler Murray is indeed alarming:

Murray is described as self-centered, immature and finger pointer, per sources.

Murray is frustrated with franchise and was embarrassed by playoff loss to Rams and thinks he’s been framed as the scapegoat — Chris Mortensen (@mortreport) February 13, 2022

Where’s it headed?

Despite the acrimony, the Cardinals expect things to calm down and Murray is their QB.

Select veterans hope to reach Murray on how he handle adversity better.

Coach Kliff Kingsbury also is self-scouting where he can provide better alternatives for QB. — Chris Mortensen (@mortreport) February 13, 2022

According to Mike Garafolo, Murray refused to go back into the playoff game against the Rams with roughly a minute left, and that didn’t make the team very happy.

Refusing to go into a game, especially a playoff game, is a massive middle finger to your coaches, teammates and management.

I have no idea how this situation is going to end, but the reality of the situation is both sides are incentivized to get it fixed.

Murray is one of the best young passers in the NFL, and Arizona doesn’t want to lose him. With a new contract looming on the horizon, you’d think everyone would come to the table and figure it out.

Texas DAs Fighting Governor’s Order To Treat Sex Change Surgeries For Children As Abuse,"District attorneys for five of the largest counties in Texas are defying Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s executive order to treat sex change surgeries for children as child abuse.

Abbott ordered the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (TDFPS) Tuesday to investigate instances of children undergoing sex change procedures, including “reassignment surgeries that can cause sterilization, mastectomies, removals of otherwise healthy body parts, and administration of puberty-blocking drugs or supraphysiologic doses of testosterone or estrogen.”

Abbott’s letter included an opinion from Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton laying out the legal argument for classifying such treatments as child abuse under Texas law.

In response to Governor Abbott and AG Paxton’s directives regarding transgender youth care: pic.twitter.com/oPHH7PBfz7 — Dallas County DA (@Dallas_DA) February 24, 2022

The five dissenting DAs said they were “deeply disturbed” by Abbott’s order and would not enforce it in a public letter. They called childhood sex change procedures “gender-affirming” and “life-saving.” They represent Dallas, Travis, Bexar, Nueces and Fort Bend counties.

“We will enforce the Constitution and will not irrationally and unjustifiably interfere with medical decisions made between children, their parents, and their medical physicians,” the prosecutors wrote. (RELATED: Texas Department Of Family And Protective Services Removes Web Page Celebrating Trans Youth)

The TDFPS acknowledged that performing sex change surgery on a child constitutes sex abuse in August 2021 after Abbott prompted the organization to take a stance.

“The medical evidence does not demonstrate that children and adolescents benefit from engaging in these irreversible sterilization procedures,” Paxton’s opinion read. “As stated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, ‘There is not enough high-quality evidence to determine whether gender reassignment surgery improves health outcomes.’”

Psaki Won’t Say If Biden Supports Unrestricted Abortion Up To Moment Of Birth,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki refused to say whether President Joe Biden supported abortion on demand up to the moment of birth in a Thursday press conference.

Fox News reporter Peter Doocy pressed Psaki on whether Biden supported any limits on abortion. Psaki refused to answer the question and told Doocy repeatedly that Biden had already made his position clear in the past.

“The President has spoken — has talked about his position many times. He supports the right of a woman to make choices about her own body with her doctor,” Psaki said. “The President has stated his view many times.”

My statement on the reported Supreme Court decision draft. pic.twitter.com/Kt3bP0kzqU — President Biden (@POTUS) May 3, 2022

Doocy said Biden’s position on abortion had changed over time and asked Psaki twice to state Biden’s stance on abortion and then specifically whether Biden supported abortion up until the moment of birth.

“The President has spoken about this many times, Peter. And I would refer you to his own comments about abortion and a woman’s right to choose and make decisions about her body with her doctor, which is what any of those women would do,” Psaki said before calling on another reporter.

Democrats in the Senate will vote next week on legislation making elective abortions a statutory right throughout the first six months of pregnancy. It would also effectively bar states from outlawing the procedure, even if a health care worker finds that pregnancy could harm a mother’s mental or physical health. The bill has 47 Democratic cosponsors.

Adam said the following when explaining the decision him and his teammates made, according to the same TMZ report:

So it’s a hard decision. Because ultimately we all said what we want is them to know that all are welcome and loved here. But when we put it on our bodies, I think a lot of guys decided that it’s just a lifestyle that maybe — not that they look down on anybody or think differently — it’s just that maybe we don’t want to encourage it if we believe in Jesus, who’s encouraged us to live a lifestyle that would abstain from that behavior, just like (Jesus) encourages me as a heterosexual male to abstain from sex outside of the confines of marriage. It’s no different.

My biggest question here is why do sports teams feel the need to get involved in social issues at all? Fans want to watch the game.

We don’t want to be lectured about guns or any other issue going on in America. Leave that to cable TV. We’re just trying to have a few beers and cheer on our team.

Having said that, it seems like the backlash has been minimal from what I can see online, and that’s a bit unexpected. Generally speaking, if you step out of line, you’re in big trouble.

Andrew Schulz Refused To Edit His Latest Special To Please A Streaming Service,"Comedian Andrew Schulz has zero interest in bending the knee to please giant companies.

The superstar comedian recently released an Instagram video announcing that an unnamed streaming service wanted him to cut jokes the company didn’t like in order to air it. (RELATED: David Hookstead Is The True King In The North When It Comes To College Football)

Instead of bowing down and doing it, Schulz took a stand for comedy, refused to cut anything and bought his special back from the unnamed streaming company.

As Schulz pointed out, he has no idea whether or not buying his special back will work or not, but he hopes it does. I hope like hell it does too!

Why? The answer is simple. We can’t let people censor comedy because they’re worried about potential backlash. This is America, and that can’t be tolerated.

Comedy is meant to be edgy and push the limits. That’s the sign of a free and healthy society. When you start censoring jokes because people might be offended, it’s a sign that you’re living in a sad and pathetic society.

Furthermore, if Schulz does well going independent with his special, it might signal that there’s a ton of money to be made outside of the traditional system.

Most people probably would have taken the money, made the cuts and moved on. Schulz drew a line in the sand and is sticking to his guns.

‘Refused To Let Me Die’: Lil Wayne Posts Heartfelt Message To Police Officer Who Saved His Life,"Lil Wayne posted a touching tribute to his Instagram page Sunday evening for a police officer known as “Uncle Bob” who recently passed away and who had saved the rapper’s life when he was a child.

“U refused to let me die,” the rapper wrote in the Instagram tribute. “RIP uncle Bob. Aunt Kathie been waiting for u. I’ll love & miss u both and live for us all.”

During an interview with Emmanuel Acho back in 2021, the musician spoke about the police officer who saved his life when he was 12 years old.

During the interview, Lil Wayne relived the story of his childhood suicide attempt when he shot himself in the chest with his mother’s gun. The Grammy winner said while he was laying on the floor bloodied from the gunshot wound, that the police officers who busted through the door other than Uncle Bob, were only focused on raiding the home. (RELATED: ‘Goodfellas,’ ‘Law & Order’ Actor Paul Sorvino Dead At 83)

The rapper said that Uncle Bob shifted the other officers’ focus away from the drugs in the house to helping Wayne survive. He said Uncle Bob picked him up and spoke to him encouragingly as he drove him to the hospital.

During the interview, Wayne said when he met Bob years later, he told the rapper, “I’m happy to see that I saved a life that mattered.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/07/25/lil-wayne-posts-heartfelt-message-police-officer-saved-life/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjXv7iAgLT9AhVnFVkFHf9BBwU4MhAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw2l7nDx3eQ749fkizi8CpMq,2022-07-25
‘Too Early To Say’: Two More Democrats Refuse To Say Whether They’d Support Biden In 2024,"New York Democratic Reps. Jerry Nadler and Carolyn Maloney refused to say Tuesday whether they would support President Joe Biden in 2024.

Nadler and Maloney were both asked during a debate whether Biden should run for re-election in 2024.

“Too early to say,” Nadler said. “Doesn’t serve the purpose of the Democratic Party to deal with that until after the midterms.”

Maloney also dodged the question as best she could.

“I don’t believe he’s running for re-election.”

Democrats have become increasingly hesitant to publicly endorse a potential Biden run as the president’s poll numbers crater.

Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin got into a shouting match Tuesday while on MSNBC when he refused to answer whether he would support Biden in 2024.

“Would you support Joe Biden if he’s on the ticket in 2024 as the Democratic President seeking re-election?” MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell asked.

Manchin then refused to answer, screaming he would not “talk about” the election. (RELATED: ‘Remarkable Record’: Axios Co-Founder Says Biden Is Doing A Great Job, Compares Him To Reagan)

Democratic Missouri Rep. Cori Bush also refused to give a straight answer on Biden’s possible candidacy during a recent interview with KSDK.

“Do you want to see Joe Biden run for a second term?” Bush was asked.

A Bush staffer quickly tried to interject and rush Bush out of the interview before the interviewer again pressed.

“That’s an easy question, it’s not going to take long, do you want to see Joe Biden run?”

“I don’t want to answer that question,” Bush said. “He’s the president. He has the right to run for a second term.”

A recent Quinnipiac poll found Biden’s approval rating hit 31%. Ninety-four percent of Republicans disapprove of Biden’s job as president while 67% of independents disapprove. A majority of those polled disapprove of Biden’s handling of the economy, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, foreign policy and gun violence, according to the poll.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/08/03/jerry-nadler-carolyn-maloney-biden-2024/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjXv7iAgLT9AhVnFVkFHf9BBwU4MhAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw3oJ5YMexzYSAMR532iBadU,2022-08-03
Man Accused Of Murdering Pregnant Girlfriend Who Refused To Have Abortion,"U.S. Navy Lt. Emmanuel Dewayne Coble was charged Aug. 11 with first-degree murder for allegedly killing his girlfriend, Raquiah Paulette King, according to police.

Police found King’s body in a ditch in Hanover, Virginia, on July 21, dead from an apparent gunshot wound, according to police. Coble allegedly shot King after they went to an abortion clinic together and she refused to undergo the procedure, according to a GoFundMe set up by Gregory King, who appears to be her father.

King had moved to Virginia to be with Coble, but he began pressuring her to have an abortion after she became pregnant; she refused, leading to frequent disputes, according the the GoFundMe. The two eventually went to an abortion clinic together, but King changed her mind once inside, and Coble shot her on the way home, resulting in the death of her and her unborn child, the GoFundMe alleges.(RELATED: Biden Has A New Abortion Plan: Focus On Men)

King had been 20 years old and three months pregnant, a Hanover Sheriff’s Office spokesman told People.

“I am incredibly proud of the diligence of our investigators and our law enforcement partners which led to the arrest of Emmanuel Coble. This arrest is the first step in bringing justice to Raquiah King and her family,” the Hanover Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.

Coble’s attorney did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Teacher Sent To Jail After Refusing To Use ‘Gender-Neutral’ Pronouns At Ireland School,"Enoch Burke, a school teacher in Ireland, was banned from his school over his refusal to use the pronoun “they” for a student, then arrested for returning Monday, according to the Irish news website RTE.

Wilson’s Hospital School suspended Burke from teaching while he underwent a disciplinary process for refusing to use the preferred pronouns of a student who identifies as transgender, which he said would violate his Christian beliefs, and a court issued an injunction temporarily barring him from teaching, according to RTE. Burke returned to the school anyways, and he was arrested and taken to prison.

“I am a teacher and I don’t want to go to prison,” Burke said, according to the New York Post. “I want to be in my classroom today, that’s where I was this morning when I was arrested … I love my school, with its motto Res Non Verba, ‘Actions not words,’ but I am here today because I said I would not call a boy a girl.” (RELATED: Social Media Can Influence Young Girls To Become Transgender.

To be clear, this teacher was jailed for breaching a court order, not for ‘misgendering’. But that court order barring him from the school because he refused to use ‘they’ for a male student, should never have been granted IMO. Sinister and absurd https://t.co/h5Zk2H3Cs6 — Helen Joyce (@HJoyceGender) September 6, 2022

He was initially suspended Aug. 24, and the court order came down Friday after he continued attending school anyways, according to RTE. He defied the court order blocking him from teaching Monday and told the court that it would violate his conscience to obey it.

Burke said in court that he loves his students and the subjects he teaches and that he didn’t want to go to prison, but he couldn’t violate his conscience by participating in the child’s gender transition process, according to RTE.

“To be clear, this teacher was jailed for breaching a court order, not for ‘misgendering’. But that court order barring him from the school because he refused to use ‘they’ for a male student, should never have been granted IMO,” author and commentator on transgender issues Helen Joyce wrote. “Sinister and absurd.”

Biden Admin Stonewalls Watchdog Seeking Accountability For $1 Billion Aid To Afghanistan Since Taliban Takeover,"The government body tasked with monitoring U.S. reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan said in a recent report it encountered insurmountable barriers from Biden administration agencies in its attempts to hold them accountable for over $1 billion in aid.

The Treasury Department and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) refused to comply with transparency requests from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) “in any capacity,” while the State Department selectively released information regarding the $1.1 billion in aid sent since August 2021, according to SIGAR. That violates SIGAR’s congressional mandate and undermines the American people’s interests, the organization claimed in a quarterly report, released Wednesday.

“SIGAR, for the first time in its history, is unable this quarter to provide Congress and the American people with a full accounting of this U.S. government spending due to the noncooperation of several U.S. government agencies,” the report said. “USAID and State legal counsels’ claim that SIGAR’s jurisdiction does not include such matters is not only contrary to the law, but a gross deviation from over 14 years of precedent set by three prior Administrations.”



The $1.1 billion assistance in question comes from the State Department and USAID for “food and cash support, nutrition, healthcare, protection for women and children and agricultural inputs,” according to a Sept. 23 USAID statement. (RELATED: US Prepares $3.5 Billion Fund For Foreign Country)

“The State Department was selective in the information it provided pursuant to SIGAR’s audit and quarterly data requests, sharing high-level funding data but not details of agency-supported programs in Afghanistan,” the report said.

The agencies have thwarted other congressionally mandated SIGAR reviews regarding the collapse of Afghanistan’s government, ongoing humanitarian programs and State and USAID safeguards against the Taliban seizing aid intended for the Afghan people through noncooperation, the report alleged. For example, one of the audits described in the report found that the State Department did not appropriately account for up to $32 million in assets transferred to the former Afghan government, which are now believed to be in Taliban hands.



A State Department official told SIGAR that officials prohibited staff from communicating with investigators without approval from the State Department’s legal advisers, the report said.

In #Afghanistan, U.S. agencies were seldom judged by their projects’ continued utility, but by the number of projects completed and dollars spenthttps://t.co/HXzJnsbKb1 — SIGAR (@SIGARHQ) November 1, 2022

SIGAR notified Congress of the agencies’ refusal to cooperate with the organization’s watchdog efforts, according to the report. Congress’ 2008 defense bill carved out the initial mandate for SIGAR “requiring the agencies to provide information and assistance upon request.”

The State Department claims that SIGAR’s mandate only applies to funds dedicated “for the reconstruction of Afghanistan,” an initiative that collapsed in August after the U.S. military pulled out of Afghanistan, and not to ongoing aid efforts, a State Department spokesperson told Politico.

“Treasury has complied with all legal requirements and shared information with SIGAR,” a Treasury Department spokesperson told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

We’ve provided hundreds of pages of analysis, responsive documents, and spreadsheets, and we will continue to do so for any requests that fall under SIGAR’s statutory jurisdiction,” a USAID spokesperson told the DCNF.

SIGAR countered that, operationally, “reconstruction” aid encompasses that directed toward “humanitarian” and “development” support.

“Most of the State and USAID programs outlined in this quarterly report are continuations of activities performed prior to August 2021, and State and USAID have not articulated how these programs have changed in practice,” the report said.

USAID and the Treasury Department did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s requests for comment.

‘Still In The Fight’: Kari Lake Refuses To Concede After Projectors Call Gov Race For Dem Katie Hobbs,"Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake said in a video posted Thursday morning that she was “still in this fight,” and has not conceded her race against Katie Hobbs.

“When we raised concerns and I filed a lawsuit months ago to get rid of the electronic voting machines, they said we were crazy,” Lake continued. “Well, it turns out we were right. On election day, nearly half of all polling locations had problems with tabulating machines and printers. Malfunctioning tabulation machines forced voters to wait in line for hours to exercise their sacred right to vote.”

Voting delays and malfunctions plagued Arizona’s Maricopa County on election day. At least 20% of tabulation machines in the county malfunctioned. The Maricopa County Elections Department said in a tweet that technicians were being sent to locations in which tabulators were malfunctioning. The county recorder later apologized for the significant voting delays and malfunctions that occurred.

“Tens of thousands of Maricopa County voters were disenfranchised,” Lake said in the video.

"Her Fiancé Abandoned Her When She Refused An Abortion. Years Later, She Works At Pregnancy Center That Helped Her","Faith was 21 when she became pregnant. Her fiancé and family said her life would be over unless she had an abortion. But when she stumbled on a pregnancy resource center, she found the support and help she had been refused.

“I had just found out I was pregnant, and I was driving by on Highway 72 and I saw big purple letters — ‘Pregnancy Resources Center,'” Faith told the Daily Caller in an interview. “I thought, ‘I’m a pregnant person; I wonder what they do there.'”

The pregnancy center Faith had happened upon was Pregnancy Resource Center of Rolla, in Missouri, more than a hundred miles from St. Louis. PRC of Rolla’s mission is, according to its website, “to rescue children, serve families and to end abortion in America because every human life, born and pre-born, is a unique and precious work of Divine art.”

The center is run by Joseph Dalton, PRC of Rolla’s current CEO and now Faith’s father-in-law. (RELATED: ‘Pregnancy Is Not An Illness’: Doctors Sue FDA Over Approval of ‘Dangerous’ Abortion Pill)

“We always have the attitude that no mountain is too high to climb,” Dalton told the Caller. “If a baby’s life is in jeopardy, we’ll do whatever it takes.”

“I remember specifically: ‘Anything you need, we will help you get it,'” Faith said about her experience at the pregnancy resource center.

The child’s father had issued an ultimatum: either abort the baby or end the engagement.

“My fiancé said, ‘This just isn’t the right time, we should abort this baby and try again after we’re married,’ and I also was getting less-than-encouraging statements from my family, whenever I shared my news. They were like, ‘Your life is ruined,'” Faith said. (RELATED: Man No Longer Considering Medically-Assisted Suicide Over Poverty Issues After Outpour Of Support)

“He gave me every reason to get this abortion. ‘Abort this baby or I’m gonna get full custody when this baby’s born,’ ‘I can raise this baby; you can’t financially raise this baby,’ ‘You’ll never see child support from me.’ Just all those ridiculous things they say when they’re ultimately really scared.”

Ironically enough, it was Faith’s fiancé who directed her to go back to the pregnancy resource center, thinking she could obtain an abortion there.

“I was like, ‘Well I’ve been there before. I don’t really think there’s anywhere in the area where you can get an abortion, but I’ll go there,” Faith said.

Faith was also working to finish college at the time. With her family and her fiancé shunning her for her pregnancy, finances were a worry. That’s when Faith started meeting with counselors at the pregnancy center.

“It felt really conversational, it was just about what I was going through, a place where I could really just vent I out — all the harsh comments my family was making, all the fears that I had, you know, and ultimately what I really wanted, which is I wanted to keep my baby.”

But Faith is glad she never listened to her fiancé or her family, and soon she gave birth to a beautiful baby boy, Noah, on her birthday.

“Now he’s five, and he’s a big brother now, to a one-year-old,” Faith told the Caller. “They actually have the same birthday, so I had Noah on Aug. 4 — it was my 22nd birthday — and then four years later I had my daughter on my 26th birthday and his 4th birthday. So we all three have the same birthday.”

Her daughter’s father is Gabe Dalton, the son of the pregnancy resource center’s co-founder and CEO, who Faith met when she was still pregnant with Noah and later married.

“He’s not the type of guy I had normally went for. I had normally gone for the toxic, whacky tacky guys,” she said.

As Noah grew up, Faith and Gabe’s friendship blossomed. (RELATED: New Jersey Dems Plan To Enshrine Abortion In State Constitution)

“In one particular instance, I was really struggling with Noah’s behavior in mass, and I was going up for communion and Gabe just offered to stay back with Noah while I went up for communion. And when I came back, they were both kneeling together in prayer. I had never seen Noah kneel and pray like that, so still with his eyes even closed and his hands folded,” Faith said.

“I was just like, ‘What is this? Did Gabe do this?’ And I just really saw that he was just being paternal to my child,” she recalled, “I was like, ‘Do I have a crush on Gabe Dalton?'”

Shortly after Gabe and Faith were married, Faith started feeling a call to volunteer at the pregnancy resource center that had helped her. Faith then began working as a counselor at the center, the sort of counselor she had spoken with when she was facing her unplanned pregnancy. Faith says the center she works at provides mothers everything from housing to baby formula.

The Caller asked Faith what her message would be to expectant mothers facing economic hardship or an unsupportive family, friends, or partner.

“I would just say that you’re already a mother, and the choices that you make are going to determine what kind of mother you are,” Faith said. “And choosing to be a mother is not the end of your life; it is actually the beginning of being more than you ever thought possible.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/11/21/woman-fiance-abortion-years-later-she-works-at-pregnancy-center-faith-dalton-missouri/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiJouaBgLT9AhWmD1kFHczOBy84RhAWegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw140YfDKuJ7WOHNibpD2Gdh,2022-11-21

Bolsonaro Challenges Election Legitimacy Citing Voting Machine Malfunctions,"Following weeks of refusing to concede the election, Brazilian President Jair Bolonsaro filed to contest the results Tuesday, citing voter machine malfunctions.

Bolsonaro argued that the election was plagued with malfunctioning voting machines and that any vote cast this way should be annulled, CNN reported. Analysts concluded that if these votes were negated, it would purportedly give Bolsonaro the victory. Election authorities told Bolsonaro that since the same machines were used in the first election, prior to their run-off, where no candidate won a majority, his team would need to amend the complaint to include both elections in order for it to make its way through the courts, according to the outlet’s affiliate, CNN Brazil.

The Supreme Electoral Court gave Bolsonaro 24 hours to audit the elections, or else it will reject his party’s claims, Fox News reported. (RELATED: Syrian Democratic Leader Begs US To Act As Turkey Gears Up For Invasion)

US Considering Sending Long-Range Weapons To Ukraine As Stockpiles Dwindle: REPORT,"The U.S. may send small precision bombs fitted onto rockets with a range long enough to reach targets far inside Russian lines as defense leaders scramble for options outside of shrinking U.S. weapons inventories, Reuters reported.

The Pentagon is entertaining a Boeing proposal to produce Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB) that have a 100-mile range, one of roughly half a dozen programs the U.S. is considering to sustain weapons transfers to Ukraine, Reuters reported, citing industry sources. Weapons stockpiles of the U.S. and European allies have dwindled since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, and Ukraine has not stopped demanding more, and more sophisticated weaponry.

The U.S. has declined to fill requests for the ATACMS missile, which has a 185-mile range and could allow Ukraine to strike Russian territory, fearing the potential escalation in conflict that could bring, Reuters reported. However, the GLSDB could pierce valuable targets behind Russian lines previously out of reach to Ukrainian forces and provide an additional capability to further advance its counteroffensive campaigns. (RELATED: White House Asks Congress For $38 Billion More In Ukraine Aid)

The GLSDB could be delivered as soon as spring 2023, according to a document reviewed by Reuters and three sources familiar with the matter. The plan requires the Pentagon to draw the primary components of the GLSDB — two widely-available systems, the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb and the M26 rocket motor — from existing stores, the document shows.

“It’s about getting quantity at a cheap cost,” Tom Karako, a weapons and security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Reuters. Stockpiles are “getting low relative to the levels we like to keep on hand and certainly to the levels we’re going to need to deter a China conflict.”

The plan requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to issue a so-called price discovery waiver exempting Boeing from the rigorous review to ensure the contract results in the best possible return on investment of U.S. taxpayer dollars, according to Reuters. At least six suppliers would also need to fast-track parts and services for GLSDB production to meet the spring 2023 goal.

Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Tim Gorman declined to comment on any “specific capability” the department is considering for Ukraine, according to Reuters, but said the U.S. and partners “identify and consider the most appropriate systems” for aiding Ukraine.

Plummeting inventories account for the increased pressure on the Pentagon and European allies’ defense ministries to step up domestic production, Karako explained, according to Reuters.

European countries are “putting a lot of orders” for U.S.-made weapons, Doug Bush, who coordinates weapons purchases for the U.S. Army, told the Pentagon last week, according to Reuters.

However, defense contractors have struggled to meet existing demand. The U.S. will have to dramatically ramp up production, or otherwise risk further weakening the U.S. arsenal and adversely affecting America’s ability to react to dangers from China and other potential foes, experts previously told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The DOD did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Man Broke Into School To Save 24 People In Storm After Nearby Houses Refused Him Shelter,"A Buffalo man who was refused shelter from nearby houses broke into a school Saturday night to seek shelter, saving two dozen other people in the mix.

Jay Withey got stuck in his truck Friday night during the deadly snow storm that rocked Buffalo. Withey allowed two other strangers to sleep in his car with him, according to WBEN before trying to find shelter at any of the nearby homes.

“I walked to the houses to see if I could find shelter, any house that had lights on,” Withey told the station. “I had $500 that I was offering, to sleep on their floor.”

But everyone turned Withey down, forcing him to go back to his truck. (RELATED: Fed-Up Armed Locals Defend Buffalo Neighborhood From Looters)

Do you recognize “Merry Christmas Jay”?

“It’s the only time in my life I actually thought I was going to die.”

Then his truck ran out of fuel Saturday morning, forcing Withey to think quick or the trio would freeze to death.

“Off to the left, I could see there was a school about 600, 700 feet away from us. I knew the power would be on, there would be heat in there and I was guaranteeing there would be food in there,” Withey reportedly said.

Withey stopped along the way to get others who had been stranded, including seven senior citizens, and broke into the Pine Hill Primary Center. The group set up shelter in the cafeteria and only ate what was needed.

The group moved out late Christmas Day, but no before Jay cleared all the cars of the individuals who spent the night with him.

Prior to leaving, he fixed the broken window at the school with cardboard and duct tape and apologized for breaking in.

“To whomever it may concern, I’m terribly sorry about breaking the school window and for breaking in the kitchen,” he wrote. “I had to do it to save everyone and get them shelter and food and a bathroom. Merry Christmas Jay.”

The Cheektowaga Police Department found the letter when they responded to the break in and asked for help finding Withey, assuring him he would not face charges.

Police later identified him and thanked him, with Withey telling authorities he and the group he rescued were planning a summer get together.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/12/30/buffalo-man-broke-into-school-saved-people/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwim3oqBgLT9AhURElkFHQ0rDKU4PBAWegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw34c8h8Omkc1lKkprOnabIu,2022-12-30
GOP Infighting Hits Fever Pitch Ahead Of Speaker Vote,"House Republican infighting hit a fever pitch Tuesday over California Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s bid to be the next Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Several GOP House members announced after a closed-door meeting Tuesday morning their intention to vote against McCarthy in the next vote for House leader. The press conference lasted just under 30 minutes and included Republican Representatives Matt Gaetz, Scott Perry and Lauren Boebert.

Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry told reporters he wouldn’t support McCarthy for Speaker because he neglected to fix Washington while in leadership positions for over a decade until opposing members forced his hand.

“Every single American agrees –even the guy [who] wants to be speaker agrees – that Washington is broken,” said Perry. “Interestingly enough, over the 14 years that [McCarthy’s] been in leadership, he’s done almost virtually nothing to change it. And under pressure from a group of members, who have said that we’re not any longer going to accept the status quo, we have been able to force rule changes to make things better.”

Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert said her vote against McCarthy came after he refused to acquiesce to her “hardline” request to include procedures that would hold the House Speaker accountable.

“I’ve said from the beginning that my hardline was the motion to vacate– single member motion to vacate. You cannot demand more responsibility and less accountability. And Kevin McCarthy was taking the path of Nancy Pelosi and following her precedence with the motion to vacate,” Boebert said.

Boebert added that McCarthy “eagerly” dismissed a deal that would see him win the leadership position on the first ballot, including protecting the border and adding Congressional term limits.

Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz told reporters he opposes McCarthy but takes “no joy in this discomfort that this moment has brought.”

“If you want to drain the swamp, you cannot put the biggest alligator in charge of the exercise,” Gaetz said. “We offered Kevin McCarthy terms last evening that he rejected.” (RELATED: To Save The American Dream, The GOP Should Shut Down The Government)

“It is true that we struggle with trust with Mr. McCarthy. Because time and again, his viewpoints, his positions, they shift like sands underneath you,” Gaetz added. “Even Kevin McCarthy’s own mentor recently said that the lies always change. Mr. McCarthy is not only responsive to pressure from the right, time and again, he has failed to achieve the goals that we seek on spending.”

Gaetz said McCarthy failed to get House GOP members his “battle plan” for important issues, including “folks in the military who feel like they’re being purged.”

“All we got was a handful of howdy and a mouthful of much obliged,” he said. “So we do not want to be here at this moment. We would prefer to have a unity of purpose, but we will not continue to allow the uni-party to run this town without a fight.”

In a closed-door meeting Tuesday morning, McCarthy admitted that as many as twenty GOP house members would be voting against him in the next vote for House leader, Politico reported.

McCarthy told reporters he’s “not going anywhere” despite the lack of support from these members for his bid for House Speaker because “we’re not empowering certain members over others.”

“Well, that’s not about America, and I will always fight to put the American people first, not a few individuals that want something for themselves. So we may have a battle on the floor, but the battle is for the conference and the country. And that’s fine with me,” McCarthy said.

“Look, I have the record for the longest speech ever on the floor. I don’t have a problem getting a record for the most votes for Speaker, too,” he added.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/03/mccarthy-gop-speaker-vote-congress-gaetz/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiq6Mr-_7P9AhVBk4kEHX0hA5k4FBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw2qqbSZJ58H3Fxj1RBJzfnP,2023-01-03
Teen Allegedly Shoots Girl In The Head After She Refused To Pick Weed Off Floor: Police,"A Kentucky teen turned himself in Tuesday after he allegedly shot a teenage girl over refusing to pick his weed off the floor earlier that morning, according to police.

The suspect, 18-year-old Demarkus Hedges, turned himself in around 2:30 p.m., over twelve hours following an incident where he allegedly killed 16-year-old Scarlett Tucker. The Boone County Sheriff’s Office sought him on one count of murder, one count of tampering with physical evidence and two counts of second-degree unlawful transaction with a minor, according to a press release from Boone County Sheriff Michael A. Helmig.

Police are working with three witnesses, a 17-year-old female, an 18-year-old female and an 18-year-old male, according to the release.

Tucker, Hedges and the three witnesses allegedly spent most of Monday night into Tuesday morning together around the Covington, Kentucky, and Cincinnati, Ohio, areas, Fox19 noted. The group made their way to the 18-year-old female’s residence on Silver Brook Drive in Burlington, Kentucky, at around 1:30 a.m., where Hedges apparently dropped a bag of weed onto the bedroom floor. He asked Tucker to pick it up, who reportedly refused, allegedly prompting him to shoot her in the head, according to police.

The witnesses called deputies to the scene at around 2:18 a.m., according to the outlet. (REPORT: Two Men Arrested For Shooting At Christmas Pajama Party)

‘Clear Violation’: Illinois Sheriffs Refuse To Enforce New Restrictive Gun Law,"Several Illinois sheriffs will not enforce the state’s recently passed gun law, with many arguing it violates the Second Amendment, according to NBC Chicago.

Sheriffs from Kankakee County, Boone County, Winnebago County and McHenry County posted messages on social media saying they will not comply with the portion of the law that requires residents to register their guns with the state, according to NBC Chicago. The recently passed law, HB 5471, will outlaw the sale, manufacture, possession and purchase of “assault-style” weapons, while also limiting magazine capacity to 10 rounds for long guns and 15 rounds for handguns.

Kankakee County Sheriff Mike Downey shared a message on Facebook Wednesday, saying that one of his duties is to protect the Constitution, including the right to “keep and bear arms for defense of life, liberty and property,” he said in the post. (RELATED: ‘I Will Go Down With The Ship If Need Be’: Sheriff Says He Will Not Give FBI Info On Legal Gun Owners)

“As the custodian of the jail and chief law enforcement official for Kankakee County, that neither myself nor my office will be checking to ensure that lawful gun owners register their weapons with the State, nor will we be arresting or housing law abiding individuals that have been charged solely with non-compliance of this Act,” Downey continued, calling the law a “clear violation” of the Second Amendment.

McHenry County Sheriff Robb Tadelman said that his office would also not enforce the gun registration required by the new law.

“Neither myself nor my office will be checking to ensure that lawful gun owners register their weapons with the state, nor will we be arresting or housing law abiding individuals that have been charged solely with non-compliance with this act,” Tadelman said in a social media post, according to NBC Chicago.

Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s office called the announcements “political grandstanding at its worst,” saying the sheriffs are violating their oath of office, according to NBC Chicago.

“The assault weapons ban is the law of Illinois. The General Assembly passed the bill and the governor signed it into law to protect children in schools, worshippers at church and families at parades from the fear of sudden mass murder,” the spokesperson told NBC Chicago. “Sheriffs have a constitutional duty to uphold the laws of the state, not pick and choose which laws they support and when.”

Alongside law enforcement officials, pro-gun rights groups are gearing up for war over the “unconstitutional” law. The National Rifle Association (NRA) plans to counter the law, telling the Daily Caller News Foundation that it “will fight this unconstitutional ban.”

The Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) plans to “see Illinois in Federal court,” SAF Executive Vice President Alan Gottlieb told the DCNF. “We will not allow this blatant attack on the right to keep and Bear arms to go unchallenged,” he said.

Pritzker’s office did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Court Rules Against Masterpiece Cakeshop Owner Who Refused To Bake Gender Transition Cake,"A Colorado Court of Appeals judge ruled against Christian baker Jack Phillips Thursday after he appealed an earlier court decision requiring him to bake a cake for an individual’s gender transition.

Phillips won a previous case at the Supreme Court in 2018 after he declined to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, but was sued again in March 2021, after a transgender individual wanted Phillips, who owns Masterpiece Cakeshop, to make a cake that was blue on the outside and pink on the inside. Alliance for Defending Freedom (ADF) announced in a press release Thursday that the Colorado Court of Appeals had ruled against Phillips, but said that a plan was already in motion to appeal the ruling.

The court determined that Phillips’ right to religious freedom did not fall under First Amendment protection. (RELATED: Christian Baker Prevails At Supreme Court In Same-Sex Wedding Cake Dispute)

“Turning to the constitutional issues presented, the division concludes that the act of baking a pink cake with blue frosting does not constitute protected speech under the First Amendment,” the court wrote. “Additionally, the division concludes that CADA’s prohibition against discrimination based on a person’s transgender status does not violate a proprietor’s right to freely exercise or express their religion.”

Autumn Scardina, a transgender woman and attorney, attempted to order a cake for a gender transition party on the same day the Supreme Court announced it would hear Phillips’ case regarding his refusal to bake a cake celebrating a gay wedding, according to ADF’s press release. Phillips said he could not make the cake because it would force him to violate his religious beliefs.

The Colorado court further argued that there is “no inherent meaning or expressed message” from Scardina’s cake request, the opinion read. Additionally, the court ruled that Phillips’ right to an accommodation due to his religious beliefs failed to supersede Scardina’s “protected status” since the requested cake did not have an explicit message, “whether secular or religious.”

Scardina’s attorney, John McHugh, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the ruling was a “victory” for his client and the “greater LGBTQ community.”

“The court held that Masterpiece Cakeshop broke the law when it refused to sell a birthday cake to Ms. Scardina because she is a transgender woman,” McHugh said. “In doing so, the court rejected the defendants’ free speech argument because, as defendants admitted at trial, a pink cake with blue frosting does not have any inherent meaning and the act of selling a cake is not speech. Similarly, the Court held, consistent with U.S. Supreme Court precedent, that Mr. Phillips’ religious beliefs do not exempt him from anti-discrimination laws.”

Jake Warner, ADF senior counsel, told the DCNF that the court’s arguments ignore Supreme Court precedent, and that despite the cake having no written message, protection of “symbolic speech” is within the rights granted by the First Amendment.

“What we have here is a cake that symbolically expresses the message and the Supreme Court in many cases throughout history has recognized that symbolic speech is protected speech,” Warner said. “Just because speech is symbolic does not mean it’s not protected, quite the opposite, the First Amendment says the government can’t force you to promote even symbolic speech that you disagree with.”

Warner also said that this court’s latest ruling had not deterred their team from defending Phillips’ right to religious freedom, noting that they planned to start the appeal process soon.

“Jack serves everyone regardless of their background,” Warner said. “He just can’t promote every message through his custom cakes and he’s being punished for that.”

Billionaire Nelson Peltz Sues Fired Wedding Planners Who Refused To Return Deposit,"Actress Nicola Peltz and her father, billionaire investor Nelson Peltz, filed a lawsuit against wedding planners Nicole Braghin and Arianna Grijalba after they refused to return the $159,000 deposit they received for Nicola’s wedding, the Daily Mail reported Wednesday.

Nelson claimed he and his wife Claudia hired Braghin and Grijalba in March 2022 when they booked the pair’s company, Plan Design Events, to coordinate their daughter’s big day. Braghin and Grijalba came onboard six weeks before the high-profile wedding in place of a previous wedding planner with whom the Peltz family had parted ways, the outlet reported. Nelson alleges in his lawsuit that nine days into their agreement, it became apparent that Grijalba and Braghin were not equipped to handle their 500-person event, but that they refused to return his money when he let them go, according to the Daily Mail.

“The celebrity of the wedding couple combined with the anticipated attendance of many high-profile guests required that the wedding planner have the expertise and staffing to plan, coordinate and execute a wedding event of the expected caliber and complexity,” the lawsuit reads, according to the Daily Mail.

Nelson’s legal filing included text messages between Nicola and the wedding planners indicating an error made with a guest named Lewis Hamilton. The planners indicated he had confirmed his attendance with an RSVP, but he had told the couple he was unable to attend.

“I need time to do this,” Grijalba allegedly wrote in a text to Nicola. “I’m going to take a moment to learn the app and send you the information, I hate looking like a fool but I hate the most not giving you what you need ASAP. I will be back soon,” she said, according to the Daily Mail.

Nicola replied by text and called out the wedding planner. “That’s not true. He didn’t rsvp AT ALL.” (RELATED: ‘So, I’m An Alcoholic’: Tracy Morgan Admits To Addiction And Describes How He’s Turning His Life Around)

Nelson’s legal filing didn’t stop at the text disputes surrounding the allegedly mismanaged RSVP process. He went on to claim that Grijalba’s habit of drinking on the job also negatively impacted his daughter’s wedding.

Nelson claims Grijalba posted messages in their group chat indicating she was “going for a tequila before her head exploded,” the outlet noted.

“Peltz had presented them with the opportunity of a lifetime – to have their names associated with the wedding of two world-famous celebrities, which would undoubtedly propel PDE into wedding planning stardom,” the Peltz’ lawyer wrote in a statement, according to Page Six. “In reality, however, it later became clear that PDE viewed this is as an opportunity to take advantage of Peltz by making material misrepresentations on both their website and in person regarding their experience, expertise and capability of planning the wedding,” the attorney wrote, per the outlet.

The Peltz family added their legal fees to the damages they are seeking through the court filing.

"Employees Fired For Refusing COVID Vaccine Labeled With ‘Problem Codes’ That Were Sent To FBI, Legal Group Says","The New York City Department of Education marked employees fired for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine with a “problem code,” affecting their ability to get rehired, and also sent that information to the FBI, according to oral arguments from Alliance Defending Freedom Wednesday.

John Bursch, an attorney for ADF, pointed out that a particular religious leader’s feelings on the vaccine could impact whether or not an employee trying to obtain a religious exemption would succeed.

“What is really horrible about that is not only does it affect their ability to get rehired by the state of New York, it affects their ability to go to any other employer because that problem code note is paired with their fingerprints as a warning flag and sent to the FBI and the New York criminal justice services,” Bursch told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Many employees fired for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine for religious reasons will not be able to get rehired due to being assigned a “problem code” by the New York City Department of Education (DOE), a code that is also sent to the FBI, according to oral arguments made Wednesday by Alliance Defending Freedom in the case of New Yorkers for Religious Liberty v. the City of New York.

Mayor Eric Adams announced that New York City’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for city employees will end on Feb. 10 after thousands of workers were fired for declining to adhere to the rule, but stated that those workers would now be able to reapply for their positions. Alliance for Defending Freedom (ADF), a legal firm focused on protecting the First Amendment rights of Americans, pointed out during oral arguments that many former employees would not be able to get their jobs back because the DOE had marked workers who refused to comply with the mandate with a “problem code” that is also tied to their fingerprints and sent to the FBI. (RELATED: Dr. Fauci Admits COVID Shots Didn’t Have A Chance Of Controlling The Pandemic)

John Bursch, attorney for Alliance Defending Freedom, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the mayor’s claim about fired employees getting rehired was ” just not true in every case.”

“Even for those who are eligible for reinstatement, when they apply they’ve all got so-called ‘problem codes’ in their personal file because they purportedly failed to fulfill a contractual condition, which was to get vaccinated,” Bursch said. “What is really horrible about that is not only does it affect their ability to get rehired by the state of New York, it affects their ability to go to any other employer because that ‘problem code’ note is paired with their fingerprints as a warning flag and sent to the FBI and the New York criminal justice services.”

Workers discovered that they had been flagged with “problem codes” and told that they could not get them removed until they had fulfilled the necessary work requirements by getting vaccinated, several documents, including employee files and email correspondence, provided to the DCNF by ADF show. One email sent from the DOE stated that “all employees who were placed on 2VM vaccine mandate leave” were given codes.

Another document, filed by an attorney with knowledge of the case, argued that the DOE’s claims that “problem codes” can only be viewed by the department are untrue.

“To the contrary, any non-DOE school or official that wants to learn whether a former DOE employee has a problem code in his or her personnel file can easily do so in a variety of ways,” the attorney wrote. “For example, non-DOE schools which offer DOE-funded positions have access to the DOE’s payment portal, Galaxy, which allows them to see problem codes; indeed Plaintiffs present evidence of at least 15 former DOE employees who were not hired at non-DOE schools because the non-DOE schools discovered their problem codes.”

One former employee, a teacher and therapist at NYC’s Early Intervention Program for children with disabilities or developmental issues, said that she was informed about her “problem code” by the agency she was working with, which has no affiliation with the DOE and should not have access to the “problem code,” according to documents from ADF.

“I was shocked that I had been flagged as ineligible to work, because such problem codes often indicate poor performance reviews, misconduct, or even criminal activity. None of these apply to me,” the employee said in her statement. “I did not understand how someone from outside the DOE could even possess this incorrect information about me, I was extremely embarrassed by its negative implications, and I was immensely disappointed that I had to inform the families that I had been assigned to that I could not service their children.”

Bursch told the DCNF that, for example, Pope Francis’ endorsement of the vaccine made it much more difficult for New York Catholics to obtain a religious exemption.

“The city simply didn’t like that some people objected to the vaccine on religious grounds and they punished them for that,” Bursch said.

Adams, the New York City DOE and the FBI did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

"Buttigieg’s Office Refuses To Say Why He Took Photo Of DCNF’s Jennie Taer, Demands Reporter Turn Off Camera","EAST PALESTINE, Ohio – Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg’s press secretary refused on Thursday to say why he took a photo of Daily Caller News Foundation investigative reporter Jennie Taer, who confronted the secretary over a train derailment that spilled toxic chemicals in Ohio.

Buttigieg took a photo of Taer on Tuesday after she pressed him on his message to the people of East Palestine, Ohio, following the derailment of a train carrying toxic chemicals which prompted evacuations and shelter-in-place orders. During his visit to East Palestine on Thursday, Buttigieg’s press secretary would not say why the photo of Taer was taken and refused to answer what was being done with the photo even after DCNF reporter Alexa Schwerha turned her camera off.

“I’m happy to answer your question. I would like for you guys to not have your cameras on,” Buttigieg’s press secretary told Schwerha.

The Department of Transportation has not responded to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment on why the photo of Taer was taken.

“Well, I’d refer you to about a dozen interviews I’ve given today, and if you’d like to reach conversation, be sure to reach out to the press office,” Buttigieg told Taer, adding that he was taking some “personal time,” when she approached him on Tuesday.

“I guess he didn’t like that so he took a pic of me,” Taer posted on Twitter about the conversation.

On Feb. 3, a Norfolk Southern freight train carrying toxic chemicals derailed outside of East Palestine causing 2,000 residents to evacuate before a controlled chemical fumes were released in order to prevent an explosion. Buttigieg has come under fire for not addressing the derailment until Feb. 13 in a thread on Twitter.
