"1,000 Activists Shut Down California Highway To Protest Shootings","Protesters shut down California’s highway in Oakland Thursday night after setting off fireworks to protest the recent cop shootings of two black men.

About 1,000 protesters marched down Oakland’s I-880 highway in protest of cop shootings of the two black men from Minnesota and Louisiana, reports CBS Local. The protests blocked both lanes of traffic around 8:30 p.m.and lit fireworks.

The protest started with approximately 2,000 people who split off into two groups, reports The Mercury News. Half of the group blocked the highways, while the other 1,000 stayed to protest in the city.

“The whole damn system is guilty as hell,” the crowd shouted in the city. Minister Ben McBride organized the rally, and led part of the crowd to the Oakland Police Department headquarters, where he read a list of demands in front of the police station. He accused the department of various crimes, including murder.

McBride painted the doors of the police headquarters with red paint to symbolize “the blood that’s been spilled.”

“F— the police” and “All cops sucks” was graffitied in the city, the NBC local reported, while windows at businesses like Foot Locker and Chase Bank were smashed. Police described the crowds mostly peaceful, according to Abc 7.

Asians For Black Lives joined the protests with some members of the group carrying signs reading, “Third Worlds for Black Power.” Asians For Black Lives supports Black Lives Matter because it believes that Asians ” have often been used as part of a “divide-and-conquer” strategy to uphold white supremacy.”

“We’re here together. Some of us have been here for a long time. Until black liberation is won, we’re not going away,” Devika Ghai said.

Both highway lanes re-opened around 1:15 a.m.

Gay rights advocates protest marriage defenders,"The National Organization for Marriage (NOM) is traveling around the country on a month-long tour promoting traditional marriage. The “Summer for Marriage Tour 2010: One Man One Woman” is targeting some of the key battleground areas in the ongoing debate over gay marriage.

Maggie Gallagher, president of the Institute for Marriage and Public Policy and one of the event’s speakers, told The Daily Caller that the group plans to stop in 23 cities in 19 states. “We recognize we need to get out there and rally the troops,” she said. “Our goal is to attract and educate supporters and activists”

While tour participants have been peaceful, gay rights activists at a couple stops have responded with venom, according to Brian Brown, president of the NOM.

Last Saturday, the tour stopped in Albany, New York and last Sunday in Providence, Rhode Island. In both places, Brown said, marriage advocates were besieged by gay rights protesters.

In Albany, activists surrounded the NOM crowd — carrying rainbow umbrellas and wearing red shirts that said “see my love” — and pushed their way onto the stage, as seen in a YouTube video provided by the NOM. There were also reports of individual incidents of intimidation, including harassment of a nursing mother, a verbal threat to kidnap a participant’s child, and garden variety name calling.

“Their goal was intimidating my family, me, and my three small children,” a nursing mother said on the YouTube video of the event provided by the NOM. “I think they did the job.”

In Providence, the protesters got much more out of hand, Brown told TheDC. “I’d never seen anything like it in my life,” he said, “and I’ve been involved in the same-sex marriage issue for years…Ive been in the heart of these debates and at a lot of rallies and have never experienced something like this.”

During the Providence rally at the state’s Capitol building, an estimated 150 protesters surrounded the rally of nearly 250, shaking rocks in bottles to make loud noises, according to Brown. Brown said the protesters then entered the crowd shouting in the faces of the marriage supporters. Several even rushed the stage during Brown’s speech.

“As I was speaking, three protesters jumped in front of the podium and started screaming in my face as I was trying to speak,” Brown said. “This is the face of tolerance, they say they want tolerance, but look at how they act when they are confronted with ideas they do not agree with.”

The gay rights activists did not just harass the adult participants. According to Brown, children at the rally were also targets of the verbal vitriol as gay rights activists reportedly called the children names and taunted them, using such language as: “Are mommy and daddy raising you to be a little bigot” or “is mommy a bigot?”

“I’ve never seen this kind of hate and border-line violence, I mean going after children? Making them cry? I’ve never seen it before,” Brown said.

“We need to confront this hate with love and respect,” Brown continued. “People were scared and I was really worried something dangerous would occur. These people were just so mad and screaming so loudly I was concerned it could get physical.”

The Capitol police eventually called in the State Highway Patrol to help restore order. No arrests were made.

Fred Sainz, vice president at the Human Rights Campaign, told TheDC that regardless of what has happened on the ground, he does not think the intentions of the tour are as innocent as they appear. “It is less about traditional marriage and more of an elaborate stunt,” he said. “They want this type of harassment for lawsuits so that they are able to pepper their suits with stories and hide the identities of their donors.”

Gallagher, on the other hand, sees these tours as providing an opportunity to expose the gay rights movement. “Because we were there with cameras we were able to show a face of the gay rights movement that the mainstream media refuse to show,” she said.

The “Summer of Marriage Tour” will end on August 15th with a rally in Washington, D.C.

Tibetans in China protest plans to curb their language,"BEIJING — Thousands of Tibetan students in western China have protested since Tuesday against proposals to curb or eliminate the use of the Tibetan language in local schools, according to reports from Tibet advocacy groups and photographs and video of the protests circulating on the Internet.

The protests are the largest in Tibetan areas since the March 2008 uprising that began in Lhasa and spread across the Tibetan plateau. But unlike those protests, these have been peaceful and have involved mostly students.

A protest against the proposed policies was also held in Beijing on Friday afternoon, drawing hundreds of Tibetan students at a prominent university that specializes in teaching ethnic minorities, according to witness reports and photographs.

The widespread protests over language reveal the deep resentment that many Tibetans feel over policies formulated by the Han, China’s dominant ethnic group, that Tibetans say are diluting their culture. Many Tibetans in western China also complain of strict controls over the practice of Tibetan Buddhism, including a ban on images of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, and large-scale Han migration to Tibetan towns. The Han end up taking many jobs that would otherwise go to Tibetans.

The latest resistance is over a proposal to shift school instruction fully or almost fully to China’s official language, Mandarin.

"CAIR video of protest lacks context, say demonstrators","Participants at a protest outside an Islamic Circle of North America Relief (ICNA) USA fundraiser are disputing the way the gathering has been characterized in edited footage the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) is circulating.

In mid-February hundreds of Californians gathered outside the Yorba Linda Community Center to protest the anti-American rhetoric supported by the ICNA event’s speakers — Imam Siraj Wahhaj, who was named as an un-indicted co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and Amir Abdel Malik Ali, a self-identified supporter of the terrorist group Hezbollah.

According to reports from witnesses, among hundreds of attendees there was a small faction that got out of line. CAIR has put out footage of those few, reportedly serving to demonize the entire group, including elected officials who spoke at the protest rally nearby.

“We spoke at the park adjacent to the community center, and I spoke to the issue of Wahhaj and Malik-Ali, the speakers at the community center,” said California Republican Rep. Ed Royce in a statement. “It is regrettable that some protesters at the community center yelled insults at Imam Wahhaj’s supporters. I disavow those remarks and conduct. It was wrong. Nothing should deflect from the radicalism of Wahhaj and Malik-Ali,”

Pamela Geller, co-founder of the Freedom Defense Initiative and Stop Islamization of America, also took issue with CAIR’s characterization of the event.

“[T]hat video was cut to highlight bad behavior, which I don’t encourage, nor do you see at my rallies,” Geller told the blog Mental Recession.“It is also important to remember that ICNA is not a benign charitable organization, but an Islamic supremacist group with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. It explicitly calls for Sharia rule, which institutionalizes oppression of women and non-Muslims and denies the freedom of speech and the freedom of conscience. This does not excuse people behaving obnoxiously toward ICNA members, but ICNA itself stands for a far greater repression and denial of human rights than that which is represented by a few insulting remarks.”

The first vice chair of the Orange County G.O.P. Organizing Committee, Deborah Pauly — who is seen in the video saying that her son is a Marine and that she knows “quite a few Marines who would be very happy to help these terrorists to an early meeting in paradise” — told the local NBC affiliate that her words were taken out of context to fit the narrative.

“This was edited to completely change the context. I was referring to terrorists who believe their actions of violence will lead them to paradise, and not the people at the fundraiser,” Pauly said, adding that the group featured in the video were likely not with the original protesters, since the footage was shot in the evening while her group protested in the afternoon.

In a statement CAIR-LA condemned the protesters.

“We support the First Amendment right of protesters anywhere in America to voice their concerns, dissent and even hatred. However, when our nation’s foundational values of inclusiveness, pluralism and equality are attacked by some in favor of calls for advocating hate and violence, then all Americans have a responsibility to challenge and expose such bigotry and those who enable it.”

The video has appeared in numerous news outlets including the Huffington Post and Al Jazeera.

‘Kill the cops!’ shout reported during ‘Occupy New Orleans’ protest,"NEW ORLEANS – The “Occupy Wall Street” movement came to the Big Easy on Thursday, but its expression of varied and often clashing political messages quickly turned difficult.

As about 500 New Orleans protesters marched, complete with a small brass band, from Orleans Parish Prison to the Federal Reserve and then inside City Hall, one activist told The Daily Caller she heard shouts of “Kill the cops!”

With tensions running high between police and protesters outside the prison, marcher Buick McKane said she had no interest in provoking law enforcement. She told TheDC she was there to advocate for “small, transparent government.”

McKane was not the only one to defy left-wing agitator stereotypes. With a “Tax the rich!” chant a block ahead, an anarchist named Mary cried “The state is violence! End the Fed!”

Reflecting on the crowd’s more socialist sentiments, Mary said: “That’s alright. … People don’t understand. They get confused.”

Outside the prison, protestors denounced both the size of the American prison system and what they said was local police corruption. One scandal that attracted some focus was a 2005 police shooting that killed two people and wounded four more — all unarmed — at New Orleans’ Danziger Bridge.

Marcher Rosanna Cruz tied the prisons to Wall Street and bank bailouts, telling TheDC that “Wall Street is where all our money and resources are going … people who can’t find jobs all go into the underground economy and from there they wind up in jail.” (RELATED: Organizer admits to pay ‘Occupy DC’ protesters)

Ultimately, police and protesters managed to keep the peace without arrests or pepper spray. Even when one man heckled marchers and yelled that they should “go home,” protesters told the police that “he’s entitled to his opinion.”

The heckler, Michael Nohrenberg, told TheDC he was exasperated by a protest culture that he saw as an expression of laziness. Someone, he said, should “make them go out and work and get jobs. They want all this free stuff!”

Chants of “tax the rich” and signs reading “Tax the 1%” were hard to miss, but some protesters were light on specifics. Many called vaguely for more “progressive” taxation to shift the burden from the lower classes. Currently, about half of American wage-earners pay no income tax.

Those who offered specific solutions most commonly cited the “Tobin tax,” a sales tax on financial transactions such as stock purchases. About half of American households own shares of stock in one form or another.

During an open-mic time in front of the Federal Reserve Bank, a bullhorn passed between speakers wearing Ron Paul stickers and others sporting shirts claiming that “Housing is a human right!”

After several consecutive speakers plugged Rep. Paul, the Texas congressman, as “the only one” seeking to end the Federal Reserve system, several in the crowd became restless and started booing and chanting, “Ron Paul sucks!,” and “End Capitalism!”

One marcher worried aloud that the Ron Paul contingent would not “fight for people’s needs, repeal free-market policies and end structural racism in America.” The crowd Thursday was predominantly white.

Protester Matt Freimyth held a sign that said “Ron Paul is not the answer.” He told TheDC, “This is the wrong environment to be campaigning for any politician.” He was, however, sporting a “Brees for President” sticker. Drew Brees is the New Orleans Saints quarterback.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2011/10/07/kill-the-cops-shout-reported-during-occupy-new-orleans-protest/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjD2bnugLT9AhUEEVkFHevqAlQ4PBAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw3WrCw5K2K1bIBcLm5Pu71N,2011-10-07
Seven women protest Rush for NOW’s big day of protest [VIDEO],"Seven women participated in the National Organization for Women’s day of protest against Rush Limbaugh in front of Limbaugh’s D.C. affiliate WMAL, Friday.

NOW’s national protest day had been in the works since April 19, when the women’s advocacy group launched their “Enough Rush” campaign.

Pairing with media watchdog Media Matters for America NOW is targeting local affiliates and local advertisers, Friday’s demonstration was touted as the group’s big demonstration of opposition to Limbaugh with affiliates across the country participating in protests.

NOW has had Limbaugh in their crosshairs for nearly two decades, and they renewed their effort to get Limbaugh off the air as a response to the radio host’slate February insult of contraception activist Sandra Fluke.

Standing on a street corner in front of WMAL the seven women bearing signs such as “Enough Rush” and “Stop hate speech” received some honks and smiles.

Erin Matson, NOW action vice president explained to The Daily Caller that Limbaugh crossed the line with his comments about Fluke and that he needs to go.

“Rush captured a new generation of women’s attention when he went on a long sexist tirade against Sandra Fluke for daring to speak up for birth control access,” Matson explained, recalling Limbaugh’s characterization of Fluke as a “slut” and a prostitute.

According to Matson, the community is on NOW’s side, adding that “it is a smart business decision” for affiliates and advertisers to leave Rush.

“Women are the majority of consumers in this country and we influence or make over 80 percent of the consumer decisions,” she said, adding that Limbaugh has already lost a number of advertisers over his Fluke comments.

Still TheDC overheard pedestrian conversations scoffing at the fact NOW is still on Limbaugh’s case, over two months after his Fluke comments.

Last week Limbaugh launched a response to NOW’s campaign against him in the form of a Facebook group for his female listeners, “Rush Babes for America aka the National Organization for Rush Babes,” to show not all women adhere the NOW agenda. His Facebook group surpassed NOW’s Facebook “likes” in under 24 hours.

Matson shrugged off the women who have joined the “Rush Babe” Facebook group explaining that it is just an attempt by Rush to feed his ego.

Limbaugh ranked 19th in Forbes ranking of the 100 world’s most powerful celebrities released this week, just behind Simon Cowell, at 18th.

According to NOW, chapters in New York City, West Palm Beach, Fla., and Phoenix, Ariz., also held protests against Limbaugh today.

Secret Service shuts down ‘Fire Holder’ protest outside White House,"WASHINGTON — Secret Service agents shut down a protest outside the White House on Monday where about 30 young protesters demanded President Barack Obama fire Attorney General Eric Holder.

Agents on scene claimed a backpack abandoned on a sidewalk was a “suspicious package,” closing the Pennsylvania Avenue pedestrian mall in front of the White House, and the adjoining Lafayette Park, from protesters and tourists. All pedestrian traffic, including media, was forced to retreat to side streets.

Officers roped the streets off with bright yellow crime scene tape and brought in bomb-sniffing K-9 dogs.

After waiting on the sidewalk behind the police line for about half an hour, a middle-aged woman came forward to claim the backpack, telling agents that she had put her small bag on the ground so she could take a photograph with her family. She declined to be interviewed.

The protesters had a National Park Service protest permit from 10 a.m. to noon. Agents began clearing the crowd at 10:43 a.m., giving little information to protesters and tourists as they forced them out of the area.

Organizer Oliver Darcy told The Daily Caller that he didn’t believe the protest’s premature end was an accident. Darcy noted that he and others were demanding the president fire his attorney general over a scandal the White House doesn’t want to talk about.

“To me, it seems like a bit of an overreaction to evacuate the entire — like — I don’t know. Was the White House evacuated?” Darcy said.

“On Pennsylvania Avenue, they shut the entire block down, you know? From my judgment, it seemed like an overreaction, but I don’t work for the Secret Service and I know they take this stuff very seriously.”

“It did seem very odd that during a protest of Attorney General Eric Holder and Barack Obama in front of the White House that all of a sudden there was a mysterious bag left — accidentally, right?” Darcy continued.

“I really don’t know, but she [the backpack’s owner] looked like she was pretty sincere that she left it accidentally, but I’m not a secret service agent so I don’t know what the protocol is. … I’ve taken part in multiple protests in front of the Supreme Court, in front of the Capitol Building, in front of the White House. Never have I seen anything like this before.”

Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary told The Daily Caller later that law enforcement was not trying to chill protesters’ free speech rights. “We had an unattended package, and we cleared it for public safety,” he said.

Leary admitted the “unattended package” turned out to be “absolutely nothing.”

“We responded as we always do with our SOP [standard operating procedure],” Leary said.

Leary said the Secret Service would not “characterize” the package but made the decision to close down the area out of “an abundance of caution.”

Leary added that the Secret Service has “unattended packages frequently around the White House complex,” and called Monday’s reaction “standard.”

“We frequently deal with unattended packages at the White House complex and that’s the way we respond to all of them,” he said.

Protesters were outside the White House Monday to demand President Obama fire Holder and release documents related to Operation Fast and Furious that he has concealed from congressional investigators by asserting executive privilege.

They chanted “No Justice, No Peace” and “Remember Brian Terry,” a reference to the U.S. Border Patrol agent who was murdered with weapons Holder’s Department of Justice and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives provided to a Mexican drug cartel as part of the ill-fated Fast and Furious “gunwalking” operation.

Protesters’ signs include “This is a big f**king deal,” “Don’t shoot me, bro!” “Release the documents!” and “Watergate didn’t have a body count!”

‘Million Big Gulp March’ to protest Bloomberg soda limits,"New Yorkers fed up the Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s proposed limits on soft drink size will participate in a “Million Big Gulp March” Monday evening.

After waiting more than a month to obtain a protest permit, opponents of Bloomberg’s crackdown on large beverages will stage a protest at City Hall Park.

Zach Huff, spokesman for the freedom advocacy group behind the rally, told The Daily Caller that the “long overdue response” anticiaqtes between 500 and 1,000 protesters. The rally will also feature local politicians, businessmen, and activist speakers opposed to the ban.

“We are hoping to send not only a message to stop this intrusion into our personal lives and small businesses but also the general idea that they have done this consistently, telling us where we can and cannot smoke, telling you how much salt you can have on and on and on,” Huff said

The protest is set to begin at 4:30 p.m. and last until 7:45.

“It is not about the number of ounces in the cup,” Huff added. “It is about the number of liberties we have left.”

Bloomberg’s ban would eliminate sugary beverages over 16 ounces from restaurants, stadiums, movie theatres, and the like across the city. The city’s health board would need to approve the measure. On July 24 the board will take it up in the first of three planned public hearings.

Activists protest New York Times for using the term ‘illegal immigrant’,"Progressive activists demonstrated outside New York Times headquarters on 8th Avenue in Manhattan Tuesday to protest the newspaper’s continuing use of the term “illegal immigrant” to describe persons who have immigrated illegally to this country.

While the Associated Press notably announced this month that it would replace the term “illegal immigrant” in its stylebook, The New York Times has so far not followed that policy.

“Soon after the election, late last fall, MoveOn.org began a petition drive focused on the New York Times that was started by Helen Chavez, Cesar Chavez’s widow,” Rinku Sen, president of the Applied Research Center and one of the protest organizers, told The Daily Caller.

“All these years, I chose to stay in the background. I walked picket lines, managed our credit union, and took care of our eight children. Cesar respected my privacy. I never spoke in public or did an interview with a reporter. But I’m speaking out now to say: stop using the word ‘illegal’ to describe human beings,” Helen Chavez said in a statement Tuesday, the twentieth anniversary of her labor leader husband’s death.

Cesar Chavez, for his part, once used the term “illegal alien” in Senate testimony in 1979.

“It is apparent that when the farm workers strike and their strike is successful, the employers go to Mexico and have unlimited, unrestricted use of illegal alien strikebreakers to break the strike,” Chavez said.

Cesar Chavez’s son, Fernando Chavez, and Jose Antonio Vargas, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who “outed” himself as an “undocumented” immigrant in a June 2011 New York Times magazine essay, delivered the petitions to Times headquarters Tuesday afternoon, joined by activists from various organizations including MoveOn.org. Vargas has been challenging news outlets to amend their stylebooks with respect to the phrase “illegal immigrant” for nearly two years.

“It took three years to get outlets like the AP to stop using that particular phrase,” Sen told TheDC. “The New York Times is clearly a national journalistic leader. Many people think it’s the country’s newspaper of record. They cover immigration issues frequently. I actually can’t speculate as to why it is that they haven’t changed yet. They said that they have found the term historically accurate.”

“When you see Republican commentators and mainstream commentators on both the left and the right changing their language, you have to ask why The New York Times is still using language that is not only grammatically incorrect but also offensive to so many people,” Presente.org executive director and protest organizer Arturo Carmona told TheDC.

Times public editor Margaret Sullivan wrote this month that the Times is considering its own moderate phasing-out of the “illegal immigrant” term, but so far that phasing-out has not begun.

“From what I can gather, The Times’s changes will not be nearly as sweeping as The A.P.’s,” Sullivan wrote April 2. “I would be surprised to see The Times ban the use of ‘illegal immigrant,’ as The A.P. has done. The Times’s changes will probably be more incremental.”

“It’s good to see these moves taking place,” Sullivan added. “Language evolves and it’s time for these changes. Early in my tenure as public editor, I considered this question and came down in favor of the continued use of ‘illegal immigrant,’ because it was a clear and easily understandable term. My position on this has changed over the past several months.”

Carmona said that he does not view his protest against the Times as a threat to free speech.

“Since the civil rights movement and the women’s rights movements, we’ve seen a tradition of [activists] helping language to evolve,” Carmona said. “The language has evolved. So why can’t The New York Times get with the times?”

Liberals protest $100 million donation to hospital because David Koch gave the money,"Hatred for Charles and David Koch is now so pervasive among the far-left that unions are actually protesting a hospital that committed the cardinal sin of accepting a $100 million donation from the infamous billionaires–even though the money will likely create jobs for unionized employees of the hospital.

The donation, made by businessman and philanthropist David Koch, is the largest in the New York-Presbyterian Hospital’s history, and will be used to build a new wing at the facility, according to The Washington Free Beacon.

The Free Beacon’s Andrew Stiles pointed out that the donation “will presumably create a fair number of new nursing jobs.”

That made little difference to the New York State Nurses’ Association, who joined the SEIU and the NAACP in protesting both outside the hospital and outside David Koch’s apartment . Union protesters argued that the money should be returned–even if it helps unionized workers–because, well, it’s Koch money.

Or as New York City councilman and Democrat Ben Kallos–who attend the protest–put it:

.@BenKallos: David Koch is against affordable healthcare. Why is his name on a hospital? #stopKoch #womensday — NYSNA (@nynurses) March 8, 2014

Other protesters complained that the Kochs were the financial backers of the “War on Women.” The protesters hoped to drive the Kochs–and their generous humanitarian donations–out of New York.

The nurses union Tweeted messages such as “Patients, not profits!” and “Quality care, not Koch care” and “If there ain’t going to be no justice, there ain’t going to be no peace!”

‘Badass Teachers’ Go BATs In Washington Protest,"A swarm of BATs has descended on Washington, D.C.

The Badass Teachers Association (BAT), a stridently left-wing group of public school teachers, gathered in Washington, D.C., on Monday to demonstrate outside the Department of Education.

Their targets? Philanthropists, reformers, charter schools, vouchers, Common Core and virtually every major attempt to reform education in the past two decades. Above all, however, the badasses stood against Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who has become a convenient punching bag for union members to express their dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party’s current direction on education issues.

The protesters presented a list of demands that more or less calls for the end of every major educational reform effort of the past two decades. They called for the federal government to cease all support for Common Core educational standards, Teach For America, charter schools and high-stakes standardized testing.

In their place, they demanded a defense of neighborhood schools, more money and a reduction in class sizes. They also demanded that Secretary Duncan be immediately fired and replaced with a “lifetime public educator.”

Speaker after speaker ascended the small wooden crate that functioned as a podium, delivering speeches that sought to rouse the several hundred people in attendance, assembled from 38 states. One speaker led attendees in cries of “We have nothing to lose but our chains,” a chant taken from The Communist Manifesto.

The speeches were interspersed with a variety of musical performances, including a half-hour show by Jeremey Dudley, aka “Origin,” a teacher-turned-rapper who led the crowd in back-and-forth anti-education reform raps with titles such as “Stop This Madness.” Other topical musical performances followed, such as a repetitive protest song in which both performers and demonstrators pledged that “I ain’t gonna teach to the test no more.”

One speaker, a fifth grader from Chicago’s public schools, encouraged performers with a variety of chants, including “Education is a right, not just for the rich and white,” and another which might gall an English instructor, “Ain’t no power like the power of the people cuz the power of the people don’t stop.”

At another point several attendees engaged in a mock dramatic performance in which a woman played Bill Gates as a conniving, evil supervillain.

“Common Core for Common people! Harvard for billionaires like me!” the mock-Gates cackled.

The performance ended when another performer vanquished Gates with the power of BAT, fittingly represented by a baseball bat.

BAT, founded last year, claims to have nearly 100,000 member teachers, and represents a sharp reaction against current reforming trends in education. Last month, several hundred BAT members demonstrated outside the headquarters of the Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington.

The group’s radicalism has been reflected in the actions of larger teachers unions. The National Education Association (NEA), the country’s largest teacher union, called for Arne Duncan to resign at its convention this summer, while the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) ordered President Obama to put Duncan on an improvement plan and fire him if he fell short. At AFT’s convention, President Randi Weingarten referred positively to the “badasses” in the crowd in an acknowledgment of the group’s influence.

It’s Too Cold To Protest Global Warming At Yale,"Yale anti-fossil fuel campaigners have indefinitely postponed a protest that was set for this weekend due to “unfavorable weather conditions and other logistical issues.”

Fossil Free Yale, a group pushing the university to divest itself from fossil fuels, told the Yale Daily News that frigid, snowy weather set for this weekend will mean their global warming protest will have to be postponed.

FFY’s Mitch Barrow said that “unfavorable weather conditions and other logistical issues, including some cancellations from speakers and performance groups” would mean they would not be able to rally on Global Divestment Day — a day where environmental groups urge institutions like Yale to divest from fossil fuels, like coal, natural gas and oil.

As this reporter writes this article, the weather in New Haven, Connecticut where Yale is located stands at -9 degrees Fahrenheit with wind chill. Saturday is expected to have weather in the low 30s with snow and Sunday will be 20 degrees with snow and rain, according to the Weather Channel.

The Yale Daily reports that FFY “had organized a series of events to rally support for its cause, including performances from student groups, guest speakers and a collaborative art installation” to protest Yale’s decision not to divest from fossil fuels six months ago. FFY remains adamant that the event is more than just about activities, it’s about “a shift in the way in which FFY will both be articulating its goals and engaging with the administration.”

“[The event] here on campus will reflect the growing movement as we recognize that we are participating in a global day of action,” FFY member Maya Jenkins told the Yale Daily. “Globally, the divestment campaign is really turning up the heat against fossil fuels by changing the traditional conversation around them.”

Environmentalists began pushing for schools in the last couple of years, signaling a new approach to how they plan on tackling global warming. If they can’t regulate them out of existence, they will target their investors.

“The fossil fuel divestment movement has grown exponentially over the last two years–now it’s going global,” said May Boeve, executive director of 350.org, the group that started the divestment movement. “From the Pacific Islands to South Africa, from the United States to Germany, people are standing up and challenging the power of the fossil fuel industry. We know that fossil fuels are the past and clean energy is the future.”

But divestment has been criticized by global warming skeptics, conservatives and even liberals. The American Security Project, a D.C.-based left-wing think tank, argued that divestment will “not cause any meaningful ﬁnancial impact to fossil fuel companies, but could hurt the universities and colleges dependent on fossil fuel share dividends.”

So far the divestment movement has met with little success as most colleges and universities have rejected calls to divest themselves of fossil fuel holdings, saying it would hurt their abilities to provide scholarships and other opportunities for students.

Harvard was one such school to reject fossil fuel divestment. In protest, 40 students with Divest Harvard staged a sit-in in the same building as Harvard President Drew Faust’s office. But even as some students become more adamant about divesting, others are finding it to be counterproductive.

“Disrupting University business is not open debate, it is not free speech, and it is not a productive way to move forward on this desperately critical issue,” reads a Harvard Crimson editorial. “Harvard deserves better, and so does the environment.”

The North East has been pummeled by poor weather and snow all week and Yale’s divestment rally is not the first global warming event to be cancelled. Earlier this week, a state legislature forum on global warming was cancelled due to bad weather.

“I hope these repeated, severe storms serve as a platform for some important conversations around bolstering our natural and built infrastructure against climate change once a new date has been set for this discussion,” said Democratic State Sen. Marc Pacheco, who chairs the state senate committee that organized the summit.

NYPD Officers Attacked During Protest Against Police Violence,"At least two New York police officers were injured after being assaulted at a Brooklyn protest against police violence on Tuesday night, CBS New York reports.

A police sergeant was taken to New York-Presbyterian/Lower Manhattan Hospital, sustaining injuries to his face and arm trying to control the angry crowds of protesters.

CBS reported that demonstrators against police-related deaths and violence started in Union Square and marched down Broadway, blocking traffic for those trying to cross the Brooklyn Bridge.

Police promptly responded to the mobs grandstanding in the middle of city streets.

“Pushing and shoving from both protesters and officers led to several arrests. Two officers were allegedly attacked,” according to CBS.

“Reports this evening that two of our NYPD officers were assaulted by protesters reminds us that here in New York City, violence or threats of violence against the police are unacceptable and will absolutely not be tolerated. These attacks will be thoroughly investigated, and we will urge the full prosecution of the perpetrators,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement.

Twenty-two of the protesters were arrested on various charges, from obstructing roadways to throwing items from the Brooklyn Bridge.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2015/04/15/nypd-officers-attacked-during-protest-against-police-violence/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjuio3vgLT9AhXgKlkFHaPZD-s4RhAWegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw378LLLL7wGpdaoLXsVDBkM,2015-04-15
Another Global Warming Protest Hit With Snow,"Global warming activists should probably start planning their protests for the summer because the second climate rally — within just days of a major one in Canada — has been buried in snow.

Student activists with Fossil Free CU have camped out the University of Colorado, staging a “sit in” meant to show the Board of Regents the group’s commitment to getting the school to divest its endowment of fossil fuel holdings.

The group’s Facebook page shows students braving the elements to convince the Board of Regents to ditch fossil fuels to fight global warming. Unfortunately for them, the “Gore effect” has kicked in and may blunt their arguments that the world is catastrophically warming.

The “Gore effect” has made its mark this year on several protests, including a major one last week in Quebec City where thousands of demonstrators marched through snow and frigid weather. Earlier this year, a divestment protest at Yale University was cancelled due to “unfavorable weather conditions and other logistical issues,” according to organizers.

The weather forecast for Colorado doesn’t look favorable to protesters. The Rocky Mountains could get up to five feet of snow over the next few days, and Boulder — where students are protesting — is expected to get one to three inches of snow Thursday and thunderstorms Friday.

But protesters don’t seem deterred by the poor weather as the Board of Regents discusses divesting its $2.7 billion endowment from fossil fuels.

“We’ve been speaking with the regents, and they really haven’t been budging,” Austen Bernier, a student activist, told the Daily Camera. “They’ve failed to take bold action; they’ve failed to commit to creating a pathway to divestment even though they let us come talk at the last board meeting. With their failure to take action, our point here is to create a safe space where we can have the dialogue that they’re refusing to have.”

Colorado is a major oil and gas producing state, so the university choosing to divest from fossil fuels would be a big victory for student activists. But it’s unclear if the board would go that far — most schools targeted by environmentalists have opted not to divest from fossil fuels.

Furthermore, the board is elected and currently Republicans hold a majority of the seats. So you tell me if things look good for activists.

Parents Starve Themselves To Protest Rahm Emanuel’s School Policies,"Parents in Chicago have endured a hunger strike lasting over a week to protest the local board of education’s decision to shut down a neighborhood high school.

Dyett High School, on Chicago’s South Side, graduated its final class of 13 students last June. The school has long struggled with both low enrollment and poor academics, and so several years ago city officials decided to pull the plug on the school, either closing it entirely or repurposing it as a charter or magnet school, meaning it will no longer be a traditional neighborhood school.

That has outraged the mostly black residents of the surrounding neighborhood, who have formed a Coalition to Revitalize Dyett High School. Since Monday of last week, a dozen parents and activists have been on a hunger strike, publicly subsisting solely on liquids in order to pressure the administration of mayor Rahm Emanuel to give in to their demands.

Strikers say the decision to shutter the school reflects Emanuel’s utter neglect of Chicago’s black community.

“Black low-income and working families are being ignored by the mayor and the alderman,” striker Jeanette Taylor-Ramann told a local news affiliate. “People are putting their lives at stake in order to save a neighborhood high school.” Taylor-Ramann says that with Dyett shuttered, her daughter will have to travel 16 miles via two buses and a train in order to get to school.

“That’s not bad parenting,” she told The Huffington Post’s Black Voices. “That’s her living in a city and a district that doesn’t value her because of the color of her skin.”

Taylor-Ramann and the rest of the Coalition want the school to be converted into a specialty school dedicated to “global leadership and green technology,” which would also have a focus on agriculture science and cultural awareness. Under their proposal, Dyett would remain a neighborhood school, though it would offer open enrollment to anybody else in the city who wishes to attend.

Starving for the sake of a high school may seem drastic, but the strikers are winning national support. The Rev. Jesse Jackson briefly joined their strike last week, and on Wednesday Randi Weingarten, president of the country’s second-largest teachers union, plans to meet with them.

Chicago school officials have said they are continuing to review proposals for Dyett and will make a final decision in September.

Here’s What A Black Lives Matter New Years Eve Protest Looks Like In Downtown DC,"WASHINGTON — The Black Lives Matter movement took to the streets of Washington, D.C., to block traffic Thursday in protest against police brutality and what they see as systematic institutional racism.

Protesters marched through the streets and cornered off intersections. They even stepped in front of moving traffic, ignoring the scorn and honking from drivers trying to pass by. The protesters had a simple message for frustrated drivers. They argued that a moment of discomfort paled in comparison to what black people have to deal with on a regular basis.

“Black Lives Matter is more than just a hashtag,” organizer April Goggans told the crowd while standing in the middle of an intersection. “We’re here to show black lives really do matter.”

Goggans also condemned the city while discussing the national problem of racism. She said city leaders have enacted policies to purposely push out minority and lower-income individuals. Goggans called for the resignation off Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser for what she has done against fellow black people.

“D.C. is not immune to police brutality,” Goggans declared. “The mayor and this city have a well thought out plan… It’s time for Mayor Muriel Bowser to go.”

The Black Lives Matter movement started in 2013 to combat violence against minority populations. Participants have rallied against police brutality and what they see as systematic racism on nearly every level of government. Protesters listed Tamir Rice, Eric Harris, Walter Scott, Jonathan Ferrell, Sandra Bland, Samuel DuBose and Freddie Gray among others as examples of unjust violence against black individuals.

“I’m out here because black lives matter and clearly this country doesn’t realize that,” protester Jazzlyn Lindsey told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “Police brutality, legislative issues, economic inequality, housing disparities, food, everything, affordable education. In every single way institutional racism is keeping black people down.”

Critics have denounced the movement, citing what they believe to be brash methods. Protesters hijacked a rally Aug. 8 for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. While Sanders helplessly stood by, protesters began making demands in the microphone. The self-proclaimed democratic-socialist was a civil rights advocate throughout his life including back during the 1960s as a college student.

Awa Sergeant sees no national politician as being on their side. She says they all too often betray the black community for political expediency even when it seem like they could be an advocate.

“I’m fighting for my rights as a black person on this planet, so that’s why I’m here today,” Sergeant told TheDCNF. “Systematic violence that has been going on for a long time is still being perpetuated by police officers.”

Black Lives Matter DC Protest (Connor D. Wolf/DCNF)

There have been several incidences of alleged police misconduct that garnered national attention in the last couple years. Gray died in April from spinal injuries while in the custody of Baltimore police. Additionally Michael Brown was shot dead in Ferguson, Mo. by local police. Both deaths resulted in several protests as well as riots and looting.

Another incident involving police misconduct resulted in the death of Eric Garner. New York City Officer Daniel Pantaleo, was accused of choking Garner to death in 2014. Garner was heard shouting that he couldn’t breathe as he was wrestled to the ground. The incident made national headlines and sparked a debate on police using excessive force and institutional racism. At the time Pantaleo caught Garner selling untaxed cigarettes.

Poll Reveals How Chicago’s Anti-Trump Protest Affected Florida Voters,"A Monmouth University poll released Monday shows Donald Trump expanding his lead over Sen. [crscore]Marco Rubio[/crscore] in Florida, and that voters in the Sunshine State are more likely than not to back Trump in response to the anti-Trump protest in Chicago.

Trump leads with 44 percent in Florida, and Rubio follows with 27 percent. In third is Sen. [crscore]Ted Cruz[/crscore] with 17 percent and Gov. John Kasich is in fourth with 9 percent. While Kasich and Cruz remain unchanged from previous Monmouth polls, Trump has extended his lead over Rubio from 8 percentage points to 17 percentage points.

Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University Polling Institute, said, “Florida is do or die for the Rubio campaign, but it looks like victory may have slipped from his grasp.”

The poll also asked likely Florida voters if and how the protest that shut down Trump’s Chicago rally will affect their vote in the March 15 primary.(RELATED: Here Are The Radical Leftist Anti-Trump Groups Behind The Chicago Protest)

Most respondents, 66 percent said that it had no impact. Twenty-two percent of voters said the incident made the more likely to support Trump, as opposed to 11 percent who said it would make them less likely to support him.

While throughout the race Rubio has been calling for the field to thin out in order to help him defeat the New York real estate developer, this poll shows that a head-to-head race wouldn’t favor the Florida senator. In fact, Cruz does better in Florida in a two-man race against Trump.

A hypothetical choice between Rubio and Trump has 54 percent of voters supporting The Donald, and 39 percent backing Rubio. If the matchup is between Cruz and Trump, Trump leads 48 percent to 40 percent.

The poll also asked GOP voters whether they would support Trump if he is chosen as the nominee. Nearly 3 in 4, 74 percent, said they would. Cruz supporters are more likely to support Trump in the general election — 3 in 4 — while only half of Rubio and Kasich supporters said they would definitely vote for the New York real estate developer.

The poll of 405 likely Florida voters was conducted over telephone from March 11 to March 13 and has a margin of error of 4.9 percent. The pollsters found that Trump’s lead increased in the Sunshine State with each night of interviews.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2016/03/14/poll-reveals-how-chicagos-anti-trump-protest-affected-florida-voters/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj2n7PwgLT9AhUcFFkFHRt6Bgc4WhAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw2xdg3-kBvqYr0Nl1WJuohy,2016-03-14
BRACE YOURSELF — This Is What An Anti-Milo Yiannopoulos Protest Looks Like [VIDEO],"WASHINGTON — “Cultural libertarian” Milo Yiannopoulos spoke at American University Thursday night, and, as usual, was welcomed by a group of angry student protesters in drag.

Yiannopoulos, the self-described “most fabulous super-villain on the Internet,” was asked to give a presentation on free speech at a Young Americans for Liberty forum. The student-led protest, called “Say NO to Milo,” assembled outside the event.

The protest’s organizer, Noah Leibowitz, sported pink hair, wore makeup, a shoulderless top, plaid skirt, and leggings. He also held a sign that read “Milo Wants Me Dead.”

Emem Obot, whose resume consists of joining social movements, publicly criticized her school.

“Let it be known that AU ain’t shit! The administration ain’t shit! Calvin ain’t shit!,” Obot shouted into the microphone. “At the end of the day, this is about validating ourselves while [Milo] is here who will be speaking about us.”

Leibowitz then led a chant to energize the mob.

“When students’ lives are under attack, what do we do? Stand up! Fight back! When trans’ lives are under attack, what do we do? Stand up! Fight back! Black lives are under attack, what do we do? Stand up! Fight back!”

At one point, freshman Stephanie Black — who claimed she was not planning on speaking — grabbed the megaphone and addressed the crowd.

“I am a survivor of sexual trauma,” Black stated, “I am bi-sexual, I am a woman, and I am ashamed to be a part of AU today.”

She also said the promotional posters for Yiannopoulos’ event had left her with crippling anxiety.

“I haven’t slept in the last three weeks,” Black said. “To see those stupid posters posted all over this campus with those pink little letters glittered…I can’t breathe walking down the fucking street at night in [sic] this campus.”

“Triggering is real,” Black insisted.

Chipotle Faces Union Protest In Response To Supplier Problems,"Chipotle Mexican Grill faced a union protest Tuesday in California over a series of alleged workplace health and safety violations at one of its suppliers.

The Teamsters held the protest in coordination with several advocacy groups. The protestors called on the Mexican restaurant chain to denounce supplier Taylor Farms over alleged workplace safety violations. The California government previously cited the supplier did not properly address October 2015 toxic spills, among other safety violations.

Taylor Farms supplies tomatoes and peppers at Chipotle restaurants along the West Coast.

“During the spill, workers were ordered to keep working, and were warned not to talk about the incident,” Teamsters International Vice President Rome Aloise said in a statement. “When Taylor Farms workers came together to form their union, the company responded with firings, intimidation and threats of deportation. Today, we protest these offenses at Chipotle restaurants nationwide.”

Aloise added the supplier threatened workers with firings and intimidation for trying to form a union. He noted the health concerns and workplace violations prompted workers to seek outside help by organized labor. Chipotle responded to the protest by noting it will not involve themselves in the dispute.

“The Teamsters demonstrations do not have anything to do with Chipotle directly, but rather involve a dispute between the union and one of our produce suppliers,” A Chipotle spokesman told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “We do not intend to insert ourselves into this dispute.”

Taylor Farms faces over $95,000 in fines in response to the toxic chemical spill alone. California workplace safety officials have also issued over forty safety and health violations against the supplier. The Teamsters believe Chipotle should put pressure on its supplier to address the workplace health violations.

Chipotle experienced a public relations outcry of its own last year over the spread of E. Coli to a handful of restaurants. The restaurant took aggressive steps to stop the spread, including closing several locations until they were deemed safe again. The Teamsters organized the protest in coordination with Working Partnerships USA, the Consumer Federation of California and HEAL Food Alliance.

Taylor Farms did not respond to a request for comment by TheDCNF.

Leaked Emails Show DNC Officials Planned Anti-Trump Protests,"The release of Democratic National Committee emails by WikiLeaks Friday reveals that DNC officials planned anti-Donald Trump protests.

In multiple emails, DNC officials signed off and acknowledged the existence of two anti-Donald Trump protests in South Bend, IN and Billings, MT. The release of nearly 20,000 emails is the first in a WikiLeaks “Hillary Leaks” series. (RELATED: Leaked Emails Show DNC Officials Constructing Anti-Bernie Narrative)

On April 29, a DNC press staffer, Rachel Palermo, alerted Eric Walker, deputy communications director, about a Facebook page for an anti-Trump protest on May 2 in South Bend. “Whoo! Thanks to our interns for finding this out.” Walker replies, “I like it, as long as the students feel safe getting involved. I imagine this demo will be nicer than the one in San Fran today.”

That day in San Francisco protesters blocked off roads to an event Donald Trump was hosting. The Republican nominee ended up having to jump down from the highway and sneak around back to enter.

In another other email chain also on April 29, titled “Week-Ahead Notes & Assignments,” former DNC media booker Pablo Manriquez comments “this should be fun” in reference to the May protest.

University of Notre Dame, located in South Bend, is Manriquez’s alma mater. A DNC official wrote, “Pablo please reach out to any folks you think may be able to help.”

Another protest that’s directly mentioned in emails included one that occurred on May 26 in Billings, MT. The email is from May 20 and features notes on the “week ahead.” (RELATED: ‘Sexist Pig’ And Other Eye-Opening Revelations In The DNC Email Leak)

Both the Indiana and Montana protests were non-violent. The South Bend protest had “some expletive laced chants,” and protesters carrying Mexican flags. The Montana one had “only a few” protesters.

Intern involvement with protests is mentioned twice in the leaked emails. DNC communications director Luis Miranda bemoaned photos of an empty anti-Trump protest in Washington, D.C. in one email chain.

Miranda said: “Going forward, when our allies screw up and don’t deliver bodies in time, we either send all our interns out there or we stay away from it.. we don’t want to own a bad picture.”

Miranda was notified of the Washington protest in an email chain titled “Tv coverage of protest great.” In the original email that notified the DNC communications director of the Indiana protest, a DNC staffer wrote, “thanks to our interns for finding this out.”

DNC officials Brad Marshall, a chief financial officer, and Alan Reed, a compliance officer, also signed off on the use of Black Lives Matter organizer Deray Mckesson as a surrogate for Hillary Clinton.

Mckesson rose to prominence after being active in protests in Ferguson, MO and Baltimore, MD. He has yet to endorse a candidate and said protests are likely to happen at the upcoming Democratic Party convention.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2016/07/24/leaked-emails-show-dnc-officials-planned-anti-trump-protests/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiGnIbxgLT9AhVxEVkFHeEECX04ZBAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw0JHoImACI5M5cUF4hiEY38,2016-07-24
College Feminists Slam Catholic School For Tolerating Abortion Protest,"A feminist group at Marquette University is denouncing the school for allowing students to engage in the “intolerant” act of publicly protesting abortion.

Last week, the student group Marquette for Life created a “Memorial for the Unborn” that consisted of 1,200 blue and pink flags to represent the roughly 1.2 million abortions in the U.S. last year. The memorial was promptly defaced. While the destructive stunt was praised by Marquette’s College Democrats, it was condemned by Vice President of Student Affairs Xavier Cole, who issued a statement saying “defacement is not dialogue.”

Now, Cole’s statement is being slammed by Marquette Empowerment, a student feminist group that claims the real problem is that Marquette students were allowed to protest abortion in the first place.

“Rather than fostering discussion and understanding, the display is damaging to the mental health of students and a disturbing act of public shaming,” the group said in an online statement. “In the past, students at Marquette have complained to university administration regarding the harmful nature of the display, which, until this year, employed crosses to emulate a ‘fetus graveyard.'”

The statement also complains that by using pink and blue flags, which represent unborn baby boys and girls, the protesters were offensively assigning genders to children before they could choose a gender on their own. (RELATED: Progressive Parents Throw Gender Declaration Parties For Teenage Children)

“The shift to pink and blue — gendered — flags offers no recompense to those interested in human rights and, rather, demonstrates the harmful and misguided conflation of sex and gender and promotion of the gender binary.”

Then, even, though Empowerment states it does not support the “defacement of property,” the group praises those who covered up Marquette for Life’s display with their own signs, and says there is no need to show tolerance for those opposed to abortion.

“To those activists and all those dissenters of policies and institutional stances that privilege oppressive narratives over your very existence, Empowerment says: Your pain and anger is valid … Do not listen when people tell you to be more tolerant of other’s intolerance.”

Activists Descend On Trump Hotel To Protest ‘Racism And Bigotry’ [PHOTOS],"Liberal activists flocked to presidential nominee Donald Trump’s new luxury hotel in Washington, D.C., to protest the “hate and racism” they claim his campaign promotes.

“I abhor everything that Donald Trump stands for,” Bill Murray, an Arlington resident, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “Any small thing I can do to get the word out that he is an abomination and the head of the basket of deplorables, that does exist, is why I’m here.”

Activists from the organizing group ANSWER Coalition stood with members of Code Pink and other protesters, waving signs and calling Trump racist while speakers repeated that they were “building a wall against racism and bigotry.”

Trump International Hotel hosted a grand opening ribbon cutting ceremony Wednesday, but many protesters said they remain committed to shutting down the hotel. Some believe his campaign will lead to vacancies, which will eventually put a financial drain on the nominee. In the meantime, some speakers called on the hotel to open its doors to the homeless in D.C.

Mayor Muriel Bowser attended a ceremony when Trump broke ground on the hotel in 2014, but did not make an appearance at the ribbon cutting ceremony Wednesday.

“I haven’t heard a word of anything specific on how he would create jobs here,” Chris Hager, a protester and resident from Falls Church Virginia, told TheDCNF. “Now I don’t know how much Hillary can do to improve the game but at least she has a big circle of people who are experienced. If she has the judgement, which she has not always shown, to take the best advise, we’ll be able to make improvements.”

A number of the nominee’s supporters attended the protest and picketed the area where the anti-Trump activists gathered. Critics of the Trump campaign have questioned the rationale behind spending campaign time at a hotel venture this late in the election, however, a Trump spokesman said it serves to highlight his business experience.

“This is actually a monument to what Trump can do,” Don Davis, a Tennessee resident and Trump supporter, told TheDCNF. “He took a run down government building and turned it into a five star hotel. He’s done it all over the country, and I’d really like to see what he can do as president.”

The hotel, built at the historical Old Post Office Pavilion, has been a rallying point for anti-Trump activists throughout the election. A soft opening for the property in early September drew similar crowds of angry protesters. Later in the protest activists gathered around the entrance to the hotel creating a barricade while people chanted, “If we don’t get no justice, you don’t get no peace.”

“This hotel in general is kind of a symbol of everything he stands for, you know, hate, bigotry and racism, which I don’t agree with,” said Hannah Jacks, a student at American University. “He’s not an ideal candidate, he’s not even an acceptable candidate.”

Sioux Tribal Council Decides To Dismantle Protest Camps Around Standing Rock Reservation,"Protesters attempting to stop the completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline received bad news on Saturday. The Sioux Tribal council officially called on all protesters encamped in its North Dakota reservation to clear out, Reuters reported.

The tribal council’s resolution, which called to dismantle the three protest camps, did not include a measure on where to move the 600 protesters.

The Standing Rock tribe has been asking protesters to go home since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers agreed to an environmental review last December of the $3.8 billion pipeline that would move oil from North Dakota through South Dakota, Iowa and into Illinois.

“The pipeline fight has moved beyond the camps and our strategy must evolve with the process,” Standing Rock Tribal Chairman David Archambault II said in a statement Saturday.

The statement comes almost one week after law enforcement clashed with protesters near the pipeline construction site.

Some activists Saturday at the Women’s March in Washington claim that Archambault “sold out.” One speaker from the Indigenous Women Rise group told the crowd, “David Archambault sold out Standing rock for $30 million, which is less than 30 cents a person.”

She added, “Bitumen, when it hits water, you cannot smell or taste it, but it will cause the bone marrow, it will kill the children and at the end, it creates death. This is what fighting the Dakota pipeline looks like. Stand up for your rights and stand up for your future.”

“Our network respects the decision of the Cannon Ball district and the tribal council of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe,” Tom Goldtooth, the executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network told Reuters. “Vacating the camp does not mean abandoning the resistance.”

Shia LaBeouf Arrested At #HeWillNotDivideUs Protest,"He’s a Nazi magnet

He’s a Nazi magnet

He’s a Nazi magnet

He’s a Nazi magnet

Just yesterday I advised Shia to calm down and get some sleep, but he didn’t listen. Now he’s back in jail.

TMZ:

NYPD officers hauled Shia LaBeouf away in handcuffs from his marathon protest site in NYC … after he got into it with another protester…

Cops tell us a guy walked in front of the mounted camera and said something — possibly regarding Trump — but whatever it was, Shia got pissed.

Shia grabbed for the guy’s scarf, and allegedly scratched him in the process.

I suppose it was only a matter of time before Shia lost it. That’s kind of his thing. Here he is, being divided from his fellow protesters:

Okay, I have just one question: Will he divide us? Someone please clarify.

Presumably the “victim” was another one of these anime-Nazi 4chan dorks who’ve made it their mission to troll LaBeouf to his face. This is exactly what they wanted, and they got it. Good job, I guess?

One side chants like mindless zombies. The other side giggles about Hitler. No minds are changed. Nothing is achieved. Yay.

Shia’s next film role is portraying John McEnroe. Kinda perfect.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2017/01/26/shia-labeouf-arrested-at-hewillnotdivideus-protest/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjY2-PtgLT9AhWkFFkFHQOxADo4MhAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw2kDt5cMAY951q6LYP_WhWE,2017-01-26
Democratic Leadership’s Anti-Trump Protest Goes Horribly Wrong,"WASHINGTON — Congressional Democratic leaders assembled on the steps of the Supreme Court Monday to protest President Donald Trump’s temporary immigration ban, but they had one big problem — their microphones didn’t work.

Hundreds of liberal protesters assembled before the Supreme Court to listen to the congressional leaders speak and chanted things such as “impeach” and “lock him up.” When House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and dozens of congressional Democrats showed up the protesters continued to have a demonstration of their own as congressional Democrats were drowned out by the chants.

Pelosi started off the event speaking for minute or so into microphones with no sound. Congressional Democrats then realized no one could hear them, and broke out into singing Woody Guthrie’s “This Land Is Your Land.”

WATCH:

dems’ mic broke so they are singing pic.twitter.com/tfzooU9bbt — Alex Pfeiffer (@PfeifferDC) January 31, 2017

The singing could only last so long and Pelosi went back to speaking into the broken microphones. Standing close to the House Minority leader, one could make out her referencing the poem by Emma Lazarus emblazoned on the Statue of Liberty which states, “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”

Pelosi was offered a megaphone by a fellow congressional Democrat, which she refused to take as chants of “no ban, no wall” from the crowd drowned out her speech. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer then took the podium and screamed his speech, eschewing the use of the broken microphones or the megaphone. He said that President Trump’s executive order on immigration makes the U.S. “unsafe” and “less American.”

The New York senator was eventually drowned out by chants as he said that the executive order was “evil.” This was a pattern repeated throughout the night, as male Democratic senators were able to have their voice heard a little before eventually being drowned out by chants, while female Democrats were almost hopeless at the microphone

When Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren took the podium she finally used the megaphone that had been offered earlier to Pelosi. However, the megaphone, like the microphones, was also broken and the potential 2020 Democratic nominee was drowned out by chants of “stand up, fight back.”

Minnesota Sen. Al Franken was one of the last Democrats to take the stage. He took advantage of the opportunity to speak into a broken megaphone by attempting to tell a nearly five long minute story, which was impossible to make out from ten yards away.

After the nearly 45 minute event, a young protester named Arianna told The Daily Caller, “There were speeches?”

President Trump tweeted Tuesday morning, “Nancy Pelosi and Fake Tears Chuck Schumer held a rally at the steps of The Supreme Court and mic did not work (a mess)-just like Dem party!”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2017/01/30/democratic-leadership-event-to-protest-trump-fails-horribly/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjD2bnugLT9AhUEEVkFHevqAlQ4PBAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw1MpykisJ9mlV0ziK3Ql-X9,2017-01-30
Dakota Pipeline Protest Camp Cleaned Up To Avoid An ‘Environmental Disaster’,"After months of protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline, activists left so much waste at their camp state, officials have ordered it be cleaned up to prevent an “environmental disaster.”

Dump trucks and work crews moved into the campsite Monday to clean up the abandoned cars, structures, trash and waste left by thousands of protesters who converged on the region to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline over concerns it would contaminate drinking water relied upon by American Indians.

Rather ironically, the waste generated by protesters posed its own threat to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s drinking water, Reuters reported. Protesters have long claimed the Dakota Pipeline would contaminate tribal drinking water.

State, tribal and local officials worked with protest organizers to clean up the campsite, which sits on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land in North Dakota.

“It is paramount for public safety, and to prevent an environmental disaster, that the camps be cleared prior to a potential spring flood,” GOP North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a pipeline supporter, said in a statement issued Monday.

Standing Rock Sioux officials asked pipeline protesters to leave the makeshift camp outside the reservation in January after months of sometimes violent protesting over the Dakota Access Pipeline. Hundreds of protesters stayed, and are now leasing reservation land.

The Dakota Access Pipeline sparked a massive political fight last year after Standing Rock Sioux tribal officials came out against the project, saying it would trample over sacred sites and threaten its drinking water.

They were joined by thousands of environmental activists in physically blocking the $3.8 billion pipeline’s route.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers blocked the pipeline in November by not granting the project the easement it needs to cross the Missouri River. The Corps initially approved the project in summer 2016.

President Donald Trump came out in support of the pipeline, and signed an executive order to move Dakota Access along in the approval process. Observers expect the project to be approved by the Trump administration.

Shirtless Trump Bro Disrupts Protest In Texas,"A student protest was disrupted at the University of Texas – San Antonio Tuesday when a shirtless man bearing a Trump flag ran past the anti-Trump demonstration.

The demonstration of roughly 30 students gathered at Sombrilla Plaza to protest the recent immigration ban by President Donald Trump.

The student protesters were chanting “no justice! no peace!” when a shirtless Trump supporter passed the group waving a Trump flag. He caught the attention of the protesters as they briefly stopped their chant and became transfixed on the man who had just run by.

Senator Finds Hilarious Proof Liberals Were Ready To Protest Any Trump SCOTUS Nominee,"Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse found evidence that liberal protesters at the Supreme Court Tuesday were ready to protest any nominee put forward by President Donald Trump.

Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch to be a Supreme Court associate justice.

Sasse found signs that read “Stop,” with Gorsuch’s name written in marker.

“Went to the Supreme Court to talk to the protesters. But it turns out to be a Mad-Lib protest. #Fill-In-The-Blank,” the senator tweeted with a picture reading, “Stop Gorsuch.” The sign, however, only had the word “Stop” printed on it, with “Gorsuch” added after his name was announced in marker.

Sasse then tweeted, “By the way, protestors- Among those who were in the Senate when Gorsuch was last unanimously confirmed: *Obama *Biden *Clinton & *Schumer.”

Police Are Investigating A Dead Body Found At Dakota Protest Site,"North Dakota law enforcement officials are investigating a dead body found in the Cannonball River near a campsite used to protest the now completed Dakota Access Pipeline.

Local fishermen found the body of Damjan Nedelkovski floating in a river Sunday morning near the primary campsite holding anti-DAPL protesters. He was a California resident known to frequent protest camps in the area, according to a press statement issued Monday by the Morton County Sheriff’s Department.

An autopsy showed no blunt trauma to the body, and officials are not certain how long he was in the water. Family and friends, meanwhile, told local officials they last had contact with Nedelkovski in October 29, 2016. His stepbrother filed a missing person report in November.

Anti-DAPL activists and Standing Rock Sioux members believe the line’s construction would trample on tribal lands and potentially poison Lake Oahe. The pipeline’s opponents continue to say the protests are largely peaceful and nonviolent.

Local officials argue the demonstration were violent enough to warrant task force help. Former GOP North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple, for instance, asked Wyoming Highway Patrol earlier this year to send riot squads and cops with active shooter training to suppress violent anti-pipeline protests, according to documents obtained by a media advocacy group.

He wanted help dealing with “civil unrest” and “criminal activities” related to the protests, according to public records communications obtained in February by Muck Rock.

The North Dakota Republican asked his Wyoming counterpart in a Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) request to send 40 officers to Morton County for assistance quelling what he deemed increasingly violent protests. An EMAC allows states to share valuable resources during emergency situations.

The demonstrations resulted in significant damage to private property, as well as numerous acts of lawlessness.

Morton County officials believe 94 percent of the 709 arrests at the Oceti and Sacred Campsites were of people from outside of North Dakota. Officials also said 221 of those apprehended had prior criminal records.

The protests also created significant property damage. More than 544 households reported losses ranging from $15,000 to $20,000 each from crop losses. The total equates to over $8 million in total losses.

"‘It’s Life Or Death For Us’: Students Protest Racism, Police Brutality At College [VIDEO]","Hundreds of students packed into a library and circled the college president’s office to protest racism Wednesday, prompting campus police to advise a professor to leave over fears for his safety.

Students at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., protested racism by complaining about bigoted professors and carrying signs with statements like “Black lives matter: End the injustice,” according to The Olympian.

“It’s important. It’s necessary,” junior Halla Warmer told The Olympian, describing the protest. “It’s life or death for us.”

“This institution is really (messed) up and racist,” insisted freshman Shayna Clayton to The Olympian. “We shouldn’t have to deal with that.”

WATCH:

The students blocked entrances to the library with furniture. Protesters issued the following statement to The Olympian:

“What started out as anti-black comments on social media has turned into the dismissal of the rights of students and femmes of color, physical violence by police, and false sentencing of students protesting. Black trans disabled students are actively being sought out and confronted by campus police constantly, police are refusing to explain their actions and harassment. Students will not stand for this anymore, as students of color have never felt comfortable on campus and have not been treated equally.”

Police allegedly had an order to stand down and told science professor Bret Weinstein that he was unsafe on campus, after students alleged the professor made racist remarks and demanded he resign.

Weinstein asserts that protesters are targeting students who defend him.

The protest marked the latest event in a series of racially tense exchanges. Students surrounded Weinstein and advocated for his resignation Tuesday. Protesters took issue with statements the professor had made in a March 2017 email to faculty.

“I would encourage others to put phenotype aside and reject [a proposed format for an Evergreen event],” Weinstein wrote. “On a college campus, one’s right to speak – or to be – must never be based on skin color.”

The professor proceeded to volunteer to host a discussion of race “through a scientific/evolutionary lens,” so long as people attended the event with “an open mind, and a willingness to act in good faith.”

“I do not believe students of color are targeted in the sciences here,” Weinstein told the students Tuesday.

Protestors asked the professor a question on race then shouted him down as he tried to answer.

“Would you like to hear the answer or not?” he asked students at one point, receiving cries of “no!” The cameraman filming the event told Weinstein to resign, which the professor said he would not do. The students soon began chanting “Hey-hey! Hey-ho! Bret Weinstein’s got to go!”

WATCH:

George Bridges, president of Evergreen State proposed changes to placate the protestors later Tuesday. The administration recommended employing students to examine the school’s code of conduct, giving students more say in faculty evaluations, and training faculty on student engagement, anti-black racism, sexual assault, police brutality, and collaboration with transgender and queer students.

When a student asked whether the training would be required, Bridges said he would request that the Evergreen faculty union consent to mandatory training. The president also said he would try to raise private donations to fund the training.

He also assured students that the college police department would not work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to track illegal alien students. When another student questioned Weinstein’s university employment, Bridges refused to comment.

WATCH:

“It’s been an intense and useful conversation with a group of students,” said Zach Powers, Evergreen State spokesman, to The Olympian. “The college is working with the group to address their issues. This type of conversation is being replicated across the country right now. We remain committed to providing a great education to all students.”

“The protests, discussions, and meetings taking place now are for larger more systemic issues such as a lack of equity for black and brown students in the sciences, student worker jobs, even for faculty and staff of color,” said student Blake Vincent, who recorded the videos above and asserted that the protesters want more than just the discipline of the professor.

The Daily Caller News Foundation reached out to Evergreen State College and Weinstein, but received no comment in time for publication.

Principal Fired After Attending Confederate Protest Speaks Out,"Only a few weeks ago, Nicholas Dean was a highly-regarded principal of a New Orleans school designed for at-risk students with nowhere else to go. He had once earned a glowing profile from NPR for his work.

Now Dean is out of a job after he became the focus of left-wing outrage when he attended a demonstration in front of New Orleans’ Confederate monuments in early May.

Dean was accused by local left-wing activists of wearing “white supremacist symbols” at the protest while giving an interview in support of the statues.

The educator told The Daily Caller he attended the protest to defend pro-Confederate demonstrators from attack by left-wing antifa. “I went to the monument protest on May 7th because a week earlier, on May 1st, a group of about a dozen monument supporters were swarmed and attacked by antifa at the Jefferson Davis monument,” Dean told TheDC.

“The antifa showed up in a military style vehicle, threw bottles at people, maced a woman in a wheelchair and punched the monument supporters. The police stood down while they were attacked. I went to stand for free speech and to oppose the Marxists by standing my ground,” he added.

At the May 7 demonstration, Dean said he “wore a helmet in case somebody threw bottles, and goggles in case somebody sprayed mace.”

The now-dismissed principal also wore rings displaying a Maltese crusader cross and a skull, along with a shield bearing the Spartan lambda symbol and the words “Come” and “Take.” These are the regalia leftists considered to be white supremacist.

These symbols, however, are popular with many conservatives in America. Gun rights enthusiasts, in particular, are fond of the Spartan declaration, which is typically spelled out in full as “Come and Take It.”

A representative for the Anti-Defamation League told The New Orleans Advocate that the symbols were not enough to prove that the person displaying them is some kind of right-wing extremist.

Dean also talked with a podcast about why he was protesting in favor of the monuments. He also said the removal of the statues would do nothing to alleviate New Orleans’ crime problem that primarily hurts black residents, and that the removal is the work of a “black nationalist” group bent on erasing history.

Those factors were apparently enough for Dean’s employer, Crescent Leadership Academy, to suspend and then fire him. In a statement to the press, the school’s superintendent Kunjan Narechania implied Dean’s actions showed that he is “unwilling to prioritize and respect the humanity of all children.”

Dean says he wasn’t even given a formal reason for his dismissal. “The school did not give me a reason for termination. I was not presented with any type of counseling or disciplinary paperwork at any point and I was terminated without a written cause,” he told The Daily Caller.

For more than three years, Dean was the principal of CLA, a school that is nearly 99 percent African-American and where many of its students regularly deal with deadly violence outside of the classroom.

Prior to termination, his work had been praised by several city leaders and news outlets. Dean was listed as a participating partner in Mayor Mitch Landrieu’s murder-reduction campaign “Nola For Life” due to his work with at-risk youth. A five-part series in The New Orleans Times-Picayune on one of the troubled teens Dean worked with highlighted how the principal dramatically turned around CLA once he took over.

The newspaper noted that under Dean’s leadership fights plummeted, re-expulsions were eliminated and the new principal worked to bring community college vocational training, dorms for homeless students and other positive features to the school to differentiate it from a prison.

The Air Force veteran also implemented strict rules for improving student behavior, which included: “Tuck in your shirt, no profanity, keep your hands to yourself, be on time, stay in your seat, learn something in class.”

Thanks to Dean, the troubled teen The Times-Picayune profiled, Sean Talley, was able to graduate — and so were many of his peers.

Several students praised Dean in NPR’s profile of CLA and were adamant he was the reason the school made a big improvement. “The principal, Mr. Dean, is a good man,” one student told NPR. “He works with you.”

“When I assumed the principalship three years ago, the school was under an intensive state monitoring. There were numerous audit violations, and the school had three principals in two years. There was a high suspension and expulsion rate, and acts of violence had tarnished the school’s image,” Dean told TheDC of the situation he took on when he became principal.

“During my first year we came off of intensive monitoring, reduced the expulsion rate by 87% and reduced the suspension rate by 53%. We had a 100% graduation rate from that year on. We received a considerable amount of positive community and media attention and completed the requirements to receive both a charter extension and renewal,” he says of his work, which he credits to the team the school had in place.

But the school appeared to think Dean’s out-of-the-classroom political speech was more important than his work on the clock. The ex-principal blames the “media blowback” for his dismissal and says it painted him a very unfair light.

“This story painted me out to be a white supremacist overseer of a black school,” he said. “Variations of it have stated that I seek to strip education from the students and that I even fast track them to jail. The way I was presented was calculated by the photographer at the monument and by the person that created the fake meme. It was a perfect PR nightmare and they decided I was not worth the media blowback.”

The ex-principal, who has spent nearly 11 years in the field of alternative and juvenile justice, was adamant he didn’t try to make his students think as he does, but to “make them think critically. We need critical thinkers to evaluate the landscape and find a place where they can affect positive change.”

On his politics, Dean says, “I want to see our nation do well through a healthy, strong, and educated populace. I believe it is my civic responsibility to live these values and to oppose tyranny, whether imposed through a pen or a sword.”

To add to Dean’s troubles, he recently underwent back surgery and his unemployment has made it tougher to pay off the costs of the operations. Friends have set up a GoFundMe to help him meet the expenses.

Looking back at his situation, Dean reflected on how things have taken a dramatic turn for him and how he hopes to turn it around. “I was the provider for my family and now my career has been destroyed. I need a job where my skill set can be of value, and I need to find a lawyer that can help right this wrong.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2017/06/01/principal-fired-after-attending-confederate-protest-speaks-out/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiC5d_vgLT9AhXaFlkFHfmtBV44UBAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw1fK_r7FaUqGs0lQkVz3iJa,2017-06-01
More Footage Leaks Of CNN’s ‘Staged’ Muslim Anti-Terror Protest [VIDEO],"Early this week, CNN was accused of staging a Muslim-led anti-terror protest after the London terror attacks. Now, more footage has dropped that shows what happened on the scene before the CNN shot was taken.

A Youtube video taken by Claire Jordan shows her milling around the scene and “protest” prior to CNN lining up the protesters for their on-air shot. (VIDEO: CNN Responds To Claims They Staged A Muslim Anti-Terror Protest)

There is a group of people in the area, both Muslim and non-Muslim, and some of them can be seen handing out bouquets of flowers and posters.

Jordan, narrating the video, observes, “you see more press than anyone else.”

Jordan then crosses the street and shows the Muslim women who were featured on the CNN broadcast. They are located on the opposite side of the street and “they’re taking selfies, none of them have got flowers.”

“I was there just before,” she explains, “and you see, again, this is the group of women and the little boy–they’re just getting their posters now.”

The Muslim women then gather their posters and cross the street to set up for the CNN shot that was used in the broadcast.

Google And Facebook Co-Sponsoring Protest Of Pro-Life Women’s Health Care Clinic,"Two of the most powerful companies in the world are co-sponsoring a protest against a pro-life women’s health care clinic that provides free medical services and counseling to pregnant women — just not abortions.

Facebook and Google are co-sponsoring Netroots Nation, an annual gathering of progressive activists and political leaders that is targeting a pro-life organization, Human Coalition, and the health care clinics they operate under the name Cura, which provide free medical services and counseling for women with unplanned pregnancies. The protest’s organizers claim two primary motivations for going after Human Coalition’s clinics: they’re pro-life, and they’re successful. (RELATED: ‘Betrayal’ — Left-Wingers Furious With Democrats’ Support For Pro-Life Candidates)

Netroots’ official agenda has the protest scheduled for Saturday at noon, immediately following one event featuring Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and shortly before another event featuring former Vice President Al Gore. Google and Facebook are listed as “premier sponsors” of Netroots, alongside far-left organizations like Planned Parenthood.

Saturday’s protest pits activists backed by two of the top four most valuable brands in the world against a small but effective organization that describes itself as both pro-women and pro-child.

Pro-abortion group Reproaction will lead Saturday’s protest against Human Coalition. Reproaction claims Human Coalition’s health center is a “fake clinic” because — unlike, say, Planned Parenthood — they don’t perform abortions. The protest is titled, “Get Fake Clinics Out Of Atlanta!”

“We are taking direct action on CURA Women’s Care Clinic to send a message to Human Coalition and other crisis pregnancy centers that they will no longer get a pass for misleading women who are trying to find abortion services,” claim the protest organizers. The organizers appear particularly disturbed by Human Coalition’s use of prayer: their description of Saturday’s protest includes two direct references to the advocacy group’s promotion of prayers for women considering abortions.

But it’s the left-wing activists who are actively deceiving women in pursuit of political goals, argued Human Coalition’s communications director Lauren Enriquez.

“This is the industry that also calls prenatal human beings ‘products of conception,'” said Enriquez. “We aren’t surprised that those who would prefer that pregnant women in crisis not have access to anything but abortion have employed deceptive rhetoric to try to delude the public about the services offered by our women’s care clinics.”

Human Coalition appears to have earned a target on its back after the organization placed two op-eds in the New York Times. The protest organizers cite the two op-eds — placed in a paper with an overwhelmingly pro-abortion editorial board — as a sign that Human Coalition has been successful, and therefore must be destroyed.

“Human Coalition staff have caught the attention of The New York Times twice this year, publishing editorials spreading the falsehood that abortion is dehumanizing to women, and that opposition to abortion is part of feminism,” Reproaction states, adding: “(nope, pro-life feminism is impossible).”

In one of those op-eds, Enriquez explained that pro-life women “reject the version of ‘feminism’ that infers that we cannot be equal to men unless we snuff out what is unique about us as women: our ability to protect, nourish and nurture new life inside of our bodies.”

Saturday’s protest of an organization devoted to helping women and unborn children indicates that Google and Facebook are becoming more open in their support of left-wing political causes.

Both Google and Facebook have long been accused of harboring left-wing biases. (RELATED: Snopes, Which Is Fact-Checking For Facebook, Employs Leftists Almost Exclusively)

Google’s board of directors donated six times as much money to Democrats as Republicans, the Media Research Center found. The company has been accused of burying negative search results for Democratic figures like Hillary Clinton, although it denied that charge.

Google recently found itself at the center of a public relations firestorm after firing an employee, James Damare, for writing a scientifically-based memo against the company’s “ideological echo chamber” and culture of political correctness run amok. New York Times columnist David Brooks called on Google CEO Sundar Pichai to resign in a column on Friday, arguing that Pichai “joined the mob” against Damore.

Facebook’s liberal biases are well documented. (RELATED: Leaked Emails Show Facebook Exec Shared Research With Clinton Campaign)

Anarchists Carrying ‘No Hate’ Shields Assault People At Berkeley Protest,"A large group of anarchists interrupted a left-wing protest against a canceled right-wing demonstration in Berkeley, Calif., attacking five people Sunday afternoon.

The anarchists, dressed in black and carrying shields reading “no hate,” crashed the left-wing “Rally Against Hate,” a protest against a canceled right-wing demonstration against Marxism, reports the Associated Press.

A hundred anarchists moved through the police line and were able to enter into the crowd of about 2,000 people. While there, the group assaulted some Trump supporters and other right-wing counter protesters who showed up to the rally.

The group attacked Joey Gibson, the Patriot Prayer group’s leader, with pepper spray and chased him to the police line. Gibson escaped them by running behind police officers dressed in riot gear.

Anarchists also kicked and punched other men at the rally, only to stop when police officers stepped in to intervene, according to an Associated Press reporter.

Some of the left-wing protesters yelled at a Latin Trump supporter, saying he should be ashamed for supporting the president.

“You are an immigrant,” Karla Fonseca, a protester, shouted as the man held a sign for Trump. “You should be ashamed of yourself.” The man later explained that he wanted President Donald Trump to build the wall on the border even though he had been born in Mexico.

The protesters came out against a rally a right-wing group was supposed to hold against Marxism in America. The organizer for the right-wing group canceled it, citing concerns that counter protesters would make it difficult to hold. Some right-wing protesters still came out to demonstrate.

Police eventually arrested about ten people by the time the rally came to an end.

EXCLUSIVE: Antifa Assaulted Comedian Who Attended Berkeley Protest As Popcorn Vendor,"Not everyone who participated in the Berkeley protest this weekend was violent.

In fact, most people weren’t — but one comedian, Vito Gesualdi, took it upon himself to check out what Antifa was up to by going there as a popcorn salesman, and they were most definitely violent toward him.

His visit was anything but peaceful. It exposed the kind of extremist political violence that turned him into a target because the black-clad leftist mob had no one else to go after.

Parts of the protest turned violent when Antifa members attacked journalists and the few right-wing protesters who were present, prompting police to conduct over a dozen arrests.

Gesualdi previously made waves when he attended the April 15 protests in Berkeley to hand out cans of Pepsi — riffing on the poorly conceived Kendall Jenner ad. While dressed as an old-timey popcorn salesman this time around, Gesualdi was assaulted by Antifa members and harangued as a “capitalist” and a “right wing troll” for doing little more than standing around asking people if they wanted to buy snacks.

The Daily Caller caught up with Gesualdi, who says his experiences reveal how humorless the Antifa protesters are and how dangerous they can be — especially when there are no alt-right protesters for them to fight against.

“As a comedian I am obviously a big free speech advocate, which is why this recent wave of protests bother me,” he says. “Though most of the protesters have good intentions and show up simply looking to exercise their free speech rights, many come for the sole purpose of starting fights and causing destruction. That’s not how we solve problems in America.”

“What I do is bring a bit of absurdism to the venue, to hopefully keep things lighthearted while also showing how ridiculous it is to characterize these protests as if they are the battlegrounds of a civil war,” says the comedian. “These kids may think they are badass street soldiers fighting against the forces of evil, but it’s hard to maintain that narrative when you’re being heckled by a peanut vendor.”

Gesualdi says that unlike the last time, the protest site was “almost devoid” of right-wing voices, many of whom were chased off by the large Antifa turnout, or because they were warned not to go by the organizer.

“I saw one group of people being chased into the police station by a group of leftists,” he says. “There’s actually a great video of this on LiveLeak, which pans over to me hawking my wares.”

The comedian says that the normal Berkeley protest crowd was peaceful, with “lots of people laughing, asking for pictures, etc.” A trio of Juggalos — fans of Insane Clown Posse — even treated Gesualdi to a bottle of Faygo and he got to sing along to “I’m Gonna Let It Shine” with older hippies.

“It was only when I got too close to the Antifa camp that things started to go south,” he says, describing how he was attacked by two separate black-clad groups.

“One group of Antifa-types took issue with the tiny American flags attached my vendor’s tray of snacks,” he described footage that was captured on his video. “Declaring them symbols of colonialism and white supremacy, they ripped them off and burned them in front of me. I was surprised they were so brazen about it, and parts of the crowd even cheered as the flags burned.”

Gesualdi was confronted by another set of Antifa later on in the day, when one of them declared him a “troll” and encouraged the group to accost him. “Knowing this could end badly I attempted to walk away from the situation, but they followed behind, ringing a cowbell for some reason. Very intimidating.”

He speculates that the reason he was targeted was because few right-wing voices had come out for them to attack, so they were happy to go after him. “They lobbed some rotten tomatoes at me, but thankfully, none of them could throw worth a damn. They blared rape whistles in my ear and got some tomato juice on my shirt, but stormed off in anger when I just ignored their nonsense and kept trying to sell them bags of popcorn.”

Gesualdi says that what really surprised him about the protest was how many people there were going on about the “evils of capitalism.”

“They seemed too much like a stereotype of the classic clueless communist who knows capitalism is evil but isn’t really sure why,” he says. “One young man tried seriously explaining to me that people didn’t want to pay because they were socialist, though I actually had commenters from socialist countries tell me that of course they pay for their food and that kid was a clueless idiot.”

“Others told me to cease my selling and ‘seize the means of production.’ I will have to look into seeing if the state is willing to acquire me a free peanut factory.”

Gesualdi says he won’t let the bad experience deter him from going to future rallies if it allows him to keep exposing their absurdity, but he worries that Antifa will paint a target on his back if he becomes a regular face.

“The Berkeley police were nowhere to be seen on both occasions I’ve gone and I honestly believe it’s only a matter of time before someone gets killed at one of these things,” he says.

People Are Gearing Up To Protest The Lack Of Public Toilets For Women,"Protesters in Amsterdam are planning demonstrations Friday due to the lack of public toilets for women.

Officials previously fined Geerte Piening, 23, after she urinated in the street because she could not find a toilet for women. Piening, frustrated for receiving the fine, brought the matter to court. A judge ruled she should have used a toilet for men, sparking the call for women to protest. Amsterdam has 35 public urinals for men and only three public toilets for women, The Guardian reported Thursday.

Piening’s case caused major backlash due to the struggles women have finding a public toilet in the city.

“It has become a massive feminist issue, and that was not really what I was after,” Piening said. “On the other hand, it is about time the issue was raised. It is embarrassing that there is nowhere for women to go.”

There are currently 1,100 people planning to take part in a protest called “Urinoirplassen voor vrouwen,” according to Facebook. Another 7,900 Facebook users expressed interested in attending the event that lasts through Sept. 30.

Due to the large number expected to attend, the women are encouraged to protest at urinals spread throughout Amsterdam, added Dutch News.

School May Ban Protest Against Teacher Who Made Students Remove Trump T-Shirts,"A Georgia high school has threatened to bring in police to prevent a Wednesday protest against a teacher that forced two students to flip their shirts inside out because they displayed the slogan “Make America Great Again.”

River Ridge High School (RRHS) announced that the Sept. 27 protest posed a danger to students and staff. State Sen. Michael Williams, a Republican candidate for Georgia governor, organized the protest and explicitly called for it to be peaceful. Williams claimed Thursday that the school is infringing on protesters’ First Amendment rights.

“The school claims to have pre-determined that our peaceful protest, ‘will significantly disrupt teaching and learning and may endanger the safety of more than 3,200 students and staff,'” Williams said in a statement provided to The Daily Caller News Foundation. “The arrogance of such statements is insulting to myself and our peaceful protestors. We will not be intimidated by your deceitful statement meant to prevent our lawful right to assemble. The protest will continue as planned. Once again, this school has failed to properly handle simple situations”



A video recorded by a student Sept. 2 shows an RRHS teacher equating President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan with a swastika before forcing two students out of the classroom to turn their shirts inside out.

“You cannot wear a swastika to school … you cannot wear ‘Make America Great Again’ like that,” the teacher said in the video. “Please go, at least for this class. I don’t care what you do in other classes.”

Williams’ campaign claimed that any attempt by the school to prevent the protest was unwarranted because the local county sheriff had deemed the event to be legal. Regardless, RRHS plans to monitor and perhaps cease the event.

“School police officers and other public safety personnel will be monitoring the driveway entrances and elsewhere on campus to ensure students and employees stay safe and secure; and the campus will be on Code Yellow all day,” school spokeswoman Barbara P. Jacoby wrote in a statement.

Colorado Anti-Fracking Activists Stage Another Embarrassing ‘Die-In’ Protest,"Activists in Colorado staged a “die-in” demonstration Tuesday protesting the fossil fuel industry a day after a sniper shot and killed several people at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas.

Members of East Boulder County United (EBCU) staged a protest at a city hall meeting opposing policies that promote fracking. Activists, many of whom believe fracking causes citizens to die, stormed the meeting while holding mock tombstones with the words “Killed by Gas” written on them.

“Your citizens are lying on the floor of this hearing room to show you first-hand, the death and destruction that is coming to Boulder County from fracking,” according to an Oct. 3 post on the group’s Facebook profile. EBCU video taped the demonstration as well.

“We are staging a peaceful die-in to illustrate the lethality and the seriousness of what you are allowing to happen,” the group noted. Activists with the group oppose hydraulic fracking, which is a method gas production studies show helps dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

EBCU used an image of the protesters lying on the ground at the Boulder County Commissioners (BCC) meeting, while holding grave markers, to promote and solicit donations to their efforts with the caption: “If you like what you’ve seen recently, please consider donating to our general fund.”

One of the group’s members implored the BCC during the meeting to pass a “Climate Bill of Rights,” which the EBCU’s members believe would protect Boulder, Colo., citizens from the supposed dangers of fracking. A similar bill in Layfette County, Colo., sought to prohibit police officers from arresting or detaining those attempting to use “nonviolent direct action” to enforce the bill’s tenants.

The Layfette version was a reaction to an amendment passed in November of 2016 making it more difficult for Colorado to ban fracking. The measure requires a proposed amendment to garner voter signatures in all 35 state Senate districts before it can be passed into law; more than 50 percent of voters must approve future amendments.

EBCU’s die-in protest came less than two days after a Stephen Paddock killed 58 people during a Las Vegas music concert – the horrific shooting is considered one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history. The group’s ill-timed demonstration comes on the heels of similarly awkward moments for the anti-fracking activists in Colorado.

Members of the Boulder County Protectors (BCP), for instance, protested outside the home of a government official in September they believed to be a fossil fuel supporter, not realizing the official had long since moved to a different residence. BCP joined BCC during Tuesday’s die-in protest.

They demonstrated outside a home in Boulder where they thought Boulder County Commissioner Elise Jones lived. Jones hasn’t lived in the house for nearly five years, much to BCP’s chagrin. The day of the rally about 50 community members had marched “on a home of politically compromised Boulder County commissioner Elise Jones asking her to resign,” the group said in a news release.

EBCU has not responded to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment for this story.

Democratic State Rep. Arrested In Anti-Black Friday Protest,"A Democratic state representative in Missouri was among those arrested as part of anti-Black Friday protests in St. Louis.

State Rep. Bruce Franks Jr. was among seven people arrested after they marched through the St. Louis Galleria mall, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. The protesters reportedly chanted “Shut it down!” as they marched through the mall.

Franks advertised the protest on Twitter beforehand.

The protest was part of an economic boycott meant to raise awareness of alleged mistreatment of African-Americans in the St. Louis area.

Franks, who was a local rapper and activist before winning election last year, was arrested last month after blocking a highway as part of anti-police protests. (RELATED: Elected Democratic Lawmaker Rapped About Dismembering Murder Victims [VIDEO])

Sinclair Producer Who Resigned To Protest ‘Obvious Bias’ Turns Out To Be A Left-Wing Activist [VIDEO],"A producer for a Sinclair-owned TV station, who resigned in protest of the company’s “obvious bias,” isn’t quite the unbiased journalist CNN portrayed him to be.

KHGI TV producer Justin Simmons resigned following a Sinclair promotion that warned against “fake news” and national media outlets practicing dishonest journalism.

The promo, which was widely condemned among liberal journalists, was “almost forcing local news anchors to lie to their viewers,” Simmons told CNN reporter Brian Stelter.

CNN’s coverage portrayed Simmons’ resignation as part of a broader clash between apolitical local journalists and conservative-leaning Sinclair executives. What CNN’s coverage didn’t note is Simmons is a proud left-wing activist.

Simmons tweeted in April 2016 about taking part in a protest against Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, which left-wing political group Democracy Spring organized. “When we took over @SpeakerRyan ‘s podium protesting to #GetMoneyOut at a @DemSpring protest,” wrote Simmons, linking to video from the protest.

Simmons also organized a Black Lives Matter protest in May 2016 and took media interviews in his role as a liberal activist.

“Nebraska isn’t going to stand for the systemic racism that we have in our country and in our police force,” Simmons told KSNB Local4. “Most importantly, we want to open people’s minds and show them that the Black Lives Matter Movement is mostly peaceful.”

Simmons later tweeted a YouTube video of the interview.

WATCH:

Simmons first joined the station “nearly four years ago,” according to CNN’s report, which means he was organizing liberal protests while working as an ostensibly neutral journalist.

CNN’s Stelter has a long-running feud with Sinclair, which he once described as an “evil operation.”

New Gun Control Laws Spawn Second Amendment Protest In Vermont,"Vermont’s Republican Governor Phil Scott pledged to sign three new gun-control bills next week, making it easier for the state to confiscate firearms from certain people.

The first bill would make it easier to confiscate guns from someone considered to be at risk of harming themselves or others. The second allows the police to confiscate firearms from anyone whose been arrested or cited for domestic violence. The third bill would raise the gun purchase age to 21 and expand background checks. It would also ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines, according to WVNY.

Hundreds of Second Amendment supporters gathered in South Burlington Saturday to protest the Governor’s decision and express their disappointment.

“Those bills won’t be able to protect us,” pre-school teacher Naomi Snelling told WVNY. “I know how to protect myself and other people, and I know the lines of when [sic] I need to draw that.”

Most people carried protests signs, but others open carried AR-15’s across their chest to make a point, WVNY reports.

Rally organizer Christopher Covey never expected he’d lead a gun rights protest but is now fully committed to spreading the group’s message, he told WVNY

The group, “Vermont Gun March,” plans to hold several rallies over the summer to protest gun control. Their tagline: “Remember in November.”

“We’re trying to get people to understand us and understand why we want our right to bear arms,” Covey told WVNY.

WVNY reached out to Gov. Scott’s office and Gun Sense Vermont, a local group advocating for stricter gun control. Neither responded to their request for comment.

Parkland Students’ Anti-NRA Protest Against Publix Backfires,"Publix Super Markets Inc. announced Friday that it’s suspending all political donations in the wake of a “die-in” boycott from anti-gun Parkland students and others opposed to its donation to a pro-NRA Florida political candidate.

The move presumably includes liberal politicians and causes, too. Some on Twitter pointed out that Publix has given plenty of money to left-leaning causes.

IJR’s Caleb Hull noted that, among other causes, Publix also pulled out of “funding for same-sex marriage and abortion advocacy…”

Publix reportedly gave $670,000 to the pro-business, pro-gun rights candidate Adam Putnam, who is currently running for governor of Florida and once described himself as a “proud NRA sellout” on Twitter. (RELATED: Publix Grocery Stores Facing Boycott Over Support Of Second Amendment Candidate)

Protests Already Planned For Trump’s SCOTUS Nominee,"The left-wing group Refuse Fascism is planning a nation-wide protest Monday night after President Donald Trump reveals his Supreme Court nominee.

The protests will go on regardless of who Trump chooses, spanning 12 American cities — Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, Honolulu, Chicago, Cleveland, Boston, Philadelphia, New York City, Atlanta, Detroit, and Seattle, according to its website.

“The Trump/Pence Regime poses a catastrophic danger to humanity and the planet, and that it is our responsibility to drive them from power through non-violent protests that grow every day until our demand is met,” Refuse Fascism, founded after the 2016 election, stated on its site. (RELATED: New Normal: Trump Allies Face Harassment, Protests Anywhere They Show Their Faces)

The Facebook event photo for Monday night shows a Ku Klux Klan hood on the generic justice figure.

The Chicago chapter’s event page is titled “Keep Abortion Legal – No Fascist Supreme Court.”

The group have previously protested with Occupy Wall Street, the Women’s March, and even the Revolutionary Communist Party, displaying severed head images of the president, according to Fox News.

Refuse Fascism did not immediately respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Women’s Protest Says Pence ‘Ushering In A Theocratic Society’,"A group of more than 100 women are planning to protest Vice President Mike Pence’s Monday visit to Philadelphia dressed in costumes resembling “The Handmaid’s Tale” because Pence will “[usher] in a theocratic society.”

“Pence is one of the most dangerous reactionary figures in modern history … he has dutifully supported and been instrumental in every Trump policy since they made their unholy, “holy” alliance to bring Christian Fascism to the heart of this regime. He is a key figure in ushering in a theocratic society right out of the Handmaids Tale,” the event page for the protest states.

“It is only fitting that Pence be greeted with 100 women dressed as handmaids. A visual representation of Pence’s end game of women totally stripped of their rights and humanity,” the event says.

Refuse Fascism, which is “a movement of people coming from diverse perspectives, united in our recognition that the Trump/Pence Regime poses a catastrophic danger to humanity and the planet,” is the group behind the protest, according to the organization’s website. (RELATED: Women’s March Promotes Antifa Protest Against ‘Unite The Right’ Part Two)

PhillyUp, “a grassroots, feminist, intersectional group of passionate Philadelphia progressives,” is also helping to organize the event.

The groups are protesting Pence’s trip to Philadelphia to campaign for Pennsylvania Senate candidate and Republican State Rep. Lou Barletta. Pence is speaking at a Monday night campaign event at the Union League Club for the candidate, according to The Hill.

“The Handmaid’s Tale” depicts a society where the U.S. becomes a Christian theocracy called Gilead and women are barred from basic tasks such as reading. Author Margaret Atwood previously compared the society in the book to the Trump regime, saying that the U.S. was becoming more “Gilead-like.”

The protesters plan to wear the novel’s signature red robes and white bonnets.

"Portland Sweeps Up After ‘Disgusting’ Occupy ICE Protest, Calls Site A ‘Biohazard’","Portland is sweeping up after an Occupy ICE camp was shut down on Wednesday. Local police calling the protest site a biohazard.

As Fox News reports, the city’s mayor is offering to pay for some of the clean-up costs, but other Portland officials are wondering why the protesters can’t be forced to pay the bill after they created the “disgusting” mess.

“It was pretty disgusting that that’s how they were living back there,” local resident Frank Savage told FOX 12.

Savage looks forward to a return to normalcy. “Getting tired of waking up to the bullhorn and the sounds and the cussing,” he said.

The protesters left the area strewn with plenty of garbage — including recyclable material like plastic containers and liquor bottles that the activists didn’t bother to place in the appropriate bins. They even built a latrine.

The demonstrators erected the site by a Portland ICE office to show their opposition to the Trump administration’s tough-line on illegals.

The protesters want to terminate ICE. It is a policy position that has been gaining traction with some top-level Democrats, but they have backed away from a bill advocating the agency’s abolition.

Dallas Cowboys QB Dak Prescott: ‘I’d Never Protest During The Anthem’,"Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott said on Friday that he isn’t affected by his team’s policy of standing during the national anthem because he would “never protest” during the song’s performance.

WATCH:

“It has no affect to me because I do exactly what I’m doing and what I’ve said and what I stand by,” Prescott said, referring to the policy set forth by team owner Jerry Jones. “Whether I was wearing the star or not, whether I was playing for Jerry Jones, Stephen Jones or any other owner. I believe in what I believe in, and that’s that.” (RELATED: Eagles Malcolm Jenkins Calls Jerry Jones A ‘Bully’ Over Anthem Stance: ‘I Don’t Play For The Cowboys, Nor Would I Want To’)

Prescott added that although he does believe in the social justice issues that have led many other players to protests the anthem, he doesn’t think it’s “the time or the venue to do so.” (RELATED: EX-NFL PLAYER SAYS PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ATTACKING ‘BLACK CULTURE’ THROUGH ANTHEM PROTEST CRITICISM)

“I’d never protest during the anthem, and I don’t think that’s the time or the venue to do so,” he said. “The game of football has always brought me such peace, and I think it does the same for a lot of people.”

“When you bring such a controversy to the stadium, to the field, to the game, it takes away … from that. It takes away from the joy and the love that football brings a lot of people.” (RELATED: TRUMP PRAISES JERRY JONES FOR MAKING COWBOYS STAND FOR NATIONAL ANTHEM)

“I think this whole kneeling, and all of that, was all about just raising awareness, and the fact that we’re still talking about social injustice years later, I think we’ve gotten to that point,” said the quarterback. “I think we’ve proved it. We know about social injustice. I’m up for taking a next step, whatever that step may be for action and not just kneeling.”

"Rosie O’Donnell And Broadway Performers Protest Outside White House, Trump In New Jersey","WATCH:

Anti-Trump celebrity Rosie O’Donnell, along with a number of Broadway performers, protested President Donald Trump outside of the White House on Monday night.

O’Donnell and a group of Broadway actors bussed into Washington, D.C. from New York City to perform musical numbers, hoping they would be so loud that it would disrupt the president’s sleep — but there was only one problem with their plan: President Trump was in New Jersey at the time of the protest, not the White House.

O’Donnell and the performers sang for about 20 minutes, then left right afterward.

Other anti-Trump speakers and people dancing around in odd shark and dinosaur costumes filled the rest of the time. The speakers recited stale and worn out liberal narratives, accusing Trump of being a racist and of colluding with the Russians, and accusing Republicans of not wanting minorities to vote — this, of course, without presenting any evidence to back up their claims.

There have been several protests outside the White House over the last three weeks. According to organizers, “the protests will not stop until Trump is gone.”

The protest drew in a small crowd and the event dwindled to a few dozen after two hours.

They really showed President Trump.

Liberty University President Gives An Okay For 300 Students To Support Kavanaugh Amidst Yale Protesters,"Liberty University is allowing up to 300 students to miss classes Thursday in order to give Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh support in Washington, D.C., and counter Yale University protesters.

“If you want to be excused from classes tomorrow, go to Washington and counter what the Yale students are doing, [and] support Judge Kavanaugh, we’ve got 300 spots for you,” Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. said at the school’s convocation Wednesday, according to a Facebook video posted by Liberty.

Falwell made the announcement after Liberty University alumnus and head of Concerned Women for America (CWA) Penny Nance offered to pay for 150 students to go and support Kavanaugh.

“We agreed to match that,” Falwell said. “We’re going to send buses for 150 more.”

CWA, a public policy women’s organization, will be holding an “I Stand With Brett” rally on Capitol Hill from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m., according to a press release.

“Senate Democrats continue to use dirty tricks, threats, and lies to smear a decent man and delay the process of confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court,” Nance said, the media advisory stated. “Enough is enough!” (RELATED: School Board Member Shares Kavanaugh Accusation Joke, Activist Group Asks Her To Resign)

Yale students started protesting Kavanaugh on Monday after Deborah Ramirez’s allegation was reported in The New Yorker, where she accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself at a college party in the 1983-84 school year, The Associated Press reported. Some students staged a sit-in at the university while others traveled to the district to protest Kavanaugh’s nomination.

Christine Blasey Ford was the first person to accuse Kavanaugh of forcing himself onto her at a party when they were in high school. Ramirez was the second accuser.

Julie Swetnick claimed to have seen Kavanaugh “engage in abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls,” according to an allegation released by lawyer Michael Avenatti Wednesday.

Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.

The convocation featured Turning Point USA’s Communication Director Candace Owens, where her speech focused on victim mentality.

The university hosts regular convocations on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, according to Liberty’s website.

Falwell indicated that students will need to leave the Virginia campus around 2:30 a.m for those traveling to the district.

I Watched Hollywood Stars Get ‘Arrested’ For Protesting Kavanaugh — Here’s What Really Happened,"Hundreds of anti-Kavanaugh protesters flooded the Senate office buildings Thursday to scream at senators, chant, sing and hold signs. One of the acts of protest that occurred was a large sit-in held in the Hart Senate office building. Approximately 300 protesters gathered together in a large atrium and chanted anti-Kavanaugh slogans at one another. There were two well-known celebrities that joined them.

Comedian Amy Schumer and model Emily Ratajkowski were among them. A massive banner was unfurled from a balcony that read “We Believe Christine Basley Ford” as dozens of Capitol Police moved into the crowd.

Here’s where it gets interesting.

The police began politely asking the protesters if they wished to get arrested. The protesters had time to confer with one another and think about it. The officers were patient, but eventually separated the protesters who wished to be arrested from the ones who did not. During this calm separation process by the police, this reporter witnessed Schumer and Ratajkowski verbally ask to be arrested. Here is video of this happening:

Here is @amyschumer telling cops she *wants* to be arrested. Cop asks “Do you want to be arrested?” Schumer: “Yes.” Save this for the “I can’t believe I was arrested for free speech!” Tweet from her soon. pic.twitter.com/TLGaDAyh1T — Benny (@bennyjohnson) October 4, 2018

The Hollywood stars sat on the floor with their entourage for approximately 30 minutes, chanting and singing along with the rest of the protest. The police asked groups of the protesters to line up in an orderly fashion to get “arrested.” All protesters complied. According to the Capitol Police, the protesters were charged with unlawfully demonstrating and then immediately released.

“The individuals arrested are being processed on site and released. At this time, we are unable to confirm the names of those arrested due to the large number being processed,” a Capitol police statement read. To get the charges dropped, all one must do is pay a $50 ticket.

A pretty easy tab for the famous millionaires.

I watched Schumer and Ratajkowski chatting with the police officers and dancing before they were led away. The group was smiling and under no duress. The officers gave the Hollywood crew pink wristbands for some reason before walking them out.

Based on the ease of the event, I did not expect there to be much made of the arrests. However, I was stunned to read the coverage of the event as far more dramatic and stress-filled than it actually was. No report mentioned that the two Hollywood stars verbally agreed to be arrested or that they were having a nice time while it happened.

When I saw Ratajkowski post a photo with a caption lamenting her arrest, I was bewildered. Ratajkowski wrote:

“Today I was arrested protesting the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, a man who has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault. Men who hurt women can no longer be placed in positions of power.”

I had to share my coverage of the staged hero moment for clarity, specifically the verbal agreement for being arrested, and the dancing and smiling Schumer and Ratajkowski engaged in during their arrests.

You’re joking, right?

“Arrested?”

I watched the cops walk up to you and ask politely if you wanted to be arrested. You & Amy Schumer said “yes.” Then you both just sat comfortably on the floor until the cops gave you special wristbands & politely escorted you out I have video. https://t.co/J5RiZ3CPkL — Benny (@bennyjohnson) October 4, 2018

Perhaps it will add some clarity for the millions of followers and fans of Schumer and Ratajkowski who are worried that they’re locked up in a cold jail call in the bowels of the U.S. Capitol.

‘A Dramatic Rebuke Of The Communist Leadership’: Hundreds Of Thousands In Hong Kong Stand Up To Communist Party Extradition Bill,"Hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered on the streets of Hong Kong Sunday in protest of a new law that will allow Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to mainland China.

The streets of central Hong Kong were densely packed with demonstrators rallying against the extradition bill that many fear will trample civil rights. The bill allows for Hong Kong citizens to be legally taken to mainland China for criminal trial in Communist Party controlled courts.

Critics of the bill are concerned that it will be used to crack down on dissident acts against the Communist Party, The New York Times reported.

The protest was mostly peaceful during the day and took a violent turn overnight, with at least seven protesters who were arrested, according to Hong Kong police. Police reportedly resorted to using pepper spray on some protesters, according to CNN.

Some protesters were reported to have thrown sticks and bottles at police, shouting, “Communist dogs!” the Times reported.

The event “represented a dramatic rebuke of the Communist leadership and a potential political crisis for Beijing,” the Times reported. (RELATED: China Rages At Accusation That It Is ‘At War With Faith’)

Chief Executive of Hong Kong Carrie Lam assured citizens in a defense of the bill that there would be safeguards in place to protect human rights.

“We will make sure that all these additional safeguards are legally binding,” she said in a press conference Monday.

Police estimated there were upwards of 240,000 people present at the protest during its peak, making it the largest demonstration since 2003, when 500,000 protesters demonstrated against a sedition law that was successfully prevented from coming into effect, according to CNN.

“I think this law will take away our freedoms if it is implemented,” 16-year-old protester Peter Lam said.

“We will not have the right to express ourselves. So we must stand up and express ourselves today,” he continued.

The government says that the bill was originally designed to do away with certain loopholes in the law by allowing Hong Kong to decide whether to send fugitives to Taiwan, Macau or mainland China where there are no formal extradition arrangements, according to CNN. The insurance of a fair trial will not be written into the bill, according to lawmakers.

Proposal of the bill was reportedly inspired by a specific criminal case in which a female Hong Kong tourist was allegedly killed by her boyfriend in Taiwan, but due to current laws, the suspect could not be sent to face trial in Taiwan, CNN reported.

Logging Trucks And Tractors Descend On Oregon Capitol To Protest Cap-And-Trade Bill,"Semi-trucks and tractors surrounded the Oregon Capitol Thursday to show support for GOP lawmakers who agreed Friday to return for weekend sessions.

The protest against climate legislation was held as most of the state senators stayed in hiding, despite Democrats’ assurances that they do not have the votes to pass HB 2020, the cap-and-trade bill that Republicans walked out on June 20, the Associated Press reported. (RELATED: Oregon Democrat Senators Fold Under Pressure After GOP Walkout On Climate Bill)

WATCH:

State Senate Minority Leader Herman Baertschiger, Jr. held a news conference Friday to announce status negotiations with Democrats, which he returned to town late Wednesday to conduct.

“I was disappointed by the barrage of threats from state police, fines and the possible removal of capital construction projects from our districts,” Baertschiger, Jr. in a televised press conference Friday.

“It saddens me that that’s how some people govern in this state,”

Hundreds of truckers rolled into the streets around the Oregon Capitol on Thursday morning to protest the climate bill that has divided the Oregon Legislature largely along party lines. https://t.co/d0af1fx2us pic.twitter.com/Ih6HwvDfuK — The Oregonian (@Oregonian) June 28, 2019

“I don’t think anyone’s against coming up with a carbon reduction policy but we’ve got to get it right. We have a fragile economy here in Oregon we’re a small state and we have to protect our economy,” Baertschiger added.

Baertschiger said the rogue Republicans would only return if the bill was dead. He said the majority, if not all, of the lawmakers will return for weekend sessions that will be held Saturday and Sunday.

The 11-member Republican walkout kept the Senate from conducting business with two senators short of the necessary quorum of 20. The legislative session ends midnight Sunday, June 30. (RELATED: Oregon GOP Lawmakers Stay On The Lam)

Baertschiger also said the senators had been using personal funds for their travel, and as of now they are still being fined $500 a day.

"Liberal Activists In Boston Protest Amazon’s Partnership With ICE, Block Traffic","Hundreds of people blocked rush-hour traffic Thursday to protest Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), resulting in a dozen arrests for trespassing on Amazon property.

The protesters — who caused a traffic congestion during their march — took specific aim with Amazon’s reported attempts to sell its facial recognition technology to ICE. The Seattle-based company allegedly encouraged federal immigration authorities to purchase its “Rekognition” facial recognition software. Amazon did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

“Never Again Action” coordinated a demonstration in Boston, Massachusetts, on Thursday to protest private companies cooperation with the federal agency tasked with carrying out deportation orders.

The demonstrators began their march at the New England Holocaust Memorial and marched to Amazon’s Cambridge office.

The entire demonstration equated ICE to the Holocaust, and likened the companies that work with the agency to Nazi collaborators.

“These tools are being used to dehumanize entire communities, to create terror, to track people, and round them up and put them into detention, and then ultimately deport them,” said Elizabeth Weinbloom, a member of Never Again Action. “During the Holocaust, IBM created punchcard and data systems that were used in every concentration camp to track our ancestors.”

Many of the protesters carried Holocaust-themed signs such as “Never Again Is Now” and “Close The Camps” as they marched through the streets. Never Again is a years-old slogan used by the Jewish community, typically meaning to never again allow the horrors of the Holocaust to happen.

The protesters Thursday ultimately entered Amazon’s Kendall Square office in Cambridge. After refusing to comply with police orders, 12 protesters were arrested. A GoFundMe for their bail was close to its $18,000 goal as of press time.

Never Again Action — a Jewish-led group that advocates on behalf of immigrations — has launch a significant number of anti-ICE protests across the country in 2019, with many of their demonstrations taking place near ICE facilities.

During a demonstration by a Rhode Island detention center in August, Never Again Action members blocked the entrance to a staff parking lot. Footage was captured of a corrections officer allegedly trying to drive through the crowd, laying on his horn in an attempt to make the protesters move. (RELATED: Anti-Trump Protesters Demand Illegal Immigrants Be Released, ICE Be Abolished)

As the debate over the illegal immigration continues in Washington, D.C., actions against immigration facilities have become increasingly violent across the country.

A left-wing terrorist died in a shootout with police in July when he tried to blow up a Washington state ICE detention center. An ICE office in San Antonio was shot at several times in August, leaving federal investigators convinced it was a coordinated attack. In the most recent incident, a Florida woman in late August threw a lit Molotov cocktail inside a United States Citizenship and Immigration Services building.

Michelle Malkin Prepares Protest Rally Against ‘Sanctuary’ Montgomery County,"Michelle Malkin and other activists are set to meet at the steps of the Montgomery County Office Building on Friday to demand elected leaders drop its “sanctuary” executive order.

The “Promoting Community Trust Executive Order” prohibits local authorities from working with ICE agents, and largely protects those living in the county illegally from deportation.

The executive order has drawn national criticism after numerous illegal aliens have been charged with rape or other sexual crimes shortly after it was signed into law.

Michelle Malkin and other notable figures will gather in Montgomery County, Maryland, to demand county leaders withdraw its “sanctuary” executive order, and ask that local immigrant communities be protected from gang activity.

The “Community Rally to Protect Our Families and Children” will take place on the steps of the Montgomery County Council Office Building on Friday. The rally is in response to the recent slate of alleged rapes and sexual assaults by illegal aliens living in the county. The sexual crime charges have drawn national criticism against the “sanctuary” executive order recently signed by their county executive.

In Montgomery County to make Maryland safe again and end illegal alien sanctuary #rockvillerally #standwithice https://t.co/um89M0C09Q — Michelle Malkin (@michellemalkin) September 13, 2019

At least eight illegal immigrants have been charged with rape or some other sexual crime in Montgomery County since July 25. In several cases, the victims have been underage girls — one of them was allegedly held at knifepoint as she was raped. The charges have drawn questions over the Promoting Community Trust Executive Order, an executive order signed by Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich in July that largely forbids local authorities from cooperating with ICE agents.

Community activists said they’ve had enough, and will rally in front of the Montgomery County Council to voice their concerns.

“We’re having a rally of local citizens and some national personalities all gather on the steps of the Montgomery County government complex in Rockville, really taking this fight to the heart of this illegal alien sanctuary space,” Malkin told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Malkin — a conservative author, blogger and political commentator — has long been involved with illegal immigration issues. Her newly released book, “Open Borders, Inc.,” exposes the sources of billions of dollars that have gone into pro-mass immigration organizations and causes. She will be joined Friday by Larry O’Connor of WMAL, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), activists with Help Save Maryland, Montgomery County angel families, and others.

The Montgomery County government, for its part, has not taken criticism well. The county council issued a statement earlier in September accusing “the White House, President Trump, Acting USCIS Director Ken Cuccinelli, local and national conservative outlets” of spreading misinformation about the county’s criminal justice system. The council even equated these people with “neo-nazi sympathizers.”

Malkin shamed the Montgomery officials for equating activists with racists.

“A lot of the local moms there have been raising their voices. What has been the response of the Montgomery County executive and council? To smear them as racists and to associate them with neo-Nazis, they actually did this,” she told the DCNF. “It’s no wonder that a lot of just ordinary, good people don’t want to go up against a government that is endangering them.”

Elrich, a liberal Democrat, has also sharply rebuked criticism of the executive order he signed.

The county executive said the release of criminal illegal aliens was completely at the behest of the judicial system, a defense of Montgomery’s policy of not holding illegal aliens in custody in time for ICE agents to apprehend them. Immigration experts and an ICE spokesperson called Elrich’s explanation “absurd” and “insulting.” (RELATED: Maryland Sheriff Flames Montgomery County For Enabling Crimes By Illegal Aliens)

The conservative activists aren’t necessarily holding their breath in the belief that Montgomery will immediately change its sanctuary policies, despite the recent rape charges, but they feel the duty to bring attention to the issue.

“And you wonder: Where are the feminists? There are at least eight of these illegal alien criminal rape suspects. That’s just the ones we know about, who could’ve been caught earlier, but for Montgomery County’s obstinate opposition to cooperation with the feds,” Malkin said.

"About 300 Uber, Lyft Drivers Protest Against ‘Unfair Treatment,’ Bringing NYC Traffic To Standstill","Uber and Lyft drivers in New York who were protesting against new changes to the companies’ apps brought traffic to a standstill in the city Tuesday morning.

About 300 drivers partook in the demonstration organized by the Brooklyn-based Independent Drivers Guild, which represents drivers who work for both rideshare apps, in retaliation of “unfair treatment of drivers” and app changes that came after the city implemented new wage regulations based on utilization, a Sept. 14 Facebook post from the guild reads.

The post called on Democratic New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to “regulate” the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The commission implemented a guaranteed minimum wage rule of $17.22 in the city in February “to provide drivers a minimum take-home pay for each trip after covering expenses,” according to TLC.

“Until we took needed action last year, it has been Uber and Lyft’s business model to oversaturate the market while promising drivers that they could succeed despite these companies’ stacking the deck against them,” Acting TLC Commissioner Bill Heinzen told the Daily Caller News Foundation in a Tuesday statement.

“The Mayor, TLC and City Council put in place smart policies to address the problems these companies created, and they are finally being forced to experiment with ways to run their businesses in an environment of accountability. We will continue to fight on behalf of drivers until they are able to make ends meet,” he continued.

Lyft and Uber have since restricted the number of drivers who are able to pick up riders in unpopular areas of the city. The apps added these limitations to avoid paying the minimum wage requirement for drivers who are less likely to get customers, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.

“Because of the TLC regulations, we’re forced to make changes to the Lyft app to not allow drivers to be online if there isn’t enough demand for rides. The TLC’s approach is bad public policy, and we are working diligently to support drivers during this change,” a Lyft spokesperson told the DCNF.

The Independent Drivers Guild called on de Blasio and the New York City Council “to stop the apps from violating the pay rules in an attempt to scam drivers out of fair pay,” in a statement according to NBC New York.

Most Lyft and Uber drivers are recognized under New York law as independent contractors rather than employees, meaning New York’s wage and hour laws do not cover them. The state’s workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance also do not cover independent contractors, according to WSJ.

New York labor groups are looking to California for inspiration after the state’s Senate and Assembly passed legislation called AB5, which recognizes independent contractors working for app-based companies as employees, last week. Uber, Lyft and DoorDash threatened to spend a collective $90 million to lobby against the bill.

Uber did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

"Protest Showdowns: Anti-Lockdown Protesters Carry Guns In Pennsylvania, Kansas City Counter-Protesters Block Traffic","Protests once again occurred across the nation Monday, with protesters in Kansas City, Missouri facing off with counter-protesters who blocked traffic, and protesters in Pennsylvania carrying rifles and driving in a military truck.

Several anti-lockdown protesters, who appeared to be wearing colorful patterned shirts, arrived in a military-style truck, carrying heavy arms.

Other protesters carried American flags, Betsy Ross flags, Trump signs and “Don’t Tread On Me” flags.

Meanwhile, in Kansas City, Missouri, anti-lockdown protesters faced off with counter-protesters, at least one of whom blocked traffic.

Protesters on the other side carried signed signs attacking the lockdowns. (RELATED: MSNBC Guest Calls Anti-Lockdown Protesters The ‘Fox News Nazi Death Cult Rump’ Of The GOP)

The protests began Tuesday evening at the site of the death of George Floyd. According to WCCO, protest organizers were determined to keep the protests peaceful. People in the crowd chanted “I can’t breath” and “It could’ve been me.” The protest did, however, turn violent as anger and frustration overcame hundreds of protesters.

Protesters moved to the 3rd Minneapolis Precinct, where the officers involved in the death of Floyd supposedly came from. WCCO footage shows protesters becoming violent and smashing police vehicles in the parking lot. Police responded by throwing flash grenades at protesters.

Other video shows protesters attacking police vehicles in the streets as the crowd enveloped them. “We’re here to let them know this can’t be tolerated, there will be severe consequences if they continue to kill us this will not go on another day,” a protester said to WCCO. Another protester said “It’s real ugly. The police have to understand that this is the climate they have created, this is the climate they created.”

The governor has previously criticized anti-lockdown protesters, saying they could increase the spread of the virus.

“These protests, they do undermine the effort, and it’s very clearly a political statement that is playing out where people are coming together from across the state, they are congregating, they’re not wearing masks, they are not staying six feet apart and then they go back home into communities and the risk of perpetuating the spread of COVID-19 is real,” she said last month.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2020/06/05/gretchen-whitmer-george-floyd-protest-social-distancing/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjuio3vgLT9AhXgKlkFHaPZD-s4RhAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw33WiEetg-qRXhs11V54J8J,2020-06-05

You can now add Byrne to the long list of sports power players who have attended protests. I can also promise you that he won’t be the last.

Jim Harbaugh, Sam Pittman and Neal Brown have also attended protests, and you can expect more and more people in the world of sports to get vocal.

The reality of the situation is that people in the world of sports have a bigger platform than most, and people respect the hell out of them.

That’s especially true when it comes to midwestern and southern states. Outside of Nick Saban, Greg Byrne is the most powerful person at the University of Alabama.

Hopefully, his presence at a peaceful protest in the aftermath of Floyd’s death helps ease the painful situation America is in.

I have no doubt we’ll see more and more coaches and other powerful people in sports continue to be visible faces during this tough time.

Nearly 200 Protest ‘Racist’ Gay Bar Dress Code Copied From Pittsburgh Public School,"Roughly 200 people gathered to protest a local gay bar in Pittsburgh for its “racist” dress code, which a worker reportedly told WPXI news channel was directly copied from nearby public schools.

Protesters shut down a heavily trafficked road in downtown Pittsburgh to protest 941 Saloon’s dress code, which was posted on the property’s windows, according to WPXI.

The policy prohibits: tank tops, cutoffs, sleeveless shirts, hoodies, athletic jerseys without collars, bare midriffs, chained wallets, sweat pants, low hanging pants, exposed underwear, pajamas, gang related insignia, bananas worn on the head, and undershirts worn as shirts. It also requires patrons to wear pants at the waist and wear “neat and clean” attire.

Streets were blocked off by police for the protest, where people could be heard chanting “the dress code is racist,” according to WPXI. Protesters also claim the owner of the bar allegedly banned the word “racism” while inside.

But a worker at the bar told WPXI that she doesn’t know why people are protesting, and that the bar is all-inclusive and doesn’t discriminate. She also said the dress code was taken from Pittsburgh Public Schools.

The bar is listed among the gay bars on the LGBTQ portion of the Visit Pittsburgh’s website, and has been reportedly known as a gay bar throughout the community for years, according to the Tribune Review.

“Apparently it’s a gay bar for a certain group of people and not for everybody,” Devar Ferguson, an activist in the Black LGBTQ+ community told the Tribune Review.

Seattle Man Who Drove Into Black Lives Matter Protest Charged With 3 Felonies,"A man accused of killing one woman and injuring another when he drove through a Seattle protest was charged with three felonies Wednesday, the New York Post reported.

Dawit Kelete was charged with felony vehicular homicide, vehicular assault and reckless driving after he struck two protesters with his Jaguar XJL and fled the scene on July 4, the Post reported. Kelete hit Summer Taylor, 24, who died Saturday night and Diaz Love, 32, who was hospitalized in serious condition.

“If they thought this murder would make us back down, they are very wrong. Very wrong,” Love posted to Facebook, the Post reported. “I cannot believe Summer was murdered.” Love added that she was “in a lot of pain,” and that she sustained internal injuries and multiple arm and leg fractures.

Kelete’s lawyer, John Henry Browne, said the crash was a “horrible, horrible accident,” the Post reported.

“There’s absolutely nothing political about this case whatsoever,” Browne said. “My client is in tears. He’s very remorseful. He feels tremendous guilt.”

Kelete reportedly told jail officials he suffers from “untreated addiction” and was withdrawing from Percocet, the Seattle Times reported.

“Several implements commonly used to smoke illegal substances” and a substance “that appears similar to crystal methamphetamine” were found in Kelete’s car by Washington State Patrol accident investigators, the Times reported.

When Kelete saw the protesters, he was driving at highway speeds, the Post reported. Kelete swerved and slid sideways before colliding with Taylor and Love, video shows. Security camera footage shows Kelete driving the wrong way up an exit ramp on I-35.

“The defendant stopped several hundred yards from the scene,” where “he was approached by witnesses who yelled at him to exit the vehicle. After the witness began hitting and pushing his vehicle, the defendant drove away at a high speed,” prosecutors said, according to the Post.

Kelete was blocked by another protester who cut him off in another vehicle until police arrived, the Post reported. (RELATED: $1.2 Million Bail Set For Driver Who Allegedly Plowed Through Two Seattle Protesters)

Since Kelete drove the wrong way up an exit ramp, he was asked to take a field sobriety test and passed, according to police, the Post reported.

“The driver was reserved and appeared sullen throughout his time in custody,” an arrest report written by State Trooper James McGuire said. “At one point he asked if the injured pedestrians were okay.”

Kelete is held on $1.2 million bail and his arraignment is scheduled for July 22, the Post reported. He lives with his religious parents in Seattle and is a U.S. citizen from Eritrea, Africa, according to the Post.

Honestly, I feel so bad for these players, parents and coaches. There’s literally no evidence to suggest we need to cancel the football season, but it’s happening all over the place anyways.

In fact, the evidence suggests that there’s literally nothing extra dangerous about playing football during the coronavirus pandemic.

It’s amazing how people who claim to be pro-science are blissfully ignorant when it comes to the data on football. More than 1,000 high school football games have been played in America, and not a single one has reportedly led to a coronavirus outbreak!

There is no science to suggest playing football is dangerous. The science and evidence proves coronavirus doesn’t spread through football. The cowards in the media and elitist university leaders are lying to you. They HATE everything football represents. https://t.co/W7ZblcQDF4 — David Hookstead (@dhookstead) September 9, 2020

A Sacramento Bee reporter said that the person who jumped on the police car was taken away in an ambulance after the incident.

A car reportedly hit two people who were standing in the street, according to KCRA3 News. One person was taken to the hospital and the other was taken care of by people in the crowd and was later seen standing up, according to the report. The car’s window was broken during the incident.

“We’ve had all kind of Trump supporters coming through, running us over, hitting us with their cars,” a protester told the Sacramento Bee. “… We surround the cars, we get near the cars asking them to leave. They won’t leave, and next thing you know, they’re starting to drive through the crowd,” the protester said.

"Andrew Yang Heckled, Accused Of Being ‘Pro-Cop’ During Bicycle Protest For Daunte Wright","New York City mayoral candidate and former presidential candidate Andrew Yang was heckled and accused of being “pro-cop” while riding his bike as part of a Tuesday night protest over the death of 20-year-old Daunte Wright.

Wright’s death in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, when he was shot during a traffic stop has sparked a new wave of protests and some riots around the country. The mayoral candidate was partaking in the demonstration with 150 other cyclists, riding from the Barclays Center into Lower Manhattan as part of the ongoing demonstrations over Wright’s death, the New York Post reported.

When Yang and the group arrived in Battery Park, several protesters began to heckle the former presidential candidate through a megaphone, according to the New York Post.

“We don’t want you here, and you are not welcome here,” a woman reportedly said through the megaphone, with another protester calling Yang “pro-cop.”

“Do not use our protest for your publicity,” another woman reportedly said, finishing her brief statement with, “Shame on you, Andrew Yang!” (RELATED: ‘You’re Not F**king Live’: Minnesota Protester Cusses Out CNN Reporter Live On Air)

“You need to improve police culture while also holding police accountable to bring their resolution rates for violent crime up,” Yang told Newsweek in the interview.

"‘Carpetbagger Katie!’: Protest Turns Violent At Democrat’s Town Hall, Several Get Into Scuffle","Tensions boiled over as protesters threw punches at Democratic California Rep. Katie Porter’s district town hall in Irvine, California, Sunday, leading the representative to intervene in the scuffle.

A group of protesters arrived at Porter’s town hall at the Mike Ward Community Park and interrupted her speech chanting “Carpetbagger Katie!” and “Corrupt Katie Porter!” the Los Angeles Times reported. Her supporters retaliated by chanting “Katie! Katie! Katie!” or screaming “Shut up!” at the demonstrators, followed by the supporters and protesters throwing punches at one another.

Porter rushed into the scuffle and wrapped her arms around an elderly woman, according to the outlet. (RELATED: Poll: Americans Across Racial Lines Solidly Against Violent Protest, Support Peaceful Protests)

Scuffle breaks out at Rep. Katie Porter’s town hall (via @LATSeema) https://t.co/l47Y5tMNmi — LA Times CA Politics (@LATpoliticsCA) July 12, 2021

The scuffle followed Republican candidate Nick Taurus, hoping to replace Porter, inviting his supporters Thursday via Instagram to attend the town hall in order to “confront” Porter, who he referred to as a “far-left ideologue.”

“Katie Porter is a far-left ideologue supported by Bay Area academics, the billionaire class and foreign lobbies!” Taurus’ Instagram post wrote. “Her America Last policies are awful for the 45th district and we intend to voice our displeasure. Please join the Taurus campaign this Sunday at 2:30PM to demand AMERICA BE PUT FIRST and send Carpetbagger Katie back to the Iowa farm she came from!”

The Irvine Police Department described a person’s arrest after causing a man’s nose to bleed in a statement, according to CNN. The suspect was released on a citation shortly after the arrest.

“Our officers were on scene for the event. There were opposing opinions at the town hall. It got heated and punches were thrown. One man received a bloody nose. The suspect was arrested, given a citation and released from the scene. The assault occurred at about 3:45 p.m.,” the statement said.

Sgt. Karie Davies said a handful of participants in the scuffle were reportedly charged with assault and battery charges, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Porter and her team are seeking strategies to ensure a “civil” and “safe” way to express disagreements at future town halls, she told CNN in a statement.

“While I absolutely respect their right to disagree, their disturbance disrespected all the families who attended and were ready to engage in a thoughtful, civil, and safe way,” Porter said. “My team and I are evaluating next steps, but my promise to Orange County families is that I will continue to hold town halls and to be in conversation with them.”

Porter has become a target amongst Republicans after defeating former Republican California Rep. Mimi Walters during the 2018 congressional midterm election, making her the first Democrat to represent her district, Business Insider reported. She won reelection by seven points while President Joe Biden claimed victory in the district by more than 11 points during the 2020 election.

The GOP reportedly plans to use her as a target during the 2022 midterm election, according to the Los Angeles Times. Torunn Sinclair, spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), called out Porter for her “socialist agenda.”

“Katie Porter and Democrats’ socialist agenda has caused everyday goods to cost more, created a border crisis and led to a rise in violent crime,” Sinclair said. “It will cost her reelection.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/07/12/carpetbagger-katie-violent-protest-democrats-town-hall-scuffle/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj2n7PwgLT9AhUcFFkFHRt6Bgc4WhAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw3brEjY-TDeLBPZBs1llzgS,2021-07-12
‘Get Us A Fair Contract’: Hundreds Of Alabama Coal Miners Protest Outside BlackRock Headquarters In New York City,"Hundreds of Alabama coal miners traveled by bus to New York City to demonstrate outside the headquarters of multinational investment management firm BlackRock, it was reported Wednesday.

The protest was organized by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), involving their union members from Alabama’s Warrior Met Coal who have been on strike against the company since April 1.

The protest reportedly drew over 1,000 people, including union members from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, as well as actress Susan Sarandon

“Do you hear that BlackRock? Get us a fair contract and we’ll go away. We’ll go back to work in those coal mines where we should be,” one of the speakers at the rally said. “We rode up here on buses to tell you your investments need to be put to use in these guy’s salaries, in these guy’s benefits, these guys that have earned you the profits that you’re making from these coal mines.”

The union members say they made concessions in pay, benefits, holidays, overtime and in other areas that totaled upwards of $1.1 billion after their previous employer Walter Energy filed for bankruptcy in 2016. Warrior Met Coal would end up purchasing the company’s assets. (RELATED: Concerned About BlackRock Pricing Out Home Buyers? Wait Until You Hear How Connected They Are To The Government)

“We’re in New York City because we are simply following the money, and demanding that those who created that wealth, the miners, get their fair share of it,” UNMA President Cecil E. Roberts said.

BlackRock has also drawn attention for buying up single-family houses all over the country, pricing middle-class buyers out of the housing market.

Colorado High School Students Stage Walkout To Protest School Mask Requirement,"High school students in Douglas County, Colorado, staged protests Wednesday calling for the end of a classroom mask mandate, ABC 7 Denver reported.

Students from ThunderRidge High School walked out of class around 9:30 a.m. in protest of the classroom mask requirement, ABC 7 reported.

Dozens Of ThunderRidge High School Students Walk Out Of Class For Mask Protest https://t.co/KIRRgnMqBc pic.twitter.com/sjVjwTyspu — CBSDenver (@CBSDenver) September 1, 2021

On Monday, the Tri-County Health Department board voted in favor of a mask requirement for all students and staff, ages 2 and up, regardless of vaccination status, ABC 7 reported. The new order does not allow individual counties to opt out of the mask requirement.

“We understand that some parents and students are frustrated and disagree with the mask requirement, but masks provide protection and prevent the spread of disease which allows students to remain in school where they learn best,” Tri-County Health Department told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Some students expressed their discontent with the mask requirement.

“I believe that masks, they’ve been going from mostly two years now, this is going to be the third year of my high school career that’s compromised,” student Austin Knapp told ABC 7. “I want a normal high school career there. If you are scared you could stay home.”

Cole Bradley, another Thunder Ridge student signaled to the students behind him and told ABC 7, “These people agree with me. They hate masks, and I do too.”

Parents and students from Ranch View Middle School joined the ThunderRidge High School students in the protest, ABC 7 reported. Students from Legend High School protested on the street with anti-mask signs around the same time.

“There’s enough parents, and there’s enough scientific data to show otherwise, that this is just not a necessary option that they have to take, and there are enough students that feel the same way,” parent Amy Ellis told ABC 7 Denver.

Mask mandates have been a salient issue throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in schools.

The Douglas County School District said it would continue to balance the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Tri-County Health Department public health order. (RELATED: Elizabeth Warren Photographed Maskless At Wedding Despite Indoor Mask Mandate)

“We will work with our families and staff members who cannot tolerate a mask due to medical or mental health reasons,” Douglas County Schools told ABC 7. “Our goal is to keep our students and staff in the classroom for in-person learning.”

The mask mandate went into effect Wednesday and is set to remain in place until the end of the year, ABC 7 reported.

Pro-Abortion Activists Protest Outside Brett Kavanaugh’s Home,"Pro-abortion protesters gathered Monday evening to demonstrate in front of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s home. Multiple police vehicles were stationed outside the house, a number of policemen stood around the lawn, and police patrolled the surrounding area.

The Daily Caller News Foundation did not see any signs that the Kavanaugh family was home, though multiple lights in the house were on.

Aside from the protest, the neighborhood was very quiet, and the DCNF observed one man walking by the Kavanaugh home who thanked the police for their presence.

CHEVY CHASE, MARYLAND — Pro-abortion protesters gathered Monday evening to protest in front of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s home.

Led by activists from ShutDownDC, protesters gathered at a Maryland park before marching about half a mile down the street to the Kavanaugh family home, located in Chevy Case, one of the wealthiest areas in the country.

Multiple police vehicles were stationed outside the house, a number of policemen stood around the lawn, and police patrolled the surrounding area. A local Maryland outlet had previously reported that a heavy police presence and traffic should be expected in the area.

The Daily Caller News Foundation did not see any signs that the Kavanaugh family was home, though multiple lights in the house were on. Aside from the protest, the neighborhood was very quiet, and the DCNF observed one man walking by the Kavanaugh home who thanked the police for their presence. (RELATED: Video Shows Anti-Kavanaugh Lawyer Saying Christine Blasey Ford Wanted ‘Asterisk’ By Justice’s Name)

From their front porch, neighborhood children watched the protesters call on Kavanaugh to resign and discuss their own personal abortion stories, fears that Roe v. Wade would be overturned, and more.

WATCH:

“There are no bad abortions because the right to pick and choose how to plan your family is a human right,” one activist shouted to the crowd to applause, adding, “Abortion is responsible!”

Earlier this month, the Supreme Court denied abortion providers’ requests to block Texas’ new law banning abortions after a baby’s heartbeat can be detected (about six weeks), and the court will soon consider a Mississippi law banning abortions after 15 weeks. (RELATED: Here’s A List Of Democrats Who Have Attacked Amy Coney Barrett For Her Faith)

The protesters voiced concerns that women would soon lose access to abortion and one activist emphasized that “it is possible to perform a safe, self managed abortion at home,” apparently referring to the use of abortion drugs.

Democratic candidate for Montgomery County council Kristin Mink told the small crowd that as part of her “family making journey,” she aborted one of her children early on in the pregnancy.

Shortly afterwards, she said, Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: ‘Disgusting Attacks On Her Faith’: Sasse Condemns ‘Anti-Catholic Bigotry’ Against Amy Coney Barrett)

“Like thousands of others, I took to the streets to protest this nomination,” she said. “And I thought there might be a chance that we might have just a small handful of Republican senators who might be brave enough to put party second. That obviously, as we saw, was not the case.”

“We knew that this was going to be the canary in the coal mine that would lead to the downfall of so many other rights,” Mink added of Kavanaugh’s confirmation. “We’ve seen so many things, not that just have already happened, but are on the dockets coming up.”

WATCH:

Progressive groups, media and activists responded with outrage and emotion when Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett replaced the late Ruth Bader Ginsberg and when Kavanaugh replaced former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.

In both cases, activists argued that Kavanaugh and Barrett would immediately seek to overturn Roe v. Wade. (RELATED: ‘He’s A Disgrace’: Conservatives Turn On Chief Justice Roberts)

The emotional backlash against Kavanaugh’s confirmation escalated following multiple allegations of sexual assault against the future Supreme Court justice. Accuser Christine Blasey Ford’s lawyer would later admit that putting an “asterisk” next to Kavanaugh’s name before “he takes a scalpel” to Roe v. Wade was “part of what motivated Christine” to accuse him.

BLM Holds Protest At NYC Restaurant That Asked For Vaccination Proof From Three Women Who Ended Up Arrested For Assault,"A group of Black Lives Matter (BLM) members held a protest at a New York City restaurant on Monday after three black women allegedly assaulted a hostess who asked for their proof of vaccination.

Kaeita Nkeenge Rankin, 44, Tyonnie Keshay Rankin, 21, and Sally Rechelle Lewis, 49, reportedly assaulted a 24-year old hostess at Carmine’s on Thursday after asking for their proof of vaccination, FOX News reported. The three customers were charged with assault and criminal mischief.

Justin More, who is representing the three women, said that the Carmine’s hostess used the “N-word” while asking for their proof of vaccination and assumed that their vaccine cards were fake, according to The New York Times.

The protestors on Monday were chanting “F— you, Carmine’s” and “Carmine’s are racist” outside the Upper West Side restaurant, according to Fox News. The demonstrators also claimed that the COVID-19 passports required at indoor restaurants disproportionately affect black people.

“This vaccination card mandate to create more Sandra Blands, and more Breonna Taylors, it ends here,” protest organizer Kimberly Bernard said. “Consider yourself served. Cancel Carmines’s!”

Founder of BLM‘s Greater New York Chapter, Hawk Newsome, believes that vaccines are a choice and should not limit everyday activities. (RELATED: Mayor Of San Francisco Goes To Nightclub Maskless, Breaks Her Own Mandate)g

“Listen, Vaccine is a choice, it’s a choice. You shouldn’t exclude people from everyday activities because they choose not to engage in something they have every reason to doubt,” Newsome said in a Tweet.

Carmine’s did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment, but told Fox News they deny any wrongdoing.

“Last week’s violence against our staff had nothing to do with race, despite a Texas criminal defense lawyer’s false assertions to the contrary,” Carmine’s said in a statement to Fox News.

Carmine’s explained that three of their hosts are people of color, who are required to enforce the city’s vaccination requirement for indoor dining.

“None of the attackers offered any reason for their attack. None of the hosts- all of whom are people of color- uttered a racial slur,” Carmine’s said. “None of the attackers mentioned anything about race to our managers, staff, or the police who arrested them, and the Texas criminal defense lawyer’s false assertion otherwise is a deeply cynical ploy to try to excuse wanton violence.”

New York City announced on Aug. 12 that people 12 and older are required to show proof that they’ve received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for indoor dining, fitness and entertainment.

EXCLUSIVE: Crowds Gather With Matt Walsh To Protest Virginia School’s ‘Indoctrination And Psychological Abuse Of Kids’,"A few hundred protestors gathered Tuesday evening outside of a Loudoun County Public Schools board meeting to push back against progressive Critical Race Theory and transgender policies.

Many of the protestors told the Daily Caller News Foundation that they were inspired to attend the rally by The Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh, who flew in from Tennessee to condemn the county’s increasingly progressive policies.

“I’m here as a concerned member of my own county and a proud Virginian,” Walsh told the DCNF. “And we are speaking out against the indoctrination and psychological abuse of kids that happens in Loudoun County schools and schools across the country.”

LOUDOUN COUNTY, VIRGINIA — A few hundred protestors gathered Tuesday evening outside of a Loudoun County Public Schools board meeting to push back against what they say are far-left Critical Race Theory and transgender policies.

Many of the protestors told the Daily Caller News Foundation that they were inspired to attend the rally by The Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh, who flew in from Tennessee to speak to the the school board of Loudoun County, a battleground for progressive education policies including LGBT issues, Critical Race Theory, and racial reparations.

The conservative commentator had amused fans and outraged critics by renting a home in Loudoun County after the school board tried to prevent him from speaking, saying that only county residents could participate in public comments.

Walsh’s fans lined up to greet, interview, or chat with him in the parking lot outside the district building where activists and family organizations had set up tents and a stage. The event was guarded by Loudoun County Public Schools Safety and Security, and security guards checked the bags and bodies of anyone who entered the building for the school board meeting with metal detectors. (RELATED: Is The Current School Board Culture War Really That Different From The Past, Or Are We Just Paying More Attention?)

“I’m here as a concerned member of my own county and a proud Virginian,” Walsh said. “And we are speaking out against the indoctrination and psychological abuse of kids that happens in Loudoun County schools and schools across the country.”

Walsh said that the rally is part of a “growing” and “encouraging trend” of parents who wish to take control of their children’s education.

“If I was able to drive a few more people to come out, then that’s great,” he said. “But when you look around and see all the signs, I think people are here because people are starting to wake up to the fact that the future of our country is not really determined on the national political level, which as conservatives, that’s what we’ve been almost singularly focused on for years. The future is determined right under our noses at school boards like this.”

Activist and teacher Lilit Vanetsyan, who urged parents to act during a viral June LCPS board meeting speech, lamented to the DCNF that it took a celebrity like Walsh coming to the event to draw such a large crowd. (RELATED: A Parent-Led Rebellion Against Critical Race Theory Is Storming School Boards Across The Country)

“I think each time we have a rally, a school board meeting of any kind, that the numbers keep growing,” Vanetsyan said. “I am happy to see everybody here. I am happy to see this number, this turnout here, but I do also believe that if it weren’t for a popular person coming here… we wouldn’t see this kind of turnout.”

Vanetsyan was formerly a teacher with Fairfax County Public Schools, but decided to leave her job over concerns that her “medical freedom was going to be taken advantage of.” She is now providing private instruction for families who have pulled their children out of school.

Angry parents and community members used the public comment section of the meeting to express discontent with policies enacted by the school board, including Policy 8040 that LCPS passed in August. Though a few parents and Loudoun County residents thanked the school board for the progressive policies, the vast majority of those speaking expressed outrage.

Under the policy, teachers must call students by their “chosen name and gender pronouns that reflect their gender identity without any substantiating evidence.” The policy also allows transgender students to participate in sports and use bathrooms that correspond to their chosen gender identity.

“You are all child abusers. You prey upon impressionable children and indoctrinate them into your insane ideological cult, which holds many fanatical views,” Walsh said during brief public comments at the board meeting. “By imposing this vile nonsense on students to the point of even of forcing young girls to share locker rooms with boys, you deprive these kids of safety and privacy.”

“You are poison,” he continued. “You are predators. I can see why you tried to stop us from speaking. You know your ideas are indefensible. You silence the opposing side because you have no argument.” (RELATED: How The Left Pushes LGBTQ Activism On Kids)

Conservatives are not the only ones outraged by Loudoun County’s progressive policies, Loudoun County resident Kelsey Bean told the school board during her public comments. (RELATED: Meet The Opponents Of Critical Race Theory The Media Does Not Want You To See)

“I have family who is part of the LGBTQ community, I have friends who are pretty left wing, my sister-in-law is pretty for a lot of liberal policies and none of them believe that any of this is the same thing,” Bean told the DCNF after she spoke at the school board meeting. “It’s often misaligned as being a left-wing ideal, but it’s not, it’s just an incredibly radical left-wing ideal, it’s not the general mainstream Democrat that believes this kind of thing.”

“I think that it is trying to be pushed as a generally Democratic ideal, because they think that if you are Democratic then you have to align with that sort of thing,” she added.

Curtis Hazen told the DCNF that it was his first time attending a school board rally. As a daily listener of the Matt Walsh Show, he said, he decided to show up when he heard Walsh was going to attend.

Hazen is a plumber who said he has to work extra jobs to put his kids through private Catholic school. He told the DCNF that shoulders the extra work to keep his kids “from being subjected to this nonsense that is going on here.”

“It’s not something I normally do, but I support the cause,” said Hazen, adding that he wants to be a voice for parents who can’t afford to send their kids elsewhere. “What they are pushing on our children is unacceptable and the fact that my tax dollars go to this really pisses me off.”

Another parent whose children attended and graduated from LCPS said that he, like Hazen, was attending the rally as a frustrated taxpayer. (RELATED: The New Left’s Institutionalized Racialism Is ‘Everywhere.’ In Medicine, Education, Even In Government Labs. Here’s How It Happened)

“It’s gone so much downhill,” he said. “All they are doing is playing games and it’s all politics. No interest in the kids.”

Loudoun County High School history teacher Monica Gill told the assembled crowd that she has been teaching for 26 years, describing how she loves her job and her students and the “unique physical, mental, or emotional struggles” they each face.

“The Loudoun County Public School Board is refusing to listen to its teachers and parents — the very people they were elected to serve — and instead is pushing its own political and cultural agenda on a captive audience of students,” Gill said in a speech.

“There is an earnest debate right now about how to best care for children who struggle with gender dysphoria,” she continued. “The Loudoun County School Board has chosen one side of this debate. They have mandated it — forcing all teachers to be complicit.”

Gill insisted that the school board’s decision is wrong.

“It is not the job of the government to mandate care or mandate individual speech,” she said. “In reality, they are not protecting students — they are pushing a radical gender ideology and allowing our kids to be victims of their social experiment.”

‘Hero To Zero’: Beverly Hills Firefighters Protest Vaccine Mandates Amid Rejections Of Religious Exemptions,"Firefighters in Beverly Hills, California, rallied at city hall Tuesday to protest Los Angeles County’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for county workers.

A firefighter for the Beverly Hills Fire Department of 11 years, Josh Sattley was recently put on unpaid leave for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. Los Angeles County set Oct. 1 as the deadline for all county employees to be vaccinated.

“These guys have families to support, bills to pay,” says Joshua Zavala, a Los Angeles firefighter who is also against the vaccine mandates. “It’s unconstitutional.”

Sattley told the Daily Caller that he doesn’t know how long he will be on unpaid leave for, but expects to be terminated later this month.

“We were all interrogated about our religious beliefs,” said Sattley.

The five firefighters that submitted their religious exemptions and were denied did end up getting their COVID-19 vaccine before the Oct 1 deadline. According to the city, one firefighter was granted a medical exemption and 18 other firefighters had their religious or medical exemptions granted temporarily for 30 days while being reviewed further.

Some Men Are Getting Vasectomies To Protest The Texas Abortion Law,"A Texas doctor said his practice has seen a nearly 15% increase in vasectomies as men try to push back against the state’s abortion law, The Washington Post (WaP0) reported Sunday.

Koushik Shaw, a doctor who practices at the Austin Urology Institute, told WaPo his practice saw a roughly 15% increase in scheduled vasectomies following the state’s Sept. 1 abortion ban.

Shaw told the outlet patients are coming in, saying “‘Hey, I’m actually here because some of these changes that [Gov. Greg] Abbott and our legislature have passed that are really impacting our decision-making in terms of family planning,’ so that was a new one for me as a reason – the first time, patients are citing a state law as their motivating factor.”

The law effectively bans most abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which occurs around six weeks after conception. (RELATED: FDA To Allow Providers To Send Abortion Pills By Mail)

Texas clinics aren’t the only places seeing men choose vasectomies, with Florida urologist Doug Stein marketing the procedure as “an act of Love” for their partners and “the ultimate way to be a good man,” according to the WaPo.

Boston family medicine doctor Sarah Miller referred to the “trend” as “remarkable … in the family planning community of recognizing and promoting vasectomy and birth control for men,” according to the report.

“It warms my heart to hear men say, ‘I am so nervous, but I know this is NOTHING compared to what my wife has gone through,'” Stein told the WaPo.

Stein and family medicine doctor Esgar Guarín even launched a “Responsible Men’s Clubs” chat for men who have had the procedure can share information about their sexual performance and explain how it “doesn’t take away their manhood, but in fact makes them a better man,” Guarín reportedly said.

Vasectomies are more than 99.9% effective in preventing pregnancies and can be reversed in most cases, according to the Cleveland Clinic. More than 500,000 vasectomies are performed each year in the U.S., according to the UNC School of Medicine.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/12/27/vasectomies-abortion-law-texas/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwigrfXrgLT9AhVCFlkFHTTaDjc4FBAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw0vThjK8rHmmk9XNBAdomcA,2021-12-27
"Psaki Goes Off On Anti-Vaccine Mandate Protest In DC, Claims It Was ‘Dangerous’","White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that anti-vaccine mandate protests in Washington, D.C., were “dangerous” and stood “in the way against a coordinated effort to save more American lives.”

Over 30,000 people took to the streets of the nation’s capital Sunday for the “Defeat the Mandates: An American Homecoming” march to protest “draconian COVID-19 requirements.” Protesters called for an end to vaccine mandates.

A reporter asked Psaki on Monday how the administration planned to respond to the protests.

WATCH:

“Just yesterday in D.C., not far from here actually, there was an anti-mask, anti-lockdown rally where some of the rhetoric around that was talking about Nuremberg style trials to holding Anthony Fauci to account, to going after the media for spreading lies, things like that,” the reporter said. “I was wondering how the administration is going to respond to what appears to be a growing intensity and potential violence in the anti-vax movement?” (RELATED: Walensky Says Americans Need To Be Boosted To Be Considered Vaccinated)

“We are well aware that there is a loud and vocal minority empowered through social media and media platforms that proliferate misinformation, politicians who espouse conspiracy theories and fundraise off opposition to public health, we know that,” Psaki replied. “We also know that 87% of American adults have at least one shot, that’s the vast, vast majority and over 210 million Americans are fully vaccinated. So our view is that it’s wrong, it’s dangerous and it stands in the way against a coordinated effort to save more American lives.”

Psaki was then asked whether the administration feels like it is “losing the war when it comes to the messaging on the importance of these types of public health measures, like getting vaccinated.”

“Again, our view is that it is a loud and vocal minority but still dangerous, still problematic. The fact that 87% of American adults, all of those people of course did not mathematically vote for Joe Biden, had at least one shot, means we’ve far surpassed where I think most people think we should be. It’s difficult and challenging of course to get more people vaccinated, we know that. And of course, efforts that are dangerous and wrong by groups like this are problematic as is the spread of misinformation on social media platforms,” Psaki said.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/01/24/jen-psaki-anti-vaccine-mandate-protests-dangerous/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjBspLtgLT9AhU1ElkFHepbC084KBAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw3oMXXvtfx2ThRTVH79NEEu,2022-01-24
American Truckers Plan ‘Convoy To DC’ To Protest Vaccine Mandates,"Thousands of American Truckers plan to take part in a nation-wide convoy to protest COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

U.S. truckers are planning the convoy after 50,000 Canadian truckers made their way to Ottawa in protest of their own country’s mandate. The U.S. truckers will drive from California to Washington D.C. (RELATED: Who’s The ‘Fringe Minority’? Elon Musk Ridicules Trudeau For Downplaying Trucker Protests)

According to the Facebook group “Convoy to DC 2022,” created to organize the protest, the truckers describe themselves as “part of many large groups who believe in our founding fathers.” The group has more than 95,000 members as of Monday.

“We believe everyone has a voice. We support our freedom. Help us spread the word about this group and together we all can make it a better place.. God Bless America,” the Facebook group says.

If American truckers do not get vaccinated against COVID-19, they will not be allowed to cross the Canadian and Mexican land borders, KARK reported.

Canadian truckers made their way to Ottawa earlier in January, and are currently in the capital city protesting the mandate. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has left Ottawa and reportedly moved to an undisclosed location since the protesters’ arrival due to “safety concerns.”

Although a date has not been set for the “Convoy to DC” yet, the Facebook group said the protest will begin soon.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/01/31/american-truckers-canada-convoy-dc-protest-vaccine-mandate/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjY2-PtgLT9AhWkFFkFHQOxADo4MhAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw0jM_Yxru_E0EuPlBsT7DRL,2022-01-31
Man Who Rammed Trucker Protest Pictured Wearing Mask By Himself In Car,"A Canadian man has been charged after allegedly driving his SUV alone while wearing a mask through a “Freedom Convoy” protest group Friday in Winnipeg.

The 42-year-old man from Headingly, Manitoba, allegedly struck four men with his Jeep Patriot as they gathered to protest COVID-19 restrictions and vaccine mandates in downtown Winnipeg near the Legislative grounds, the Winnipeg police said in a statement. One victim was taken to the hospital and later released, and the other three did not require medical attention for their minor injuries, according to the statement.

In images posted to Twitter, the man in the SUV can be seen wearing what appears to be a blue face mask despite being alone in his car during the incident. (RELATED: ‘Protesting To Mandate Freedom’: Truck Drivers Continue To Rally Against COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates)

The police said the suspect, who fled the scene, was apprehended a short while later after reportedly briefly resisting arrest, according to the Daily Mail. He has been charged with four counts of assault with a weapon, two counts of dangerous operation of a conveyance causing bodily harm, two counts of failure to stop at the scene of an accident, two counts of failure to stop after accident and one count of dangerous operation of a conveyance, according to the press release from Winnipeg police.

GoFundMe announced Friday that it had taken down a “Freedom Convoy 2022” fundraiser started by organizers of the Canadian protests, citing “police reports of violence and unlawful activity” as justification.

Video Appears To Show Canadian Police Visiting Home Of Woman Who Supported The Truckers On Facebook,"A video circulating on social media appears to show a member of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) showing up at a woman’s home who expressed support for the trucker convoy on Facebook and handing out a pamphlet on what counts as a peaceful protest.

The video, posted to Facebook Thursday by Nadine Ellis-Maffei, appears to show an OPP officer visiting Ellis-Maffei’s home in Peterborough after she allegedly interacted with content on Facebook in support of the truckers protesting vaccine mandates. Ellis Maffei wrote on Facebook that she was making dinner when she heard a knock at the door.

“Sorry since you’re at my home, can I just get your name and your badge number?” Ellis-Maffei is heard asking.

The officer identifies herself before handing the woman a pamphlet which she says “is just some information about peaceful protests, that’s all it is.”

“Okay, so you saw something on my Facebook?” Ellis-Maffei asked. Ellis-Maffei posted on Facebook that she interacted with a “group that supported the freedom movement to end mandates and in support of the freedom convoy.”

“No, on the Facebook group,” the officer responded.

“Okay and [you] decided to come to my personal residence to give me information about peaceful protests?” Ellis-Maffei questioned.

“Yes,” the smiling officer responded.

“Are you guys now monitoring people’s Facebook pages or Facebook groups as to who comments to what their status updates are or what they’re doing or what-”

“Just because of the protest happening province-wide, yes we have been monitoring the protests, so there’s a protest coming up, I’m simply providing you with information about a peaceful protest and now I am leaving, that is all,” the officer said.

“So the OPP are watching what people are doing on Facebook in different groups, whether or not they’re commenting, participating, liking and you guys are now doing service calls to give people information about peaceful protests?”

“It’s just a proactive measure to make sure you understand your right to go about peaceful protesting,” the officer said.

“Absolutely, I have a copy of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms so I’m well within that and very understanding of that,” Ellis-Maffei said. “I’m hoping that you guys aren’t going to waste our tax dollars continuing to do this to everybody, but now it’s nice to know we’re being watched.”

The officer then left. (RELATED: ‘Canada Has Absolutely ZERO Jurisdiction’: GiveSendGo Slams Judge Trying To Freeze Funds For Truckers)

The Daily Caller has reached out multiple times to the OPP but has not received a response at the time of publication.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced a state of emergency Friday, warning truckers who are protesting vaccine mandates they would be severely fined and jailed should they fail to comply with orders.

“To whose who have attempted to disrupt our way of life by targeting our lifelines for food, fuel and goods across our borders, to those trying to force a political agenda through disruption, intimidation and chaos, my message to you is this: your right to make a political statement does not outweigh the right of hundreds of thousands of workers to earn their living,” Ford said, according to BBC.

Minnesota Middle School Advised Students On How To Protest,"A Minneapolis public middle school sent a newsletter to students Feb. 15 with advice on how to protest the death of Amir Locke, according to a copy of the letter obtained by a concerned parent organization.

Justice Page Middle School sent middle school students the “Rhino Report,” which told 12-to-13-year-old kids that they should remain silent at Black Lives Matter protests, “ESPECIALLY if you’re White.” Students were also encouraged to wear “nondescript clothing” and to bring a first aid kit “incase [sic] you get hurt,” the letter obtained by Parents Defending Education reads.

“When it comes to Black Lives Matter protests, if you’re not Black, remember that you’re there to show your support and amplify Black voices. ESPECIALLY if you’re White, if they’re offering the megaphone for anyone to speak, it’s not for you,” the Rhino Report read.

Students were also told not to post videos with people’s faces “especially if it’s someone doing art/graffiti,” and to write in sharpie the name of their parents or “local legal aid organizations” on their arm and glaze it in hairspray “so it lasts longer.”

“Wear long sleeves, mask, glasses [to] protect against COVID-19 and Tear gas,” one bullet point read. (RELATED: Public School Must End Racial ‘Affinity Groups’ Following Lawsuit)

The newsletter was released 12 days after Amir Locke was fatally shot by a member of the Minneapolis Police Department during a no-knock search warrant in a homicide investigation.

The “Rhino Report” is a publication of Minneapolis Public Schools, not the middle school, according to the report. The newsletter is edited by Travis “TJ” Koupal, an eighth-grade Earth Science teacher at Justice Page.

Erika Sanzi, the Director of Outreach at Parents Defending Education, called the newsletter “inappropriate” for the age group it was distributed to and alleged that it was “done behind the backs of parents.”

“It is inappropriate for a school system to be providing protesting advice to 12-year-olds, especially when it is for particular causes and varies based on students’ race. It is also a problem that it was done behind the backs of parents,” Sanzi said.

Minneapolis Public Schools spokeswoman Crystina Lugo-Beach did not answer the Daily Caller’s question as to whether the district approves of the message presented to teenage students.

“At Minneapolis Public Schools, we value and encourage student voice,” Lugo-Beach said. “The Rhino Report newsletter is a student publication that was written by students in an after school community education program. The publication represents the viewpoints of students, very similar to an editorial written for a newspaper.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/02/23/justice-page-middle-school-protest/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwigrfXrgLT9AhVCFlkFHTTaDjc4FBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw1csvfTUssEbXLOi87JezNS,2022-02-23
WH Press Corps Erupts In Protest After AP Again Lets Psaki Off The Hook Early,"The White House press conference erupted in protest Monday after Associated Press (AP) reporter Josh Boak ended the briefing early.

Boak called for the end of the briefing after only 39 minutes, leading New York Post reporter Steve Nelson to stand up and tell Boak that reporters in the back rows had unanswered questions. Steve Portnoy, the president of the White House Correspondents’ Association (WHCA), has said it is tradition for the oldest wire service, the AP, to determine the end of the briefings whether or not other reporters have questions.

Tensions boiled over when Lynn Sweet, the Washington-Bureau Chief at the Chicago Sun-Times, called for an end to the tradition of the oldest wire service determining the end of the briefing so that all attendees “feel they have a shot” to speak, according to tapes obtained by the Daily Caller.

“Baby steps, can we maybe think about ending the tradition of having one of our own end the briefing and let the White House end the briefing?” Sweet suggested. Another reporter chimed in that it “is not right” for one reporter to end the event.

Portnoy replied “that is a decision for the White House press secretary to make,” tapes revealed. He told the reporters he would consider the issue at stake, leading a handful of reporters to cheer.

One reporter argued that the tradition has caused a roadblock in getting her name out to the public and being able to represent Christian and African American media, according to the tapes.

“I’ve been here on my third president and people don’t even know my name,” one reporter said. “That’s significant to me and women’s history month. As an African American woman, it’s significant to me as a person who represents Christian media, African American media, all kinds of media and I never get an opportunity to bring some of these key issues that are unique to my audiences to the table.”

Real Clear News White House correspondent Phillip Melanchthon Wegmann criticized the old tradition, which had been seemingly revived by White House press secretary Jen Psaki in the early months of President Joe Biden’s administration.

“An open question: What is the utility of empowering a wire service to call an end to a White House briefing? Is it for the benefit of @PressSec? Or for a few reporters in the front row? Or the entire press corps? I do hope some serious thought, that is to say, not just nostalgia, went into whether it was wise to revive this tradition,” Wegmann said.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/03/07/wh-press-corps-protest-psaki-early/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiC5d_vgLT9AhXaFlkFHfmtBV44UBAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw27DTpAoA6NinttalSpIoGx,2022-03-07
‘For You People In Florida’: Oscars Hosts Chant ‘Gay’ In Protest Of Florida Parental Rights Bill,"Oscars hosts Amy Schumer, Regina Hall and Wanda Sykes repeatedly chanted “gay” onstage Sunday in reference to the Florida parental rights bill.

“We’re gonna have a great night tonight — and for you people in Florida, we’re going to have a gay night,” Sykes said. “Gay, gay, gay.” The audience cheered as the three hosts repeatedly sang the word.

Florida’s H.B. 1557, titled Parental Rights in Education, prohibits classroom discussion about sexual orientation and gender identity to children attending kindergarten through third grade. The bill also requires parental consent for select healthcare treatments and bars school districts from keeping secrets from parents regarding changes to the students’ physical and mental health.

Critics and establishment media have labeled the legislation the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, though the term “gay” is not mentioned in the bill and allows for discussion of issues pertaining to sexual orientation and gender beginning in the fourth grade.

In early March, Florida Democrats marched in the Florida state house chanting the word “gay” to protest the bill. Attendees cheered and held signs in support of gay and trans rights. Disney CEO Bob Chapek announced that he called Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to express his disappointment in the bill, to which the governor agreed to meet with him and LGBTQ members of the company to discuss ways to address their concerns.

The governor criticized Disney on March 10 for their opposition to the legislation by arguing that a company marketing toward young children should understand parents’ concerns of LGBT content being taught in classrooms. DeSantis has previously pushed back against reporters for establishing “fraudulent” narratives by referring to the legislation as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill.

The legislation currently awaits passage by DeSantis after passing the Florida House on Feb. 24 and the Senate on March 8 with a 22-17 vote.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/03/27/oscars-hosts-chant-gay-protest-florida-parental-rights-bill/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjz2JDrgLT9AhXhM1kFHQNKAt44ChAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw1ZUwTxQ4RNrdfodDj-OlZc,2022-03-27
‘They Crossed A Line In The Sand’: Demonstrators Protest Disney’s ‘Woke’ Agenda At California Headquarters,"Following Disney’s criticisms and opposition to Florida’s Parental Rights In Education bill, people in California marched to Disney’s headquarters in Burbank to protest.

Protesters gathered in front of Disney’s Burbank, California, headquarters Wednesday evening to speak out against the company’s stance on gender ideology. Protesters sang songs outside the gates, waved American flags, and chanted “Hold the Line” and “Boycott Disney.”

Sean Feucht, founder of Hold the Line and the rally’s organizer, spoke to Fox News ahead of the protest, saying the aim was to call attention to the corporation’s “woke” agenda. Feucht told co-host Ainsley Earhardt that Disney had “crossed a line in the sand when they began to enable those who want to fight to sexualize our kids.”

“They’re going to feel this in their earnings reports, and they’re also they’re going to feel this as people cancel their subscription, as they raise their voice,” Feucht said. “This is the year of the parents in America, 2022 is the year of the parents, and this is another opportunity for us to rise up and to hold the line.”

The protesters glued their hands to the frame of the painting at the Courtauld Gallery in London as they wanted to fight against the art world’s complicity with climate change, Forbes reported. Video footage of the protest was filmed by gallery visitors and shared widely online on Friday, showing the pair wearing custom orange t-shirts.

The pair are Louis McKenchie, 21, and Emily Brocklebank, 24, according to Forbes. The painting they attached themselves to was “Peach Trees in Blossom” from 1889, which van Gogh painted shortly after he cut his own ear off, Fox News reported.

“Sorry everybody, we don’t want to be doing this,” the McKenchie said to other gallery attendees, “we’re here glued to this painting, this beautiful painting, because we’re terrified for our future. We’re here from a group called ‘Just Stop Oil.’ We expect to be arrested today.” The pair said they were protesting the UK government’s work pushing through more than 40 new fossil fuel projects, which they claimed was “like signing our death warrants.”

“My generation has no other choice but to take this kind of action,” he continued. “For 30 years we’ve been outside Parliament with our banners and our flags and for 30 years nothing has gotten done. If there were any other way of getting the change we need, we would’ve done it. We’ve tried everything else.” (RELATED: Hollywood Actor Glued His Hand To Starbucks Counter In Bizarre Protest)

Other members of Just Stop Oil were arrested in an art gallery in Scotland on Wednesday after spray painting the walls and gluing themselves to another painting, Forbes noted. Police reportedly responded to the incident. It is unclear whether the paintings were damaged after either incident, according to Forbes.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/07/01/just-stop-oil-protest-van-gogh/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwigrfXrgLT9AhVCFlkFHTTaDjc4FBAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw04GvuuSx-R6xzfMzDb7O-Z,2022-07-01
Climate Change Protesters Disrupt Tour De France,"A group of climate change activists disrupted Stage 10 of the Tour de France on Tuesday, halting the riders with flares on mile 71 of the 92-mile-long race.

Protesters wearing t-shirts with the message “989 days left” occupied the roadway and lit pink flares, effectively stopping the race for 12 minutes. Dernière Rénovation, a French climate change activist group, took credit for the protest.

The group promotes a “campaign of civil resistance that aims to achieve a political victory over energy renovation, through non-violent disruption actions repeated over time.” (RELATED: Protests Rage As Chinese Banks Won’t Let People Withdraw Their Funds)

Alice, one of the group’s activists who participated in the protest, pinned politicians as the main threat to the planet’s future.

“The reality is that the world which the politicians are sending us towards is a world in which the Tour de France will no longer be able to exist,” Alice wrote, according to the cycling website road.cc. “We must act and enter into civil resistance today to save what remains to be saved.”

French authorities had to haul the protesters out of the roadway before placing them in custody, the Washington Examiner reported. Photos and videos show the protesters appeared to have chained themselves together by the neck, apparently refusing to move until they had to be forcibly dragged by tour officials.

Sir Bradley Wiggins, who rode a motorcycle in the race, spoke to the television channel Eurosport about the incident. “It really was going off. It was quite crazy. A lot of people getting quite angry, some of the directeur sportifs got out the cars, stuck a boot in,” he said, according to The Irish Times.

This is not the first time the Tour has been a target of protests. The climate protests took place after race organizers pledged a commitment to reduce their carbon footprint, citing cycling as a “source of well-being” which “helps to improve air quality and reduce environmental risks.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/07/13/climate-change-protesters-disrupt-tour-de-france-derniere-renovation/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjuio3vgLT9AhXgKlkFHaPZD-s4RhAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw3yOkUZmx2U0lKJANwyFuVM,2022-07-13
"Ocasio-Cortez, Members Of ‘The Squad’ Arrested In Front Of Supreme Court","Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other members of the far-left group “the squad” were arrested outside the Supreme Court Tuesday afternoon during a protest.

In several videos posted on Twitter, Ocasio-Cortez can be seen with her hands behind her back being held by police officers who appear to be escorting her away from a protest in front of the Supreme Court.

"After Parents Protest, School Board Backs Off Proposal To Open Up Planned Parenthood Clinic","A California school board considering opening a Planned Parenthood clinic in a high school postponed the vote after parents protested, according to a Monday statement by the school district.

The Planned Parenthood clinic would provide access to and insertion of contraceptives, prescriptions for reproductive health and physical examinations, according to the Planned Parenthood proposal. The school board for Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District in Los Angeles, California, was set to vote on the implementation of the clinic in John Glenn High School at a Monday meeting, but postponed the vote amid protests, according to a July 18 statement from the school district. (RELATED: White House Dismisses Sen. Warren’s Idea Of Putting Abortion Clinics In National Parks)

A group of protesters against the proposal gathered outside John Glenn High School on Monday as the school board made the decision to postpone their vote, Fox News reported.

The Planned Parenthood clinic would be in the school for five years before needing to be approved by the school board again, according to the proposal. It is unclear whether abortions will be provided at the school, but the clinic will refer students to “other health care services” if needed.

Students who come to the clinic will be encouraged to “involve their families in decision making regarding the services,” according to the proposal. Under California law, “minors have the right to consent to reproductive health services without parental consent or notification.”

The clinic in Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District is a part of Planned Parenthood’s 2019 initiative to spend $10 million establishing 50 clinics in local high schools, according to The Washington Post.

The clinics in the initiative will have services including “a range of sexual health services one day a week, including testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), emergency contraception and birth control counseling and provision, well-person exams, pregnancy testing, and pregnancy options counseling,” according to a 2019 Planned Parenthood press release.

The school board, Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District, and Planned Parenthood Los Angeles did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

‘Kills The American Dream’: Truckers Disrupt Port Of Oakland To Protest Newsom’s Labor Law,"Protests have disrupted shipping operations and supply chains at the Port of Oakland this week as truckers express their opposition to a new labor law that they say threatens their business model and way of life, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Assembly Bill 5 reclassified California’s 70,000 independent owner-operators as employees of the shipping companies they work with to arrange hauls, rather than independent contractors, the WSJ reported. The law was designed to protect gig workers like Uber drivers, but many truckers see it as restricting their independence, and in response, have been blocking access to Oakland’s port since Monday in an effort to get Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom to delay implementation of the law and compromise with them, The New York Times reported.

“This kills the liberty of being a trucker and kills the American Dream,” one Los Angeles-based trucker previously told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Today, I had the opportunity to be at the Port of Oakland with truck drivers whose lives and businesses are being impacted by #AB5. This law has created a legal nightmare. I opposed AB 5 in the Legislature & I stand with our truckers and small businesses. #Dahle4Governor #CA pic.twitter.com/8aoHIIcjNk — Senator Brian Dahle (@BrianDahleCA) July 20, 2022

The protests have seriously derailed port operations, delaying not just shipments scheduled to go through the Port of Oakland but also clogging up other congested ports elsewhere in California as containers are diverted from the Bay Area, the WSJ reported.

“If this carries on, I don’t know what we are going to do. We will literally be sitting on the last of our 2021 crop and not being able to ship it,” Nina Solari, vice president at a family-owned walnut processor, told the WSJ. (RELATED: San Francisco Schools Report Worsening Absences And High School Preparation Rates)

Supply chain issues have plagued the entire country throughout the pandemic, but California has been a particularly bad bottleneck. Increased stress on an already shaky system has attracted attention from federal policymakers, CalMatters reported.

AB 5 was signed by Newsom in 2019 and had been working its way through the legal system ever since, but the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case on June 30, paving the way for the law to go into effect earlier this month, CalMatters added.

“Although it has been the subject of litigation, AB 5 was enacted in 2019, so no one should be caught by surprise by the law’s requirements at this time,” a spokesman for the governor’s office told the WSJ.

Over half of California’s truckers are contractors that work with shipping companies but maintain their independence. AB 5 makes this arrangement no longer legally tenable, and would force owner-operators to either become employees beholden to company regulations, or pay up to $20,000 out-of-pocket for permits and insurance to handle their own logistics and remain independent.

“They’ve exempted all kinds of people from AB 5, but not truckers. We have a supply chain issue, we should let them go to work like everyone else. These are small business owners. Gavin Newsom is trying to force everybody to be employees and in unions even when they don’t want to,” Republican California State Sen. Brian Dahle, who is running for governor, told the DCNF.

Neither Newsom nor Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf responded to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Protests Erupt Across Iran Over Death Of Woman Detained By Morality Police,"Angry Iranians took to the streets Tuesday to protest against the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested and held by police days earlier.

Trash bins set on fire and rocks scattered across downtown intersections were just some of the sights witnessed by reporters in the nation’s capital during Monday’s protests. Tuesday’s protests were a continuation of unrest from the day before, as students from universities around Tehran gathered and called for investigations into Amini’s death, according to the Associated Press.

A Kurdish human rights group stated three deaths had occurred from Monday’s demonstrations though no official confirmation has been made, Reuters reported. (RELATED: ‘They Are Running After Us, But Cannot Catch Us’: More And More Iranian Women Are Openly Defying Headscarf Rules)

Growing unrest was sparked by the death of Amini, a young Kurdish woman who fell into a coma and died while detained by the nation’s so-called morality police, according to Reuters. Iran’s morality police are responsible for the strict enforcement of proper head coverings and loose-fitting clothing for women in the Islamic Republic. Mahsa Amini’s family maintains that she had no prior health issues and sustained bruises to her legs. Her father blames the police for her death, according to the outlet.

Mahsa Amini should be alive today. Instead, the United States and the Iranian people mourn her. We call on the Iranian government to end its systemic persecution of women and to allow peaceful protest. #مهسا_امینی — Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken) September 20, 2022

Amini’s death not only sparked turmoil within the country, but also earned condemnation from the global community. “Mahsa Amini should be alive today,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted. Blinken also called on Iran’s government “to end its systemic persecution of women and to allow peaceful protest.”

EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell called her death “unacceptable” and demanded accountability, according to Euro News. “Women who defy these compulsory veiling rules should not be harassed, should not be subjected to violence and there needs to be a fair investigation,” UN spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said.

Iran’s president has called on his Interior Minister to “investigate the cause of the incident with urgency and special attention,” CBS News reported.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/09/20/protests-erupt-iran-death-woman-detained-morality-police-mahsa-amini/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiGnIbxgLT9AhVxEVkFHeEECX04ZBAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw0OUegPEkt4bjX59K7y3nsu,2022-09-20
‘There Will Be Waves Of Lawsuits’: Activist Group To Protest Yale’s New Booster Mandate,"TeamRealityCT organized a protest on Friday at Yale University against its COVID-19 bivalent booster mandate.

Students are required to receive a bivalent booster before the spring semester, however the policy does not apply to faculty.

Dr. Naomi Wolf, who will keynote the rally, told the Daily Caller News Foundation “that colleges have a moral standing ‘In Loco Parentis’ and a legal obligation not to create a dangerous context for study.”

An activist group dedicated to ending college COVID-19 vaccine mandates will tackle Yale University’s bivalent booster mandate at a medical choice rally on Friday.

The rally, organized by TeamRealityCT, will be held at the Connecticut university from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. to demand the university reverse its policy which requires students — but not faculty — to be vaccinated with a bivalent booster shot, which defends against the original and omicron variant, for the spring 2022 semester. The rally will be a peaceful demonstration to “learn about proper informed consent,” “support medical choice” and learn about student rights, according to the Eventbrite.

Dr. Naomi Wolf, a Yale alumna, will keynote the event. She told the Daily Caller News Foundation that she will be “highlighting information” about the vaccine, which she said can cause “severe menstrual and reproductive damage to young women and cardiac damage to young men.”

“As a Yale alumna, I’ll be noting that the Yale motto, Lux et Veritas, ‘Light and Truth,’ as well as a liberal arts education in general, stands counter to these policies of coercion, suspension of informed consent, and censorship,” she said. “I’ll point out that colleges have a moral standing ‘In Loco Parentis’ and a legal obligation not to create a dangerous context for study.”

Yale University updated its COVID-19 vaccination policy in October. Students must receive a bivalent booster by Jan. 31, 2023, to remain enrolled. (RELATED: Four Colleges Mandate Booster Shot For Faculty, Student Body)

The policy confirms that all students without an approved exception are required to comply “regardless of how many previous monovalent boosters they received,” according to the university website. Students who fail to upload record of their vaccination could be referred to the Compact Review Committee and disciplined with “administrative action.”

Faculty, on the other hand, are only required to receive a primary series vaccination and a booster when eligible.

“There will be waves of lawsuits as well as criminal filings for universities physically harming a generation of young people and Yale will be at the forefront unless the institution immediately suspends its illegal mandate,” Wolf told the DCNF.

The rally’s Eventbrite claims that students were “coerced” into receiving a COVID-19 vaccine despite “healthy 18-24 year olds” not being at risk for serious COVID-19 complications.

In October, State Surgeon General Joseph A. Ladapo of Florida issued a guidance warning about increased cardiac-related death in young men. The analysis found an 84% increase in such occurrences in 18-39 year-old men within 28 days of receiving an mRNA vaccine.

Still, most states continue to recommend adults of all ages be vaccinated and boosted.

In addition to Friday’s rally, TeamRealityCT launched a fundraiser to challenge the mandate in court. The legal fund has currently raised over $4,600, and the group first plans to send a demand letter to the administration requesting the policy be put on ice.

“Yale and other elite universities set the tone for higher education policies across the nation. If Yale is pressured to drop its mandates, other schools may follow,” the fund description reads. “This is a high profile case and it’s why we ask you to participate even if you do not have a Yale affiliation.”

Yale University implemented strict guidelines students had to follow during the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2022, students were required to quarantine in their dorms after returning from the winter break until they obtained a negative test, Yale Daily News reported. The university also implemented a campus-wide quarantine which barred students from leaving the premises including to visit local businesses or restaurants.

However, Yale University is not the only university requiring students to obtain a bivalent booster shot.

Fordham University required students obtain a bivalent booster shot by Nov. 1. Harvard University, Tufts University and Wellesley College also mandate a bivalent shot.

Yale University and TeamRealityCT did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

"Mongolians Protest At State Palace After Government Officials Allegedly Steal Billions In Coal, Sell It To China","Mongolian protesters reportedly attempted to storm their capitol building Tuesday, demanding the resignation of government officials they say are involved in the alleged theft of billions of dollars in coal.

The protesters reportedly tried to break into the State Palace in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, ostensibly upset about the 385,000 tons of coal allegedly stolen from Mongolia’s border with China. The protesters, mostly college students and some in their 20s and 30s, sang, chanted and picketed outside the building, the Associated Press (AP) reported.

“If you don’t love your country, why be a citizen?” one protester’s sign read, according to the outlet. “If the citizens rise up, the feast is over!” another protester reportedly wrote.

A Foreign Ministry spokesperson in Bejing said she had no knowledge of the “specific situation,” according to the New York Post.

“China is a friendly neighbor of Mongolia, and we believe the Mongolian government will properly handle and investigate the matter. The competent Chinese authority will provide necessary assistance as requested by the Mongolian side in accordance with laws and regulations,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said, according to the outlet.

The reported protests erupted after a whistleblower alleged several legislators connected to the coal industry embezzled billions of dollars worth of the product, according to the NY Post. Most resources that come out of the land-locked country, such as coal, cashmere and livestock, are bound for China when exported, the outlet reported.

Male Afghan Students Boycott Classes To Protest Ban On Women’s Education,"Male students in Afghanistan vowed they will not return to class until women are allowed to return to university classrooms, Tolo News, an Afghan outlet, reported on Sunday.

The Taliban announced on Dec. 20 that women would no longer be allowed to attend university classes effective immediately, which furthered a previous order from March 2022 which prohibited women from receiving secondary education. Male students reportedly claimed that they would not return to the classroom until women were allowed to resume their studies. (RELATED: Taliban Bans Afghan Women From Higher Education)

“Universities are closed for our sisters. We don’t want to go to university either,” Nawidullah, a student, told Tolo News.

Another student told the outlet that he would not return to school because his two sisters were not allowed to continue their education. While the boycott includes students from universities across the country, according to Tolo News, it is unclear how many students are participating.

The Taliban’s minister of higher education Nida Mohammad Nadim defended the government’s decision by claiming that female students violated the dress code in classes, The Associated Press reported. He also claimed that the subjects taught in university courses were not appropriate for women to learn according to Islamic beliefs.

“We told girls to have proper hijab but they didn’t and they wore dresses like they are going to a wedding ceremony,” he reportedly said. “Girls were studying agriculture and engineering, but this didn’t match Afghan culture. Girls should learn, but not in areas that go against Islam and Afghan honor.”

The Taliban’s ruling on women’s education breaks its promise that women would be able to continue their education so long as classrooms were segregated by sex, AP reported.

Nadim could not be reached for comment by the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Residents Of Chicago’s Woodlawn Neighborhood Protest Shelter For Migrants,"Residents of a Chicago neighborhood protested preparations to establish a migrant shelter inside a closed-down elementary school, allegedly without the locals’ permission.

A group of Woodlawn residents gathered Thursday morning to insist the community provide resources for locals rather than the migrants, the Chicago Tribune reported. The city reportedly plans to convert Wadsworth Elementary School into housing for migrants relocated to the city.

“I’m here because I am a child of Woodlawn … and I’m speaking on behalf of the people that are here and the one’s that’s [sic] not here,” one resident said, according to video footage from the gathering. “We are very disappointed in this decision that Mayor Lightfoot has made to place these migrants in our community without our permission. Mayor Lightfoot would never pull this type of thing in anyone’s neighborhood. She would not drop off a busload of Haitians in Little Village. She would not drop off a busload of black people in Chinatown. She would not drop off a busload of black people up north.”

The resident asked Lightfoot to “please withdraw your decision to put the migrants in our community.” Ald. Jeanette Taylor told the Tribune the locals’ dissent came from concerns about the lack of resources in Woodlawn, rather than an opposition to the migrants themselves.

The resident said the migrants should be relocated to the city’s Little Village neighborhood because there is allegedly “more room” there. She cited concerns of fentanyl in the community and a lack of resources, and argued migrants should not take what is already a scarcity of assets. (RELATED: New York Begins Construction Of A Tent City To House Illegal Migrants)

“We’re tired, Ms. Lightfoot,” the woman continued.

Other members of the community criticized the reported move to shelter migrants in their neighborhood.

“The community feels disrespected, they feel as though they were not included, and they need answers today,” community member Jennifer Maddox said, according to FOX32.

“While I’ll love to help immigrants and everybody else, I’ll like to help my own first,” Woodlawn resident Jean Clark said, according to the Tribune.

Taylor said neither she nor the residents had been informed about the mayor’s plan, FOX32 reported.

Hundreds Protest After Police Shoot College Student Who Allegedly Advanced On Them With Kukri Knife,"Hundreds of protestors took to the streets to voice their anger and frustration over the shooting of a University of Massachusetts Boston student last week.

Angry and frustrated demonstrators gathered outside of Cambridge City Hall Monday in a rally organized by the Bangladesh Association of New England to voice their displeasure at the situation. Sayed Faisal, 20, was fatally shot Wednesday after the student allegedly advanced on police with a kukri sword, WCVB reported.

“Faisal needed help not bullets,” was the sentiment on some of the signs among the protestors looking for justice for a man, according to WCVB. “It’s so heartbreaking to hear about the sad news,” the organization stated on their Facebook page. “We need to bring justice for this young brother. Police brutality need to stop.”

Faisal reportedly jumped through his apartment window and began cutting himself on the broken glass, according to another report by WCVB. Surveillance video showed Faisal holding the kukri sword up to his neck before running shirtless down the street with police following close behind. The chase continued until Faisal stopped in a backyard next to a daycare where police again attempted to get him to give up the weapon. Police initially hit Faisal with a non-lethal “sponge round” before lethal force was used, the outlet reported.

“Our only son, Sayed Arif Faisal, who we lovingly called Prince, is no longer with us nor in this world. We are completely devastated and in disbelief that our son is gone,” begins the statement from his parents.https://t.co/XBVk9R6BfH — Bianca Beltrán (@BiancaNBCBoston) January 9, 2023



In a statement released by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), Faisal’s parents remembered their son, “Prince,” as a non-violent person who had never had a brush with law enforcement before. “We are completely devastated and in disbelief that our son is gone. Prince was the most wonderful, loving, caring, generous, supportive, and deeply family-oriented person,” the statement read.

“To Faisal’s family and friends, my heart breaks with you. Know that I hear you and your demands for accountability and change. I understand it feels as though the city you’ve called ‘home’ has failed you; insofar as I’m able to repair this break, please know I am committed to doing so,” Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui said in a press release Monday.

The Cambridge City police Department echoed those sentiments by offering their condolences to Faisal’s family and loved ones. “Any time a life is lost in our community, it is tragic, so we are all mourning,” Cambridge police Commissioner Christine Elow stated, according to WCVB news.

An independent investigation into the shooting is underway, the results of which will be sent forth to the Middlesex District Attorney’s to determine if charges are warranted in the case. The process, the outlet stated, could take a year or more. Elow assured that the Cambridge Police Department would be cooperating with that investigation “100 percent”, WCVB reported.

Parents Protest As Opioid Addiction Center Prepares To Open Next Door To Boys & Girls Club,"Parents gathered Monday to protest at a city council meeting in Lynnwood, Washington, as an opioid clinic prepares to open next to a Boys & Girls Club after-school program, multiple outlets reported.

A number of local parents and some city council members have expressed concern about the planned relocation of the Acadia Healthcare treatment clinic, primarily over the safety of their children, according to KING5. The Acadia Healthcare clinic is expected to hold up to 300 patients and offer medication to treat opioid addiction.

The center is expected to open at its new location later in January, but city officials said they were not informed about the clinic’s plans until recently due to an alleged miscommunication between the city’s permit and planning department and city council, KOMO News reported.

Snohomish County makes up 10% of Washington’s population and over 18% of the state’s heroin-related deaths, KING5 reported, citing county data.

“I feel like this location is … crazy,” one parent said at the city council meeting, according to KING5.

“The safety is our priority. It’s the wrong location because it’s too close to our kids,” resident Jou Hou told the outlet. (RELATED: Former Shill For Opioid Maker Is Now Promoting Sex Changes For Children)

“We’re in this position of either being called NIMBYs [Not In My Backyard], and you know like — like, ‘You just don’t have a heart, you don’t want to help people,’ or, we stand up and try to protect our community and we want to know who is accountable for this,” one local, Vivian Dong, told KING5. “And we are glad that the city council is apparently on our side and wants to work with us.”

Thank you Lynnwood City Council for standing with the people and speaking out against the @WADeptHealth. We will continue to work with the Council to fight this proposed location and protect our kids. #safeLynnwood — Safe Lynnwood (@safeLynnwood) January 10, 2023

Lynnwood City Council President George Hurst called for the clinic to be moved to a more industrial location. “This is just the wrong place for it. If Lynnwood wants one or will have one, and I think they should be, I’m thinking along Highway 99, in a light industrial area,” Hurst said, according to KING5.

“Department of Health is now waiting for Acadia to meet some final requirements, including meeting with local governing bodies and providing an updated community relations plan before the department can make a final licensing decision,” a spokesperson for the State Department of Health told the outlet. Acadia Healthcare reportedly said it would hire security personnel around the property if necessary.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/10/lynnwood-washington-opioid-clinic-parents-protest/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjY2-PtgLT9AhWkFFkFHQOxADo4MhAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw1g-ROhz4vGMiblTQ8HqzEH,2023-01-10
REPORT: Police Remove Greta Thunberg From Climate Protest,"The German police reportedly removed Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg from a climate strike on Sunday.

The goal of the strike was reportedly to protest the destruction of a German village, Luetzerath, in favor of the expansion of a coal mine. Thunberg initially joined the climate strike on Saturday to denounce the clearance of the village by RWE, a German energy company, Fox News reported. Thunberg reportedly refused to leave the protest after two policemen asked her to do so, according to Bild.

The soil in Luetzerath reportedly contains significant amounts of lignite coal, which, when burned can lead to acid rain if not treated, according to Fortune. (RELATED: ‘Very Dangerous’: Greta Thunberg Slams Biden Over Climate Record)

Between 20 and 40 activists were still protesting by late Friday, with 470 people leaving after being pressured by the police, a spokeswoman for the protests said.

Despite the protests, demolition of empty buildings has slowly proceeded. Trees have also been removed, France 24 reports. The village remains an icon of resistance against fossil fuels, according to France 24. The rallying call of the demonstrators is “Against the evacuation — for an end to coal and climate justice,” the outlet noted.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/16/police-remove-greta-thunberg-climate-protest/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjrlMTsgLT9AhXiEGIAHfjSBlQ4HhAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw36ig4fRNmKd-K9vcfdVnXZ,2023-01-16
Top Dem Katherine Clark’s ‘Non-Binary’ Child Arrested At Antifa Protest,"House Minority Whip Katherine Clark’s child was arrested Saturday at an Antifa protest, and has been accused of assaulting a police officer and vandalism, according to a press release from the Boston Police Department (BPD).

Twenty-three-year-old Riley Dowell, whose birth name is Jared, was charged with “Assault by Means of a Dangerous Weapon, Destruction or Injury of Personal Property and Damage of Property by Graffiti/Tagging,” according to the BPD’s press release. Clark has previously said Dowell is “non-binary,” and described Dowell as her daughter in a Tweet.

“Last night, my daughter was arrested in Boston, Massachusetts. I love Riley, and this is a very difficult time in the cycle of joy and pain in parenting. This will be evaluated by the legal system, and I am confident in that process,” Clark wrote Sunday.

Dowell was one of two people arrested Saturday night at an Antifa riot near the Parkman Bandstand Monument in Boston Common, according to the BPD’s statement. Dowell allegedly spray-painted “No Cop City” and “ACAB” (All Cops are Bastards), phrases associated with Antifa rioters, on the monument. Roughly 20 protesters attempted to interfere with Dowell’s arrest, the department continued.

Dowell is not the first child of a congressional Democrat to be arrested for protest and riot activity. Linwood “Woody” Kaine, the youngest son of Democratic Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, was sentenced to probation in 2017 after entering the Minnesota state capitol while protesting a Donald Trump rally. (RELATED: Tim Kaine: ‘I Don’t Know Enough About Antifa)

"Teacher Makes BLM Protest Signs With Four, Five-Year-Olds In Daycare Training Video","A teacher made Black Lives Matter signs with her students in a video guide promoted to North Carolina daycare workers.

In the video, the teacher makes the sign after reading a children’s book titled “20 Protesters Who Changed America.” The book includes a page on San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who took a knee during the national anthem before football games in protest of police brutality against black Americans.

“Colin took a knee to support Black Lives Matter,” the teacher said. “This way his way of spreading the word and showing people that things are not fair right now. Things need to change.” (RELATED: Teacher Says He Spins Around While Wearing A Skirt In The Classroom In Training Video For Early Education Workers)

The teacher then gave the children “homework” on the lesson, asking each child to think about what “we as a group of five-year-olds together with your teachers, what can we do to help.”

A video promoted by a daycare association depicts a male teacher telling children he “wants to feel safe” while wearing a skirt in the classroom. “I like it, I like to spin around in it,” Silveira says he tells the 4 or 5 year old students. @DailyCaller https://t.co/SE70pA3Sad — Sarah Weaver 💍 (@SarahHopeWeaver) January 25, 2023

The teacher said one of the children came up with the idea to “support Black Lives Matter” after the homework assignment. When the teacher said they could get the supplies for the sign tomorrow, she says that the children responded, “no, Nadia, this is really important work. We can’t wait until tomorrow.”

After making the signs and putting them on sticks, they marched around the school with them, even going into other classrooms to “tell them how important black lives are.”

“This is our Black Lives Matter sign, and we have our Black Lives Matter statement,” one of the children says in the video.

Denver Elementary School promoted Black Lives Matter trainings that advocate disrupting the “nuclear family” and directs students to be “transgender affirming” in June 2022. BLM Week was an event promoted by a number of school districts in states from Boston to Seattle and promoted “the 13 values of Black Lives Matter” to students in February 2022.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/25/teacher-blm-protest-signs-north-carolina-daycare/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjrlMTsgLT9AhXiEGIAHfjSBlQ4HhAWegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw2YOqTi8LrF8zV_o9aF8H8m,2023-01-25
DAVID BLACKMON: Why Doesn’t Greta Thunberg Stage Climate Protests In China?,"Climate change activist Greta Thunberg made news recently when she was arrested during a protest at a coal mining site near Lutzerath, Germany. The news did not come so much from her arrest by German police dressed up in riot gear, but by the obvious staging of the event with the full cooperation of the policemen and the press covering the event.

Ms. Thunberg and the officers no doubt assumed video of all the obvious staging and repeated takes from different angles would not leak, but leak it did, revealing the phoniness of it all. Such staging of major “news” events is not really anything new, but it is revelatory of Thunberg’s real role as a crisis actor for the climate alarmist movement.

It is a role she appears to have been raised by her parents to fulfill, but her staging choices raise some questions about her sincerity to the supposed cause. (RELATED: MICHAEL BASTASCH: There’s A New Book The Climate Industrial Complex Doesn’t Want You To Read)

Put simply: Ms. Thunberg seems to aim her protests at the wrong targets.

For example, why is it that the Thunberg campaign to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide has never traveled to China? China is, after all, the world’s biggest carbon emitter by far.

Oxford Analytics recently published a chart, based on data compiled by the International Energy Agency, showing that, in 2022, China generated more electricity by burning coal alone than the U.S. generated from all energy sources.

So, if Greta wants to protest coal — which emits more CO2 than any other source of power generation — why not do it in the country that uses vastly more coal than any other?

Why pick on Germany, which is in the midst of a severe, if self-inflicted, energy crisis and has no choice but to burn more coal to keep its citizens from freezing in the dark this winter? Doing so seems somewhat callous, even cruel.

It’s a compelling question, but no one in the climate narrative-friendly press seems interested in asking it. (RELATED: STEPHEN MOORE: The Night The Lights Went Out In Europe)

When an independent journalist with Rebel News did confront Thunberg with that very question on the streets of Davos a few days after her fake arrest, another reporter following Greta’s entourage could be heard in the background calling him an “idiot.”

Such is the kind of fawning loyalty to which Thunberg has grown accustomed from her media friends.

To be fair to Greta, her odd reluctance to chastise the Chinese government falls right into lockstep with the general attitude displayed by the jet-setting elites who attend these climate-focused global conferences like the WEF and last November’s UN-sponsored COP 27 conference held in Egypt. Unlike China, the governments of the western world have actually made progress towards cutting their carbon emissions over the last quarter century, even if they’ve chosen to devalue their currencies to fund trillions in green subsidies in the process.

China, meanwhile, has not only continued to consume an ever-rising volume of coal for power generation, but it currently also plans to build at least 300 additional coal-fired plants at home and abroad in the years to come. Where the western world obsesses on a goal of becoming “Net Zero by 2050” in carbon emissions, the global collective has chosen to place no real obligations on China to make any real changes in its emissions profile until well after that deadline has come and gone.

In fact, the virtual absence of any utterance of the word “China” during its week of ruminations on climate change was one of the most striking aspects of the WEF conference. It is almost as if the subject is now taboo in the circles of the global elite.

It’s a classic case of an effort to ignore the proverbial elephant occupying the sofa in the living room. When it comes to carbon emissions, China is unambiguously that elephant that everyone in the west tries to walk and talk around.

Greta Thunberg is just the crisis actor these western elites have used as a poster child. Greta is no longer a child, though: She is 20 years old now, and should know better.

This crisis theater is too costly and destructive to continue.

‘We Want Urinals’: Students Cut Class In Protest Of New Hampshire District Urinal Ban Over ‘Gender Identity’,"Over 100 Granite State students banded together to conduct a Friday walk out to protest a school board district-wide policy that bans urinals over ‘gender identity’ concerns.

The united act of defiance came in response to the Milford, New Hampshire School Board voting in favor of closing off urinals, limiting “the number of people in a restroom to the number of stalls,” WMUR reported. The board’s decision resulted in urinals “being covered up with trash bags” at schools within the New England district:

The outlet reported that male students “felt particularly targeted” by the policy. Numerous students said they felt voiceless; having no say in the outcome of the vote.

At least one student carried a sign that read: “We want urinals,” according to ABC News. The Friday demonstrations lasted as long as 45 minutes after the initial walk-out.

“Nobody asked for this,” student Autumn Diveley told WMUR. “Nobody but the few parents who complained to the school board asked for this.”

The school board decided a few days before the Friday walkout to prohibit students at Milford Middle School and Milford High School from using urinals or shared spaces in locker rooms. https://t.co/ysw9j22GIu — The Washington Times (@WashTimes) February 12, 2023

The picketing pupils were reportedly joined by a handful of teachers as well as administrators.

The policy is the apparent result of a compromise, following a contested Monday night board meeting that included a proposal to change the already-in-place district bathroom policy – which presently permits students to use any of the bathrooms that best align with their chosen gender identity, according to coverage from earlier in the week by WMUR. (RELATED: The Transgender Bathroom Question Is Likely Heading To The Supreme Court)

That proposal sought to change the current district restroom rules so that students could only enter the lavatory that matches their sex so as assigned at birth.

Another student, Lena Silva, told the outlet that “As a female, I don’t think it’s safe to have males in our bathroom.” (RELATED: ‘He Just Went Crazy’: Video Shows Student Going Berserk, Throwing Teacher To The Ground)

Board member Noah Boudreault told ABC News that he proposed the urinal prohibition policy as an attempt at a compromise. The district restroom policy changes also restrict students from changing in front of one another in a locker-room-like setting.

Boudreault commented on the student protests to the local news outlet, saying he supports their right to picket.

“I have heard from a great number of the students on the matter and want them to know that I hear their voices. The board’s decision was in part to collect data and make adjustments if necessary,” he added.

Milford School Board Secretary Joseph Vitulli suggested that the move was rushed and that the student turn-out shows the need for further board deliberation geared toward reconsideration.

“My personal opinion is that the students’ actions speak for how they feel about the bathroom situation and that it’s clear the board must deal with this issue ASAP,” Vitulli said. “The idea of immediately changing was not well thought out by the board, and we need to fix the situation.”

Student Jay Remella told WMUR he knew no one that lobbied for the change: “It was solely made by the school board and a parent complaint,” he told the outlet.

The next school board meeting is set for February 20, yet the Milford Public Schools Superintendent Christi Mishaud hinted that it is possible that the restrictions could be rolled back before-hand.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/12/milford-urinals-students-protest-new-hampshire-district-urinal-ban/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjz2JDrgLT9AhXhM1kFHQNKAt44ChAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw3zA0m_uJTmUMU_nCVnoZe6,2023-02-12
School Board That Banned Urinals Changes Mind After Students Protest,"A New Hampshire school board reversed its ban on urinals a week after prohibiting them amid backlash from students, according to WMUR News.

The Milford School Board unanimously voted Wednesday to put urinals back in the school bathrooms after previously banning them last week over gender identity concerns, according to WMUR News. The reversal comes after more than 100 students within the district walked out to protest the banning of the urinals. (RELATED: Idaho School Board Cancels Gender Identity Policy Following Community Uproar)

“The board has listened to folks,” Christi Michaud, superintendent of Milford School District, told the outlet. “Lots and lots of emails, lots of phone calls that we’ve received.”

On Feb. 6, the Milford School Board voted to limit the number of students allowed in the bathroom at once, prohibited students from using shared changing spaces and banned urinals, leading to them being covered with trash bags. The ban was an attempt at a compromise after a policy was proposed to permit bathroom use on the basis of biological sex rather than gender identity.

The reversal only applied to the ban on urinals, according to WMUR News.

Students and several teachers protested the ban on Feb. 11, with one carrying a sign that said “we want urinals.” The urinal ban has led to male students feeling “targeted,” WMUR News reported.

“Nobody asked for this,” Autumn Diveley, a Milford School District student, told the outlet. “Nobody but the few parents who complained to the school board asked for this.”

The limit on the number of students allowed in the bathroom at a time will still stand and students will still use bathrooms on the basis of gender identity, according to WMUR News.

“My personal opinion is that the students’ actions speak for how they feel about the bathroom situation and that it’s clear the board must deal with this issue ASAP,” Joseph Vitulli, Milford School Board secretary, told the outlet after students protested. “The idea of immediately changing was not well thought out by the board, and we need to fix the situation.”

The Milford School Board and Michaud did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.
