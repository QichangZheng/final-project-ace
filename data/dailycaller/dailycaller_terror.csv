Arrests In Three European Countries Dismantle ISIS-Linked Terror Cell,"European law enforcement agencies arrested 13 terror suspects with ties to ISIS Thursday during simultaneous raids in six countries.

The terror suspects are leaders and members of Rawti Shax, a Kurdish-Sunni terror ring, who were allegedly willing to become suicide bombers and were allegedly plotting a kidnapping attempt on Norwegian diplomats.

The European Union’s judicial cooperation unit, Eurojust, which has been investigating Rawti Shax for years, said it has close relations with ISIS, and has been providing logistical and financial support to recruited terrorists. The group’s primary objective is to overthrow the Kurdish-Iraqi government and replace it with one governed by Sharia law.

The arrests were made in Italy, Norway and the UK, reported the Guardian. Raids in Switzerland, Finland and Germany did not result in any arrests, but authorities were able to obtain important documents and electronic data on the group’s operations.

The leader of the group is believed to be Najmuddin Faraj Ahmad, commonly known as Mullah Krekar, who has been running the ring from prison in Norway where he has lived since 1991. Krekar is a recognized terrorist by the United States and the UN.

He has served several prison sentences in Norway after making death threats to the Prime Minister and plotting terrorist attacks in the country. Norway has been unsuccessful in deporting Ahmad because of the risk that he may be executed upon return to his native Iraq.

Angelino Alfano, Italy’s interior minister, said the country has invested more resources in preventing terrorism as the threat continues to rise. (RELATED: Italy Arrests ISIS Terrorist Disguised As Refugee)

“We are a country exposed to the international risk of terrorism because we are part of that great international coalition that is opposed to the caliphate,” he said when asked about the arrests.

Europol estimates that between 3,000 and 5,000 EU citizens have joined Al-Qaida and ISIS.

US Citizen ‘Shot In The Head’ By UK Police During London Terror Attack,"U.K. police who were responding to the London Bridge terror attacks Saturday accidentally shot an American citizen in the head.

Police fired approximately 50 rounds at the attackers who were using knives to attack bystanders after ramming others with a van. Fabio Lamas, a local bartender, recalled seeing the three Islamic State terrorists carrying knives.

“I got people to start evacuating inside from our little garden that we have … and got people to come into the bar and to go into toilets, hide under tables and hide in our cellar where we keep all our stock,” Lamas told NBC. “Then I heard shooting, and I saw an American guy get shot in the head.”

The unidentified American was standing near a window inside Wheatsheaf pub. One terrorist was shot dead just outside the establishment.

Lamas claimed the victim was a doctor from either New Jersey or New York. The man was with two friends who were living in London. The U.S. embassy in Britain has not acknowledged an American was injured in the event.

London Metropolitan police responded to the attack within eight minutes of receiving the first emergency phone call regarding the incident, according to Metropolitan Police Service Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley. The officers responding to the event “fired an unprecedented number of rounds to be completely confident they had neutralized those threats.” (RELATED: London Police Gun Down Terrorists With ‘Unprecedented Number Of Rounds)

The attackers killed seven people and injured another 48.

Anti-terror plan allies White House with Muslim groups,"The White House’s new plan to curb home-grown Islamic extremism calls for partnerships between local governments, various non-profits, and U.S. communities of Muslims. But critics say those partnerships often include Islamic groups whose ideology spurs terrorism.

Federal agencies are already using their “convening power to help build a network of individuals, groups, civil society organizations, and private sector actors to support community-based efforts to counter violent extremism,” according to the new strategy document, titled “Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States.”

But administration policymakers have not worked with pro-American Muslim groups, said Zuhdi Jasser, president of the Phoenix-based America Islamic Forum for Democracy. “The [groups] they work with are the wrong ones,” Jasser told TheDC.

Muslims in the United States “tend to be pro-Western and pro-American [but] the leadership of the mosques and the Islamic centers tend to be influenced by Islamists overseas,” said Andrew McCarthy, who successfully prosecuted Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and eleven other terrorists in 1995. Rahman had earlier created a terror group in Egypt.

Instead of partnering with Islamic groups, the federal government should use routine policing and civil-rights laws to protect individuals in Muslim communities from being intimidated by politicized Muslims, many of whom are tied to the Egypt-based Muslim Brotherhood, McCarthy said.

Federal protection would ease assimilation by people from Muslim countries and also undermine Muslim ideologies that spur terrorism, adds McCarthy, who now runs the Center for Law and Counterterrorism at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.

The White House’s new strategy was applauded by advocacy groups including the Muslim Public Affairs Council, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “The way the plan is rolling out is very much in line with a community partnership model, and we believe that is very useful,” said Salam Al-Maryati, president of MPAC

According to a statement from CAIR’s executive director, Nihad Awad,“Programs that build trust between law enforcement authorities and the communities they serve are crucial … Our government must also engage with American Muslim institutions and individuals proven to enjoy community support.”

The U.S. Department of Justice designated CAIR an unindicted conspirator in the successful 2008 prosecution of several U.S.-based Muslims for smuggling funds to the Hamas terror group.

The administration’s strategy comes almost 10 years after Al Qaeda’s attack on New York, and after what MPAC says were at least 48 additional attacks or terrorist plots by observant Muslims.

The terror threat “is not coming from the [Muslim] communities,” Al Maryati insists, but from “individuals that communities can help us detect and rehabilitate.”

U.S. government officials “have bent over backwards to be respectful to Islamists, which is not helpful,” McCarthy argues. And Americans would be safer if government policy encouraged “a natural assimilation of pro-Western Muslims — there are many in the United States — and [made] clear that the law of the United States is the supreme law, and we’re not ceding territory or legal jurisdiction” to local Islamic activists.

A recent survey of Gallup polling data showed a large segment of Americans with a Muslim background actually have few connections to Muslim groups. Only about half of self-identified Muslims in the United States go to a mosque, and almost half — 48.5 percent —declined to name a Muslim advocacy group that most represented their interests.

Only 11.5 percent of Muslim respondents said CAIR most represented their interests, 3.5 percent chose MPAC, and 13 percent cited groups that the report did not identify. The Abu Dhabi Gallup Center, which is supported by the Crown Prince Court of Abu Dhabi, issued the survey on Tuesday.

The administration’s new policy document offers no details on implementation plans, but is closer to Al Maryati’s preferences for federal cooperation with Islamic groups than to McCarthy’s recommendations for a focus on individuals’ rights.

For example, the report says the federal government “must use a wide range of good governance programs — including those that promote immigrant integration and civic engagement, protect civil rights, and provide social services — that may help prevent radicalization that leads to violence.”

Communities that do try to discourage terrorism should be praised and be given extra government support, said the report. “Where communities have been active in condemning terrorism and confronting violent extremism, we must recognize their efforts; help them build upon their work; and connect them with other communities and stakeholders in order to share best practices.”

The report is silent about criteria for choosing U.S. groups to be supported by the government.

It also discourages criticism of Muslim groups, even when they share common beliefs with terrorists. “Strong religious beliefs should never be confused with violent extremism … [and] officials and the American public should not stigmatize or blame communities because of the actions of a handful of individuals.”

The report does not discuss the ideologies or motives of Islamic terrorists, except in noting that Al Qaeda terrorists “all believe: (1) the United States is out to destroy Islam; and (2) this justifies violence against Americans.”

“The government needs to think through how and with whom it partners … sometimes we do that well, and more often, we have not,” said Matthew Levitt, director of the counterterrorism program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “Sometimes the largest and loudest groups get most attention, but the most grassroots and effective groups do not,” he said.

Advocates from MPAC, CAIR and other Muslim advocacy groups have met with Obama administration officials during the last two years, but leaders in Jasser’s council of Western-oriented Muslim groups say they were frozen out of government discussions.

In July the American Islamic Leadership Council urged the administration to “engage non-Islamist Muslim groups to help develop and implement effective counter-radicalization programs, which affirm the principles of liberty and individual rights, within an Islamic narrative.”

The July draft of the administration’s strategy “provides no criteria for determining with which Muslim groups the Administration will conduct its outreach programs … [and] focuses narrowly upon al-Qa’ida as the enemy,” said the council’s recommendations. Council members include Jasser’s organization and 24 other individuals and groups, few of which have staff or offices.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2011/08/04/anti-terror-plan-allies-white-house-with-muslim-groups/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj4usaMgLT9AhXKFFkFHTSgCAQ4UBAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw2Dmn82L3Of1OCA3nw-OZe3,2011-08-04
"Don’t mention Islam, says new anti-terror plan","The White House wants to use U.S. Attorneys to coordinate outreach to immigrant groups that produce Muslim terrorists, according to a new policy.

The White House-appointed U.S. Attorneys will work with Muslim groups to avert terror attacks, which the new policy dubs “violent extremism,” and will give them access to law enforcement information, aid Muslim bloggers and re-train law enforcement departments around the country.

“To better synchronize this work, U.S. Attorneys, who historically have engaged with communities in their districts, have begun leading Federal engagement efforts,” said the policy, titled “Strategic Implementation Plan For Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States,” released Dec. 8.

Federal officials, including at least 30 of the 93 U.S Attorneys, have already held more than 150 meeting with communities, withdrawn unwanted training materials and translated anti-radicalization information into languages used by Muslim immigrants, including Arabic, Somali, Urdu and Farsi.

Officials are also revamping training materials used by law enforcement officials. Officials “have gone through a review process, developed and tested and piloted training related to both countering violent extremism as well as broader counterterrorism training to ensure that it’s accurate and meets those objectives,” a White House official said Thursday.

However, the policy offers few details about the plan, does not name the Muslim groups that are to be included in the outreach efforts, and does not name the individuals or groups that are slated to re-train law enforcement officials about “violent extremism.”

Also, the new report does not mention Islam, whose texts are often used to provide the impetus and rationales for that spur terror strikes by Muslims.

That policy, however, isn’t always applied.

Quintan Wiktorowicz, the official who leads the development of the new policy for the White House, told NPR on Dec. 7 that “here are potential behavioral signals… has someone in the community seen them watching violent extremist videos? Are they publicly coming out in defense of Osama bin Laden? Are they talking about the kuffar [Arabic for non-Muslim]? That’s not enough alone, but if that is in a combination of other things, that’s what we are looking for.”

But the top-level refusal to identify Islam as a cause of terror attacks cripples counter-terrorism efforts because it deters lower-level law enforcement officials from understanding jihadis’ motivations and purposes, say critics, including Robert Spencer, who runs the jihadwatch website.

For example, Army officials routinely ignored vitriolic Islamic arguments made by the Muslim Army officer who killed 13 soldiers and civilians at Fort Hood.

The enemy, according to White House, are not jihadis or radical Islamists, but “violent extremists” who are members of al-Qaida.

Al-Qaida’s affiliates, presumably, include the Somali-based Al Shabab organization, which has used U.S.-based clerics to recruit up to 30 Muslim immigrants living in Minnesota. At least one of the recruits volunteered to be a suicide bomber in Somalia.

The report instead compares jihadi attacks, such as the Fort Hood massacre by a self-described “Soldier of Allah,” to domestic violence, “school shooters” and workplace violence, such as shootings by post office workers.

Critics say this silence about Islam is rationalized by progressives’ diversity ideology, and by their desire to build political alliances with immigrant Muslim groups in Illinois, Michigan, New York and other states.

The policy says mistakes by the U.S. government can spur terror attacks. “The Administration recognizes the potential to do more harm than good if our Nation’s approach and actions are not dutifully considered and deliberated,” said the policy.



The report urges the federal government to establish mechanisms to work with immigrant communities to avert radicalization.

The efforts include events to “discuss issues such as civil rights, counterterrorism security measures, international events, foreign policy, and other community concerns … raise awareness about the threat of violent extremism… facilitate partnerships to prevent radicalization to violence.”

When reaching out to Muslim communities, “we talk about issues that are of concern to everyone, to include violent extremism, but also civil rights, civil liberties, bullying and other issues that are of concern for parents. … We see Muslim Americans as, frankly, our most important partners in this effort,” said a White House official.

But this emphasis on federal outreach to selected representatives of immigrant communities may actually sideline immigrant-integration techniques that successfully absorbed millions of European immigrants in American society.

These older techniques included the use of social and workplace pressure to speak English, abandon foreign clothing, adopt English names and embrace Western ideas and education.

The policy does not suggest screening immigrants for Islamist sympathies, but it cites the integration of immigrants as one of several means for reducing terror strikes.

The emphasis on working with leaders from the immigrant communities,rather than treating immigrants as Americans, does carry the risk of helping communities isolate themselves from U.S. society, critics charge.

The policy recognizes the danger posed by immigrant self-segregation. “Violent extremist narratives espouse a rigid division between ‘us’ and ‘them’ that argues for exclusion from the broader society and a hostile relationship with government and other communities. … Activities that reinforce our shared sense of belonging and productive interactions between government and the people undercut this [separatist] narrative and emphasize through our actions that we are all part of the social fabric of America,” said the report.

However, the administration’s report repeatedly calls for U.S. law enforcement officials to work with communities’ political groups, not with individuals.

Numerous Muslim political groups have offered themselves to serve as brokers between the federal government and the Muslim communities. However, these groups usually argue that police forces should not monitor immigrant communities for suspected terrorism by individuals, but instead should defer to them and local Imams.

The new policy does not urge the use of civil rights laws to protect Muslims from other Muslims, or to help them integrate into U.S. culture.

For example, several Muslim women have been killed or threatened by family members who say they are becoming too Americanized. Jessica Mokdad, 20, was killed this April by her step-father for “not adhering to Muslim customs,” said a May report in the Minneapolis Star Tribune.

The extension of U.S. civil rights laws to Muslim communities would be sharply opposed by many local leaders that are being sought to serve as brokers with law enforcement officials.

Also, some of those brokers have been working both sides. In 2010, for example, an Afghan-born Imam in New York admitted he tipped off a terrorist after police asked him about the man.

Similarly, several Muslim political groups have close ties to terrorists. On Dec. 7, for example, a three-judge appeal court panel upheld jail sentences for three Texas-based Muslims who funneled money to Hamas, the violent Palestinian offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood. During the trial, federal officials identified many Muslim groups and individuals as unindicted conspirators. These groups include the nation’s primary Muslim coalition, the Islamic Society of North America, as well as the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

The report includes no details about the Muslim groups and individuals who will be invited to aid the outreach or training programs.

However, according to the policy, “it is important that we communicate to the American public the realities of what the threat is, and what it is not… an informed citizenry enhances our national security.”

Animal rights terror group takes credit for torching cattle trucks,"A shadowy group of anonymous animal rights radicals says it was behind an arson attack early Sunday that burned more than a dozen trucks at a cattle feedlot in Fresno County, Calif.

A statement from the Animal Liberation Front, published by the Fresno Bee, describes how the fire, which heavily damaged 14 tractors and several cattle-hauling trailers, was set. “Despite guards, a constant worker presence and razor wire fence,” the statement read, “the enemy is still vulnerable.”

“[T]here is a lot of stuff that needs to be destroyed,” the statement added, “and we can’t count on spontaneous combustion and careless welders to do all the work.”

Harris Farms CEO and Chairman John Harris said Tuesday in an email to the Bee that he and his employees are “appalled by this senseless, but very alarming attack.”

“I had suspected Animal Liberation Front may have been involved and now they are in fact claiming responsibility for it with multiple details,” Harris wrote, calling the arson a terrorist action.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation, too, considers the loose-knit Animal Liberation Front a terrorist group. Testifying before Congress in 2005, then-FBI deputy assistant director John Lewis called it, along with other “eco-terror” organizations, “one of today’s most serious domestic terrorism threats.”

Three of the seven fugitives in the “domestic terror” category of the FBI’s Most Wanted list are affiliated with the Animal Liberaton Front.

Yasser Arafat’s widow admits Palestinian terror campaign in 2000 was premeditated,"Suha Arafat, the wife of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, admitted in a TV interview earlier this month that the Palestinian terror campaign against Israel launched in 2000 was a premeditated act orchestrated by her husband, not a spontaneous “intifada,” or uprising, as many have claimed.

Watch:

“Yasser Arafat had made a decision to launch the intifada,” she told Dubai TV on Dec. 16, according to a translation by the Middle East Media Research Institute.

“Immediately after the failure of the Camp David [negotiations], I met him in Paris upon his return. … Camp David has failed, and he said to me: ‘You should remain in Paris.’ I asked him why, and he said: ‘Because I am going to start an intifada. They want me to betray the Palestinian cause. They want me to give up on our principles, and I will not do so.'”

In a summit convened by President Bill Clinton at Camp David in July 2000, Arafat rejected an offer by then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barack to create a Palestinian state in the equivalent of roughly 97 percent of the West Bank, including land swaps, and all of the Gaza Strip, according to an account by America’s chief Middle East negotiator at the time, Dennis Ross. East Jerusalem was to be the Palestinian capital.

Though then-Saudi Ambassador to the United States Prince Bandar bin Sultan reportedly told Arafat that if he rejected the generous offer he would be committing a “crime” against the Palestinian people, Arafat did just that by walking away from the deal. (RELATED: France begins murder investigation after Arafat’s death)

In September, soon after the Camp David summit ended in failure, the so-called Palestinian intifada began. Many have blamed the start of the uprising on then-leading Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon’s supposedly provocative visit to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, which besides being a holy site to Jews, is also the site of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, a holy site in Islam.

But Suha Arafat’s interview backs up those who have argued that the terror campaign was not the result of some spontaneous uprising triggered by Sharon’s visit to the Temple Mount, but a premeditated terror campaign orchestrated by Yasser Arafat himself.

“‘I do not want Zahwa’s friends in the future to say that Yasser Arafat abandoned the Palestinian cause and principles,'” Suha Arafat said her husband told her. Zahwa is the couple’s only child.

“‘I might be martyred, but I shall bequeath our historical heritage to Zahwa and to the children of Palestine,'” he supposedly added.

As a result of the four-year terror campaign, more than 1,000 Israelis were killed by Palestinian terror groups, while more than 3,000 Palestinians, including terrorists, died as result of Israel’s efforts to stop the violence.

Feds charge Tunisian citizen with Amtrak terror plot,"The FBI announced Thursday that Ahmed Abassi, a Tunisian citizen who recently moved to the United States from Canada, has been arrested in connection with a planned terrorist attack at a railway along America’s northern border.

Abassi is the third man to be charged in relation to the terror plot. The other two were arrested in Canada last month, and are said to be affiliated with al-Qaida elements in Iran. According to the New York Daily News, their plan involved derailing a Toronto-bound train operated by Amtrak.

“As alleged, Mr. Abassi came to the United States to pursue terrorist activity and support others in the same shameful pursuit,” FBI Assistant Director in Charge George Venizelos said in a statement. “What Mr. Abassi didn’t know was that one of his associates, privy to the details of his plan, was an undercover FBI agent.”

According to the FBI, Abassi came to the U.S. in March and “fraudulently” attempted to obtain a work visa.

“While in the United States, Abassi, who was under surveillance by law enforcement agents at all times, maintained regular contact with an FBI undercover officer (the UC) and also met with Chiheb Esseghaier in New York City,” the FBI said in a statement. “Esseghaier, who was recently arrested in Canada and is currently incarcerated there on terrorism charges, was previously radicalized by Abassi.”

“During Abassi’s discussions with Esseghaier and with the UC, which were recorded by the UC, Abassi discussed his desire to engage in terrorist acts against targets in the United States and other countries and his intention to provide support and funding to organizations engaged in terrorist activity—including the al Nusrah Front, which is recognized by the U.S. Department of State as an alias for Al Qaeda in Iraq—and to recruit other individuals for terrorist plots.”

Abassi was arrested on April 22 and arraigned on May 3, according to the FBI statement.

Anti-terror activist: Security of the Benghazi embassy was ‘farmed out to an al-Qaida front group’ [VIDEO],"In an exclusive interview with the Daily Caller, anti-terror activist and founder of Act! for America Brigitte Gabriel calls out the Obama administration for its “shameful” actions in Benghazi and inability to take responsibility.

“Those who lay their life on the line and sign up to serve our country overseas, it doesn’t matter what country they are serving in, they are depending on the United States government to provide them security,” Gabriel says. “So for Ambassador Stevens to be killed, tortured, kidnapped, sodomized, which most people do not want to talk about, and dragged through the streets the way he did and here is somebody who is exemplary example of what it’s like for someone to go into a country that’s trying to establish its democracy.”

Gabriel continues: “The security of the embassy was farmed out to an Al Qaeda front group instead of our own Americans protecting the embassy. Because our president wants so much to show our enemies his goodwill and working with our enemies he assigned the security of our embassy to an Islamic front group that had direct ties to Al Qaeda. This is exactly how they found out where Ambassador Stevens went, where he was hiding and people who were supposed to protect him are basically the people that ambushed him, while the order came down to stand down, from the White House, to stand down and not allow our first responders and specials forces to go in and save the ambassador.” (RELATED: Anti-terror campaigner: ‘Boston was a reality check for this administration who sold us a lie’)

Gabriel expresses her frustration with the Obama administration’s attempted Benghazi coverup.

“I am offended and insulted as an American, as a taxpayer, that my government lied to me,” exclaims Gabriel. “[K]nowing all that, our president didn’t have the guts to come on national television and say, ‘I made a mistake, we trusted the wrong people with the security of our own embassy because I made a bad judgement -forgive me and I take the blame.’ He wasn’t man enough to stand up in front of the country and say that. That’s why we are concerned about our government. That’s why we are concerned about Benghazi and want the truth to come out.”

Discussing news coverage of Benghazi, Gabriel describes the media as facilitators, helping the Obama Administration disseminate lies.

“They basically were his enablers in getting the story and saying it was a video that instigated all these riots. Most people in that part of the world didn’t even know anything about that video or that it existed. More people found out about that video from Hilary Clinton and President Obama, standing in front of the White House, talking about the video that instigated all these riots. That’s how they found out about it — by our president.” (RELATED:

The War on Terror is a war on American freedom,"In the aftermath of 9/11, President George W. Bush guided the Patriot Act through Congress, unilaterally expanded surveillance of Americans, amplified executive detention authority and took other dramatic measures that shifted the balance between liberty and government power significantly, in the name of national security.

After the initial Patriot Act was passed, many Democrats perceived the growing threat to civil liberties and started to have misgivings. Now, five years into the Obama presidency enthusiasm for these measures seems to be bipartisan.

As a presidential candidate, Barack Obama in 2007 and 2008 argued that sacrificing liberties in the name of anti-terrorism posed long-term risks. He condemned military commissions and violations of habeas corpus as serious threats to “the great traditions of our legal system and our way of life.” He called the Patriot Act “shoddy” and “dangerous.”

Senator Obama sharply criticized President Bush’s surveillance policies as going beyond the boundaries of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the Fourth Amendment. He vowed that if elected he would run an administration of unprecedented transparency and vigorously protect whistleblowers.

President Obama’s deeds have not matched Senator Obama’s words. Indeed, he has raised the stakes.

He promised to close Guantanamo by January 2010, but instead slowed down releases from Guantanamo and vastly expanded the prison camp at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan.

In 2009, he announced a policy of “prolonged detention,” ensuring indefinite imprisonment for detainees, including those against whom the U.S. government had no evidence of wrongdoing. In 2011, he signed the renewal of the Patriot Act. He has increased the role of unmanned drones and claims the authority to order a strike against any suspected terrorist: no trial necessary.

He also has expanded the surveillance operations of the National Security Agency (NSA), monitoring phone and internet traffic in a seemingly indiscriminate manner. The full extent is uncertain, but the goal is “total information awareness,” an idea floated shortly after 9/11.

The agency spies not just on Americans, but on residents of U.S. allies and other friendly countries. Germany, where President Obama has enjoyed high popularity, has protested particularly loudly, knowing well the dangers of totalitarian surveillance powers.

The administration also has spied on reporters, and Attorney General Eric Holder signed an arrest warrant for Fox News correspondent James Rosen over normal journalistic behavior.

Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden exposed the agency’s vast surveillance program. Instead of affording him whistleblower protections, the administration now wants to imprison him.

In fact, the current administration has used the Espionage Act against whistleblowers more than all previous administrations combined. And to prevent future whistle-blowing, the White House is encouraging federal employees to spy on one another.

Our Democratic law professor president, a self-described progressive, has created a perfect storm. Ten years ago, liberals screamed because the Republican administration took note of what patrons checked out at the library. Today, they seem much more complacent in the face of more intimate forms of mass surveillance.

Democrats once talked about prosecuting executive officials for wrongdoing. Today they muse about whether the government should jail journalists like Glenn Greenwald, U.S. columnist for the British newspaper, the Guardian, merely for providing a soapbox for whistleblowers.

The president has announced that the “war on terror” is all but over. We need a new approach to the threat. If the war on terror is being ended, the extraordinary measures that threaten our personal liberties also should be ended.

Some say that foreign terrorists hate the United States for its freedom. This seems oversimplified at best. But if it’s true, America’s enemies must love what U.S. leaders have done in the nearly 12 years since 9/11.

The question isn’t about balancing freedom and security. Determined terrorists can always take lives. But only our politicians, with our acquiescence, can take our freedoms.

Angelo Codevilla: The ‘War on Terror’ has become ‘The War on Americans’ [VIDEO],"The course of action the U.S. government took in the name of security after the 9/11 attacks is the “greatest mistake that could possibly have been made,” according to retired professor emeritus of Boston University Angelo Codevilla. “The War on Terror” has increasingly become a “war on Americans.”

The former U.S. Navy officer, author of “The Ruling Class: How They Corrupted America and What We Can Do About It” and staff member for the Select Committee on Intelligence of the United States Senate is highly critical of both the Bush and Obama administrations for their failure to understand their role in international relations.

The U.S. government does not understand how to combat international terrorism or respond to its threats. In an exclusive interview with Ginni Thomas of The Daily Caller, Codevilla highlighted the failure of both administrations to understand the enemy, explaining that it makes national security decisions based on a flawed paradigm.

“After 9/11, the U.S. government instituted a system of homeland security based on the proposition that any American is as likely as anyone in the world to commit terrorist acts — and that therefore, all Americans must be screened and presumed to be terrorists until the screening clears them,” Codevilla said.

With this flawed proposition directing domestic security’s strategic thinking and planning, Codevilla said the empowered government takes successive steps down the path towards greater intrusive surveillance and scrutiny, leading to “a largely useless and obnoxious bureaucracy” that is “based on the supposition that we should trust each other less but trust government more.”

Codevilla called this an “unnatural demand” and “one that pushes us to regard each other with suspicion.” He delved into the new poll that found that Americans now trust each other less than they ever have before, as the culture of suspicion permeates American life.

“Decreasing the amount of trust among citizens is probably the worst thing that government could ever do,” he added.

Codevilla further argues that due to the incorrect deductions and conclusions drawn post 9/11 about the motivations and nature of the enemy it was facing, the DHS bureaucracy, the wider national security infrastructure and their mission have been flawed since their inception.

“These people who attacked us had reasons, which are widely supported — in fact, vigorously promoted by the regimes from which they came,” Codevilla said. “The Saudi regime, which we count as an ally, does in fact harbor the most virulent strain of Islam, the Wahhabism. This movement inspired most of the hijackers in 9/11. The others, some of the leaders, were inspired by the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt, which the Obama administration has been courting and favoring.”

Rather than confronting the movement of Islamic radicalization, Codevilla says that both Barack Obama and George W. Bush blamed acts of terrorism on the perpetrators themselves, instead of viewing them as the incarnations of a murderously ideological movement.

“The Bush administration gave the impression that we were merely dealing with rogue groups, not people supported by major movements which in their turn are supported by major countries,” Codevilla said. “American policy after 9/11 was wrong primarily in giving the American people the impression that those outrages had not been performed by Muslims pursuing Muslim agendas, but by rogues — amorphous rogues who were acting for essentially insane reasons.”

Once that impression had coalesced, Codevilla argued, it lead to a paradigm shift in policy making mindsets that has had serious consequences on the constitutional freedoms of the American people, a “lockdown” of the U.S. This in turn, Codevilla says, has resulted in a breakdown in the trust between citizens and the state — and a breakdown in trust between individual citizens.

Obama admin unilaterally changes law to allow immigrants with ‘limited’ terror contact into US,"The Obama administration has issued new exemptions to a law that bars certain asylum-seekers and refugees who provided “limited material support” to terrorists who are believed to pose no threat from the U.S.

The Department of Homeland Security and the State Department published the new exemptions Wednesday in the Federal Register to narrow a ban in the Immigration and Nationality Act excluding refugees and asylum seekers who had provided limited material support, no matter how minor, to terrorists.

“These exemptions cover five kinds of limited material support that have adversely and unfairly affected refugees and asylum seekers with no tangible connection to terrorism: material support that was insignificant in amount or provided incidentally in the course of everyday social, commercial, family or humanitarian interactions, or under significant pressure,” a DHS official explained to The Daily Caller.

Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson and Secretary of State John Kerry signed the exemptions.

DHS contends that the law change is “commonsense” and that immigration procedures will remain the same in other respects.

“In addition to rigorous background vetting, including checks coordinated across several government agencies, these exemptions will only be applied on a case-by-case basis after careful review and all security checks have cleared,” the official added. “This exemption process is vital to advancing the U.S. government’s twin goal of protecting the world’s most vulnerable persons while ensuring U.S. national security and public safety.”

While the administration says the rule change is reasonable, former State Department official and current director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration StudiesJessica Vaughan questioned the administration’s right to unilaterally change the law.

“[T]here is a very legitimate question as to whether the administration actually has the authority to change the law in this way,” Vaughan wrote in an email to TheDC. “It seems to me that they are announcing that they will be disregarding yet another law written by Congress that they don’t like and are replacing it with their own guidelines, which in this case appear to be extremely broad and vague, and which are sure to be exploited by those seeking to game our generous refugee admissions program.”

According to DHS, Section 212(d)(3)(B) of the INA allows either the secretary of state or DHS secretary in consultation with each other and with the U.S. Attorney General “to determine that certain terrorism bars of the INA do not apply.”*

While Vaughan conceded that there are a number of immigrants seeking protection who have been denied due to unintentional contact with terrorists, she sees the exemptions as likely another opportunity for people to get around the system. (RELATED: Is spotty immigration enforcement to blame for MS-13 gang havoc?)

“If the recent past is any guide, those evaluating these cases will be ordered to ignore red flags in the applications, especially if the applicant is supported by one of the many advocacy groups that have the ear of senior DHS staff,” she explained. “The administration already approves of the admission of gang members as asylees and criminals in the DACA program and grants of prosecutorial discretion, so I don’t expect them to be troubled by the admission of terrorists and garden variety fraudsters in our refugee program. This is how we end up with families like the Tsarnaev brothers [the Boston marathon bombers], who were originally admitted for political asylum.”

On the other side of the spectrum, Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy cheered the changes to that law passed by Congress following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

According to Leahy’s office, the senator has been pushing for such exemptions for years.

“The existing interpretation was so broad as to be unworkable. It resulted in deserving refugees and asylees being barred from the United States for actions so tangential and minimal that no rational person would consider them supporters of terrorist activities,” the Vermont Democrat said in a statement. “These changes help return our nation to its historic role as a welcoming sanctuary to the world’s most vulnerable populations. It is long past time to return common-sense to our refugee and asylum laws and these new exemptions are an important step in that process.”

There are the types of asylum or refugee status seekers who would have been previously barred from entering the U.S., according to DHS include:

1) Individuals who provided small or inconsequential amounts of support without an intent to further any terrorist or violent activities, such as a refugee who gave a bowl of rice to a member of an opposition group. 2) Individuals who, in the ordinary course of business transactions or social or family interactions, have incidentally provided support with no intent of abetting violent or terrorist activity. For instance, an owner of a restaurant who serves food to any paying customer, even though he knows some of them are members of an opposition group; or a mother or father who-as any parent would-fed and clothed their young adult child, even when they knew their child is part of a resistance movement. 3) Individuals who have provided certain humanitarian assistance – for example, an aid worker who handed out bottled water and blankets to victims of a natural disaster or those displaced by civil conflict, some of whom happen to be members of an opposition group. 4) Individuals who have provided support under significant pressure that does not quite rise to the level of duress (for which there are already exemptions in place), but that is significant enough that anyone in the same situation would see no reasonable alternative and would do the same. We have seen, for example, a farmer who regularly pays a toll to a resistance group in order to cross a bridge to take his food to market, or a Syrian refugee who pays an opposition group to gain safe passage out of Syria.

Vaughan pointed out that in some cases, only the word of the individual would be used to make a determination.

“In my experience as a former State Dept. consular official, I know that there are some qualified applicants that get excluded because we cannot be sure if they are truly associated with terrorist or criminal groups, but it is better to err on the side of caution when it comes to national security and public safety,” she explained. “After all, there are usually other resettlement options for these people – they don’t have to come to the U.S., even if that’s what they want.”

And while the changes will affect those seeking protection in the short term, the manner in which the Obama administration changed the law will not be lost on Republican skeptics of immigration reform in the long term.

“This glaring end-run around Congress underscores that immigration reform is doomed to failure,” a Senate GOP aide told TheDC.

Secretary Hillary — Now Decrying ‘Terrorism’ — Refused To Call Boko Haram A Terror Group,"Since the kidnapping of nearly 300 girls, Hillary Clinton has risen to the fore of those demanding international action and calling Nigerian group Boko Haram terrorists.

But during her tenure at the head of the U.S. Department of State, Clinton resisted numerous calls from the CIA, the FBI, the Department of Justice and a number of U.S. senators and congressmen to do just that.

On Sunday, Clinton tweeted:

Access to education is a basic right & an unconscionable reason to target innocent girls. We must stand up to terrorism. #BringBackOurGirls — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 4, 2014

And on Wednesday, Clinton called the kidnappings and threat to sell the girls for $12 each, “an act of terrorism and it really merits the fullest response possible, first and foremost from the government of Nigeria.”

The government of Nigeria, itself a human right abuser, may be somewhat behind Clinton’s refusal to designate the church-bombing, anti-education, al-Qaida-harboring terror group on the official list, The Daily Beast Reports: “Several officials said that the Nigerian government was opposed to the designation and [Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie] Carson was focused on preserving the relationship between Washington and Abuja,” Josh Rogin writes.

Early urging from the intelligence community and Congress to designate the group came after the 2011 bombing of the United Nations HQ in Abuja.

Carson was the most vocal critic of placing Boko Haram on the list. Being placed on the list expands the U.S.’s ability to thwart the group through Patriot Act powers, and by cutting off dealings with all U.S. businesses, thereby making it toxic for other countries’ businesses to deal with the group. Designation is not, however, the only means of fighting organizations.

When Clinton was still in charge, the State Department went so far as to lobby against the Boko Haram Terrorist Designation Act of 2013, introduced by a number of senators to force a designation of explanation, The Daily Beast reports.

Carson stood by the previous decision to not designate Boko Haram a terror group in a Wednesday press call, saying, ““There was a concern that putting Boko Haram on the foreign terrorist list would in fact raise its profile, give it greater publicity, give it greater credibility, help in its recruitment, and also probably drive more assistance in its direction.”

Ten months into his tenure at the helm of the State Department, John Kerry added the group to the list. The designation cited murderous campaigns against civilians, the bombing of the U.N. building, and ties to al-Qaida — all things recognized by the U.S. government during Clinton’s time as secretary of state.

Clinton allegedly made women’s rights, including access to education, a priority for her State Department.

Report: ISIS Planning Imminent Terror Attack At U.S. Border,"The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria is reportedly working with al-Qaida to carry out a terror attack on the U.S.-Mexico border in the very near future, according to a government watchdog.

Sources told Judicial Watch the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria is definitely operating along the Mexican border in Ciudad Juarez alongside al-Qaida, and one source said officials have picked up radio chatter about an imminent “attack on the border.”

“It’s coming soon,” the source told Judicial Watch.

High-level federal enforcement and other sources confirmed to Judicial Watch that a bulletin was sent out to a number of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense agencies warning that ISIS and other terrorists are operating in Juarez, where they are planning an imminent attack on the U.S. with car bombs and other vehicle born improvised explosives.

One source told Judicial Watch the commanding general at Ft. Bliss, the U.S. Army post in El Paso, is being briefed on the situation. And agents in Homeland Security, Justice and Defense agencies have been placed on high alert and told to aggressively work all possible leads and sources concerning the threat, Judicial Watch reports.

Rampant crime is bad in Juarez, and as recently as a few days ago, the U.S. issued travel warnings to anyone planning to visit.

Obama Admin Spends Christmas Trying To Get Islamist Groups Off Terror List [VIDEO],"The Obama administration spent Christmas week trying to get two Islamist organizations off a foreign country’s terror list.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations and the Muslim American Society are both listed as Islamist organizations by the Islamist Money In Politics database, which tracks copious political spending by figures linked to the groups. The Muslim American Society was founded as an American-based Muslim Brotherhood front group.

CAIR and MAS representatives met with “senior U.S. government officials” just days before Christmas to discuss the groups’ inclusion on the United Arab Emirates’ official list of terrorist organizations.

“The two American Muslim organizations and the U.S. government pledged to work together to achieve a positive solution to the UAE designations,” the groups said in a joint statement.

The Obama administration’s State Department recently “affirmed that department officials meet regularly with representatives of CAIR and MAS,” according to the groups.

Boko Haram Carries Out Second-Bloodiest Terror Attack In Modern History,"Boko Haram slaughtered as many as 2,000 people in an orgy of violence while the world watched news about a jihadi massacre and ensuing siege in Paris.

The attack in Baga, Nigeria is now the second-deadliest terrorist attack in modern history, behind the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.

Survivors reported seeing “bodies in the street” and said “the whole town was on fire.”

The majority of casualties were “children, women and elderly people who could not run fast enough,” local officials told The Associated Press. Another official told the BBC the city is now “virtually non-existent.”

Amnesty International has corroborated the 2,000-person death toll estimate, and many thousands have been driven into adjacent areas, fleeing for their lives.

The group raided a military base in the area less than a week ago, with Nigerian, Cameroonian and Chadian soldiers running away rather than standing their ground. (RELATED: Boko Haram Storms International Base)

Unlike many terrorist groups, Boko Haram is completely indiscriminate in its destruction, killing Muslims, Christians and anyone else that stands in its path. It justifies attacks against Muslims by calling them “infidels” who fail to meet its own standards for Islamic behavior.

Baga lies in a region near Lake Chad, where some drowned as they tried to escape. Boko Haram has controlled swathes of Nigeria’s north for years, most famously kidnapping a group of over 200 schoolgirls in April of 2014.

The Nigerian government, whose power is concentrated in the country’s south, has been largely unable to deter the organization’s advances, distracted by a declining economy and an upcoming election.

Terror Widow Flees To Syria As New Paris Jihadi Facts Emerge,"Turkey’s foreign minister confirmed Monday that Hayat Boumedienne, the romantic partner of French terrorist Amedy Coulibaly, had been in Turkey before last week’s Islamic terror attacks in Paris.

She reportedly fled to Syria on Thursday, shortly before Coulibaly seized hostages in a kosher grocery store.

Boumedienne reportedly entered Turkey on a flight from Madrid on Jan. 2. She is suspected to have helped plan Coulibaly’s siege of the store, and perhaps also Thursday’s shooting of a Paris policewoman.

A video has surfaced of Coulibaly, a French-born citizen of Senegalese descent, pledging allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The video was apparently made after Thursday’s attack, but before the siege on Friday where police killed Coulibaly.

The extent to which Coulibaly and Boumedienne coordinated their actions with Charlie Hebdo attackers Saïd and Chérif Kouachi remains unclear: as Coulibaly said in his video, the attack on the magazine was “a bit together, a bit separate.”

The Kouachi brothers have been linked to al-Qaida training operations in Yemen, as well as a decade-old French recruiting network for al-Qaida in Iraq. Given the rivalry between al-Qaida and the Islamic State terror group, it is unlikely that last week’s events in Paris were coordinated by the leadership of the two groups.

However, terrorism analyst Clint Watts has pointed out that the “amorphous connections” between the two groups indicate a trend toward a more unpredictable model of global jihad: “a loose social movement” that contains numerous participating and sometimes rival groups. While certain terrorist attacks may be “directed” by organizations’ central leaders, others are likelier to be “networked” by veterans of overseas jihadi battles, or simply “inspired” by foreign terrorist groups.

Turkey’s often-porous border with chaotic Syria, which Boumedienne crossed on Thursday, has been nicknamed “the jihadi trail.” Originating in a Turkish policy meant to support opponents of President Bashar al-Assad, the unenforced flow of fighters into Syria has in recent years become almost exclusively a pipeline for ISIS and other radical organizations.

Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu has denied his country’s complicity in the attacks in France.

Jimmy Carter Blames Recent Terror Attacks On ‘Palestinian Problem’,"When in doubt, blame Israel — at least that seems to be the habit of America’s least respected former president.

In the wake of the Islamist terror attacks in France against cartoonists and Jews, former President Jimmy Carter’s first reaction was to pin the motivation for such terrorism on Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians. Appearing on “The Daily Show” Monday, Carter was asked by host Jon Stewart whether the violence the world saw on the streets of Paris was actually fueled by something else other than Islamic extremism.

“Well, one of the origins for it is the Palestinian problem,” Carter replied. “And this aggravates people who are affiliated in any way with the Arab people who live in the West Bank and Gaza, what they are doing now — what’s being done to them. So I think that’s part of it.”

Carter didn’t explain how solving the Israeli-Palestinian issue would in any way resolve the violent conflicts currently engulfing the Arab world, including the Syrian civil war, the Islamic State’s takeover of part of Iraq and its brutal implementation of Islamic law, and the conflict between the Egyptian government and the Muslim Brotherhood, just to name a few. Nor did he detail how the “Palestinian problem” helps explain why three French Muslims murdered innocent French Jews buying groceries for the coming Sabbath and cartoonists preparing the next issue of their paper. (READ: The Truth About Muslim Violence)

Carter did go on to warn that the world is witnessing “a new evolutionary development in terrorism.”

“But I think this is a new evolutionary development in terrorism, where people go into Syria, they get trained there, they have a passport from France, from Great Britain or from the United States,” he added. “They stay there for a few months and learn how to be a terrorist and then they come back through Turkey and you know they have been there and you know who they are. And I think this event in Paris is going to waken up the people in charge of security to watch those people more closely than they have in the past — and not single out all of the Muslims in the country.”

"Once Again, Obama Statement On Terror Victims Doesn’t Mention That They’re Christians","Once again, President Barack Obama has released a statement denouncing a mass terror attack on persecuted Christians, without mentioning the fact that they were killed for their faith.

When 21 Coptic Christians were beheaded by ISIS in February, the president’s statement condemning their deaths did not mention they were killed for their faith. Later, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said he “[couldn’t] account for” the omission.

When nearly 150 students at a Kenyan university were massacred on Friday, the Islamist terrorists affiliated with al-Shabaab separated the Christians from the Muslims, killing only the Christians. But in Obama’s statement condemning the slaughter, once again there was no mention of the fact that the students were killed for their faith:

Michelle and I join the American people in expressing our horror and sadness at the reports coming out of Garissa, Kenya. Words cannot adequately condemn the terrorist atrocities that took place at Garissa University College, where innocent men and women were brazenly and brutally massacred. We join the world in mourning them, many of whom were students pursuing an education in the pursuit of a better life for themselves and their loved ones. They represented a brighter future for a region that has seen too much violence for far too long. We also commend the heroism of the responders who lost their lives in the selfless protection of the students and faculty. I know firsthand the extraordinary resilience and fundamental decency of the people of Kenya. So I know that the people of Garissa and all of Kenya will grieve, but their determination to achieve a better and more secure future will not be deterred. And neither will the resolve of the United States. We will stand hand-in-hand with the Kenyan Government and people against the scourge of terrorism and in their efforts to bring communities together. This much is clear: the future of Kenya will not be defined by violence and terror; it will be shaped by young people like those at Garissa University College – by their talents, their hopes, and their achievements. This is a message I will relay to the Kenyan people when I visit Kenya in July. Even at this difficult hour, the Kenyan people should know they have an unwavering friend and ally in the United States of America.

Secretary of State John Kerry likewise did not mention any religious overtones to the attack.

The United States strongly condemns al-Shabaab’s terrorist attack on Garissa University College in Kenya today. We extend our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of the innocent victims who were killed in the attack. We also direct our thoughts to the many who sustained injuries. The United States stands resolutely with the government and people of Kenya in the effort to end the scourge of terrorism. The attack once again reinforces the need for all countries and communities to unite in the effort to combat violent extremism.

But just like Earnest’s confusion over the omission in February, Deputy White House Press Secretary Eric Schultz seemingly didn’t realize the omission the following day. “I hope you saw our statement yesterday on that,” he said during a press conference. ” We extend — we condemn in the strongest possible terms the terrorist attack, and we extend our deep condolences to the families and all the loved ones killed in this heinous attack, which reportedly included the targeted of Christian students.”

The White House has received a great deal of criticism for its constant refusal to adopt religious language when denouncing terrorism. White House press officers refuse to use the term “Islamic terrorism” when referring to groups such as ISIS, and Obama claimed in an interview that the terror attack on a Paris kosher deli was “random.”

Report: TSA Failed To ID 73 Aviation Workers Who Were On Terror Watch Lists,"The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) failed to vet 73 aviation workers who were on terror watch lists, according to a Department of Homeland Security inspector general’s report released Monday.

The report is the second major blow against the agency in as many weeks. Last week, the details of another inspector’s general report were leaked. The report found that TSA screeners failed to identify explosives and weapons in 67 out of 70 test screenings conducted at a dozen U.S. airports.

While Monday’s report called TSA’s screening measures “generally effective,” the inspector general stated that the agency had “less effective” controls in place to ensure that aviation workers did not have criminal records and terror-related red flags. The agency also was not properly equipped to screen out applicants who did not have legal authorization to work in the U.S.

“Our testing showed that TSA did not identify 73 individuals with terrorism-related category codes because TSA is not authorized to receive all terrorism-related information under current intraagency watchlisting policy,” the report reads, noting that the workers were employed by major airliners, airport vendors and other employers.

According to the report, the 73 workers with terror backgrounds were identified out of 900,000 active aviation workers using the National Counterterrorism Center’s Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) system.

The report includes a table showing which terrorism codes applied to the 73 aviation workers, but it is redacted.

The reason for the knowledge gap is that TSA is not privy to some codes which are part of the “watchlist extract” included in the TIDE system. In order to include the new terrorism-related codes, DHS must issue a formal request to the Watchlisting Interagency Policy Committee.

Screening for aviation workers on terror watch lists was hindered in other ways, according to the report.

While airports are responsible for providing identifying information for aviation employees, the information is often incomplete. And that is a problem because of a TSA security directive which requires that the agency only initiate a security threat assessment for employees whose profiles have complete information.

The inspector general found that 87,000 aviation workers did not have a social security number listed on their employee profiles. Nearly 75,000 immigrant aviation workers did not have passport numbers listed. Another 14,000 immigrant employees did not have alien registration numbers.

In addition, the report notes that TSA had independently determined that airports were not providing all known aliases during the vetting process.

“Complete and accurate aliases are important to the accuracy and effectiveness of TSA’s vetting processes,” the report reads.

TSA agreed with most of the reports findings.

US Airstrike In Libya Reportedly Kills Terror Leader,"The Libyan government Sunday said al-Qaida connected terror leader Mokhtar Belmokhtar was killed in an American airstrike.

Belmokhtar was the former leader of al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, and had been charged in 2013 by federal prosecutors over his involvement in the Algerian gas plant raid that same year, which ended with 37 hostages, including three American, dead.

The raid and subsequent hostage-taking occurred in retaliation over continued French use of Algerian airspace to attack terrorists in Mali.

Belmokhtar had also been known as,”Mr. Marlboro,” in reference to the large-scale cigarette smuggling operation he used to fund his Jihad.

A U.S official confirmed to CNN that the one-eyed Belmokhtar was the target of the manned aircraft operation. The source, unlike Libyan officials, wouldn’t confirm his death, saying U.S operatives are still assessing the outcome of the operation.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2015/06/14/us-airstrike-in-libya-reportedly-kills-terror-leader/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj4usaMgLT9AhXKFFkFHTSgCAQ4UBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw2DISb2faZxniIgvHLESZjf,2015-06-14
Former CIA Head: ‘I Wouldn’t Be Surprised’ If Terror Attack Hits U.S. Over 4th Of July Weekend [VIDEO],"Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell said Monday that he “wouldn’t be surprised” if there’s a terrorist attack over the upcoming 4th of July weekend.

In an appearance on “CBS This Morning,” Morell spoke about the possibility of a terrorist attack, which the FBI and Department of Homeland Security have mentioned after attacks in Tunisia, France and Kuwait.

“This one really resonates with me for two reasons,” Morell said. “One is there’s been about 50 people in the last 12 months who have been arrested in the United States for being radicalized by ISIS, wanting to go fight there or wanting to conduct an attack here, so there’s a lot of people out there who are seeing themselves as aligned with ISIS, number one.”

“Number two, you have this ISIS call to arms during Ramadan,” Morell said. “We are right in the middle of Ramadan, call to arms, conduct attacks against our enemies, so I’m worried about this one.”

“I don’t want to tell Americans what to do or what not to do, but…I wouldn’t be surprised if we’re sitting here a week from today talking about an attack over the weekend in the United States,” he told co-host Norah O’Donnell. “That’s how serious this is.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2015/06/29/former-cia-head-i-wouldnt-be-surprised-if-terror-attack-hits-u-s-over-4th-of-july-weekend-video/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwil45qNgLT9AhU5K1kFHZI1Al84WhAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw2D0XrY3Ab42BuLnL6RTzmt,2015-06-29
‘Whiteness’ Is ‘Terror’ Professor Lands At Fancypants College That’s 77 PERCENT WHITE,"The sociology professor who used her now-protected Twitter account to announce that white people are synonymous with “terror” and to define the Confederate flag as “the ultimate symbol” of capitalism has accepted a position on the faculty at Rhodes College.

The professor, Zandria Robinson, was formerly on the faculty at the University of Memphis in Memphis, Tenn.

Rhodes College is a private bastion of the liberal arts also located in Memphis. The fancypants school enrolls “students of color” at a rate of 23 percent. Thus, 77 percent of the students are white.

“Whiteness is certainly and most inevitably terror,” Robinson proclaimed in a June 26 tweet.

Students enrolled at Rhodes enjoy a lovely, leafy, pseudo-Gothic campus surrounded by upscale homes. An art museum, the Memphis Zoo and one of the best golf courses in the city are all just across the street.

Tuition, fees and room and board at Rhodes run roughly $55,300 per year. By way of comparison, the annual household income in Memphis is $36,817, according to Sperling’s Best Places.

Robinson’s rancorous statements on Twitter brought her substantial notoriety earlier this week. In addition to her claims that “whiteness” “is” “terror” and that the Confederate flag is “the ultimate symbol of heteropatriarchal capitalism,” Robinson also declared that “white folks” believe politeness provides immunity from her biting analysis of power structures based on race. (RELATED: Professor: ‘Whiteness’ Is ‘Terror,’ Confederate Flag Represents ‘Capitalism’)

In a statement issued on Wednesday, officials at Rhodes offered extravagant praise for Robinson, reports Memphis CBS affiliate WREG.

“As a leading scholar and author in the areas of race, class, gender, culture, and the South, Dr. Zandria Robinson’s comments are sometimes provocative, controversial, and debatable,” the statement asserted.

“Dr. Robinson was hired for a faculty position in the Rhodes Anthropology & Sociology Department that calls for expertise in particular areas, specifically gender studies and social movements.” the statement effusively claimed. “Her expertise in these areas, her extensive understanding of the complex problems of race in American society, her deep roots in the Memphis area, and many years of successful teaching experience, made her an attractive candidate for the position.”

The top brass at Rhodes also said students appreciated Robinson’s “ability to challenge them to think about society with fresh eyes” during a 2008-2009 stint at Rhodes.

Rhodes administrators further praised their school “as a place where intellectual engagement and the exchange of ideas are among our highest priorities.”

When the kerfuffle over Robinson’s bizarre tweets broke out, officials at the University of Memphis quickly noted that Robinson no longer worked at the taxpayer-funded state school, despite the fact that the University of Memphis website contained a page clearly calling Robinson a faculty member.

School officials removed that information at some point after The Daily Caller and other sources publicized Robinson’s Twitter activity.

As of Thursday morning, however, Robinson’s curriculum vitae still resided on the University of Memphis website, listing her contact information as:

University of Memphis

Department of Sociology

231 Clement Hall

Memphis, TN 38152

Phone: (901) 678-3778

E-mail: zandria.robinson@memphis.edu

In any case, Robinson tweeted that she was not fired from the University of Memphis.

Around the same time, she also set her tweets to protected status.

When her Twitter account was public, Robinson described herself as this way: “Dirty South black feminist sociologist. Zora-type ethnographer. Some babies’ mama. Negressdamus. Norf Memphis Teacake’s wife. Never in no particular order.”

Rhodes College was last in the news because leaders of ISIS, also called the Islamic State, had called on followers to assassinate a Rhodes professor in their propaganda magazine. The religious studies professor on the radical Muslim group’s hit list is is Yasir Qadhi. He is also the resident scholar at the Memphis Islamic Center.

"Obama Administration Granted Asylum And Residency To 1,519 Foreigners With Terror Ties","The Obama administration granted asylum to more than 1,500 foreigners with ties to terrorist organizations last year because they were deemed to have provided support to the groups “while under duress.”

The figures are contained in an annual report that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) sent to Congress this month. The conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained the report and published it online Tuesday.

During fiscal year 2014, USCIS applied exemptions to 1,519 foreigners with ties to terrorist organizations who applied for discretionary relief. Of that total, 806 of the foreigners granted discretionary relief were for refugee applicants while another 614 were applicants for lawful permanent resident status.

Of the 1,519 with terrorist associations, 627 provided material support, “while under duress,” to undesignated terrorist groups. Another 189 provided material support, “while under duress,” to designated terrorist groups.

Designated terrorist groups are the most dangerous. They are classified as Tier I and Tier II organizations and include groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, al-Qaeda and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

Nine foreigners granted relief received military-type training, “while under duress,” from terrorist groups; 28 provided voluntary medical care to members of terrorist groups; 37 were qualified aliens who had existing immigration benefits who had “provided material support to, solicited funds for, solicited individuals for membership in or received military-type training from Tier III terrorist organizations.

USCIS asserts that applicants are thoroughly vetted and pose no terrorist threat to the U.S. Applicants’ names and fingerprints are compared against terrorist watch lists. Following that process, individual applicants are reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Department of Homeland Security.

Such applicants would have been rejected prior to Feb. 2014, according to Judicial Watch. That’s when the Obama administration announced that DHS could exercise discretion whether to grant asylum to aliens “who provided limited material support.”

“Before the Obama administration tweaked a federal law last year, these foreign nationals would have been banned from the country for supporting terrorist causes,” Judicial Watch asserts.

“The bottom line is that the U.S. government is allowing them all to stay in the country with rights and benefits afforded to legal residents despite their terrorist connections and associations,” the watchdog argues.

NY Daily News Writer Has History Of Blaming Terror Victims,"New York Daily News writer Linda Stasi this weekend blamed one of the San Bernardino shooting victims for his own death because of his vocal opposition to Islamic extremism. The allegation is in character for Stasi, who has a habit of shifting the blame for terrorist attacks away from the terrorists themselves and onto critics of Islamic extremism instead.

When terrorists attacked Paris newspaper Charlie Hebdo last May–slaughtering 17 people in the process–Stasi responded by arguing that solidarity with the victims was misplaced because the newspaper had published cartoons of the prophet Muhammed. “American journalists and American citizens actually don’t tolerate hateful, anti-religious bigotry,” Stasi wrote at the time. “No, we don’t kill over it, but we sure as hell don’t tolerate it either,” she continued.

Later in the column, Stasi–who once claimed that the NRA was more of a terror threat to Americans than ISIS–pointed out that Charlie Hebdo had satirized the “same movie that was believed to have prompted the deadly attack on the American embassy in Benghazi.” (The Benghazi attacks, in Hillary Clinton’s own words, had nothing to do with the film Stasi refers to in her column.)

Similarly, Stasi blamed political activist Pamela Geller for an attack by a pair of Islamic extremists at a “Draw Muhammed” contest in Texas last May. Stasi claimed that Geller–who organized the contest–was no different from ISIS. “Geller, like ISIS and al Qaeda, revel in hate and nothing would make any of them happier than to be the catalyst for the killing of hundreds of innocent Americans to prove a point,” Stasi wrote. “Don’t think for a minute that violence isn’t what she, just like the murderers of ISIS, want,” Stasi went on to say.

Later in that same column, Stasi again blasted the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack, arguing that their “pornographic cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed led to the slaughter of 17 people by maniacal Muslims in Paris.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2015/12/07/ny-daily-news-writer-has-history-of-blaming-terror-victims/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjtw_OLgLT9AhUnkokEHULfDkc4RhAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw37Zh96rqF6GHsoUZr2z_Jc,2015-12-07
Finland Charges Two Refugees With Terror Murder Of 11,"Finland charged two 23-year-old Iraqi refugees Friday morning with a terror-related murder of 11 people, after they were allegedly spotted in an Islamic State (ISIS) execution video from 2014.

The execution video shows victims lying on the ground getting shot one by one by unmasked shooters. The men were detained Thursday and were charged Friday morning based on a probable cause. They both plead not guilty.

The executions were part of the June 2014 ISIS Camp Speicher massacre of unarmed Iraqi air force cadets near Tikrit, which is believed to have taken more than 1,000 lives.

They arrived in Finland as refugees in September. Detective Jari Räty declined to comment on whether or not they had filed asylum applications.

The arrests caused a bit of panic around Finland Thursday. Finland has taken 32,000 refugees so far in 2015.

“Of course we need to react in a condemning matter and distance ourselves from these actions, but we shouldn’t overreact,” Mats Fridlund, researcher on the history of science and technology of terrorism at the University of Aalto, told public broadcaster YLE. “We need to keep in mind that the terrorists want us to overreact. That’s the way terrorist measure their influence. If we change our behavior we give them power.”

Whistleblower: Feds Shut Down Terror Investigation That Could Have Prevented San Bernardino Attack,"A former Department of Homeland Security agent says that an investigation he was conducting into a fundamentalist Islamic group operating in the U.S. may have helped stop San Bernardino jihadi Syed Farook had the government not shut down his probe.

During an interview with Fox News’ Megyn Kelly on Thursday, Philip Haney said that in 2012 as an agent with U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s National Targeting Center, he opened an investigation into a Sunni Islamic group called, Tablighi Jamaat, a subset of the fundamentalist Deobandi movement.

But Haney said that just a year into the investigation it was shut down by the State Department and the Homeland Security Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

The reason the investigation was quashed? Because the federal government did not want to profile Islamic groups, Haney told Kelly.

In the process of shutting down Haney’s inquiry, the feds also deleted his files, which included information on an organization with ties to Farook’s mosque, San Bernardino’s Deobandi movement-affiliated Dar-al-Uloom al-Islamia.

And Farook’s wife and accomplice, Tashfeen Malik, went to school at Pakistan’s al-Huda, which also has ties to the Deobandi movement.

As the global intelligence group Stratfor has reported, Talighi Jamaat has been linked to a number of attempted terrorist attacks targeting the U.S.

Members of the sect were tied to the Oct. 2002 Portland Seven case and the Sept. 2002 Lackawanna Six case. Members were also involved in an Aug. 2006 plot to bomb airliners en route from London to the U.S. and attempted bombings in London and Glasgow, Scotland in July 2007. Stratfor also reported that Talighi Jamaat affiliates were involved in the July 7, 2005 bombings. That attack left 52 dead and more than 700 injured.

Haney said that had his investigation been allowed to develop, Farook may have ended up on the federal government’s terror radar or on the government’s no-fly list. And if that had occurred, Farook would not have been able to connect with Malik. The jihadists reportedly met in 2013. She came to the U.S. from Saudi Arabia last year on a fiancee visa and married soon after.

“Either Syed would have been put on the no-fly list because association with that mosque, and/or the K-1 visa that his wife was given may have been denied because of his association with a known organization,” Haney told Kelly.

Haney turned whistleblower in 2013 after meeting with DHS’ inspector general. In turn, DHS and the Justice Department investigated him, though found no wrongdoing, The Federalist reported.

In September 2014, Haney had his security clearance revoked as well as his access to work databases.

According to Fox’s Trace Gallagher, the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the story but said that Haney’s story is missing many details.

Haney’s claim comes amid reports that investigators believe that Farook was in the same social circle as a Riverside, Calif., man who was arrested in 2012 in a plot to recruit for al-Qaida. That recruiter, Soheil Kabir, was convicted of providing material support to terrorists and sentenced to 25 years in prison.

Farook had reportedly planned an attack in 2012 but got spooked after that recruiting ring was busted.

"Iran Setting Up Terror Networks In The US, Says Israel Defense Minister","Israel’s Minister of Defense claimed that Iran is setting up a global terror network which is poised to commit attacks on the U.S. and Europe on command.

Moshe Ya’alon warned that the “sleeper cells” being set up by Iran are collecting weapons, intelligence and gathering operatives on Wednesday while on a trip to Cyprus. He believes that Iran is creating “emissaries” intended to spread the Islamic revolution worldwide.

“The Iranian regime through the Iranian Revolutionary Guard corps is building a complex terror infrastructure including sleeping cells that are stockpiling arms, intelligence and operatives and are ready to act on order including in Europe and America,” said Ya’alon.

He noted that the Syrian civil war has created “widespread infiltration by murderous, merciless terror organizations.”

Ya’alon noted that in addition to creating terrorist cells, Iran has created a “dangerous axis” across various cities in the Middle East, including the capitals of Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq.

While Ya’alon offered no new evidence to back up his claim, Iran’s financing and support of terrorist groups like Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Palestinian Hamas have been well known for some time. Additionally, concern over Iran’s influence in Iraq and its continued support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, in conjunction with Russia, has drawn concern over officials and experts alike.

Former U.S. ambassador to Iraq James Jeffrey has referred to the Iran-Russia-Syria alliance as the “number one problem in the whole region.”

Iran’s coalition countering Western interests in the Middle East has been referred to as the ‘Axis of Resistance.’ The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington, D.C.-based think-tank, has defined it as a group of “state and non-state actors” led by Iran that includes Hezbollah and various other predominantly Shia militant groups.

In a piece for the Daily Beast published in September, James Miller claimed that the ‘Axis of Resistance’ now includes Russia, Syria, Iran, Iraq and Hezbollah given Russia’s continued bombing campaigns in Syria. This group has also been referred to as the ‘4+1 alliance,’ which was supposedly secretly created in September when all parties agreed to cooperate militarily and politically in Iraq and Syria.

Obama Responds To Brussels Terror Attacks … ‘Whatever’ [VIDEO],"Speaking in Havana, Cuba Tuesday, President Obama said the United States will “do whatever is necessary” to bring the culprits behind the Brussels terrorist attacks to justice.

“Before I begin, please indulge me,” Obama said to the crowd. “I want to comment on the terrorist attacks that have taken place in Brussels.”

Obama only spent 52 seconds of his speech talking about the attacks in Belgium.

“The thoughts and prayers of the American people are with the people of Belgium,” he continued. “And we stand in solidarity with them in condemning these outrageous attacks against innocent people.”

“We will do whatever is necessary to support our friend and ally, Belgium, in bringing to justice those who are responsible, and this is yet another reminder that the world must unite.”

“We must be together, regardless of nationality, or race, or faith, in fighting against the scourge of terrorism,” he added. “We can and we will defeat those who threaten the safety and security of people all around the world.”

ACLU Lawyers Blame Christians For Orlando Terror Attack,"Several American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) attorneys took to Twitter to blame the “Christian Right” for Sunday’s deadly terrorist attack at a nightclub in Orlando, Fla., which left 50 dead and 53 injured.

Chase Strangio, a staff attorney with the ACLU’s LGBT and AIDS Project, claimed the social and political environment cultivated by Christian conservatives in recent months was to blame for the shooting at Pulse, a nightclub popular with Orlando’s LGBT community.

Strangio also called for solidarity between American Muslims and LGBT communities, arguing both are maligned and oppressed by the religious right.

Federal law enforcement officials have identified Omar Mateen, of Port St. Lucie, Fla., as the alleged shooter. Mateen’s father told NBC news his son harbored anti-gay sentiments, and said his son gave voice to those feelings recently during a trip to Miami, where he saw two men kissing.

Another ACLU attorney, Eunice Hyon Min Rho, who specializes in election and religious liberty law, impugned the motives of Republican lawmakers who expressed sympathy for the victims, by pointing out many were sponsors of the First Amendment Defense Act, legislation the ACLU considers anti-LGBT.

She further characterized expressions of solidarity as “useless,” as many of the victims could be people of color, who she contends are regularly stigmatized by Republican legislators. Little demographic data is currently available about the victims, as many have not yet been identified.

She went on to retweet a user who claimed many public officials would use the auspices of an LGBT tragedy to pursue an “anti-Muslim agenda.”

The ACLU did not respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Update: Rho appears to have deleted her Twitter account. Multiple attempts to locate her account on the social media platform were unsuccessful.

Former Ambassador: Orlando Terror Attack Helps Trump ‘Change The Race’,"A former ambassador believes Sunday’s terrorist attack in Orlando that left 50 dead and 53 injured could make presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump the next president.

“If I were Donald Trump now I would have come out as soon as the FBI started to leak this morning that this is a terrorist operating from Islamic motivation with ties to — first of all the name itself, Omar Siddiqui Mateen, a Muslim name, son of immigrants from Afghanistan with whatever connection to Islamic extremist organizations, it already greatly influences the race for the presidency,” Michael Oren, Israel’s ambassador to America from 2009 to 2013, told a journalist Sunday.

Omar Mateen assaulted Pulse, a packed gay nightclub in Orlando, early Sunday before being killed by police. The attack is the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. Mateen was a Florida resident who a senior FBI official said might have had ties to Islamic State.

Oren states Trump could benefit politically by quietly pointing out Mateen’s possible ties to ISIS.

Trump’s initial response on Twitter to the Orlando attack didn’t mention the shooter’s name or Islam.

Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart & vigilant? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 12, 2016

Media outlet’s have predicted that a major terrorist attack could boost the real estate mogul’s campaign.

“You can bet that if any significant national-security threat is posed between now and November, Trump’s poll numbers will soar in the same way that Bush’s did in 2001,” Nick Bilton, a political correspondent for Vanity Fair, wrote in May. “And if that happens, God forbid, I’m willing to bet that he may be the next president of the United States.”

A terrorist attack in Brussels in March likely caused support for Trump to spike at a critical time during the Republican primaries and analysis by Nate Silver’s political and statistics blog FiveThirtyEight indicates that terror attacks have helped Trump politically.

Al Jazeera Readers Celebrate Orlando Terror Attack,"In the aftermath of the Orlando terror attack that left more than 50 people dead, Al Jazeera’s Arabic-language Facebook page was flooded with comments celebrating Omar Mateen as a hero for carrying out the attack.

The comments were first pointed out by Iraqi-born human rights activist Faisal Saeed AlMutar, who tweeted: “Go to Al Jazeera Arabic Facebook page and read the comments about the #Orlando attacks and you will see 1000s of people celebrating. #qatar.”

Pakistani-Canadian writer Ali Rizvi quickly followed up with a screenshot of the top comments on an Al Jazeera video about the Orlando attack. Rizvi included the caption: “Thousands at @AlJazeera Arabic FB page celebrating #Orlando attacks.”

One of the top comments in Rizvi’s screenshots (as translated by Facebook) celebrated how Mateen “slaughtered Jews and Americans.”

One of the current top comments on the video says: “God is great god welcome champ Omar the afghan,” according to Facebook’s translation of the original Arabic. Google translates the same phrase as: “God is great God bless you, hero Omar Afghan.”

Another popular comment reads: “God is great and the glory of God. God bless you, champ. God şlţ them. Your soldiers from his righteous jihad my sisters dear Lord follow me, and all our martyrs mujahideen all respect to Omar Afghan.”

“I swear the prettiest news I’ve heard in my life,” another commenter said.

Another commenter wished for a thousand men like Mateen.

Not all of the comments translated smoothly. Facebook translated the top comment, which has been liked 345 times, as saying: “A man with a thousand for it and legs of the provisions of the old Afghan Scabies fight these homosexuals filth.”

Not all commenters supported the terrorist attack.

“After the funeral of Muhammad Ali Clay and compassion and tolerance which has emerged within American society with Muslims come in this process to go back and make sure in the distortion of Islam,” one comment translated.

Another commenter worried that the terrorist attack would give Muslims “a bad reputation in front of the world.”

Most of the comments, however, were celebratory.

Gun Manufacturer Stocks Skyrocket Following Orlando Terror Attack,"The market value for two major gun manufacturers skyrocketed following the terror attack that claimed the lives of 49 victims in Orlando on Sunday.

According to Business Insider, Smith & Wesson shares jumped by as much as 11 percent when the market opened Monday morning. At the time of this article’s publication, the price had stabilized at $22.86 per share.

Similarly, Sturm, Ruger & Company saw an 8 percent gain and was trading at $62.68 at the time of publication.

Both companies saw similar trends following the San Bernardino terror attacks in late 2015.

On Sunday, terrorist Omar Mateen killed 49 and injured countless others after opening fire at the Pulse Nightclub shortly after 2 a.m. EST.

Both Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama drew attention to the “need to keep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals. (RELATED: White House Doesn’t Acknowledge Orlando Attack As Radical Islamic Terrorism)

Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump criticized both Clinton and Obama for spinning the incident as a gun control issue instead of actively confronting radical Islamic terrorism. (RELATED: Trump Respond to Orlando Terror Attacks)

Terror Expert: Obama Is Practically Guaranteeing Another Attack Before Election,"In an exclusive interview with The Daily Caller, foreign policy and terrorism expert Patrick Poole stated that the Obama administration’s counter-terrorism policies make it impossible for government agencies to prevent terror attacks and that the Orlando nightclub shooting will not be “the last attack on U.S. soil we’ll see before the election.”

Poole states that principles outlined in the Countering Violent Extremism doctrine — Obama’s politically correct guidelines that dictate how agencies conduct security operations — “border, if not pass, the line of criminal negligence.” (RELATED: DHS Instructed To Combat Violent Extremism With Political Correctness)

“In all three areas (below), by the White House’s own standards, the CVE has been a complete failure.”

Enhance engagement with local communities

Build government and law expertise for preventing violent extremism

Counter violent extremist propaganda

He argues that the “inability to identify the ideological drivers is a feature, not a bug, of CVE.” (VIDEO: FBI Director — ‘I Don’t Think’ We Could Have Prevented Orlando)

“It’s completely designed for that, to completely remove any ideological discussion or examination from anything doing with counterterrorism. That’s its purpose, so in that effect it’s the only thing about CVE that’s working.”

Poole pointed to the purging of FBI training materials and the dissolution of the State Department’s Center for Strategic Communications to illustrate the CVE’s serious shortcomings. (RELATED: Did FBI Training Material Purge Cause Agency To Drop The Ball On Orlando?)

“The Washington Post actually reported back in [December],” about the ineffectiveness of the CSS. “It’s such a fucking catastrophe, that they had to shut the whole thing down. They did an internal report about their effectiveness and found out it was worse than doing nothing. It was actually aiding the enemy.”

INCOMPETENCE AND PARTISAN POLITICS

Poole explicitly stated that the Obama Administration is not intentionally hampering America’s ability to effectively counter domestic terrorists.

Instead, he argues the flaws, inherent within White House policies, are produced by a combination of government officials’ incompetence and partisan politics.

“A lot of these people — I don’t want to say are dumb, they’re highly educated — they just have no fucking idea what they’re talking about,” he told TheDC. “There is a knowledge aspect, ‘well we don’t want to go make some sweeping statement about Islamic law,’ to which my immediate response is ‘what manuals of Islamic law, what Sharia have you actually read?’ They haven’t read any. That, in and of itself, is a professional failure to do their job.” (RELATED: Syrian Immigrant Who Said 9/11 ‘Changed The World For Good’ Is A Homeland Security Adviser)

“If they’re out speaking about this, and they say this isn’t something we need to worry about — and that they have no idea what’s actually in it — there’s a professional negligence in not doing that.”

Poole noted that popular Sharia texts, like “Reliance of the Traveler,” “are available in English. You can go to any Islamic bookstore and buy these things.”

Furthermore, the vehicle for properly identifying terrorist threats totally breaks down “when you add politics into it.”

“The people in these agencies, particularly the decision makers, they’re not going to say anything that gets them uninvited to the cocktail parties or that they get a phone call from the White House,” he explained. “The result of that, time and time again, is that we see dead people. People are dying because of this.”

“Every single one of these incidents is testimony to how the utterly bizarre policy combined with their inbred penchant for political correctness has directly led to the loss of American lives on American soil.”

KNOWN WOLF TERRORISTS

Nothing exemplifies government agencies’ inability to stop terror attacks from occurring on U.S. soil better than the concept of a “known wolf terrorist,” a pattern which Poole himself characterized.

In Poole’s words, the “known wolf” is “a case where the FBI knew about them before hand and didn’t do anything,” and this list of terrorists include Fort Hood shooter Major Nidal Hasan, the Tsarnaev brothers (Boston Bombing) and the Orlando nightclub gunman Omar Mateen. (RELATED: Orlando Terrorist Threatened To Shoot Up His Elementary School When He Was 10)

“Major Hasan was emailing with [deceased Al-Qaeda recruiter] Anwar Al-Awlaki, where the second-to-last email was about justifying attacks on his fellow soldiers,” Poole said of the former Army psychiatrist who murdered 13 soldiers and wounded 30 others in Fort Hood, TX in 2009. “The FBI put out a press release saying ‘oh, that email correspondence, it was just about religious matters’ so we closed the case.”

“It took us years to get the emails, and then we found out that was complete horse shit,” Poole added.

He also explained how the Russian Federation’s intelligence agency had in fact alerted the FBI to the possibility that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been radicalized before he and his brother bombed the Boston Marathon in 2013, killing 3 and injuring more than 200 in the process.

“The FSB [Russian intelligence service] warned the FBI twice about Tamerlan Tsarnaev’s contacts over in Dagestan. The FBI did absolutely nothing with it. It’s almost the same thing we saw with Orlando.”

Just like the Tsarnaev brothers and Major Hasan, Omar Mateen was on the FBI’s terror watch list before committing his heinous attack on the Pulse Nightclub on Sunday.

Mateen had previously been the subject of a federal investigation, yet the case was dropped after investigators deemed the terroristic threats he made to coworkers as reactions to “being marginalized because of his Muslim faith.” (RELATED: FBI Called Off Investigation Of Orlando Shooter Because They Thought His Coworkers Were Racist)

REAL WORLD CONSEQUENCES

In Poole’s eyes, Obama’s counter-terrorism policies make it impossible to label and prevent terror attacks, which is effectively worse than not having any protocols in the first place. (RELATED: Obama — ISIS Fighters ‘Are Not Religious Warriors’)

“Was it a surprise that the FBI wasn’t able to see that Omar Mateen was a serious problem? Of course not. They can’t identify the threat.”

“The inability to define the threat has real world consequences. How do you tell the difference between a good guy and a bad guy. So how the administration’s policies have played out, you’re not able to distinguish. The extremists use the American-Muslim community as a shield. If you’re criticizing me, you’re criticizing all Muslims.”

Poole also told TheDC that in addition to hampering law enforcement efforts, Obama’s policies “end up stigmatizing the Muslim community,” leaving them vulnerable to attack from American vigilantes, disillusioned by the government’s inability to keep them safe.

“I’m surprised we haven’t seen it already,” he noted. “You’re going to have some knuckleheads go out there and say, ‘damnit I’m mad they’re not doing anything. I’m going to go shoot up a mosque.’ The administration’s policies are endangering American-Muslims.”

In closing, Poole warned that terrorist “threats are proliferating.”

“I don’t think this is the last attack on U.S. soil we’ll see before the election.”

Secretary Of The Army Makes Terror Attack In Orlando All About Himself,"Secretary of the Army Eric Fanning reacted to the mass shooting in Orlando by making the terror attack all about himself.

In a tweet posted early Monday morning, Fanning stated, “Hrs & distance cannot dull the pain of #Orlando. It could have been me that night. And now that I’m #Army Secretary, it’s doubly personal.”

Fanning is the first openly gay man to hold a secretary level service position, and apparently, Omar Mateen, the 29-year-old terrorist, also had homosexual proclivities, as evidenced by his apparent use of the gay dating app Jack’d and the fact that he was reportedly a regular at the Pulse nightclub.

Fanning often emphasizes the fact that he’s gay when talking about his position as head of a military branch, saying he initially wanted to focus solely on his qualifications for the job, but now is interested in talking about his sexual identity.

One of the club-goers, Kevin West, told The Los Angeles Times that Mateen messaged him for about a year over the app. Four other regulars at the club said they had previously seen Mateen sloppily drunk at Pulse.

“He was trying to pick up people. Men,” Jim Van Horn told The Associated Press. “He would walk up to them and then he would maybe put his arm around them or something and maybe try to get them to dance a little bit or something. And then go over and buy a drink or something. That’s what people do at gay bars, you know? That’s what we do.”

West, on the other hand, had never actually seen Mateen until Sunday morning, when the shooting took place. Mateen killed 49 and wounded 53 others. The narrative surrounding Mateen’s motives is now shifting to accommodate not just radical Islam and devotion to terror groups, but also the fact that he seemed to be a self-loathing, closeted homosexual. Just two months before the shooting, Mateen’s father noted he had been angered by the sight of two men kissing, which may have been the impetus for the terror attack Sunday.

FBI Director: Gun Control Measure Would Harm Terror Investigations,"FBI Director James Comey previously warned lawmakers last year that Democratic supported gun control measures to block individuals on the terror watch list from buying a firearm could blow domestic terror probes, according to Roll Call.

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that Democrats will use the 2017 Commerce, Justice and Science appropriations spending bill to force a vote on an amendment that would keep terror-watch list individuals from purchasing firearms.

“So I hope Republicans will find the courage to help us pass meaningful legislation to protect the American people. They’re certainly doing a good job in protecting Donald Trump,” Reid said.

The push to pass gun control legislation comes in the wake of nightclub shooting in Orlando that left 49 dead and dozens wounded.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that members would meet Wednesday with both Comey and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson on the issue, saying:

“If we want to engage in a serious legislative effort, we’re going to talk to the experts about what we could do to be helpful. Our suspicion is this is basically a politically motivated effort that we’re likely to see on Commerce, Justice, and State, but we’re open,” McConnell told reporters Tuesday. “Nobody wants terrorists to have firearms. We’re open to serious suggestions from the experts as to what we might be able to do to be helpful.”

Democrats previously attempted to pass the same measure put forth by California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein following last December’s San Bernardino shooting, but the amendment failed on a procedural vote 45 to 54.

An FBI spokeswoman told Roll Call that while Director Comey does not take a stance on any particular proposed gun legislation, he will enforce whatever the law is and that Comey does not take a position on any proposed gun amendment but will follow whatever the law is. Comey himself has told lawmakers he is focused on the operational side and the FBI does not endorse legislation.

However, the FBI noted 2015 testimony at a Senate Appropriation subcommittee hearing when Comey discussed what would happen if Feinstein’s amendment became law.

Feinstein mentioned to Comey the Government Accountability Office found 2,233 cases between 2004 and 2014, 91 percent of the time the known or suspected terrorist passed the background check.

“What can be done about this?” Feinstein asked.

Comey apologetically responded that it would “blow our investigation” to interfere with the purchase.

“Well, senator, what we do now is if someone on the watch list purchases or attempts to purchase a firearm, an immediate alert is sent to the agents who are the source of the suspicion about that individual, so they can incorporate that information into their investigation,” Comey said.

“It’s a little bit challenging for us because known or suspected means it hasn’t been adjudicated in every case that somebody is a terrorist,” Comey said. “It’s somebody we’re investigating, so we don’t want to, obviously, blow our investigation. Sorry.”

France Has Twice As Many Terror Suspects As It Does Anti-Terror Police,"France has 10,000 active suspects on its highest threat level terror watch list and less than 5,000 federal agents to surveil them, chairman of the French Center for the Analysis of Terrorism told The New York Times.

French anti-terror agents can only surveil 250 of the 10,000 suspects at any one time, because 24-hour surveillance requires twenty agents per suspect. All 10,000 people on the “S-list” are considered radicalized by French security services.

The suspected terror watch list also lacks any prioritization by threat level. All suspects are considered equally dangerous, making cross-agency coordination and threat level monitoring difficult for French authorities.

“We are in fact drowning in intelligence,” one French expert told The New York Times.

This sentiment was echoed by FBI Director James Comey in the wake of the Orlando terrorist attack. Comey characterized Mateen’s file with the FBI prior to Orlando as just one of “hundreds and hundreds of cases all across the country.” He elaborated that trying to surveil each and every one of them was like “looking for needles in a nationwide haystack.”

Eight of the ten Paris attackers were on the highest terror watch list. Despite this, the suspects were able to travel to Iraq and Syria to train with the Islamic State and return without raising any flags in the French intelligence service.

European authorities told The New York Times they are swamped with thousands of terror suspects and are simply unable to keep up with them all. The consequences of this overload became apparent on June 13 when French terrorist Larossi Abballa stabbed two police officers in front of their children, while livecasting the entire event on Facebook.

Aballa was a convicted terrorism suspect, who was taken off the surveillance list just months before his brutal terrorist attack. In his final words he told his Facebook followers, “You closed the door toward the lands of the caliphate? Well, good then, we have opened the door of jihad onto your territory.”

Former DOD Official Warns America Is On The Wrong Track To Fighting War On Terror [VIDEO],"Former Department of Defense official Rich Higgins knew America was losing the war on terror when a terrorist attacked the Pulse bar in Orlando, killing 49 people and injuring over 50.

Higgins’ sister-in-law asked him if he was doing all he could to fight this enemy after seeing the carnage of innocent life. Now, Higgins is taking considerable risk to speak truthfully about the lack of strategic policy in our government’s war on terror.

In this exclusive video interview with The Daily Caller News Foundation, the former Department of Defense official explains how Islamists are “weaponizing political correctness” and using narratives to collapse our understanding of the enemy and how to battle them.

His expertise is political warfare and developing strategies to battle against the ideologies and tactics used to carry out terror attacks.

Political warfare includes both non-violent and violent actions working in synthesis, Higgins says. The left, with enemy-friendly Muslim Brotherhood allies, is able to control the dominant cultural narrative with the media and the government, blinding us in the war on terror and impacting how Americans think, he argues.

Higgins calls for a “strategic and operational pause” in America’s misguided battle to stop the terror. He would, instead, ask new leadership to develop a comprehensive political warfare plan, while removing the subversive policies and personnel causing America to lose this paramount battle.

He cites the “purges” carried out by law enforcement and intelligence officials throughout government, which Phil Haney, Sebastian Gorka and Steve Coughlin have made public. (RELATED: Whistleblower: Islamic Groups Control Narrative Of American Law Enforcement)

The Orlando terrorist accomplished the enemy’s goals, Higgins said, as the massacre was the second most deadly attack on U.S. soil and now Americans are in such great fear they would willingly give up free speech or gun rights — thus benefitting the enemy.

Higgins calls for more whistleblowers to come to Congress, and for Congress to subpoena these truth-tellers because their jobs, families and pensions are at risk without a congressional subpoena.

28-Page BOMBSHELL: Saudi With Terror Ties Checked Security At US Border In 1999,"A Saudi national who was under investigation by the FBI checked a security checkpoint on the southwest U.S. border prior to the 9/11 attacks, according to 28 pages from a 2002 joint inquiry released by the House Intelligence Community on Friday.

The unnamed individual also discussed the possibility of smuggling terrorists into the U.S., the report reads:

The report lays out several new connections between members of the Saudi Royal Family and two 9/11 hijackers.

The report also points to a 1999 incident on board an America West flight from Phoenix to Washington D.C. that investigators came to believe was a “dry run” for the 9/11 attacks.

A terror-connected Saudi national named Mohammed al-Qudhaeein was flagged for asking a series of suspicious questions during the flight. He also attempted to enter the cockpit of the airplane. Al-Qudhaeein and an associate were headed for a party at the Saudi embassy in Washington D.C., according to the report.

Both the Obama and George W. Bush administration opposed the release of the 28 pages, which were classified as “Top Secret.” The Obama administration caved into demands to release the redacted pages under increased pressure from lawmakers, special interest groups and families of 9/11 victims.

French Prime Minister On Nice Terror Attack: ‘France Is Going To Have To Live With Terrorism’,"The morning after the terrorist attack in Nice, France, which left 84 dead and 50 wounded, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls declared that the country is “going to have to live with terrorism.”

Valls delivered his speech by the Élysée Palace in Paris Friday morning, The New York Times reports.

“We would like to tell the French people that we will never give in,” he said. “We will not give in to the terrorist threat. The times have changed, and France is going to have to live with terrorism.”

He added that the attack took place July 14 on Bastille Day was no coincidence.

“France, once again, has been hit in its soul, on the 14th of July, our national day. They wanted to attack the unity of the French nation.”

Users on social media in France have absolutely exploded in response to his comments, with some calling him to resign.

Tunisian terrorist Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, who regularly ran afoul of the law, gunned people down in a crowd Thursday evening before driving his truck straight through a throng of people, killing dozens upon dozens. The death toll is likely to rise.

Police were successful in killing the driver, but not before he racked up a serious death count.

“We cannot deny that it was a terror attack,” French President Francois Hollande said.

The state of emergency, which was implemented following the Paris attacks in November and set to expire at the end of the month, will now continue at least for three more months.

The Department of State has confirmed two Americans died in the attack: Sean Copeland and his 11-year-old son from Texas.

Since the attacks, French police have raided Bouhlel’s home in Nice. Although Bouhlel was involved in petty crime, he was not under surveillance by any intelligence services in France.

String Of Islamic Terror Attacks Punctuate Troubling Numbers Under Obama Admin,"The spate of terrorist attacks over the last year or so — Charlie Hebdo, Paris, Brussels, Orlando, Nice — really send home an inconvenient truth for President Barack Obama: terror has skyrocketed since he took office.

It isn’t just anecdotal, the numbers add up. Since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, the global carnage as a result of terrorism during the Obama administration adds up to at least 131,081 casualties.

The damning figures are publicly available in the U.S. Department of State’s Country Reports on Terrorism, which annually summarize terrorist activities worldwide. Much of Obama’s woes come from ISIS redrawing the map of the Middle East as it takes on the governments of Syria, Iraq, and Jordan.

The Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 starts off by admitting, “The global terrorist threat continued to evolve rapidly in 2015, becoming increasingly decentralized and diffuse.” The report goes on to state that ISIS, “remained the greatest threat globally,” and that the organization has at its disposal, “a large number of foreign terrorist fighters.”

In the non-partisan Vision of Humanity’s 2015 Global Terrorism Index (GTI), it states, “the number of people who have died from terrorist activity has increased nine-fold since the year 2000.”

The GTI 2015 report goes on to conclude that lone wolf terrorist attacks account for 70 percent of terrorist-related deaths in the Western world since 2006. Dealing with terrorist threats cost the world $52.9 billion in 2014, which is ten times more than the cost in 2000.

Vision of Humanity also notes in its 2016 Global Peace Index (GPI), that, “the last decade has seen a historic decline in world peace. This interrupts the long term improvements in peace since World War II.” The 2016 GPI depressingly states that, “the number of yearly incidents has almost tripled since 2011 and the number of deaths has increased to over 30,000.”

Five countries are primarily responsible for heightened terrorist activities and casualties: Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria, according to the 2016 GPI. So far, 2014 was Obama’s worst year on record in preventing terrorist fatalities, considering 32,727 people died that year. The following year was only slightly better for the president’s statistics, as 28,328 people lost their lives to terrorism.

Most of the deaths in the wake of 9/11 during the Bush presidency happened outside of the U.S., and the majority of the victims were not Americans. The same is true of Obama’s presidency. There were only two Islamist-terror linked attacks that hit the U.S. mainland under Bush after 9/11, while there have been eight under Obama.

In October 2002, 10 people lost their lives to the D.C.-area snipers, John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo, who had a fondness for jihadist thinking. The D.C. shootings were the only fatal jihad-inspired attacks in the continental-U.S. for the remainder of the Bush presidency. Muslim Mohammed Reza Taheri-azar used his SUV in 2006 as a battering ram, attempting to kill, but only injuring six people, ultimately failing his goal “to avenge the deaths or murders of Muslims around the world,” at UNC-Chapel Hill.

The eight terror attacks that hit the U.S. mainland during the Obama presidency caused 85 casualties. That number is only a fraction of the kind of terror that runs rampant across the world as ISIS continues to actively recruit fighters.

ISIS Recruits Reporter To Commit Acts Of Terror,"A report released Thursday reveals that jihadi Abu Muslim Khurasani recruited a British reporter to commit heinous acts of terror in the name of ISIS.

For two months the jihadi recruiter coached the undercover journalist to carry out a lone wolf terror attack in London, The Sun reports.

The undercover reporter worked for the U.K. newspaper The Sun while communicating with Khurasani via Telegram, an app which encrypts messages between senders.

“Learn from Nice. Get a car you can park somewhere busy with many people—and a gun you can use at the same time,” Khurasani told the undercover reporter. “While sitting in car, use them all [referring to bullets] and quickly press the button. Both things must be in a hurry. No time gap”

The attack was to be carried out last Monday at a busy shopping center, an unexpectedly ordinary location for such extraordinary violence. The location selected indicates the recruiter hoped the attack would have the same abruptly atrocious quality witnessed in Nice.

Other considerations on the hit list included Big Ben and thed London Bridge.

The ISIS jihadi also guided the reporter in constructing a homemade bomb for the attack. Instructions indicated that all necessary materials, like fireworks and gas canisters, could be easily found for around ￡300 from high street shops.

The Sunday before the attack was to be carried out, Khurasani’s final message to the reporter read: “We will remember u. But I dont wanna distract ur intentions akhi (brother). Like all the brothers who did this. Tomorrow inshallah (God willing).”

According to The Sun, Khurasani often implored their reporter to heed Allah’s will. “We will remember your work — intentions must only be to serve Allah. He will love you for that.”

The Sun has since passed all evidence and information from their investigation to MI5 and anti-terror police.

Message exchanges reveal that the jihadi recruiter has plans for expansion once ISIS can “verify” potential recruits. The verification process for The Sun reporter was relatively simple and included a few questions about Islam and related prayer rituals.

Khurasani reportedly told the undercover journalist that ISIS was planning to recruit more lone-wolf terrorists in the West once they’re “verified” and often referred to the terror attacks in Nice, Germany and Florida as examples of what jihadis could achieve.

Ex-Scotland Yard commander John O’Connor commented on The Sun’s investigation in a somber tone.

“We can’t rely on good fortune, and the absence of terror attacks for so many years is no indication as to whether it will happen here,” O’Connor told The Sun. “There are thousands of these people who are potentially going to commit a terrorist offense…It will happen here—it’s just a matter of time. A terrorist attack is imminent.”

Commander Dean Haydon, head of the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command, commended The Sun’s proactive investigation.

“It is always helpful when journalists share with police information that could indicate terrorist or criminal activity.”

“While the U.K. threat level from international terrorism remains severe, we would like to reassure the public that we constantly review our security plans, taking into account specific intelligence and the wider threat.”

“We ask the public to remain vigilant and alert.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2016/07/28/isis-recruits-reporter-to-commit-acts-of-terror/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwil45qNgLT9AhU5K1kFHZI1Al84WhAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw2x5RDDMhvWqavOCJvjENQh,2016-07-28
FBI Director: Somali Muslim Immigrants More ‘Susceptible’ To Radicalization By Terror Groups,"Minnesota’s large Somalian immigrant Muslim community is more susceptible to radicalization from terrorist organizations, according to the director of the FBI.

FBI Director James Comey noted the proclivity for radicalization while testifying before the House Committee on the Judiciary Wednesday.

“Why is Minnesota turning out so many jihadists?” Rep. Ron DeSantis asked Comey, citing a report from the House Committee on Homeland Security, which found that Minnesota was the top source for U.S. fighters joining Islamic State.

“I don’t know whether for sure that’s true, but it sounds about right,” said Comey, noting the overall number of U.S. citizens has been fairly low. “There have been a number of Somali-American heritage young men who’ve gone to fight with al-Shabaab in Somalia and with ISIS.”

According to Comey, Minnesota produces so many jihadis because “that’s one of the few areas in the United States [that] we have a large concentration susceptible to that recruiting.”

“The great thing about America is everybody is kind of dispersed,” said Comey. “That’s one of the areas where there’s an immigrant Muslim community that seems to be susceptible for some reason.”

A Somalian-American man in St. Paul, Minn., engaged in a knife attack at a local mall Sept. 17, injuring eight. ISIS was quick to take credit for the attack shortly after it occurred. Comey noted that the FBI investigation into the attack is ongoing, but he was apprehensive in connecting it to ISIS at this point.

“They claim responsibility, [but] that isn’t dispositive for us, beceause they’ll claim responsibility for any savagery they can get their name on,” said Comey.

Approximately 25,000 Somalis live in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, many of whom are Muslim. Most of the community immigrated to the area as refugees in the 1990s due to the Somalian civil war. As opposed to many immigrant communities which are usually spread throughout the U.S. upon resettlement, the Minnesota Somalian community is densely concentrated in the Minneapolis Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, earning it the nickname “Little Mogadishu.”

Terror-Plagued Pakistan Just Turned On Another Nuclear Reactor,"Pakistan’s fourth nuclear power plant began providing electricity to citizens Sunday with some help from China, despite concerns about radical Islamist groups operating in the country.

Engineers began final testing of the new 340 megawatt reactor at the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant, which is expected to reach its full capacity in December with the help of China. Local Pakistani Islamic radical groups and the Islamic State have expressed interest in stealing nuclear material from the country’s reactors to build a dirty bomb.

Pakistan has a small nuclear power program, capable of only generating 725 megawatts of electric power, but is building numerous new reactors with financial and technical assistance from China. The country invested about $860 million into its new reactor, with $350 million provided by China, according to a report by the World Nuclear Association.

The country has two more new nuclear power plants at Karachi under construction, which will be completed in 2020 and 2021 respectively. These new reactors will collectively generate another 2100 megawatts of electrical power. Pakistan has been operating nuclear reactors for the last 44 years and has nuclear weapons as well.

A local terror group called Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan plotted in 2013 to steal such material. The father of Pakistan’s nuclear program, Abdul Qadeer Khan, illegally sold unauthorized nuclear technology to other countries for over 20 years. Despite these threats, Pakistan still claims that its nuclear assets are secure.

ISIS said it wants to steal radioactive material from a similar reactor to build a dirty bomb. The terrorist organization asserted in the May 2015 issue of its propaganda magazine Dabiq that it can buy such nuclear material through links to corrupt officials in Pakistan. ISIS does not have a profound presence in Pakistan and exists only in the form of small, independent cells.

Pakistan’s nuclear reactors don’t produce the weapons-grade plutonium necessary to make a nuclear weapon, but materials from them could be used to create dirty bombs. A dirty bomb combines radioactive material with conventional explosives that could contaminate the local area with high radiation levels for long periods of time and cause mass panic, though it would be millions of times weaker than an actual nuclear device.

Other unstable Islamic countries with terrorism problems — including Algeria, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt — are also on their way to constructing new nuclear reactors.

Russia and Saudi Arabia signed an agreement last year to work together on “peaceful” nuclear energy projects. The stated purpose of these reactors is to generate electricity, power desalination plants and reduce domestic oil consumption so Saudi Arabia can sell the oil abroad. The reactors will be built by the Russian government controlled Rosatom State Nuclear Energy Cooperation. Saudi Arabia will buy 16 nuclear power plants from Russia for $100 billion despite terrorism concerns.

ISIS Issues Guide For Thanksgiving Day Terror Attacks,"The Islamic State has issued a guide for its followers in the U.S. and Western countries, detailing how to engage in successful terror attacks, specifically on Thanksgiving day.

The guide was featured in ISIS’s most recent edition Rumiyah, its English language magazine. It explained that ISIS adherents in the West have “a multitude of weapons and techniques that he may employ” to “inflict misery and destruction upon the enemies of Allah.” Vehicle attacks are one of the most effective weapons in the terrorist arsenal, the guide stated.

3) “Just Terror Tactics” section praises #Nice vehicular attack, suggests markets, rallies, & specifically Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade pic.twitter.com/15rKo9b9Zl — Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) November 11, 2016

“Though being an essential part of the modern life, very few actually comprehend the deadly and destructive capability of the motor vehicle and its capacity of reaping large numbers of casualties if used in a premeditated manner,” the guide stated.

ISIS pointed to the terror attack in Nice, France in July as an example of how effective a vehicle attack can be. An ISIS adherent of Tunisian background drove a large truck through a crowd, killing 86.

The guide suggested using a large load-bearing truck to engage in such an attack, and recommends “large outdoor conventions and celebrations” as potential targets. It includes a picture of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade, with the caption “an excellent target.” ISIS also suggested creating a multi-step plan before engaging in the attack, which includes assessing a practical target and carrying a secondary weapon.

ISIS often uses its media outlets to encourage followers abroad to engage in terrorist attacks. The terrorist group initially encouraged followers to travel to the so-called caliphate in Syria and Iraq to engage in jihad, but changed its tactics last year after the Operation Inherent Resolve coalition began to push back against ISIS forces. ISIS has engaged in several successful attacks against Western targets ranging from France to the U.S.

ISIS rarely directs attacks abroad directly, instead issuing guides and suggestions allowing radicalized followers abroad to engage in their own attacks. The decentralized strategy is much more effective than a top-down strategy, such as the attacks on September 11, 2001. It also minimizes the risk of being caught by security officials.

The SPLC Considers The Most Deadly Islamic Terror Attack Since 9/11 A Right-Wing Plot,"The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) considers the Orlando nightclub shooting, an ISIS-inspired attack that left 49 dead, a right-wing plot, along with the shootings of police officers by anti-white terrorists.

The SPLC maintains a list called “Terror from the Right,” which according to them is “a synopsis of radical-right terrorist plots, conspiracies and racist rampages since the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.” The list includes individuals such as the Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph and Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof. (RELATED: Just 13 Right-Wing Extremists Have Been Charged With Terrorism Since 9/11)

However, among abortion center bombers and white supremacists are Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, Gavin Eugene Long, Luqman Ameen Abdullah and Micah Xavier Johnson.

Mateen was the perpetrator behind the June Orlando gay club shooting in which he killed 50 individuals, including himself, and left 53 wounded. Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State before he died and was on the FBI’s radar as an Islamist sympathizer before the attack. There were reports that Mateen was gay, but the FBI said they had found no evidence to corroborate this.

The Orlando shooter is one of two Islamic extremists on the SPLC’s list of right-wing terrorists and plots. The other is Luqman Ameen Abdullah, a Michigan imam killed by the FBI in a 2009 shootout. Federal court documents described him as a Muslim separatist. No other jihadis are included on the SPLC’s “Terror from the Right” list and the group did not offer an explanation to The Daily Caller about why Abdullah and Mateen are considered right-wing terrorists.

Likewise, the SPLC did not explain to TheDC why two black power-supporting cop killers are considered right-wing. Micah Xavier Johnson is responsible for the July ambush of police officers in Dallas that left 5 dead and 7 wounded. Dallas police said that Johnson told them he wanted to kill white people and a picture from his Facebook profile shows him holding up a “black power” fist.

Gavin Eugene Long killed three Baton Rouge police officers in July. Long claimed in YouTube videos that he was a former member of the Nation of Islam, which believes white people were created by an evil scientist named Yakub. Long also complained about “crackers” in one of his videos.

The SPLC did not include two New Black Panther Party members who were arrested for planning to set off bombs during a Ferguson, Mo. protest on their right-wing terror list. TheDC reported Thursday that the SPLC’s list is light on actual individuals charged with terrorism, only seven on its list have been indicted on federal terrorism or terror-related crimes.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2016/12/08/the-splc-considers-the-most-deadly-islamic-terror-attack-since-911-a-right-wing-plot/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi60M-IgLT9AhWmFFkFHbyRBic4FBAWegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw3j461N35wPk8kD_NPZhY94,2016-12-08
Obama Races To Destroy Anti-Terror Program So Trump Can’t Use It,"The Obama administration is moving quickly to dismantle a program to track visitors from countries with a high terrorist threat, so that Trump can’t use it as president.

The program, called the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS), was created after the 9/11 attacks and halted in 2011. It worked by tracking arrivals from countries with active terrorist groups.

It attracted renewed attention in the past year when then-presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed reviving the program to serve as a form of “extreme vetting” for Muslims arriving in the United States from dangerous countries. Trump adviser Kris Kobach, who currently serves as Kansas’ secretary of state, was recently photographed carrying documents that explicitly called for reinstating NSEERS and using it to track all arrivals from terrorism-associated countries. (RELATED: Speaking Of Fake News, The ‘Muslim Registry’)

But now, the Obama administration is junking the deactivated program so Trump can’t use it, forcing him to rebuild it from scratch instead. In a rule change taking effect Friday, the Department of Homeland Security moved to eliminate the regulations that undergird it, saying the program wasn’t useful.

“D.H.S. ceased use of NSEERS more than five years ago, after it was determined the program was redundant, inefficient and provided no increase in security,” Neema Hakim, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement accompanying the rule change. The rule change argues that all the useful data NSEERS collected is obtained in other ways, making it useless.

The maneuver is the latest effort by the outgoing Obama administration to throw up hurdles for the Trump administration before it leaves power. Obama has also issued a decree banning oil drilling in large swaths of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move he says Trump won’t be able to reverse.

Republicans Propose Bills Designating Iranian Guard And Muslim Brotherhood As Terror Groups,"Two bills reintroduced in the Congress late Wednesday designated the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist organizations.

Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz re-proposed the two bills in the upper chamber while Texas Republican Rep. Michael McCaul and Florida Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart dropped companion bills in the House.

The bills, according to a press release, will direct the State Department to hold accountable both the IRGC and the Muslim Brotherhood “two foreign entities that espouse a violent Islamist ideology with a mission of destroying the West. Both bills require a report on whether these organizations meet the criteria to be designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations, and if so, will enable the U.S. to take action that could stifle the funding they receive to promote their terrorist activities.”

McCaul introduced the IRGC Terrorist Designation Act in the House, which asks the State Department to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization and Diaz-Balart filed legislation for the Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Designation Act, which urges State to classify the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization.

The passage and adoption of such legislation would be very different from the Obama administration’s relationship to the Muslim Brotherhood, particularly in Egypt, where the administration supported the previous Muslim Brotherhood Islamist government headed up by Mohamed Morsi.

“I am proud to reintroduce these bills that would codify needed reforms in America’s war against radical Islamic terrorism,” Sen. Cruz said of the legislation. “This potent threat to our civilization has intensified under the Obama administration due to the willful blindness of politically-correct policies that hamper our safety and security.

Rep. Diaz-Balart agreed saying a statement, “I am proud to once again work with Senator Cruz to introduce this legislation in the 115th Congress. The Muslim Brotherhood continues to support terrorist organizations that are responsible for acts of violence around the world.” He added, “This bill would impose tough sanctions on a hateful group that has spread violence and spawned extremist movements throughout the Middle East. This designation is long overdue, and I look forward to working with the incoming administration and the appropriate committees to ensure that this bill becomes law. We have an incoming president who appreciates the threat of terrorism and has vowed to defeat it. Designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization is an important step in defeating violent extremists.”

The IRGC terrorist designation bill comes on the heels of reports that the U.S. and five other world powers that negotiated the nuclear deal with Iran announced delivery of 116 metric tons of natural uranium to the Iranian regime on Monday.

Rep. McCaul said of the IRGC legislation that “If a foreign organization looks like a terror group, operates like a terror group, and supports terrorism, then it should be called for what it is – a foreign terrorist organization.” He added, “As obvious as that seems, for years the IRGC has been allowed to operate clandestinely using front companies and illicit networks to evade formal designation. The Obama Administration has chosen to turn a blind eye to these activities for the sake of a flawed nuclear agreement which Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei stated publicly would not alter Iran’s behavior.”

"Women’s March Organizer Recently Met Ex-Hamas Operative, Has Family Ties To Terror Group","Linda Sarsour, one of the organizers behind Saturday’s Women’s March, being held in Washington, D.C., was recently spotted at a large Muslim convention in Chicago posing for pictures with an accused financier for Hamas, the terrorist group.

Sarsour, the head of the Arab American Association of New York and an Obama White House “Champion of Change,” was speaking at last month’s 15th annual convention of the Muslim American Society and Islamic Circle of North America.

While there, she posed for a picture with Salah Sarsour, a member of the Islamic Society of Milwaukee and former Hamas operative who was jailed in Israel in the 1990s because of his alleged work for the terrorist group.

Salah Sarsour, who is also a board member of American Muslims for Palestine, served as a bodyguard of sorts at the convention for Sumeyye Erdogan Bayraktar, the daughter of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. (RELATED: Ex-Hamas Financier Spotted At Muslim Convention In Chicago With Turkish President’s Daughter)

While it is unclear if Salah and Linda are related (though they share the same surname, she has suggested in the past on social media that they are not and did not respond to requests for comment), she has other family ties to alleged Hamas operatives. Though she avoids discussing it now, Sarsour has acknowledged in past interviews that she has cousins serving prison time in Israel because of their work for Hamas.

Sarsour has denied having any contact with the terror group. She told The New York Times in 2012 that she would not have been appointed an Obama “Champion of Change” if she had.

The activist has risen to national attention recently. She served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, and she is one of four lead organizers for the Women’s March.

The event is expected to attract 500,000 people and will feature several high-profile progressive speakers. But it has been heavily criticized for excluding pro-life women’s groups. Meanwhile, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights group which opposes abortions past 20 weeks, was asked to take part in the event.

Linda Sarsour has close ties to that organization, which was named an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation (HLF) terrorism case.

HLF was found to have funneled money to Hamas, which was designated a terrorist group in the 1990s.

Salah Sarsour has ties to that group.

Sarsour was implicated in Hamas activity in the West Bank in the 1990s, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).

ADL cited a Nov. 2001 FBI memo detailing information provided by Sarsour’s brother, Jamil, to Israeli investigators in 1998.

“According to statements given to Israeli investigators by his brother Jamil, Sarsour was personally involved in fundraising for Hamas. According to a November 2001 FBI memorandum, Jamil Sarsour was arrested in 1998 for funding Hamas and told Israeli investigators that Salah Sarsour was involved in funding Hamas through his fundraising for the Holy Land Foundation (HLF),” ADL reported.

The FBI memo stated that the Sarsours passed money in $1,000 and $2,000 increments to a Hamas operative named Adel Awadallah through their Milwaukee furniture store.

Awadallah was a commander in the Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ militant wing.

Salah Sarsour met Awadallah in 1995 while serving an eight month prison sentence in Israel for supporting Hamas.

Sarsour has not been charged with any crimes in the U.S. His brother Jamil was arrested and charged in 2003 with money laundering after returning back to the U.S. from Israel. He served a four year jail sentence for his work for Hamas.

White House Releases List Of Terror Attacks It Considers Underreported By The Media,"The White House released a list Monday night of the terror attacks it believes were underreported by the media.

CNN’s Jim Acosta said his producer was given the list of the 78 attacks outside of the White House. Though he did not read the list in full on air, Acosta said it included attacks like Paris, Brussels, Nice, Istanbul and San Bernardino.

While speaking at the MacDill Air Force Base Monday — the headquarters of the U.S. Central Command — President Trump accused the “dishonest press” of failing to comprehensively cover terror attacks.

“It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even reported, and in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn’t even want to report it,” Trump said.

WATCH:



Later, on board Air Force One, White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the president’s statement, saying that terrorist attacks “aren’t exactly covered to a degree on which they should be.”

“[The president] felt members of the media don’t always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered,” Spicer said.

“Protests will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn’t necessarily get the same coverage.”

Below is the unedited list of the attacks the White House released Monday.

Al-Qaida Quietly Regrouping To Expand ‘Global Terror Enterprise’,"Al-Qaida’s affiliate in western Africa, AQIM, is consolidating with local tribal groups to put down roots to grow its terror operations, The Soufan Group warns.

Al-Qaida’s Africa strategy mimics the tactics it’s used in Syria, which co-opts local groups into its larger terror network. The strategy is at odds with Islamic State tactics, which instead controls and administers territory under its control by conquest. Experts say al-Qaida’s methods will make it more difficult to eradicate, and could make it a much longer lasting threat than ISIS.

“While the world remains focused on defeating the Islamic State, al-Qaeda is quietly exploiting the opportunity to expand its global terrorist enterprise,” the U.S.-based security advisory firm states.

The group outlines al-Qaida’s patient strategy with African tribes saying, “over a decade of collaboration with AQIM helped convince local militants of the group’s long-term commitment to the region, and the utility of sacrificing a degree of autonomy in exchange for the benefits of membership in al-Qaeda’s global network.”

Experts at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) note that the new al-Qaida merger will “fuel an emboldened insurgency in Mali” and “allow for greater coordination” of terrorist operations throughout Africa.

AQIM’s terror activities were already on the upswing with 250 attacks in 2016, according to statistics tracked by FDD. The group is already on track to surpass the number, with another 50 attacks recorded in 2017. The group continues to operate under the authority of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.

AQIM has long been considered a threat by the West. The U.S. periodically drone strikes senior leaders in Mali, and France deployed hundreds of special operators to Mali in 2013. The French operations lasted for nearly a year and successfully reclaimed major cities for the Malian government.

South Fears North Korean Drones Could Unleash Terror From The Sky,"Just in case North Korea’s missiles, nukes, and chemical weapons weren’t big enough problems, the North is believed to have around 1,000 drones capable of unleashing terror from above.

The North’s arsenal of unmanned aerial vehicles could be used for airborne terror attacks, the Yonhap News Agency reported Wednesday, citing a South Korean think tank.

“North Korea’s air forces are inferior to its South Korean counterpart and an absence of military satellites is making it difficult for Pyongyang to” carry out reconnaissance, Chun Ku-youn, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification, explained in a report, adding that drones could also be used for biological and chemical weapons strikes.

Although the North denies it, the country, which is not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention, is suspected of running an advanced chemical weapons program. The Korea Institute for Defense Analyses estimates that North Korea possesses around 25 chemical agents, including six potent nerve agents, such as VX and sarin.

“North Korea may possess between 2,500 and 5,000 tons of [chemical warfare] agents,” the Nuclear Threat Initiative assessed, “At maximum capacity, North Korea is estimated to be capable of producing up to 12,000 tons of [chemical weapons].”

While the country is a signatory to the Biological Weapons Convention, the reclusive regime is also believed to be in possession of 13 types of pathogens, including anthrax and clostridium.

North Korea’s drones are called Banghyun, and it has been developing various versions since the 1990s.

Standard North Korean drones fly at around 100 mph and can carry 45-55 pound payloads. Kim Heung-Kwang, a defector and the director of a private think tank, revealed last year that North Korea’s stealth drone, the Banghyun 5, could potentially carry explosives and radioactive material. This type of drone could be used as a radioactive dispersal device, or in simpler terms, a dirty bomb drone that renders the target area uninhabitable for years.

An Onslaught Of Islamic Terror Is Europe’s New Normal,"On Thursday, in an attack that has started to feel routine, Karim Cheurfi opened fire on French police on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, killing a police officer. Cheurfi then wounded two others before he was shot and killed. Police later found a note in which he expressed support for the Islamic State, which later declared him their “soldier.”

Following similar attacks in London, Stockholm, Paris, Nice, Berlin and Israel, Europe is waking up to the fact that these abrupt acts of murder — using knives, guns and cars — are the new norm.

Over the last five years, there has been a noticeable change in jihadist methods. During the 2000s, Al Qaeda and other violent Islamist groups were preoccupied with large explosions –terrorist acts that took months of planning, networks of contacts, sources of funding, and supplies of explosive material. The effects, when successful, produced enormous casualties and made for dramatic television. But these plots were also ripe for discovery by law enforcement: large money transfers were noticed, explosive materials were tracked, conspirators were surveilled and Muslim informants exposed whole Islamist cells.

On the other hand, acquiring a gun, picking up a knife, or simply getting into your car requires hardly any planning at all. Islamists have realized that ersatz terror may kill fewer people than showpiece terror, but its effects are just as terrifying and its success rate is far higher.

Islamist low-tech terrorism was first advocated seriously in 2010. Al-Qaeda in Yemen (led by the late American Islamist, Anwar Al-Awlaki) encouraged Muslims to get in their pick-up trucks, which they referred to as “Ultimate Mowing Machines,” and “mow down the enemies of Allah.”

Then, in 2014, ISIS called on Western Muslims to use vehicles, knives – anything to hand: “If you are not able to find an I.E.D. or a bullet, then single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman, or any of their allies. Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him.”

Cheurfi was born in France, and had a long criminal record. From 2001, he was imprisoned for 11 years after shooting at two police officers from a stolen car. He was not identified as a possible Islamist until December 2016, according to Le Monde, after police were warned that he was planning an attack. In February, he repeated the threats on a messaging app, and was questioned by police. Then, in March, he attempted to contact ISIS fighters in Syria. By that point, he had been included on a list of 16,000 Islamists the security services deemed potential violent extremists.

Europe faces an onslaught. France, in particular, has far more potential terrorists than security service resources to stop them. Along with more effective counter-terrorism work, the only possible long-term solution for Europe, is to actively stamp out all violent and non-violent Islamist influence, and back reformist Muslims instead.

Over the past few decades, Europe’s radicalization problem has been severely exacerbated by the attitudes of government towards their Muslim communities. European state multiculturalism policy regards its citizens not as individuals, but as blocs — or communities — delineated by ethnicity, race and religion. In order to interact with these communities, governments need intermediaries to manage them. Among European Muslims, where there is no organized clergy, only the Islamists have had the wherewithal to proclaim themselves representatives of the dozens of different, fractious political and religious Islamic sects. To run the communities, governments have handed these Islamist leadership groups taxpayers’ money, political power, and influence over schools, hospitals, prisons, chaplaincy programs, among other things.

Consequently, an entire generation of European Muslims have grown up attending Islamist-run mosques, schools and community centres. Islamist politicians are elected to government offices, Muslim prisoners are placed in the care of Islamist chaplains, and Islamist charities move money to and from the Middle East – much of it partly subsidized by European taxpayers. In strictly secular France, its multiculturalism policy funds ethnic groups rather than religious ones. But because the clear majority of French Muslims are from North Africa, taxpayer subsidy of these communities ends up being claimed by the Islamists as well.

For Karim Cheurfi, radicalization was not necessarily the result of slick propaganda videos produced by Islamic State, or a particularly convincing contact on social media. His introduction to Islamism was offline – it occurred simply by virtue of the fact he was a European Muslim, surrounded and politically represented by a community under the thumb of Islamist ideologues.

For Europe to survive, the Islamists must be squashed. Funding must be cut off, both from Western governments and foreign Islamist regimes. Extremist mosques must be shut down, extremist foreign clerics should be deported, and moderate, anti-Islamist Muslims must be funded and supported. Most importantly, Western Europe must stop organizing its Muslim citizens into homogenous religious and ethnic blocs, ripe for radicalization.

Report: Israel Blows Up Big Terror Weapons Stockpile Near Damascus Airport,"Israeli jets likely took out a Hezbollah weapons depot near Damascus International Airport, Reuters reports.

The strike hit weapons freshly ferried from Iran for the Lebanese terrorist group who is fighting on behalf of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad. Israel has not confirmed the strike, and usually does not acknowledge its airstrikes inside Syria.

Israel has however acknowledged in the past that it will strike Hezbollah if the group is set to acquire advanced weaponry. Israel’s intelligence affairs minister Yisrael Katz intimated to an Israeli Army radio Wednesday that the strike was “entirely consistent with our policy to prevent the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also declared in late March, “When we identify attempts to transfer advanced weapons to Hezbollah and we have intelligence and it is operationally feasible, we act to prevent it.”

Hezbollah is a Lebanese terrorist organization that fought a war against Israel in 2006, and is sponsored by Iran. Damascus International Airport is reportedly a major conduit of Iranian arms bound for Hezbollah in Syria. The group has thousands of forces inside Syria fighting on behalf of the Syrian regime.

Israel and Syria have clashed in the past over strikes on Hezbollah. Syria even launched a series of anti-aircraft missiles at an Israeli Defense Force jet in late March, after one such strike. The missile was intercepted by Israel’s missile defense system and prompted a serious warning from the Israeli government. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman declared to Israeli media “The next time the Syrians use their air defense systems against our planes we will destroy them without the slightest hesitation.”

Israel’s commitment to carrying out strikes and warning to the Syrian regime may explain Assad’s apparent decision not to engage the Israeli aircraft bombing a target in his own capital.

"CNN, MSNBC Largely Ignore Terror Attack To Focus On Russian ‘Collusion’ Coverage [VIDEO]","CNN and MSNBC largely ignored breaking news of a terror attack Monday night in England for nearly an hour to rehash news about President Trump and accusations his campaign colluded with Russia during the election.

Initial reports of explosions at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester came in around 6 p.m. EST, and Fox News began extensive coverage of the attack around 6:50 p.m. By then at least 20 were reported dead and hundreds wounded in what was quickly becoming a clear instance of a major terror attack.

CNN’s Erin Burnett and MSNBC’s Chris Matthews were obviously eager to dive into the Washington Post report at the top of the 7:00 hour, and their segments were literally torn between that news and news of people getting blown up at the concert. WaPo reported that Trump asked two top U.S. intelligence officials to publicly deny the existence of any evidence his campaign colluded with Russia.

CNN and MSNBC briefly cut to news of the attacks before 7 p.m., but both networks opted to devote the bulk of the following hour to a discussion of news regarding the report on Trump and Russian collusion accusations. MSNBC devoted just 26 minutes of that hour to news of the massive terror attack. And CNN covered the attacks for just under 20 minutes.

“Police say there have been a number of fatalities and a serious incident after a concert at Manchester arena,” Matthews said in the opening of his segment. People at the arena are heard screaming in the background of his segment, as a video clip from the arena plays. “A senior U.S. intelligence official tells NBC news there has been an explosion. We’ll get the latest on that in a minute.”

“We begin however, with the shocking news in Washington tonight,” he continued, quickly switching to a topic deemed more important. Matthews spent the next 20 minutes discussing the report on Trump, before briefly getting back to the attack.

WATCH:

Burnett did not even mention the attack at the beginning of her segment on MSNBC. Viewers who tuned in at 7 p.m. would have had no clue the attack was happening until about 17 minutes into her show.

“Breaking news — a stunning report,” she said in her opener, teasing the report on Trump and a silly dispute over whether Melania batted his hand away on their trip Monday, but making no mention of the terror attack.

“I’m going to talk to the Washington Post reporter breaking this story,” she said. “Trump and Israel denying something he was never accused of — did he incriminate himself? And the presidential putdown. Did Melania refuse to take the president’s hand?”

WATCH:

Ten minutes later, here’s what the screens on CNN and MSNBC looked like:

Fox News, meanwhile, continued coverage of the devastating attack:

WATCH:

About two-thirds of the way into their respective segments, CNN and MSNBC gave way to the more compelling breaking news story and finally switched coverage back to the terror attack for the remainder of the hour. Both networks had spent more than 30 minutes ignoring the attack in order to focus on the negative Trump news.

While some of the details of the Washington Post report are new, the thread of the Trump campaign asking intelligence officials to tamp down on media reports accusations of collusion with Russia is old news. Reports circulated as early as February that Trump’s chief of staff Reince Priebus asked the FBI to deny reports that campaign advisers were communicating with Russian intelligence agents during the campaign.

"NIGEL FARAGE: UK No Safer Than France, Belgium From Terror [VIDEO]","Former U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said the possible terror attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester Arena Monday night has dispelled the notion Britain is safer than the rest of Europe.

“We have been lulled into a slight sense of complacency,” Farage told Fox News host Tucker Carlson Monday night.

Farage, who led the “Brexit” movement, said he didn’t want to “rush to judgement” on the motivation behind the explosion at Manchester Stadium.

“We’ve convinced ourselves that we’re in a better place than the rest of Europe on this,” Farage said, mentioning terror attacks in France and Belgium in recent years.

WATCH:

Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com



The explosion went off outside the arena after the concert ended. At least 19 people were killed and fifty more were injured.

Police are treating the explosion as a possible terror attack. NBC News reported an attacker with a backpack bomb. Many of the casualties are young girls. No terror group has taken credit for the attack, but experts say it bears all the marks of an intentional terror attack.

Islamic State-linked Twitter accounts celebrated the attack, though the group has not taken responsibility.

“This is a direct attack on children, which marks a new low” for terror attacks, Farage told Carlson, adding “we’ve convinced ourselves” the U.K. is a better place when it comes to preventing terrorism.

“Any sense that the United Kingdom is safer than France or Belgium has rather disappeared this evening,” Farage told Carlson.

BBC Anchor: We Have ‘To Get Used To’ Terror Attacks [VIDEO],"According to BBC Anchor Katty Kay, Europeans have to get used to terror attacks like the Manchester bombing.

Kay told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Tuesday that Europeans have no choice but to get used to terrorists murdering their families because “we are never going to be able to totally wipe this out.”

“Europe is getting used to attacks like this, Mika. They have to, because we are never going to be able to totally wipe this out,” Kay said.

“As ISIS gets squeezed in Syria and Iraq, we’re going to see more of these kinds of attacks taking place in Europe and Europe is starting to get used to that.”

Kay then said no one is “used to having children targeted,” further suggesting that Europeans are used to adults being killed in terror attacks.

“None of us are used to having children targeted in this way, young girls targeted in this way,” she said.

Side By Side: How Trump And Obama Respond To Terror Attacks [VIDEO],"A side by side comparison of President Donald Trump’s response to the Manchester Arena terrorist attack and President Barack Obama’s response to the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando reveal a lot about how the two perceive terror differently.

Trump addressed the tragedy in the United Kingdom that claimed 22 live and left at 59 injured in no uncertain terms, saying the victims were “murdered by evil losers in life” and targeted in a terrorist attack by extremists. He also added that: “This wicked ideology must be obliterated, and I mean completely obliterated. Life must be protected.”

WATCH:



“So many young, beautiful innocent people living and enjoying their lives murdered by evil losers in life,” Trump said in response to the attack. “I won’t call them monsters because they would like that term. They would think that’s a great name. I will call them from now on losers, because that’s what they are. They’re losers. And we’ll have more of them. But they’re losers. Just remember that.”

In the wake of the Pulse Nightclub shooting carried out by an Islamic extremist, Obama took a more measured tone. While pointing out the event was an “act of terror,” Obama went on to say they reached “no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer.” Obama also added that he directed authorities to “spare no effort to determine what — if any — inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups.”

WATCH:



Obama also used the incident to bring up gun laws in the United States, saying “reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.”

Eyewitnesses Say Community Police Fled From Scene Of Terror Stabbings At Borough Market,"Multiple eyewitnesses said that community police officers fled from Borough Market in London after seeing two men with knives stabbing people as part of a terror attack Saturday.

These eyewitnesses told The Guardian’s Lisa O’Carroll that two men started stabbing people outside a restaurant in Borough Market, close to where the first terror attack took place on London Bridge, resulting in multiple fatalities.

“I saw two guys with big knives downstairs outside Roast. They were stabbing people,” the eyewitnesses said.

Perhaps the most jarring part of the testimony was a report that, instead of running to the stabbing to stop it, the police turned around and ran the other way.

“The police were running away, they were community police. They were normal officers, they were running away,” the eyewitnesses said.

With the police out of sight, onlookers began yelling “stop, stop” and throwing chairs.

But then police arrived at the scene and “shot straight away.”

Police community support officers (PCSOs) operate usually in a paid, full-time role, and while “PCSOs do not have the same powers as regular police officers, they still carry a lot of responsibility, and are a critical part of the police service.”

More than 90 percent of police officers in London do not carry guns and instead carry mace, handcuffs, batons and, on occasion, a stun gun.

Mere hours after the events took place on London Bridge and at Borough Market, Metropolitan Police labeled them as terror attacks.

"Two Days Before Terror Attacks, London Mayor Called Global Warming ‘One Of The Biggest Risks To Humanity’","Two days before deadly terror attacks hit London, Mayor Sadiq Khan railed against President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.

Khan called global warming “one of the biggest risks to humanity” and pledged to work with other cities to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, which is to keep future global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. Trump announced U.S. withdrawal Thursday.

Climate change remains one the biggest risks to humanity. Now more than ever world leaders must recognise and act on this threat. pic.twitter.com/ZKc3crHLTs — Mayor of London (@MayorofLondon) June 1, 2017

European leaders were also heavily critical of Trump for pulling out of the Paris accord, including U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May.

European leaders pressed Trump on the climate deal at the G7 summit in May, but Trump mainly wanted to talk about fighting terrorism and other issues, not global warming.

Two days later and Khan is faced with two attacks near London Bridge that have been declared terrorist attacks by British authorities.

A white van plowed into about 20 people Saturday on London Bridge shortly after 10 p.m., possibly killing and injuring pedestrians. A group of at least three men armed with knives then attacked people in Borough Market about 80 yards south of the bridge.

British police declared that the two incidents were terror attacks early Sunday morning. Few details have been released regarding any casualties or the attackers.

At 0025hrs 4/6/17 the incidents at #LondonBridge & #BoroughMarket were declared as terrorist incidents. — Metropolitan Police (@metpoliceuk) June 3, 2017

The London attacks came about two weeks after a suicide bomber killed 22 people and dozens more were injured in Manchester just outside the lobby of an Ariana Grande concert. Young children were among the dead, and the Islamic State took credit for the deadly attack.

Grande is scheduled to hold a benefit concert in Manchester Sunday.

Update: Khan issued a statement condemning the terror attack, calling them “deliberate and cowardly.”

MSNBC Anchor Wonders If Trump Trying To Provoke A Terror Attack To Prove A Point [VIDEO],"MSNBC anchor Thomas Roberts theorized on Sunday that President Trump is trying to provoke a terrorist attack on U.S. soil in order to “prove himself right” about Islamic terrorism.

Roberts floated the theory during two separate interviews, one with Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and another with former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean.

Roberts pointed to Trump’s tweets early Sunday in the wake of a terrorist attack that left at least seven dead in London.

Trump wrote that “we must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people.” He also criticized London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, who said that there was “no reason to be alarmed” following the attacks.

“The president doesn’t want us to be politically correct, right? So let’s not be PC about this. Is the president trying to provoke a domestic terrorist attack with this Twitter rant, because only to prove himself right?” Roberts asked Reed during an interview.

WATCH:

Reed dodged the question.

But Roberts pushed his theory again, in an interview several minutes later with Dean.

“I asked this of Mayor Reed, but it seems like the president is trying to provoke something that he can politicize more for his own gain in America. Do you feel that way?” Roberts asked.

Even Dean, never one to shy away from making bombastic claims on television, appeared not to buy Roberts’ theory.

He laughed nervously and avoided Roberts’ query.

“Well, I think he’s totally incompetent,” he responded.

Trump And WH Aide Go After London’s Mayor Following Terror Attack,"President Donald Trump and White House aide Dan Scavino criticized London Mayor Sadiq Khan Sunday for his response to Islamic terrorism.

“At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!,'” Trump tweeted. This seems to be a misquote from the president, as in context Khan was speaking about the police presence in the days to come. Three terrorists rammed a car into London Bridge pedestrians Saturday night and continued to go on a stabbing rampage.

At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is “no reason to be alarmed!” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017

The mayor said in a statement Sunday that: “Londoners will say an increase police presence today and over the course of the next few days. No reason to be alarmed.” A spokesman for the mayor said that Khan “has more important things to do” than reply to an “ill-informed” Trump tweet.

Trump and Khan have had a longstanding feud of sorts. The Mayor of London tweeted in May 2016 that “Trump’s ignorant view of Islam could make both our countries less safe. It risks alienating mainstream Muslims. London has proved him wrong.”

At the time, Scavino, who manages Trump’s social media, replied to Khan and said, “it’s called not being politically correct.” The president’s aide brought back attention to this Sunday and tweeted, “[Mayor of London] – refer to below tweet 13 months ago, after you criticized…now President [Trump] — and WAKE UP!!!!”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2017/06/04/trump-and-wh-aide-go-after-londons-mayor-following-terror-attack/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj4usaMgLT9AhXKFFkFHTSgCAQ4UBAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw1nGGkarQPeKA5c0P-KqGq1,2017-06-04
Trump On Terror Attack In Iran: What Goes Around Comes Around,"President Donald Trump said in a statement Wednesday about a terror attack in Iran that “states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote.”

At least 12 were killed after suicide bombers and gunmen attacked the Iranian parliament and the Mausoleum of Ayatollah Khomeini Wednesday in Tehran. The Islamic State promptly claimed responsibility for the attack, and Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have pointed at Saudi Arabia as being guilty.

“We grieve and pray for the innocent victims of the terrorist attacks in Iran, and for the Iranian people, who are going through such challenging times,” Trump said in a statement. “We underscore that states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote.”

While Iran is considered a state sponsor of terror by the U.S., it has not backed radical Sunni groups like ISIS.

More Footage Leaks Of CNN’s ‘Staged’ Muslim Anti-Terror Protest [VIDEO],"Early this week, CNN was accused of staging a Muslim-led anti-terror protest after the London terror attacks. Now, more footage has dropped that shows what happened on the scene before the CNN shot was taken.

A Youtube video taken by Claire Jordan shows her milling around the scene and “protest” prior to CNN lining up the protesters for their on-air shot. (VIDEO: CNN Responds To Claims They Staged A Muslim Anti-Terror Protest)

There is a group of people in the area, both Muslim and non-Muslim, and some of them can be seen handing out bouquets of flowers and posters.

Jordan, narrating the video, observes, “you see more press than anyone else.”

Jordan then crosses the street and shows the Muslim women who were featured on the CNN broadcast. They are located on the opposite side of the street and “they’re taking selfies, none of them have got flowers.”

“I was there just before,” she explains, “and you see, again, this is the group of women and the little boy–they’re just getting their posters now.”

The Muslim women then gather their posters and cross the street to set up for the CNN shot that was used in the broadcast.

How The Flint Terror Suspect May Have Debunked The ‘Gun Show Loophole’,"The man charged with stabbing a police officer, in what could be ruled as terrorism, tried but failed to purchase a firearm shortly before Wednesday’s attack at Bishop International Airport in Flint, Mich.

Amor Ftouhi, a Tunisian national with Canadian citizenship, tried to purchase a gun at the Gibraltar Trade Center, a massive public market with hundreds of vendors outside Detroit, according to Fox 2. Ftouhi resorted to using a large knife when he stabbed police Lieutenant Jeff Neville in the neck.

The FBI confirmed that Ftouhi tried to purchase a gun inside the United States, but would not confirm where. Agents said that Ftouhi was rejected early in the process because he is not a U.S. citizen.

News that Ftouhi tried and failed to purchase a gun pushes back against concerns of a “gun show loophole.” The term refers to the sale of firearms by private citizens who are not required to perform background checks.

Federal law requires licensed gun sellers to run background checks on potential buyers. Gun control activists argue that the perceived loophole must be closed up, while gun rights advocates argue that there isn’t a loophole and that it’s unconstitutional for the federal government to regulate the transfer of firearms between private citizens.

While some states have enacted its own statutes, no background check is required for the private sale of rifles or shotguns in Michigan. To purchase a handgun in Michigan, prospective buyers must have either a handgun purchase license or a conceal carry license, both of which require a background check.

It is unclear what Ftouhi attempted to purchase. While Ftouhi was able to purchase a large hunting knife, he was not able to obtain a firearm because he wasn’t a citizen.

The FBI said that Ftouhi crossed into the United States legally from Canada on Friday, June 16. Government officials say he purchased a serrated “Amazon Survival Jungle” knife in Lake Champlain, New York shortly after his arrival into the states.

Ftouhi is facing 20 years in federal prison for violence at an international airport. Neville was reported to be in good condition by doctors.

"‘Mega Terror Attacks’ Possible Through Cyber, Says Former Israeli Intel Chief","Rapid advances in the cyber realm have opened up the possibility for “mega terror attacks,” according to a former Israeli intelligence chief.

Terrorists would have a hard time obtaining a nuclear bomb, but a major cyber attack could be “relatively simple,” Yuval Diskin, former director of Israel’s Shin Bet domestic security service (also known as Shabak), warned reporters during a briefing last Tuesday at Tel Aviv University’s Cyber Week conference. He noted that, while terrorists will likely continue their traditional tactics, cyber opens up a “new field of attacks.”

“I think that you will have terrorists that carry out attacks inside the state by using people and guns and other things, and there will be guys more sophisticated, or more technical guys that will try to take down an airplane by attacking it,” said Diskin, who now serves as chairman of CyMotive Technologies, an auto industry cyber security firm. “And this is something that I am really worried about … because I think it is already possible, these kinds of attacks are already possible.”

Thus far, major terrorist groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaida have used the cyber realm more as a recruiting tool than a weapon. The internet and social media have remained primary recruiting grounds for jihadists across the globe for nearly two decades, but there is also room for offensive measures.

While such an attack hasn’t yet happened, Diskin believes that it will only take someone with the interest, capability and opportunity.

“It will happen, I promise you, I’m sorry to promise you, it is going to happen,” said Diskin.

Other security officials have also warned of the potential for cyber terrorism. Former FBI agent Andre McGregor, who specializes in cyber crime, warned attendees at the RSA 2016 conference that terror groups could target a nation’s critical infrastructure in an attempt to sow chaos, according to Security Week.

When asked to elaborate on what a “mega terror attack” would look like, Diskin demurred.

“I don’t want to give ideas to the bad guys … I have a very creative mind,” said the former Shin Bet chief, adding that he could give an example of how to engage in a chaotic terrorist attack in Tel Aviv in just two hours.

CNN’s Cuomo Calls ‘Extreme Right’ The ‘Number One Domestic Terror Threat’ In America,"CNN’s Chris Cuomo labeled the “extreme right” as “the number one domestic terror threat in the U.S.” Thursday while co-hosting “New Day.”

“If you take anarchists at their worst, do you have malefactor? Do you have criminals in their ranks? Do you have people who do violent things? Yes, yes, yes, yes. That is not a moral equivalency to the KKK,” Cuomo said. “It’s certainly not an equivalent to what we see on the right. Just look at the stats. The number one domestic terror threat in the U.S. is the extreme right. There is not even a close second.”

“That’s all they’re about is hate. Two out of three people on this panel they don’t want to exist!”

Cuomo was speaking with CNN commentator Bob Ferguson, whom he accused of trying to equate groups like Antifa with the KKK. Ferguson defended his position and said people must realize violence and chaos doesn’t stop with white supremacy groups.

“What I’m saying is there are individuals in this country, human beings in the country that do want a race war, and do want to cause violence and pain and even death to other people,” Ferguson said.

Cuomo interrupted Ferguson, “Yes! they’re called the KKK. They’re called white supremacists and neo-Nazis.”

“This is where people are so hyper focused on one issue only that they are completely missing the point that many Americans understand,” Ferguson replied. “There is no doubt that the KKK, white supremacists, neo-Nazis are disgusting and vile, despicable human beings. That should be able to be a statement that is stand alone on it’s own.”

Ferguson asked if it was possible to have a second, separate conversation about violence stirred up intentionally, meant to increase racial hostilities and bring about a race war.

“There are violent people out there that when they see an opportunity to become violent, when they see an opportunity to create a race war that they do show up everywhere and travel around the country to try to have a race war,” Ferguson said. “There are people that want to do that.”

Police Arrest Second Suspect In Connection With Barcelona Terror Attack,"The president of Spain’s Catalonia region confirmed that police have arrested a second suspect in connection with the van attack in Barcelona’s Las Ramblas district Thursday.

Two men are in custody following the attack, which left 12 people dead and at least 80 more injured, Carles Puigdemont said at a news conference, according to the Associated Press.

A rental van jumped the sidewalk in Las Ramblas on Thursday afternoon, mowing down pedestrians walking along the tree-lined street. Spanish authorities declared the incident a terrorist attack, and the Islamic State claimed responsibility just hours later. (RELATED: ISIS Claims Responsibility For Barcelona Attack)

State-owned broadcaster RTVE had previously reported that a man was detained a few hours after the attack. Spanish media also reported that police were searching for a man named Driss Oukabir, who was suspected of having rented the van.

Catalonian officials have not confirmed if Oukabir is one of the men in custody.

In a separate incident Thursday afternoon, Catalonian police shot and killed a man who was in a car that hit two officers at a security checkpoint in Barcelona. Police have not said if the incident was connected to the Las Ramblas van attack.

US Citizen Pleads Guilty To Supporting Somali Terror Group Al-Shabaab,"U.S. citizen Maalik Alim Jones has pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide material support to Somalia-based terror group al-Shabaab.

Jones, 32, left his wife back home and flew to Kenya from New York in 2011, traveling to Somalia via land once he had arrived in Kenya. Upon entering Somalia, Jones immediately began working with al-Shabaab and receiving military training from the terror group, including how to operate an AK-47 and rocket-propelled grenades, according to a Department of Justice press release.

“I knew that my actions were a violation of the laws of the United States,” Jones said.

Jones quickly moved up the ranks to join al-Shabaab’s special unit, known as Jaysh Ayman. As part of that unit, Jones attacked soldiers from the Kenyan government.

In total, Jones fought for four years as part of al-Shabaab.

Somali authorities arrested Jones in December 2015 as he was trying to head to Yemen, at which point he was sent back to the United States.

“Jones pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide material support to al Shabaab, by traveling abroad to join and fight on behalf of the foreign terrorist organization for four years,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Dana Boente. “I want to thank the many prosecutors, agents, and analysts who made this result possible.”

“As he admitted in court today, Maalik Jones traveled to Somalia, was trained by al Shabaab in the use of an AK-47 and rocket-propelled grenades and took up arms for four years as a terrorist fighter,” said New York Acting Attorney Joon Kim. “For his allegiance to this lawless, terrorist organization that vows to destroy America and its values, Maalik Jones been held to account in an American court of law. All that is left is for him to be sentenced for his crimes.”

Jones faces sentencing Jan. 25, 2018. The maximum sentence for material support of a terrorist organization is 15 years in prison, but that doesn’t include other charges, like receiving military training from al-Shabaab. Accounting for those other charges, Jones faces a sentence of up to life in prison.

Jones has been detained since December 2015.

NHL Player Calls For Tighter Immigration Controls After Terror Attack By Somali Refugee,"Arizona Coyotes forward Max Domi said Canada needs to more closely examine who it allows to immigrate following a terror attack by a Somali refugee in Edmonton on Saturday.

Domi, who was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and grew up in the Toronto area, tweeted Sunday that the attack serves as a reminder of why Canadians need to be more “aware” of who is let into the country.

“Really hope everyone in Edmonton is ok,” Domi said. “We’re behind you. This is why we have to be aware of some of the people we let into our country.”

Domi posted his tweet the day after Abdulahi Hasan Sharif was arrested after going on a rampage in downtown Edmonton. The 30-year-old Somali refugee allegedly plowed his car into police crowd-control barricade near the city’s football stadium, knocking a police officer to the ground. Sharif then got out of the car and proceeded to stab the officer repeatedly, according to investigators.

Sharif fled the scene on foot and was later arrested after ramming a different vehicle into a group of pedestrians during a police chase. Officers discovered an Islamic State flag in the car that stuck the police officer, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described the incident as a terror attack, reports Fox News.

Trudeau has portrayed Canada as a welcoming country for immigrants and refugees, contrasting his policies with the Trump administration’s travel ban and tougher immigration enforcement. As the U.S. has reduced its intake of refugees and tightened rules on asylum claims, thousands of Somali immigrants have illegally crossed the border into Canada to apply for asylum.

Edmonton police have not disclosed when Sharif arrived in Canada, but officials said he was investigated in 2015 for allegedly espousing extremism. Sharif was not arrested at that time due to insufficient evidence, reports CBC News.

Domi’s tweet about being being aware of who immigrates to Canada drew outrage from some Twitter users, who accused the NHL player of racism. Others claimed that white men were a far bigger threat to Canada than refugees.

Domi responded to critics Sunday night, tweeting that he was not trying to single out any race or religion, just “bad people” that could come to Canada to commit attacks.

“I was not disrespecting any race or religion,” he said. “I’m talking about the bad people that can come over here and harm our country. # isis”

“Do you care if anyone comes into our country and causes harm to our friends and family,” Domi added. “Seriously. Let’s have a conversation about this.”

Facebook Describing NYC Terror Attack As ‘The Violent Incident’,"Facebook has labeled the Tuesday terrorist attack in New York City “The Violent Incident in Manhattan, New York,” completely skirting any mention of terror motivations.

The feature pops up when users mark themselves as safe and makes no mention of the words “terror” or “attack.” The suspect, 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, is from Uzbekistan and was living in the United States on a green card.

After running over a row of bikers, Saipov also hit a school bus before jumping out and shouting the Islamic term “Allahu Akbar.” He than began running through traffic brandishing fake firearms. Police later shot him and took him to a nearby hospital to be treated.

Thus far eight have died in the attack and at least 11 have been injured. The police officer who wounded Saipov was described as having “lit him up” by a police department official, and is credited with saving lives.

Obama’s Tweet On Terror Attack Leaves Out Key Detail,"Former President Barack Obama tweeted about Tuesday’s New York City terror attack, and noticeably left out a major point concerning the nature of the incident.

Obama made no mention of the word “terror” or “terrorist” and simply referred to Tuesday’s events as “today’s attack.”

Michelle and I are thinking of the victims of today’s attack in NYC and everyone who keeps us safe. New Yorkers are as tough as they come. — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) November 1, 2017

The suspect in the attack, 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, is an Uzbek national staying in the U.S. on a green card, and was heard shouting “Allahu Akbar” after running over a row of bikers with a truck in lower Manhattan.

The FBI has taken over the investigation and deemed the incident terror related. President Donald Trump was a frequent critic of Obama for not calling out “radical Islamic extremism,” and has made it a central issue of his administration.

When will President Obama issue the words RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM? He can’t say it, and unless he will, the problem will not be solved! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2015

After being wounded, Saipov was taken into custody and then transported to a nearby hospital to be treated.

The Russian Revolution And Terror Of Marxism-Leninism,"Russian President Vladimir Putin would like to ignore the Bolshevik Revolution, which marks its 100th anniversary next month. Putin reportedly told his advisers that it would be unnecessary to commemorate the occasion. He knows better—it is nothing to be proud of.

The horrors of twentieth-century socialism—of Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, Mao, and Pol Pot—were the offspring of 1917. Seventy years earlier, Marx and Engels predicted the overthrow of bourgeois rule would require violence and “a dictatorship of the proletariat . . . to weed out remaining capitalist elements.” Lenin conducted this “weeding out” using indiscriminate terror, as Russian socialists before him had done and others would continue to do after his death.

The late Rudolph Rummel, the demographer of government mass murder, estimated the human toll of twentieth-century socialism to be about 61 million in the Soviet Union, 78 million in China, and roughly 200 million worldwide. These victims perished during state-organized famines, collectivization, cultural revolutions, purges, campaigns against “unearned” income, and other devilish experiments in social engineering.

In its monstrosity, this terror is unrivaled in the course of human history.

Lenin’s coup on November 7, 1917, the day Kerensky’s provisional government fell to Bolshevik forces, opened a new stage in human history: a regime of public slavery. Collectivist economic planning led to coercion, violence, and mass murder. Marx and Engels had defined socialism as “the abolition of private property.” The most fundamental component of private property, self-ownership, was abolished first.

The Marxists’ biggest targets have always been the family, religion, and civil society—institutional obstacles to the imposition of the omnipotent state. With the Bolsheviks in power, Lenin set out to destroy them.

Murder of children became a norm after he ordered the extermination of Czar Nicholas II, his wife Alexandra, and their five children. Millions of families were rounded up and forcibly relocated to remote and uninhabited regions in Siberia and Kazakhstan. Hundreds of thousands of children died of starvation or disease during their journey into exile and were buried in mass unmarked graves.

In 1935, Stalin introduced Article 12 of the USSR Criminal Code, which permitted that children age twelve and older be sentenced to death or imprisonment as adults. This “law” was directed at the orphans of victims of the regime, based on the belief that an apple never falls far from the tree. Many of these kids, whose parents had been jailed or executed, were commonly known as bezprizorni, street children. They found themselves living in bare, dirty cells in a savagely violent gulag, where they were mixed with dangerous criminals and were brutalized and raped by guards and common criminals.

The Soviet Union was the first state to have as an ideological and practical objective the elimination of religion or, in other words, physical extermination of religious people. With Lenin’s decree of January 20, 1918, nationalization of the church’s property began: cathedrals, churches, church grounds, and all buildings owned by churches were looted, and valuables (gold, silver, platinum, paintings, icons, historical artifacts) were either stolen by Communist atheists or sold to the West via government agents, communist sympathizers, and fellow travelers such as American business tycoon Armand Hammer, who met Lenin in 1921.

To be religious often meant a death sentence. The goal was the state’s absolute monopoly over thought by means of a secular religion, socialism. Almost all clergy and millions of believers of all (traditional) religions were shot or sent to labor camps. Seminaries were closed, and religious publications were prohibited.

Marxism-Leninism pretended to be “scientific socialism,” the universal explanation of nature, life, and society. However, deviation from its ideology, especially traditional “bourgeois” science, was punishable by death. The scope of the persecution of scientists was a real genocide.

After seventy-four years of mayhem and misery, the Bolshevik Revolution failed. The biggest country on Earth, with abundant natural resources of all kinds, could not meet the basic needs of its citizenry. The system had no means to rationally allocate resources in the absence of property rights and the market institutions that rely on them.

From my own life in the Soviet Union, which ended the same year that Vladimir Putin reported on the collapsing Berlin Wall for his KGB bosses, I can attest to the truth of Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises’s statement that socialism amounts to a “revolt against economics.”

Yet, socialism still has sympathizers in the West. Many Americans believe that socialism is good, whereas communism, fascism, and Nazism (National Socialism) are violent and antidemocratic. A public-opinion survey published last year proved that general assumption: 43 percent of respondents younger than thirty had a favorable view of socialism; only 32 percent had a favorable view of capitalism. This is a powerful warning. The anticapitalistic mentality has brought suffering and mass murder in all socialist countries and has reduced standards of living and the quality of life in mixed economies.

The Soviet Union is now gone, as are the huge statues of Marx and Lenin that littered the East, but ideas have consequences, and no body of ideas attracted a greater following than Marxism-Leninism. A Russian aphorism says, “The only lesson of history is that it teaches us nothing.” For too many people this is as true as ever.

Vehicle Terror Attacks Becoming New Normal,"Vehicular terrorist attacks are increasingly becoming the new normal in the West, a Daily Caller News Foundation review reveals.

Terrorists have used vehicles as weapons periodically since the mid-2000s, but the tactic recently gained steam with use by Palestinian jihadists against Israeli’s in late 2014. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula also encouraged the tactic in 2010 saying “pick your location and timing carefully. Go for the most crowded locations … The ideal location is a place where there are a maximum number of pedestrians and the least number of vehicles.”

The Islamic State quickly adopted the tactic after its inception in 2014 and began encouraging such attacks with success in the West.

The first high profile vehicular attack took place on Bastille Day in Nice, France, when a Tunisian born man inspired by ISIS ran down hundreds of people, killing 84. The tactic then appeared again when a Tunisian asylum seeker plowed a truck into a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016, and when a Somalian-American national plunged his car into students at Ohio State University in November 2016.

London since this time has been hit twice by vehicular terrorist attacks in 2017, both in crowded tourist areas killing more than a dozen. The last major vehicular terrorist attack in the West occurred in Barcelona in mid-August when a young jihadist terror cell rented van that plowed into Las Ramblas, a well known tourist site.

Police are now investigating a man who reportedly shouted “Allahu Akbar” plowed into pedestrians in lower Manhattan Tuesday evening as an act of terrorism.

CNN Repeatedly Cited Groups Accused Of Terror Ties,"A number of news articles published by CNN cited groups accused of ties to terror groups, even promoting donations to one group on two occasions.

CNN.com published two separate articles promoting donations to a group called Islamic Relief USA.

One article from 2015 titled, “Help victims of the Nepal earthquake,” promotes donations to a number of charities that CNN claims to have “vetted.”

Among them is Islamic Relief USA, a group that is a sister organization of Islamic Relief Worldwide. As reported by The Daily Caller, Islamic Relief Worldwide has been banned from Israel and the United Arab Emirates for allegedly financially supporting Hamas and other terror organizations. (RELATED: Investigation: Foundations Gave Millions To Groups Accused Of Terror Ties)

Another article from 2013 about helping Syrian refugees promotes donations to Islamic Relief USA, writing that the group, “[provides] food parcels, housing essentials and medical supplies for those displaced inside Syria and the refugees in Jordan and Lebanon.”

Islamic Relief has once accepted tens of thousands of dollars from a charity founded by Sheik Abd-al-Majid al-Zindani, “Charitable Society for Social Welfare.”

Al-Zindani was previously designated as terrorist in 2004 by the U.S. and the United Nations.

In 2008, The Washington Post reported that federal prosecutors in 2005 described Zindani’s organization as “a front organization” “used to support al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.”

Islamic Relief accepted funding from the al-Qaeda-linked group as recently as 2009.

The Gatestone Institute, a think tank focused on Middle East issues, claimed that Islamic Relief Worldwide, a “sister organization” to the CNN-promoted Islamic Relief USA, “appears to be a hub for donations from charities accused of links to Al Qaeda and other terror groups.”

A number of other organizations accused of having questionable ties to terror have been cited by CNN as an authoritative voice, often on Muslim-American issues.

A news article on CNN.com from after Donald Trump’s 2016 election win, titled, “Muslims respond to hate letters: ‘You’re not going to scare us,’” purports that a wave of Islamophobia is currently targeting Muslim Americans.

The article uncritically cites a quote from Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC) president Salam Al-Marayati, who said at a press conference, “You are a coward unless you come here and debate the points that you apparently believe so much in.”

MPAC also has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, and previously lobbied for Hamas and Hezbollah to be taken off the United States list of terrorist organizations.

CNN.com also published an op-ed titled, “No, ISIS doesn’t represent Islam,” from Al-Marayati in 2015.

Al-Marayati previously inferred that Israel could be responsible for 9/11, saying it should be on a “suspect” list over the attack. (RELATED: Muslim DHS Advisor Called Israel A ‘Suspect’ In September 11 Attacks)

CNN has also uncritically cited the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA) in an article about Muslim contributions to the United States after Donald Trump’s call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration.

ICNA supports the creation of an Islamic caliphate, and previously hosted an al-Qaeda recruiter at its 2002 conference. ICNA also has ties to terror on U.S. soil. (RELATED: New York Terrorist’s Mosque Has Ties To Fundamentalist Islamic Umbrella Group)

The Muslim American Society (MAS) was also uncritically cited in a CNN article from August after an apparently targeted explosion at a mosque.

CNN wrote, “The Muslim American Society of Minnesota’s executive director said six groups are offering a reward of $24,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrator.”

The article then quotes Imam Asad Zaman, described as the “executive director of the group,” who said, “We are saddened at the unprovoked hate crime. We are thankful to our elected officials and law enforcement who have acted speedily to repudiate such a horrible hate crime. And we are hopeful about our neighbors and about the interfaith community that have come forward in a show of support.”

According to a court filing, federal prosecutors said MAS was “founded as the overt arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in America.”

Both MAS and ICNA, two groups cited by CNN, held a 2009 convention that “served as a forum for religious scholars and political activists to rail against Jews, call for the eradication of the state of Israel and accuse the United States government as waging a war against Muslims at home and abroad,” according to the ADL.

CNN did not respond with a comment by press time.

Nearly 30k Diversity Visas Have Been Given To Immigrants From Terror States,"Nearly 30,000 foreigners from state sponsors of terrorism have gotten visas since 2007 through the diversity visa lottery.

President Donald Trump wants Congress to end the program, which benefits foreigners from nations that don’t have high levels of immigration to the U.S. He increased his public pressure against the program after an Uzbek recipient of the diversity visa lottery allegedly killed eight in a recent terrorist attack in New York City.

Statistics released by the White House Monday show that since 2007 the program has given permanent residence visas — green cards — to 20,739 Iranians, 7,232 Sudanese and 812 Syrians.

The program gives out 50,000 visas annually to immigrants chosen at random.

“One of the main national security weaknesses that experts have identified in the diversity visa program is the lack of restrictions on admissions,” the House Judiciary Committee wrote in a 2004 report.

“First, there are few restrictions on the countries from which applicants may come. … Second, under the program, successful applicants are chosen at random. Consequently, those aliens who win the diversity visa lottery do not necessarily have any ties to the United States. … Because diversity visa winners do not necessarily have such ties, the program could offer an opportunity for individuals or groups who want to harm the United States, its institutions, and its people to place terrorists in the United States. … Any potential terrorist who did win the diversity visa lottery could live here freely, and come and go with little scrutiny.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2017/11/13/nearly-30k-diversity-visas-have-been-given-to-immigrants-from-terror-states/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjJgsiKgLT9AhXUF1kFHcZQAmA4MhAWegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw2k5-c9vd8kECALMfSXVAbl,2017-11-13
FBI Official Says A Domestic Terror Statute Would Be Helpful,"An FBI counterterrorism official said Wednesday at a Senate hearing that it would be helpful to have a domestic terror statute to defend the country against domestic terrorists.

At a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee hearing, Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri asked the question of whether the FBI would find it useful to have a domestic terror statute on the books. Currently there is a criminal statute for international terrorism, but not domestic terrorism — an issue that has come to the forefront in the wake of antifa violence, the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., and Stephen Paddock’s massacre in Las Vegas.

eputy assistant director for counterterrorism at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, answered in the affirmative.

“Regarding domestic terrorism, you are absolutely correct, there is not a statute. We cannot charge someone with material support to a domestic terrorism group, and we actually do not have designated domestic terrorism groups,” Floris said. “Whether or not that statute would help, I would certainly defer to my colleagues at the Department of Justice. But absolutely I believe that would help as another tool to defending the nation against domestic extremists.”

For domestic extremists with no connection to overseas organizations, usually federal authorities pursue charges like using a weapon of mass destruction or straight weapons and murder charges.

FBI Director Christopher Wray said in September there was a discussion about the creation of a domestic terror statute. At the time, Wray hinted at support for such a statute, saying the FBI “can always use more tools,” but shied away from explicit support.

The discussion of a domestic terror statute in September emerged out of the aftermath of a white nationalist car attack in Charlottesville on Aug. 12, that left one person dead. Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the incident an act of “domestic terrorism,” however, there technically is no such statute to prosecute individuals, though the idea was brewing in former President Barack Obama’s Department of Justice.

There is a significant debate surrounding the issue.

Domestic terrorists would undergo the same legal treatment as Muslim terrorists animated by foreign organizations, but having a formal list of domestic terrorist organizations would enable the full intelligence and legal apparatus of the state to be deployed on a much wider scale. This includes surveillance without a warrant and detention in a military prison without being charged or put on trial.

Trump Blames NYC Terror Attack On Immigration Policies,"President Donald Trump called for immigration reforms Monday after a Bangladeshi immigrant allegedly exploded a pipe bomb in New York City.

“Today’s attempted mass murder attack in New York City—the second terror attack in New York in the last two months—once again highlights the urgent need for Congress to enact legislative reforms to protect the American people,” Trump said in a statement.

The alleged terrorist Akayed Ullah, 27, entered the U.S. in 2011 through extended family chain migration. The terror attack left four, including Ullah, injured.

Statistics released by the White House revealed that 142,000 Bangladesh nationals have been permanently resettled in the U.S. on the basis of familial ties since 2005. (RELATED: More Than 70 Percent Of Immigrants Came From Chain Migration)

“Today’s terror suspect entered our country through extended-family chain migration, which is incompatible with national security. My Executive action to restrict the entry of certain nationals from eight countries, which the Supreme Court recently allowed to take effect, is just one step forward in securing our immigration system. Congress must end chain migration,” Trump said.

“Congress must also act on my administration’s other proposals to enhance domestic security, including increasing the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, enhancing the arrest and detention authorities for immigration officers, and ending fraud and abuse in our immigration system,” the president stated. “The terrible harm that this flawed system inflicts on America’s security and economy has long been clear. I am determined to improve our immigration system to put our country and our people first.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agrees with Trump’s desire for chain migration reforms, and a bill introduced last week by key Senate Republicans would achieve this policy change.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2017/12/11/trump-blames-nyc-terror-attack-on-immigration-policies/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi-_pyJgLT9AhXaKFkFHbmPCd84HhAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw3ymqH-9pu5k-Opq-rLKdSc,2017-12-11
Germany Ends Year With Fivefold Increase In Terror Investigations,"Germany opened five times as many terror investigations this year compared to 2016, newspaper Tagesschau reported Saturday.

Authorities launched around 1,200 investigations involving suspected terrorism acts throughout the year. Some 1,000 of them had an Islamist background. The total number marks a fivefold increase from an estimated 250 investigations in 2016.

The court system is having a hard time keeping up with the surge. Regional authorities are now handling about a third of the cases. The judges’ association has requested more staff in response to the trend.

Not all cases involve plans to carry out attacks. Migrants from Syran, Iraq and Afghanistan have been tried over alleged membership in terror groups without being suspected of planning attacks on European soil.

Germany’s federal police (BKA) estimates 705 Islamist extremists are willing to carry out terror attacks, up from 600 during an estimate in February. Germany’s domestic intelligence agency (BfV) recently said around 24,400 Islamists are active in the country but most of them don’t pose an immediate terror threat.

BKA chief Holger Münch told daily newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau in July that the danger from the far-right and far-left is minor compared to threats posed by jihadis.

“In the left-wing scene, the [German] states have currently estimated a number that can be counted on the fingers of one hand,” Münch said. “In the right-wing scene, the number is in the low double digits.”

DHS: Suspects In Terror-Related Crimes Came To US Through Chain Migration,"Two suspects in recent terrorism-related cases were able to move to the U.S. through chain migration, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

In a statement shared Saturday on Twitter, Acting DHS Press Secretary Tyler Houlton said the agency could “confirm the suspect involved in a terror attack in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and another suspect arrested on terror-related money laundering charges were both beneficiaries of extended family chain migration.”

BREAKING: My statement on Immigration Backgrounds of Recent Terror-Related Suspects: pic.twitter.com/I3JfZOfuBh — Tyler Q. Houlton (@SpoxDHS) December 24, 2017

In the Harrisburg incident, Ahmed Aminamin El-Mofty allegedly went on a shooting spree near the state Capitol building, targeting police officers in multiple surprise attacks. He injured one state trooper before being shot and killed by police.

Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Marisco said there was “no doubt” El-Mofty was deliberately trying to kill police.

“He fired several shots at a Capitol police officer and at a Pennsylvania state police trooper in marked vehicles,” Marsico told reporters Saturday, according to the Associated Press.

El-Mofty was a naturalized citizen from Egypt who was originally admitted to the U.S. on a family-based visa, according to DHS.

“The long chain of migration that led to the suspect’s admission into the United States was initiated years ago by a distant relative of the suspect,” Houlton said.

Chain migration, or extended-family immigration, is the process by which a recent arrival to the U.S. can sponsor relatives for immigrant visas of their own. Critics of the system say it allows too much immigration on the basis of family ties alone, instead of potential economic contributions or ability to assimilate. About 70 percent of all immigrants admitted to the U.S. over the last decade were chain migration immigrants.

Houlton’s statement also referred to the case of Zoobia Shahnaz, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Pakistan. On Dec. 14, Shahnaz was indicted for allegedly laundering more than $85,000 through Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to fund Islamic State fighters overseas. She sent the funds to people in Pakistan, China and Turkey and planned to travel to Syria to fight with the remnants of ISIS, according to federal investigators.

Shahnaz came to the U.S. on an F43 visa, which is granted to the children of siblings of U.S. citizens. The F4 category has come under scrutiny in recent months, after homeland security officials revealed the suspects in two separate terror attacks in New York were admitted on F43 visas.

“Both chain migration and the diversity visa lottery program have been exploited by terrorists to attack our country,” Houlton said. “Not only are the programs less effective at driving economic growth than merit-based immigration systems used by nearly all other countries, the programs make it more difficult to keep dangerous people out of the United States and to protect the safety of every American.”

The Trump administration and several GOP lawmakers have called for reforms to the chain migration system, possibly as a part of a bill that gives legal status to recipients of the now-cancelled Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

Supreme Court Won’t Reinstate A $650 Million Award For Terror Victims,"The U.S. Supreme Court will not reinstate a $650 million award secured by American terror victims against the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO).

The justices turned down an appeal Monday from 11 families who won the judgement in a Manhattan federal trial court, which the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently overturned. A bipartisan group of lawmakers say the decision effectively eviscerates a federal law that allows victims of terrorism to sue the perpetrators in American courts.

The Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992 (ATA) gives federal courts power to hear civil cases against terror syndicates. A coalition of American terror victims and their families sued the PLO and the Palestinian Authority (PA) in 2004 under the 1992 law. The plaintiffs were killed or injured in a series of attacks in and around Jerusalem during the al Aqsa Intifada. The PA and the PLO either carried out the attacks or furnished material support for the perpetrators.

A jury found for the plaintiffs and awarded them $218 million in damages, which was raised to $655 million under a provision of the ATA that triples such judgements.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision, finding federal courts cannot hear cases against the PA and the PLO, since their connection to the United States is tenuous and their agents did not set out to kill Americans. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reached the same conclusion in related litigation.

Lawmakers say the ruling substantially neuters the ATA. The U.S. House of Representatives filed an amicus (or “friend-of-the-court”) brief urging the justices to take the case, warning the 2nd Circuit’s decision dramatically narrows the range of actions that may be brought under the 1992 law.

“The decision below effectively nullifies the ATA, contravening the considered judgment of the political branches and hobbling an important tool in our nation’s war on terror,” their brief reads.

“The court of appeals’ decision renders the ATA lifeless with respect to the vast majority of circumstances it was enacted to address,” it adds.

The Trump administration filed its own brief advising the Court to let the 2nd Circuit’s decision stand.

“The United States sympathizes deeply with the American families who, in 2004, sued the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization for acts of terrorism committed against their loved ones between 2002 and 2004,” said Kerri Kupec, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice. “The court of appeals decided, however, that the suit was not consistent with due process under the Constitution, and its decision does not meet the usual standards for Supreme Court review. We will continue to support wherever possible all lawful actions to fight terrorism and provide redress to the victims of terrorist attacks and their families.”

The Supreme Court found in February that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), which protects the property of foreign governments, does not have an exemption for state-sponsors of terror. The decision makes it more difficult for terror victims to recover damages from governments that support radical groups.

"Hezbollah Crime-Terror Network Poses Big Concerns, Should Be Focus At Summit Of The Americas","As world leaders from throughout the Western Hemisphere gather in Lima, Peru for the Summit of the Americas VIII on April 13th – 14th they should agree to target Hezbollah and dismantle their crime-terror empire in this part of the world.

While Hezbollah, aka Lebanon’s Shia Islam “Party of God”, is most well-known for both raining down rockets on Israel and fighting in Syria on behalf of Bashar Al-Assad, its growing profile in Latin America has been gaining attention. That’s because it has grown into a billion dollar syndicate through illicit financing in Venezuela, Bolivia, Paraguay, Panama and beyond to fund global terror at Iran’s bidding.

Its reach beyond the Middle East exploits the vast Lebanese expatriate community throughout Latin America to traffic in drugs like cocaine, while money laundering via black market used car sales to Africa and cigarette smuggling. It counts on the Hawala system of money couriers to help avoid detection, as well as friendly faces like Venezuela’s Vice President Tareck El-Aissami, an ethnic Syrian-Lebanese 43-year old former governor with deep ties to the Arab community in his home country. In February 2017, he was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury department as a “Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker.”

Though Hezbollah’s strength in the Americas partly comes from an imploding Venezuela, the physical threat extends far beyond its borders.

In 2016, Peru held a terror trial against an alleged Hezbollah operative from Lebanon, then-30 year old Mohammed Ghaleb Hamdar. He was caught in 2014 with traces of nitroglycerine on his hands and apartment, plus photographs of Peruvian landmarks and buildings. During questioning, he even admitted to being a member of Hezbollah on a surveillance mission – bogus passport from Sierra Leone and all. Had Iran and/or Hezbollah decided to punish Peruvians, the Jewish community, or Americans in Peru, by blowing up a building or attacking a conference in Lima, all the Ayatollah would have needed to do is launch sleeper agents like Hamdar.

Though the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency created “Project Cassandra” to target Hezbollah ten years ago, they were stifled by the Obama White House which made signing the Iran nuclear deal a priority over cracking down on the Ayatollah’s terror proxy. It’s only been in the past year that Americans have learned of what happened through Congressional hearings and media reports. According to Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-NC), “The witnesses providing account of the Obama Administration derailing and stonewalling the prosecution of this illicit funding investigation has resulted in the most serious consequences of the misguided and injudicious actions of President Obama and his team.”

In effect, the Obama Administration rewarded Iran’s terror-supporting regime twice. First, it ushered in the nuclear accord which only slows, not stops, Iran’s pursuit of a nuclear weapon. Second, it allowed Hezbollah to balloon in size and strength, enabling even more crime and terrorism.

Hezbollah, designated by the U.S. as a terrorist organization over 20 years ago, has carried out terrorist attacks in the Middle East and beyond. Iran, designated by the U.S. as a state sponsor of terrorism for supporting groups like Hezbollah, targets enemies wherever they are vulnerable. Let’s recall the bombings against the AMIA Cultural Center and Israeli Embassy both in Buenos Aires, Argentina in the early 1990s. They were the deadliest Islamist attacks in the Americas prior to 9/11. Let’s also recall that Argentina’s Chief Prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, was assassinated in 2015 just days after releasing his damning report about the former Argentine government’s efforts to cover up Iran’s role in the attacks.

In December 2017, Argentina’s former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner was charged with treason by an Argentine judge over this scandal.

Fortunately, things are beginning to change in Washington with respect to Hezbollah. In January 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions wisely announced the creation of the Justice Department’s Hezbollah Financing and Narcoterrorism Team (HFNT) which will pick up where Project Cassandra left off.

Now it’s time for partner nations throughout the Americas to join these robust efforts to stamp out crime-terror networks like Hezbollah. The Summit of the Americas is an ideal venue to focus on this important task. Countless lives literally depend on it.

CNN Anchor Calls Russian Meddling ‘A Terror Strike’,"CNN host Michael Smerconish went on a rant Saturday morning calling the Russian election meddling “a terror strike.”

WATCH:

Smerconish was responding to a tweet from a viewer asking if he would hold former President Obama accountable, since the Russian meddling took place under the Obama administration.

“Here’s what I’m looking for, instead of this going on between liberals and conservatives, Republican and Democrats, what happened to when we were united against a common enemy?” Smerconish asked rhetorically. “This was terrorism. We were the victims of a terror strike and will the commander-in-chief on Monday hold accountable the presumed perpetrator of that terror strike?”

“Stop all the liberal, conservative red state, blue state stuff. Our partisan differences used to end at the water’s edge,” he continued.

A tweet from @SwingDriver210 asked, “Will you hold Obama accountable? You say you are fair. We will see. I mean all this meddling happened under Obama and no one cares.”

Pelosi Refers To 9/11 Terror Attacks As An ‘Incident’ While Defending Weaker Borders,"House minority leader Nancy Pelosi referred to the 9/11 terror attacks that killed nearly 3,000 innocent people and scarred generations of Americans as an “incident” during her weekly press conference on Capitol Hill.

Pelosi was describing her opposition to the now-reversed policy of the Trump administration of separating illegal immigrant children from their parents when they cross the border illegally.

Pelosi said the Trump administration believes that “if you are a mom who wants to escape rape, murder and gang violence for your child, and you’ve tried to come to asylum in the United States, you are unfit, and we’re taking your child away from you.”

Pelosi was defending her stance on weaker border enforcement in an attempt to pivot the blame for the current border crisis to Republicans after 9/11.

“When we had the 9/11 incident,” Pelosi said, “the commission was formed and they made the recommendations. They made recommendations to protect America, and some were about our borders, and Republicans would not take them up.”

Pelosi went on to say that she believes Democrats will be victorious in November midterms because Americans think this is not “who we are as a country” to take children away from their parents.

Ilhan Omar’s Minnesota Congressional District Is The Terror-Recruiting Capital Of The US,"FBI statistics reveal that Minnesota’s fifth congressional district, which is represented by Rep. Ilhan Omar and includes the urban area of Minneapolis, is the jurisdiction with the highest rate of terrorist recruitment in the United States.

Minnesota is reported to have the highest Somali population in the United States, with current population estimates breaching 100,000. This demographic has proven to be connected to terror-related activities, Fox News reports,

“More men and boys from a Somali American community in Minneapolis have joined — or attempted to join — a foreign terrorist organization over the last 12 years than any other jurisdiction in the country. FBI stats show 45 Somalis left to join the ranks of either the Somalia-based Islamic insurgency al-Shabab, or the Iraq- and Syria-based ISIS combined. And as of 2018, a dozen more had been arrested with the intention of leaving to support ISIS.”

In the past, Omar has shown her strong affinity for the Somali community in her district, as well as abroad. In one case in 2016, Omar — who at the time was only a state rep. in Minnesota — defended a group of nine Somalis who had attempted to cross the border into Mexico in a plan to reach Syria, “planning to join ISIS,” KMSP-TV reports.

When they were arrested, she wrote a letter to the judge who oversaw their case asking him to have “compassion” for the wannabe terrorist and to take a “restorative approach to justice.”

Omar wrote to the Judge:

Such punitive measures not only lack efficacy, they inevitably create an environment in which extremism can flourish, aligning with the presupposition of terrorist recruitment. . . . The best deterrent to fanaticism is a system of compassion. We must alter our attitude and approach; if we truly want to affect change, we should refocus our efforts on inclusion and rehabilitation.

In reference to the 2013 bombing of a Kenyan mall by Somalia-based terrorist organization, Al-Shabab, Omar placed the blame on the United States and its past foreign policy in the region for the attack: “For us, it’s always ‘I must have not done anything. Why is it happening to me?’ Nobody wants to take accountability of how these are byproducts of the actions of our involvement in other people’s affairs,” Omar stated. (RELATED: Ilhan Omar To Fundraise For Hamas-Linked Muslim Organization)

There are a number of reasons why the Twin City region is afflicted by such high rates of terror recruitment. Robin Simcox, a terrorism and national security expert at The Heritage Foundation, told Fox News that Minnesota’s unique demographic density of Somalis creates favorable conditions for broad radicalization and frequent terror recruitment. (RELATED: Bill Maher Defends Omar Tweets: ‘I Don’t Know Why This Has To Be Seen As Anti-Semitic’)

He explains:

For over a decade, Islamist terror groups have been able to recruit from Minnesota. This is, in part, because Minnesota has a large Muslim population compared to other parts of the U.S. However, it is also because there have been small segments of the Somali community there that have struggled to integrate into the U.S. Al-Shabaab and ISIS have exploited this – upon religious, political cultural and identity issues to offer a compelling alternative to Western democracy.

David Otto, director and counter-terrorism program coordinator at Global Risk International, also explained to Fox News how and why terror groups are so effective at targeting Somali-American recruits:

Recruitment takes place online as well as face-to-face radicalization, sometimes with promises of what appears to be legitimate opportunities. For al-Shabab, they focus mainly on the negative impact of U.S. counterterrorism policies — like targeted assassinations and drone strikes that sometimes kill innocent civilians in Somalia – to attract recruits and sympathizers. The promise that al-Shabaab will restore a Sharia state and get rid of the government is somewhat attractive.

According to Jeanine Brudenell, who served as the Somali liaison for the Minneapolis Police Department, the uptick in extremism that has occurred in recent years can be linked to efforts to crack down on street gangs throughout the city.

“In trying to lead youth away from joining gangs, many parents were taking their children to the mosques,” she said.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2019/02/18/ilhan-omar-district-terror/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi-_pyJgLT9AhXaKFkFHbmPCd84HhAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw1Rl607MWKTF5vB_rMSHm42,2019-02-18
"Accused Utrecht Shooter Admits Guilt, Faces Terror-Related Charges: Dutch Prosecutors","Dutch officials said a suspected gunman admitted to killing three people in the Netherlands shooting on a Utrecht tram Monday.

Gokmen Tanis, 37, admitted to three terrorism-related charges, BBC reported Friday. (RELATED: Dutch Police Searching For Turkish Man After Tram Shooting Leaves 3 Dead, 5 Injured)

A 19-year-old woman and two men, 28 and 49, were killed. The suspected gunman also wounded five other people.

Authorities are still investigating whether Tanis was motivated by terrorism or personal issues along with radicalized ideas, BBC reported. Police considered Tanis, who was born in Turkey, might have had a terrorist motive after finding a letter in his getaway vehicle.

Officials evacuated all mosques in Utrecht and security was temporarily increased at mosques around the country, The New York Times reported. It is unclear whether evacuations were due to a specific threat or were done to be cautious after the deadly mosque shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand Friday.

Zabit Elmaci, who used to work with Tanis, said he was “always in trouble,” according to the Times.

A judge extended Tanis’s detention for two more weeks Friday, BBC reported. Investigation is ongoing.

This is not the first terror-related incident the Netherlands has faced in recent time. Seven men were arrested for conspiring to commit a major terrorist attack in the country and an Afghan man stabbed two Americans in a railway station in September 2018.

Rep. Ilhan Omar Describes 9/11 Terror Attacks: ‘Some People Did Something’,"Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar described the September 11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States in a nonspecific way during a recent speech to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)

Omar delivered the keynote speech at a fundraiser for CAIR in late March and urged Muslim Americans to “raise hell” and “make people uncomfortable.” In one part of her speech that surfaced on Twitter this week, Omar described the 9/11 attacks in a peculiar way.

“CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,” Omar said. (RELATED: McCarthy Condemns Omar For Hamas-Linked Org Fundraising)

WATCH:

CAIR has notable ties to Islamic terrorist groups and was listed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) as an unindicted co-conspirator in funneling millions of dollars to Hamas.

Omar’s speech to CAIR in March sparked a pro-Israel protest, wherein hundreds of protesters descended upon the venue and attacked Omar for her comments that many have perceived to be anti-Semitic.

FBI Links Certain Conspiracy Theories To Domestic Terror Threats: Report,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation reportedly described “conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists” as threats in a document obtained by Yahoo News.

A May 30 FBI intelligence bulletin from FBI’s Phoenix field office says the FBI believes the emergence of these extremists could be getting worse leading up to the 2020 presidential election cycle, according to Yahoo News.

The document also mentions the network QAnon, a group that maintains there is a deep-state conspiracy against President Donald Trump, and the conspiracy theory Pizzagate that claims a pedophile ring was run out of a D.C. pizza joint’s basement and involved the Clintons. (RELATED: Trump Supports Labeling Antifa A ‘Major Organization Of Terror’)

“The FBI assesses these conspiracy theories very likely will emerge, spread, and evolve in the modern information marketplace, occasionally driving both groups and individual extremists to carry out criminal or violent acts,” the document said, adding that “the uncovering of real conspiracies or cover-ups involving illegal, harmful, or unconstitutional activities by government officials or leading political figures” makes these threats more intense.

“While our standard practice is to not comment on specific intelligence products, the FBI routinely shares information with our law enforcement partners in order to assist in protecting the communities they serve,” the FBI said in a statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation.

News of the document follows Trump extending support to Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Republican Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy in their effort to label ANTIFA a domestic terrorist organization.

Consideration is being given to declaring ANTIFA, the gutless Radical Left Wack Jobs who go around hitting (only non-fighters) people over the heads with baseball bats, a major Organization of Terror (along with MS-13 & others).

"Study Shows War On Terror Displaced 37 Million People, More Than Any War, Except WWII Since 1900","Researchers at Brown University found that the U.S. war on terror has displaced 37-million people since Sept. 11, 2001, according to a study released Tuesday.

The ‘Costs of War’ project at Brown, which claims to be the first of its kind, notes that the number of displaced persons is higher than any other war, except World War 2, since 1900, according to The Hill.

According to the research, 37 million displaced “in and from Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, the Philippines, Libya, and Syria” is a “very conservative estimate.” The number might be closer to 48 million to 59 million, the Hill reported.

U.S. military involvement was not the only reason for displacement in these countries, per the Hill, but it was a “dominant or contributing factor.” The estimate excludes millions displaced by smaller U.S. combat operations in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Niger, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia, per The Hill.

To determine the number of the displaced, scholars from American University collected data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center, and other organizations, according to The New York Times.

"France Terror Suspect Had Arrived In Europe From Tunisia On Migrant Boat 1 Month Prior To Killings, Official Says","The man suspected of killing three people in a church in France had reportedly arrived in Europe by migrant boat from Tunisia a month prior to the attack, officials said, according to BBC.

The 21-year-old Tunisian suspect reportedly was carrying an Italian Red Cross identity document that was issued after his arrival in Lampedusa, an Italian island, in September, according to the BBC.

His name is Brahim Aouissaoui

He entered France, illegally

He’s 21 years old

He was in France for less than 1 month

He killed 3 innocent peoplehttps://t.co/nFOnMa07NT — Damon A. Salvadore (@DamonSalvadore1) October 29, 2020

Jean-François Ricard, France’s chief anti-terrorist prosecutor, said that the attacker, identified as Brahim Aouissaoui, had arrived in the Italian city of Bari on Oct. 9, according to Reuters. Weeks later, the suspect arrived by train to Nice with his Red Cross documents, then changed his clothes at the train station before walking to the church to carry out the attack, Reuters reported.

Tunisia has opened an investigation into Aouissaoui, who was not listed by Tunisian police as a suspected militant before he left the country in September, according to Reuters. Aouissaoui was also not known to French intelligence services, a police source said, according to Reuters.

The suspect had been living in Sfax, a major port and point of departure for Tunisians trying to make the illegal crossing into Europe. The port is roughly 80 miles from Lampedusa.

Aouissaoui was shot by police and is in critical condition, according to the BBC. France’s President Emmanuel Macron announced that the country has deployed 7,000 soldiers to protect public places like churches and schools, and has raised the nation’s national security alert to the highest level.

The elderly victim that was “virtually beheaded” in the attack at Notre-Dame basilica had come to pray, BBC reported. Two of the people who died were killed inside the church, and a woman was able to flee to a nearby cafe after being stabbed several times before dying later that day.

One of the victims was identified as Vincent Loqués, 55, a father of two children. He also reportedly had his throat cut, according to the Guardian. The woman who fled was identified by the Brazilian press as Simone Barreto Silva, a mother of three originally from Salvador, according to the Guardian.

The killings are being investigated by France’s anti-terror prosecutors, and come two weeks after teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded after showing students the caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, published by the Charlie Hebdo satire magazine in 2015, during a lesson on freedom of speech.

Multiple attacks took place within hours of the attack in Nice, or were foiled by police. Police killed a man who was threatening passerby with a gun in another French city, Montfavet, while yelling “Allahu akbar,” Europe 1 reported according to Reuters.

An Afghan national armed with a long knife was arrested in Lyon while trying to board a tram. The individual was already flagged to intelligence services, according to i24 News.

Swiss Woman Arrested After Suspected Terror Attack Had Ties To Jihadist In Syria,"A Swiss woman who was arrested after a suspected terror attack Tuesday had ties to a jihadist in Syria and had tried to travel there in 2017, numerous sources reported.

The suspect, 28, allegedly attempted to choke someone and stabbed another person in the neck with a knife at a department store in the Italian-speaking Ticino region of Switzerland, according to the Associated Press. The attacker was reportedly apprehended by two shoppers.

Swiss federal police said Wednesday that the woman had a relationship with a jihadist in Syria, and was been blocked by Turkish authorities in 2017 while she was trying to enter Syria. She was subsequently sent back to Switzerland.

The Swiss federal authorities, known as Fedpol, said on Twitter that the woman was experiencing mental health problems at the time of the attempted entry to Syria.

“After returning to Switzerland, she was admitted to a psychiatric clinic,” it adds. “Since 2017, the woman has not come to fedpol’s attention in any investigations related to terrorist activities.”

The Swiss federal prosecutor’s office announced Wednesday. that it was pursuing criminal charges including premeditated homicide, serious bodily harm, and violating the country’s ban on extremist groups like ISIS.

Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurtz expressed solidarity with Switzerland after the “Islamist terrorist attack,” which comes weeks after a gunman who had previously attempted to join ISIS in Syria killed four people and injured 14 more in early November.

Kujtim Fejzulai, the 20-year-old suspected gunman, was shot dead by police after the beginning of the attack. (RELATED: Suspect In Vienna Shooting Tried To Join ISIS, Was Released From Prison Early After Terrorism Charges)

The attack in Austria occurred roughly a week after a Tunisian migrant is alleged to have killed three people at a church in France, where multiple Islamist terror attacks have recently taken place. Among the attacks was the beheading of a teacher who was targeted after showing students caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad from the satire magazine Charlie Hebdo during a lesson on freedom of speech.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2020/11/25/swiss-woman-arrested-terror-attack-lugano-syria-jihadist-ties/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwizkO-JgLT9AhX5FlkFHSrqAGY4KBAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw2m5sQtHggBRE0I-O9lemF-,2020-11-25
"Lebanon-Based Terror Group Says They Have 100,000 Trained Fighters","The leader of a Lebanon-based Shiite Muslim terror group known as Hezbollah announced that the organization has 100,000 trained fighters, the Associated Press reported on Monday.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah announced that the terrorist group has 100,000 fighters during his first address since seven people were killed in a gunfight in Beirut on Thursday, according to the Associated Press. The exact number of fighters is difficult to verify because of the group’s secrecy, but if Nasrallah’s figure is accurate, then Hezbollah fighters outnumber Lebanon’s own armed forces.

“The real program for the Lebanese Forces is civil war,” Nasrallah said, the AP reported. “The biggest threat to the social peace in Lebanon is the Lebanese Forces.”

Violent civil confrontations have occurred in response to an investigation into an August 2020 port explosion that killed more than 215 people, according to the AP. Hezbollah officials and supporters of the group have asked for the judge overseeing the investigation to be replaced since they are reportedly considering Hezbollah responsible for the blast.

The deadly Beirut gunfight followed speculation about the judge’s findings and lasted for several hours on Thursday, with fighters wielding rocket-propelled grenades and automatic rifles, the AP reported. Nasrallah blamed the leader of the Lebanese Forces, Samir Geagea, for “manufacturing” the gunfight to spark a civil war in the country.

“Don’t miscalculate. Be wise and be polite and take a lesson from all your wars and all our wars,” Nasrallah said in a statement directed at Geagea, according to the AP. (RELATED: 5 Killed, 16 Injured In Lebanon Over Judge’s Probe Of Massive Explosion)

Unlike the Iran-backed Hezbollah, the Lebanese Forces are part of the country’s right-wing Christian party, which Nasrallah said has tried to scare Lebanese Christians about Hezbollah, the AP reported.

State Department Partners With Refugee Coalition Groups Supporting Organizations With Alleged Terror Ties,"The U.S. State Department joined an initiative to welcome Afghan refugees with organizations funding groups allegedly tied to terrorism.

Welcome.Us is a coalition of former officials, private organizations and companies, public figures and corporate leaders mobilizing to provide Afghan refugees with the resources they need for resettlement.

George Soros’ Open Society Foundations and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, both of which have funded organizations with alleged ties to Palestinian terrorist organizations, are helping fund the initiative.

The U.S. State Department joined an initiative to welcome Afghan refugees into the country that is sponsored by organizations supporting groups with possible ties to Palestinian terrorist organizations, a Daily Caller News Foundation review found.

Welcome.US is part of the Office of American Possibilities initiative, a project of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, according to its website. The initiative’s main co-chairs include former President Barack Obama, former First Lady Michelle Obama, former President George W. Bush, former First Lady Laura Bush, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

The initiative also formed a coalition composed of nonprofit leaders and organizations, former government officials, corporate leaders and public figures. Businesses, including Starbucks, Uber, Facebook, Microsoft, Walmart and Airbnb, also support the effort.

Welcome.US received funding from grantmaking organizations such as George Soros’ Open Society Foundations and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, both of which have made contributions to groups with alleged terror ties, according to Israeli watchdog NGO Monitor.

“This is a moment in which committed philanthropic organizations are rightfully putting the vast majority of funding toward work happening on the front lines,” Welcome.US’s website states of its sponsors. “This group of funders chose to also enable the launch of Welcome.Us so that, together, we can amplify those efforts and mobilize the American people to support them.”

Secretary of State Antony Blinken has promoted the initiative, emphasizing the U.S. government’s role in supporting the group. The State Department has also advertised the initiative on various official taxpayer-funded platforms.

“The goal of the State Department’s partnership with WelcomeUs, an initiative of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, is to ensure that everyone who wants to lend a hand can find a way to do it and to match the massive desire to help with the very real needs of the families arriving here,” Blinken said in a promotional video posted Oct. 4. “Everyone has a role to play.”

The State Department declined to comment. Welcome.Us did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

The Rockefeller Brothers Fund, which supports Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors to the tune of millions of dollars, is a philanthropic group seeking to advance social change, according to its website.

The Rockefeller Brothers Fund contributes hundreds of thousands of dollars in ongoing grants to Defense for Children International-Palestine (DCIP) and Middle East Children’s Alliance (MECA). Both of these organizations have been accused by NGO Monitor of having ties to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which has been a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization since 1997, or its alleged affiliates.

Open Society Foundations funded Al-Haq and Al-Mezan Center for Human Rights, which allegedly also have ties to the PFLP. The Israeli government has referred to Al-Haq’s general director as a “former senior member of the PFLP.” An Al-Mezan leader was pictured with alleged PFLP members, according to NGO Monitor, and the organization participated in a past event with representation from Hamas, another U.S.-designated terrorist organization.

The Israeli government recently declared Al-Haq and DCIP arms of the PFLP. During the announcement,the Israeli defense minister urged other countries and international groups “to assist in this fight, and to avoid contact with companies and organizations that supply materials to terrorism,” the Jerusalem Post reported.

State Department Spokesperson Ned Price responded to the designations, saying that the Israeli government didn’t “give the U.S. advance warning that they would be designated.” He added that the administration will “be engaging our Israeli partners for more information.”

Defense for Children International-Palestine

DCIP seeks to support the rights of children living in the West Bank and Gaza, often advocating for Palestinian juveniles held in Israeli prisons, according to its website.

DCIP reported in July that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) raided its office in the West Bank. The organization’s general director, Khaled Quzmar, said on Oct. 4 that the raid related to allegations that DCIP possessed materials used to carry out terrorist attacks. (RELATED: Group Designated As A Terror Organization In Israel Is Active In The US)

“We asked them [the Israeli military courts] who raided the office. The answer was the Israeli army because they have information that there is materials used in a terror attack or maybe will [be] used, or maybe will [be] used with other terrorist organization,” Quzmar said. “So, they throw the accusation, general accusation, against DCI without any facts, so we asked the court to force the army to return back the computers and the documents that they took because it is for the work of the organization and no one [is] allowed to even see this information.”

The members of DCIP’s previous board of directors allegedly had ties to the PFLP, according to a report by NGO Monitor. DCIP assembled a new board in June 2020 made up of members who have, in the past, lauded alleged terrorists.

Quzmar called accusations that DCIP is connected to terrorist groups “fake news.”

“They have nothing against us except they want to silence us because we start talking … in public about their crimes and asking for accountability,” he said.

DCIP’s current board secretary Adla Nazer posted on Facebook in February 2018 her sympathy for Ahmed Jarrar, who was killed by Israeli forces, which considered him a “principal operative in the terrorist cell” that carried out a shooting of a rabbi. Hamas claimed Jarrar as a martyr, according to the Times of Israel.

Nazer made a similar post in Dec. 2018, sharing images of Salah Barghouti and Ashraf Na’alwa with the caption “Once more, what a loss for us — every drop of blood of theirs. What a bad morning,” according to a translation by NGO Monitor. Barghouti was allegedly responsible for a shooting attack that wounded seven people, including a pregnant woman whose baby had to be delivered in an emergency operation and was later pronounced dead, according to the Times of Israel. Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack and called Barghouti a martyr after he was shot and killed by Israeli forces.

Na’alwa was responsible for shooting and killing two Israelis at a factory where he worked, according to Haaretz. He was later killed by Israeli forces, and Hamas subsequently praised efforts to avenge his death.

Dr. Yaser Amouri, DCIP’s treasurer, has also applauded alleged terrorists, according to NGO Monitor. Amouri posted in 2015 an image of a bloodied Yasser Tarwa, who carried out a stabbing that injured an Israeli police officer before being shot, with the caption “Blessed is the city of suffering. For martyrs eternity,” according to NGO Monitor’s translation. Images reported by the Times of Israel showed Tarwa wearing Hamas garb. The terrorist group called the attack “heroic.”

Amouri shared a picture in 2014 featuring late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and PFLP founder George Habash with the caption “Their condition as if said ‘if we were failed defenders of the [Palestinian] cause, it is more worthy that we would change the defenders and not the cause,” according to NGO Monitor’s translation. NGO Monitor has been criticized by activists as aggressively pro-Israel.

An IDF spokesperson confirmed that “as part of the campaign against terrorist organizations, based on accurate and up to date intelligence, security forces operated in the offices of the organization in question.” DCIP didn’t respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Donations to DCIP made through Citibank and Arab Bank were reportedly stopped in 2018 by both banks after the alleged terror ties were publicized, according to UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI), which earlier urged the banks to withdraw services from DCIP. Citibank declined to comment, and Arab Bank did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

In 2019, UKLFI reported that GlobalGiving UK was removed from DCIP’s donations page, saying that the organization confirmed to UKLFI an investigation into the alleged terror ties.

GlobalGiving UK did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

A 2016 archived version of DCIP’s donation page shows that CitiBank and Arab Bank processed donations to the organization. The banks are no longer listed on the DCIP’s donations page.

Middle East Children’s Alliance

MECA’s 2019 IRS form 990 lists Open Society Foundation for a $200,000 contribution and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund for a $70,000 contribution.

MECA seeks to protect the rights of Palestinians living in the Palestinian territories, according to its website. The organization is based in California.

MECA has partnered with the Union of Health Work Committees (UHWC), which is allegedly linked to the PFLP, according to NGO Monitor.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in 1993 labeled the UHWC “the PFLP’s health organization.” MECA’s director of Gaza projects is described as a member of the UHWC, and its Gaza project assistant is noted as someone who volunteered for the UHWC.

UHWC’s founder, Dr. Rabah Muhanna, was labeled in 2001 a “member of the political bureau of the PFLP,” and the PFLP mourned her death in 2019.

Then-Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon declared in 2015 that “the group of people or institutions or association known as the ‘Union of Health Work Committees-Jerusalem [HWC]’…or any other name that this association will be known by, including all of its factions and any branch, center, committee or group of this association is an unauthorized association, as defined by the Defense Regulations,” according to NGO Monitor.

The UHWC said in June that Israeli forces raided its office and seized computer hard drives and other documents. The organization said its office had also been raided in March and an employee was detained as a result.

MECA did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment, nor did the UHWC.

Al-Haq

Open Society Foundations, through its Foundation to Promote Open Society, has an ongoing $800,000 grant to Al-Haq. The general director of Al-Haq, Shawan Jabarin, is “a former senior member of the PFLP who has served time in prison due to his role in numerous terrorist activities,” the Israeli government said in 2020. The Israeli government also claimed that Jabarin “employed PFLP terror operatives as Al-Haq staff.”

Al-Haq documents human rights violations against Palestinians, according to its website.

The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention noted in a 1994 decision that Jabarin “was apparently convicted” in 1985 of recruiting members to the PFLP and for coordinating “guerilla training outside of Israel.” Jabarin subsequently served prison time for the conviction, the document stated. The working group decided that previous instances where Jabarin was in detention but hadn’t been tried were “arbitrary.”

Moreover, Jabarin was described in an Israeli court ruling, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, as someone who “apparently operates under the guise of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.”

“On one hand he presents himself as a director of a human rights organization, and on the other, he is active in a terrorist organization that commits murder and attempted murder,” the ruling stated. “His lifestyle has nothing to do with human rights, on the contrary, he actively denies the most fundamental right of all, without which there are no other rights – the right to life.”

Visa, Mastercard and American Express all stopped processing credit card donations for Jabarin’s organization, according to a 2018 UKLFI report. The credit card companies did not respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.

Neither Open Society Foundations nor Al-Haq responded to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Al-Mezan Center For Human Rights

Open Society Foundations, through its Foundation to Promote Open Society, gave a three-year $600,000 grant in 2019 to Al-Mezan Center for Human Rights. An Al-Mezan leader participated in an event with at least one terrorist organization and the organization’s board chairman, who has served in his role at least until January, has alleged ties to the PFLP.

Al-Mezan’s website says the organization is focused on supporting victims of human rights abuses. The group is based in Gaza.

Dr. Kamal Al-Sharafi, who served as Al-Mezan’s board chairman until at least January, has posted pictures with alleged PFLP members, according to screenshots posted by NGO Monitor. Al-Sharafi posted a picture in 2019 at the memorial service of Ali Darwish. The PFLP mourned Darwish’s death, calling him a “front-line fighter.”

The Independent Commission for Human Rights held a meeting in 2016 that included Al-Mezan Director Issam Younis and representatives of Hamas and other groups, according to the commission’s website.

Younis rejected the “politically-motivated allegations, which are intended to harm our work and fundraising,” telling the DCNF that “Al Mezan is a respected human rights organization.”

Younis referenced a 2020 press release, which stated that the Dutch government rejected NGO Monitor’s assertions. “With that, the Dutch government effectively dismissed and debunked NGO Monitor’s standard tactic of associating Palestinian NGOs with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which is on the EU’s sanctions list,” the Al-Mezan press release said. The statement noted that the Dutch government is a “long-time donor” to Al-Mezan.

The press release accused NGO Monitor of spreading falsities about Al-Mezan and referring to the wrong people when alleging the organization’s ties to the PFLP.

Younis also pointed to a 2018 report by the Policy Working Group that accused NGO Monitor of “defaming human rights organizations that criticize the Israeli occupation,” citing its alleged close relationship with the Israeli government.

“NGO Monitor uses the listing of the PFLP as a terrorist organization to accuse anyone who politically identifies with the PFLP of involvement with terrorism,” the report stated. “It does not differentiate between the militant arm of the PFLP and the group’s political wing. The latter participated in the 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections – with Israel’s knowledge and consent.”

NGO Monitor declined to respond to Al-Mezan’s allegations.

"Border Authorities Arrested 42 People On Terror Watchlist Under Biden, DHS Says","Border authorities apprehended 42 people whose names were on the U.S. terror watchlist since President Joe Biden took office, according to a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) response to a congressional inquiry obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The individuals attempted to enter the country illegally and were arrested by Border Patrol and Office of Field Operations authorities, according to the response.

“Since January 20, 2021, the U.S. Border Patrol and the Office of Field Operations has arrested 42 subjects who were on the terror watchlist and attempted to enter the United States illegally. These numbers are inclusive of anyone who may be on the No-Fly List,” DHS said in their response.

The national terrorism database uses information across intelligence and government agencies.

23 of the flagged individuals attempted to enter the country between Jan. 20 and Dec. 27, 2021, Fox News earlier reported. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: GOP Reps Demand DHS Provide ICE Data Biden Is ‘Hiding’)

Former Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott before leaving his post in August 2021 said that alleged terrorists were crossing the border “at a level we have never seen before.”

DHS didn’t respond to a request for comment.

‘Discrimination’ Petition Mark Ruffalo Blasted Out To Followers Was Crafted By Palestinian Group Linked To Terror Orgs,"Mark Ruffalo, a movie star and left-wing activist, tweeted a petition out to his more than 8 million followers that was in part created by a group with ties to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a U.S.-designated terror group, and other Israeli-designated terror groups.

7amleh, also known as The Arab Center for the Advancement of Social Media, has voiced its support of PFLP and collaborated with other alleged terror-linked groups.

Nadim Nashif, 7amleh’s director and co-founder, tweeted an article in 2014 calling PFLP member Leila Khaled, who hijacked a plane in 1969 and attempted to do so in 1970, a “resistance icon.”

Movie star Mark Ruffalo promoted a petition demanding PayPal offer its services to Palestinians to his over 8 million Twitter followers that was in part created by an Israeli-registered non-governmental organization (NGO) with ties to groups designated as terror organizations in the U.S. and Israel.

Ruffalo tweeted the petition, titled “PayPal: Stop discriminating against Palestinians,” last week. The petition urges the multinational financial technology company to make its services available to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

“Friends: Paypal operates in Israel’s illegal settlements—but is refusing to provide service to Palestinians in Gaza and West Bank, in direct violation of UN guidelines,” said Ruffalo on June 6. “Join the international call to Paypal to end its baseless discrimination now.”

But one of the two groups that put out the petition, 7amleh, also known as The Arab Center for the Advancement of Social Media, is linked in various ways with Israeli-designated terror groups that operate as “arms” of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), according to the National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing of Israel. The PFLP is designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. and E.U.

7amleh, which participates in Meta’s “trusted partner program,” according to its website, launched its “#Paypal4Palestine” campaign in October 2021 with Jewish Voice for Peace, the Israeli-designated terror group Al-Haq and other NGOs. Meta partners with “expert organizations that represent the voices and experiences of at-risk users” across the world, according to its website.

PFLP, which was designated as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997 by the U.S., has planned numerous attacks against Israel. In 2001, the group assassinated Israeli Minister Rehavam Ze’evi. In 2002, a PFLP suicide bomber killed three Israeli citizens, wounding 25.

Still, 7amleh and its staff members have repeatedly expressed support for PFLP.

For instance, Nadim Nashif, 7amleh’s co-founder and director, tweeted an article in 2014 that called PFLP member Leila Khaled a “resistance icon.” Khaled hijacked a plane in 1969 and attempted to do so again in 1970. (RELATED: Al Jazeera Accuses Israel Of Murdering Star Reporter In Military Raid)

In 2017, Marwa Fatafta, a member of 7amleh’s advisory board, wrote an article calling suspected PFLP terrorist Basel al-A’araj an “intellectual activist” after he was killed by Israeli forces. When he died, PFLP called him “one of the most prominent young Palestinian strugglers” and 7amleh celebrated him as a “prominent youth activist.”

Similarly, in 2020, 7amleh referred to former PFLP leader Ghassan Kanafani as a “prominent figure” born before “Israel” became a state in 1948 and slammed “Google” for listing the former leader as born there.

Join the international call to Paypal to end its baseless discrimination now.https://t.co/TdWjNWuEMl — Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) June 6, 2022

There appear to be links between 7amleh and Al-Haq and Addameer, which like Al-Haq is an Israeli-designated terror group. Ahmad Qadi, the monitoring and documentation officer at 7amleh per his LinkedIn, also works for Al-Haq as a database management specialist.

Diana Alzeer, the senior advocacy and outreach director at Al-Haq, spoke at 7amleh’s conference in May. Likewise, Al-Haq’s former lawyer Cathrine Abuamsha is now a manager at 7amleh, her LinkedIn shows.

7amleh and Addameer collaborated on a social media campaign in 2017 called “#APrisonerEveryday” to raise awareness for “Palestinian political prisoners.” Prisoners included in the campaign were Mohammad Jamal Al Natsheh, a leader of the terror group Hamas, Marah Bakir, who in 2015 stabbed a border policeman in Jerusalem and Ayman Kurd, who also stabbed two officers in Jerusalem in 2016.

The petition Ruffalo shared currently has more than 212,000 signatures.

A representative for Ruffalo did not respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment, nor did Meta, Paypal or 7amleh. Al-Haq and Addameer did not respond.

PayPal previously addressed its position on Palestine in a 2016 statement, noting that the company “appreciate[s] the interest that the Palestinian community has shown in PayPal” and will work in “accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.”

Editor’s note: This piece has been updated to avoid confusion regarding participants in the #Paypal4Palestine campaign.

Americans In Turkey Warned Of Possible ‘Retaliatory’ Terror Attacks After Koran Burning,"The United States Embassy in Turkey issued a second notice to American citizens Monday warning them to be alert and aware of potential terror attacks in religious centers in the country after Koran book burnings in Europe.

Turkey alerted its citizens over the weekend to potential “Islamophobic” attacks in the U.S. and Europe after a Koran was burned in Sweden, according to Reuters. The U.S. Embassy in Turkey released a notice urging Americans overseas to be aware of their surroundings and avoid crowds, noting that religious centers such as churches and synagogues were most at risk for attacks. (RELATED: Turkey Torpedoes NATO Expansion Due To Quran-Burning Protests)

“The U.S. government cautions its citizens of possible imminent retaliatory attacks by terrorists against churches, synagogues, and diplomatic missions in Istanbul or other places Westerners frequent, especially in the Beyoglu, Galata, Taksim, and Istiklal areas,” the notice read. “Turkish authorities are investigating this matter.”

Americans are instructed to “keep a low profile,” “avoid crowds” and remain aware of the surroundings, according to the notice. The Monday warning was the second notice in four days from the embassy, after a Jan. 27 memo was released with similar concerns of terrorist attacks aimed at places of worship, particularly “locations frequented by Westerners.”

Protests in Stockholm, over concerns of expanding NATO and Turkish aggression toward the Kurdistan Workers Party that Sweden has supported in the past, resulted in a copy of the Koran being burned outside of the Turkish Embassy in Sweden, according to Reuters. The burning sparked outrage from Turkish officials who responded by warning Turkish citizens to be on the alert for “possible Islamophobic, xenophobic and racist attacks” in the U.S. and Europe over the weekend.

Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Monday that Turkey would not give a vote to Sweden gaining entrance to NATO as a result of the protests in Stockholm.

The U.S. Embassy in Turkey did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.
