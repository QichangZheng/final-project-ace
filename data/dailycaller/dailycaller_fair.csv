"Scalise’s Condition Improves, Upgraded From Serious To Fair","House Majority Whip Steve Scalise’s condition has improved, with doctors announcing they were upgrading his status from serious to fair Wednesday.

Scalise, 51, sustained serious injuries after being shot in the hip at the GOP’s congressional baseball practice on June 14. The Louisiana Republican underwent multiple surgeries, having received multiple blood transfusions after suffering blood loss.

“Congressman Steve Scalise continues to make good progress,” MedStar Washington Hospital Center said in a statement. “He is now listed in fair condition and is beginning an extended period of healing and rehabilitation.”

Scalise is one of the five victims of the shooting in Alexandria, Va., where 66-year-old James Hodgkinson took aim at roughly two dozen GOP lawmakers at a baseball field. Capitol Police Officers Crystal Griner and David Bailey as well as Tyson’s Food lobbyist Matt Mika and congressional staffer Zack Barth were also wounded in the attack.

Doctors previously said Scalise’s condition “was as critical as you can be when he came in.”

Trump Ridicules Vanity Fair’s Apology For Video Mocking Hillary,"President Donald Trump ridiculed Vanity Fair Thursday after both the magazine and its publisher apologized for a recently released video mocking Hillary Clinton.

Vanity Fair, which looks like it is on its last legs, is bending over backwards in apologizing for the minor hit they took at Crooked H. Anna Wintour, who was all set to be Amb to Court of St James’s & a big fundraiser for CH, is beside herself in grief & begging for forgiveness! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2017

The Vanity Fair video offered 6 tongue in cheek pieces of advice for Clinton including staying away from politics and perhaps taking up knitting.

The video sparked widespread backlash from Clinton supporters on social media including a campaign by some former operatives to get subscribers to cancel their Vanity Fair subscriptions. The magazine regretted the backlash in a Thursday statement saying “it was an attempt at humor and we regret that it missed the mark.”

The president also took aim at Conde Nast executive and Vanity Fair publisher Anna Wintour implying she would have been ambassador to the U.K. in a Clinton administration. Wintour was a prominent fundraiser and backer of Clinton during the 2016 presidential election.

Vanity Fair Cover Teases Bill De Blasio Sex Tape,"The newly-released January cover of magazine Vanity Fair has an interesting Easter egg: a half-hidden message seemingly teasing a sex tape featuring Democratic New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.

The cover depicts actor Bradley Cooper shooting pool, with various inside stories written across pool balls. But one pool ball, cut off by the edge of the photo, only reads “-ILL -LASIO -EX -APE!” It doesn’t take a master sleuth to fill in the blanks. (RELATED: De Blasio Sacrifices Jobs To Liberate NYC Horses From ‘Tortured’ Lives)

The New York Times reports that, no, there is not actually any story on a sex tape in Vanity Fair’s January issue. A representative for the magazine gave a bizarre explanation, saying, “That’s what you get for letting Kim Kardashian guest edit the cover lines.”

De Blasio’s wife, Chirlane McCray, emailed an alternate reading to the Times: “Bill de Blasio Spandex Cape? Great idea for Halloween next year!”

Fair Game: fairly lame,"Our own Jamie Weinstein has a terrific review/dismantling of Hollywood’s latest libsploitation flick, Fair Game. The movie purports to be the story of American heroes Joe Wilson and Valerie Plame as they save the world from the malevolent Karl Rove and his various puppets, including but not limited to George W. Bush. But as Weinstein puts it:

It is an equation that is as certain as two plus two equals four: Sean Penn + Iraq War + Hollywood movie = something less than the truth.

He then goes on to prove it, debunking the four main myths underpinning the story and interviewing director Doug Liman, who doesn’t know nearly as much about “the Plame Affair” as he thinks he does.

The movie’s only in limited release…

…so it remains to be seen whether it’ll earn more than Hollywood’s previous entry in the “America Sucks” genre, the Matt Damon mega-flop Green Zone. They keep making these stupid movies and they keep bombing. It’s as if the less the general public cares about their conspiracy theories and paranoid fantasies, the more convinced they are of their own braveness and iconoclasm.

But hey, it’s their money.

P.S. A while back, I had a little fun with how publicity-shy Wilson & Plame are.

Hollywood hit job: ‘Fair Game’ propagates easily disprovable myths about lead up to Iraq War,"It is an equation that is as certain as two plus two equals four: Sean Penn + Iraq War + Hollywood movie = something less than the truth.

And so it is with director Doug Liman’s “Fair Game,” starring Penn and released last Friday, despite Liman’s contention that he made strenuous efforts to depict only those claims he could back up. “I exercised the kind of restraint you don’t normally see from a Hollywood filmmaker,” Liman told The Daily Caller in an interview Monday. “I stuck to the facts.”

Background

The movie bills itself as “inspired by true events” and frames itself around the Joe Wilson-Valerie Plame affair. Wilson, played by Penn, was the former American diplomat sent to Niger by the CIA in 2002 to investigate claims that Iraq was trying to buy uranium for its purported nuclear weapons program from the African country.

The results of Wilson’s trip were viewed as largely meaningless by the CIA. But months after President George W. Bush said in his State of the Union address in 2003 in the lead up to the Iraq War that British intelligence believed that Iraq had been seeking uranium from Africa, Wilson sprung into action — claiming that he disproved the possibility of the Iraq-Niger uranium deal and suggesting the Bush administration may have been intentionally using dubious intelligence to justify the war in Iraq.

By the time Wilson began talking to the press, the Iraq War had begun and the American people were becoming disturbed that no Weapons of Mass Destruction had yet been found. In July 2003, Wilson famously wrote an op-ed in the New York Times, entitled “What I didn’t find in Africa,” suggesting perfidy on the part of the Bush administration.

After the op-ed appeared, the late columnist Robert Novak wrote a column indicating that sources told him that Joe Wilson’s wife, Valerie Plame (played in the movie by Naomi Watts), was a CIA operative that recommended Wilson be sent to Niger. The revelation led the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate who leaked Valerie Plame’s identity to Novak since intentionally revealing a covert operative’s identity is a violation of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act.

The special prosecutor discovered early on that the main source for Novak’s article was State Department official Richard Armitage. Ironically, despite claims that the revelation of Wilson’s wife’s name was done by Bush administration proponents of the Iraq War seeking to discredit Wilson and his claims, Armitage was against going to war in Iraq, at least at the time the Bush administration initiated the invasion. (Novak, too, was an ardent opponent of the Iraq War.)

You wouldn’t know this by watching Liman’s “Fair Game,” since Armitage is nowhere to be found — except in script at the very end. The narrative that Karl Rove and Dick Cheney’s Chief of Staff Scooter Libby were nefarious behind-the-scenes players intent on destroying innocent reputations while pushing the nation into war on false pretenses fits too nicely into Liman and Hollywood’s leftwing vision. You can’t, after all, let facts spoil a cinematic anti-Bush diatribe.

But because the truth matters to some, here is a factual breakdown of the film’s most major inaccuracies:



MOVIE MYTH #1: Scooter Libby and other members of the Bush administration pressured CIA analysts into providing cherry-picked intelligence to justify the Iraq War

The movie treats Scooter Libby as a bogeyman, who ruthlessly interrogated CIA analysts to supposedly pressure them into providing cherry-picked intelligence that Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear weapons program. Libby is shown in the film holding interrogation sessions at the CIA’s headquarters in Langley, Va., where CIA analysts are frightened by the mere presence of the vice president’s chief of staff. One analyst is even depicted throwing up in the bathroom because he was so intimidated by Libby.

The point of these scenes, of course, is to paint the picture that the vice president was itching to go to war and that he and his staff were pressuring CIA analysts into giving them the intelligence they needed to justify the war to the American public.

The problem is that this is directly contradicted by the bipartisan Robb-Silberman Commission report that looked into how the intelligence community got Iraq so wrong. The authoritative report found absolutely no evidence that pressure from the White House or vice-president’s office altered intelligence analysis before the war — and the intelligence community clearly expressed its belief in reports to the administration that Saddam had reconstituted his nuclear weapons program, as well as his biological and chemical weapons programs. The Robb-Silberman report is especially explicit on the point that analysts did not alter their reports as a result of political pressure.

“[W]e closely examined the possibility that intelligence analysts were pressured by policymakers to change their judgments about Iraq’s nuclear, biological, chemical weapons programs,” the report reads. “The analysts who worked Iraqi weapons issues universally agreed that in no instance did political pressure cause them to skew or alter any of their analytical judgments.”

In fact, the report suggests that it is vital that policymakers strenuously challenge and question analysts to ensure that they are providing policymakers with the best information possible.

“We urge that policymakers actively probe and question analysts,” the report recommends in order to avoid future intelligence failures like what occurred in Iraq. “In our view, such interaction is not ‘politicization.’ Analysts should expect such demanding and aggressive testing without — as a matter of principle and professionalism — allowing it to subvert their judgment.”

When asked by TheDC whether policymakers should be rigorously challenging CIA analysts, former CIA Director General Michael Hayden echoed the Robb-Silberman Commission report’s recommendation on the matter.

“They should absolutely be asking tough questions. That comes with the job description. No analyst worth his salt would be intimidated by a policymaker asking tough questions,” he said. “That is just fine. And there is no sin in that at all. That is what we do. And a policymaker should have the right to challenge our analysts.”

Yet, “Fair Game” employs all the cinematic techniques to paint this process as a sordid affair.

As the film accurately depicts Libby noting during one of these supposedly nefarious sessions with a CIA analyst, before Gulf War I, the CIA predicted Saddam Hussein as being far away from obtaining nuclear weapons capability. After the war, however, it was discovered that he was much closer to building a nuclear weapon than the intelligence community had believed.

This failure to predict the extent of Saddam’s nuclear program before the first Gulf War, according to the Robb-Silberman Commission report, is one of the reasons that CIA analysts got it wrong in Iraq again. Knowing how much in error their analysis was before the first Gulf War, CIA analysts didn’t want to make the same mistakes again by underestimating Iraq’s nuclear sophistication and drive.



MOVIE MYTH #2: The intelligence community didn’t believe the aluminum tubes purchased by Iraq were for its nuclear program

The movie depicts Plame sitting around a table with other members of the intelligence community discussing Iraq’s acquisition of high-strength aluminum tubes — a key piece of data that led the CIA to conclude that Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear weapons program. The scene further depicts one member of the intelligence community making the case that the tubes are evidence for a reconstituted nuclear program, which prompts Plame to thoroughly debunk the very possibility that the tubes could be used in a nuclear weapons program.

In the absence of any other knowledge, an observer of the scene would be left to conclude that Plame was right and it was transparently obvious that these tubes not only weren’t being used for an Iraqi nuclear program, but couldn’t be used for one. But in reality, as the bipartisan Robb-Silberman Commission report notes, “Most agencies in the Intelligence Community assessed — incorrectly — that these [aluminum tubes] were intended for use in a uranium enrichment program.”

The report goes on to note that “Analysts from the National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC),” which was an intelligence agency, “recognized as the national experts on conventional military systems” concluded that “While it could ‘not totally rule out the possibility’ that the tubes could be used for rockets and thus were not destined for a nuclear-related use, the tubes were, technically speaking, poor choices for rocket bodies.”

So, the report continues, “NGIC’s expert judgment was therefore that there was a very low probability the tubes were designed for conventional use in rockets” and “because of NGIC’s expertise on conventional weapons systems such as rockets, NGIC’s view that the tubes were poor choices for rocket bodies gave CIA analysts greater confidence in their own judgment that the tubes were likely for use in centrifuges.”

While it is true that Department of Energy dissented from the consensus view on aluminum tubes, most of the intelligence community thought otherwise and the “CIA informed senior policymakers that it believed the tubes were destined for use on Iraqi gas centrifuges.”

On the aluminum tubes contention, “Fair Game” is hardly fair.



MOVIE MYTH #3: The 16 words about uranium from Africa in Bush’s State of the Union speech were a lie, and it was well known to be a lie because of Joe Wilson’s trip to Niger.

One of the main turning points in the movie is when Wilson is sitting at an airport bar listening to the State of the Union when he hears Bush utter these 16 words: “The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.”

He discovers later that when referencing Africa, Bush was indeed referring to Niger specifically. This sets Wilson, who suggests his report to the CIA definitively debunked the Iraq-Niger claim, off. The ultimate culmination of his rage is him penning his op-ed in the New York Times in July 2003.

There is a minefield full of problems with all of this. For starters, Bush’s statement was technically accurate. British intelligence was suggesting at the time that Iraq was trying to get uranium from Niger. After a lengthy investigation, in 2004, the British government would issue the Butler Report on pre-war intelligence about Iraqi WMD. On Bush’s State of the Union claim, it said, “we conclude also that the statement in President Bush’s State of the Union Address of 28 January 2003 … was well-founded.”

What’s more, Joe Wilson’s contention that he definitively disproved the possibility that Iraq purchased uranium from Niger is categorically false — at least the CIA didn’t take it that way at all. The bipartisan U.S. Senate report looking into intelligence failures surrounding Iraq stated that while the intelligence report regarding Wilson’s trip showed the difficulty of Niger selling uranium to rogue countries, it “did not refute the possibility that Iraq had approached Niger to purchase uranium.” In fact, the report goes on to say, that the most important information gleaned from Wilson’s trip to Niger was “that the Nigerian officials admitted that the Iraqi delegation had traveled there in 1999, and the Nigerian prime minister believed the Iraqis were interested in purchasing uranium …”

The Senate report ultimately concluded, “The report on the former ambassador’s trip to Niger, disseminated in March 2002, did not change any analysts’ assessments of the Iraq-Niger uranium deal. For most analysts, the information in the report lent more credibility to the original Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) reports on the uranium deal,” though the report does note that “State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) analysts believed that the report supported their assessment that Niger was unlikely to be willing or able to sell uranium to Iraq.”

Overall, Wilson’s trip, according to the report, was mainly viewed as a non-event — intelligence community “analysts had a fairly consistent response to the intelligence report based on the former ambassador’s trip in that no one believed it added a great deal of new information to the Iraq-Niger uranium story,” the Senate report reads. What’s more, Wilson’s trip was viewed as so inconsequential that the Senate report says that the “CIA’s briefer did not brief the vice president on the report, despite the vice president’s previous questions about the issue.”

The bipartisan Senate report also discovered that Wilson was telling the press things that he couldn’t possibly have known about. Wilson was the source in a Washington Post article that said documents related to the supposed Niger uranium sale to Iraq were forged because “the dates were wrong and the names were wrong.” Except, as the Senate report noted, Wilson “had never seen the CIA reports and had no knowledge of what names and dates were in the reports.” Wilson told the Senate committee that he may have “misspoken.”

Now, it is true the CIA later concluded that the 16 words probably should not have been included in the president’s State of the Union address. But as the Senate report notes, “At the time the president delivered the State of the Union address, no one in the IC [intelligence community] had asked anyone in the White House to remove the sentence from the speech.” It further noted that “CIA Iraq nuclear analysts and the director of WINPAC told committee staff that at the time of the State of the Union, they still believed that Iraq was probably seeking uranium from Africa, and they continued to hold that belief until the IAEA reported that the documents were forgeries.”

In other words, Bush’s 16 words are hardly an example of the Bush administration’s perfidy in supposedly pushing false claims about Iraq on the American public in order to justify war. Like much of the intelligence given to the Bush administration before the war, the intelligence community simply got it wrong.



MOVIE MYTH #4: The revelation of Valerie Plame’s association with the CIA gravely harmed American intelligence efforts and cost lives

The most dramatic scenes in the move depict Plame involved in highly sensitive operations with the CIA, including those that involve Iraqi scientists. As a result of her outing during the Iraq War, the movie shows operations to save her Iraqi contacts halted and we are lead to believe they probably died as a result.

In an interview, Liman told TheDC that a former CIA officer told him that “people were put in mortal jeopardy as a result of the outing of Valerie Plame and separately that it did not end well for the scientists.”

Despite Liman’s claim, it is far from clear that Plame played as crucial a role as movie viewers are led to believe. It also seems to be a stretch to suggest that American assets died as a result of her revelation. Reporters Walter Pincus and Richard Leiby write about this in a recent Washington Post article about the movie:

It’s true that Valerie Plame Wilson was working with one of the CIA’s teams trying to gather intelligence on Iraq WMD operations, but she evidently did not play the central role that the film puts her in. She was not directly part of the scientist program, according to agency officials.

The movie, on the other hand, depicts Valerie recruiting an Iraqi-born Cleveland physician to visit her scientist brother in Baghdad for information about Hussein’s alleged nuclear program. In fact, the doctor was recruited by another CIA officer. Although the film suggests that the blowing of Valerie’s cover led directly to the shutdown of the Iraqi scientist exfiltration, an intelligence insider told us: “Something like this, if it was going on, wouldn’t have been canceled for this reason.”

Interview with “Fair Game” director Doug Liman

In an interview with TheDC, Liman showed a stunning ignorance about the Valerie Plame affair for a man who claims to have thoroughly fact-checked the film. After pressing Liman about several scenes depicted in the film, using the bipartisan Robb-Silberman Commission report as my guide, TheDC got the impression he was completely unfamiliar with the report.

“Did you read the Robb-Silberman report before making the film?” TheDC asked.

“My writers did,” he said.

Which is another way to say “no.”

(It should be noted that the most relevant portion of the report as it pertains to the events depicted in “Fair Game” is less than 100 pages long. I suppose it is understandable that Liman didn’t take the hour or two necessary to read it — it is, after all, only the most comprehensive and authoritative report ever produced on the subject the movie covers.)

Liman kept trying to prove his interpretation of events by referencing the declassified 2002 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq.

“I’ve actually seen the NIE,” Liman said. “The beauty of making this film years after the fact is that so many documents have been declassified. And so you can actually read the actual documents the president and vice president were presented.”

The NIE was declassified in 2003, at least parts of it. And, as should be obvious, it was read and incorporated into both the Senate report and the Robb-Silberman Commission report. It also doesn’t do anything to bolster Liman’s case. Indeed, beyond uranium acquisition, the NIE supports more generally that Iraq was pursuing a nuclear weapons program.

“Iraq does not yet have a nuclear weapon or sufficient material to make one but is likely to have a weapon by 2007 to 2009,” the NIE reads in one section.

“Most agencies believe that Saddam’s personal interest in and Iraq’s aggressive attempts to obtain high-strength aluminum tubes for centrifuge rotor — as well as Iraq’s attempts to acquire magnets, high-speed balancing machines, and machine tools — provide compelling evidence that Saddam is reconstituting a uranium enrichment effort for Baghdad’s nuclear weapons program. (DOE agrees that reconstitution of the nuclear program is underway but assesses that the tubes probably are not part of the program.),” the NIE reads in another section.

The NIE does contain a reservation from one intelligence agency, but it makes clear that the intelligence community as a whole estimated with “moderate confidence” that Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear weapons program and that the country could have a nuclear weapon by the end of the decade.

Liman is left to argue that the Bush administration should have listened to the DOE.

“When you have the Department of Energy telling you the tubes are poor choices, that they are poorly suited, those were their words, for weapons production and the DOE is the expert when it comes to gas centrifuges, I would listen. You can’t get any more forceful than that,” he said.

It is true the DOE was in the minority of the intelligence community in dissenting from the aluminum tubes aspect of the nuclear case against Iraq. But it also joined with the intelligence community to assess that Iraq had a nuclear program that could produce a nuclear weapon by the end of the decade. If you are wondering what Liman’s point here is by pointing out one intelligence agency dissenting from the aluminum tubes analysis or how this piece of information provides any evidence that the Bush administration intentionally promoted false claims to push the country into war, you are not alone.



When pressed to tell TheDC what information he had, as he claimed, that the Robb-Silberman Commission didn’t have when it issued its report, Liman first suggested that he had talked to Plame’s CIA colleagues.

The Robb-Silberman Commission interviewed, in its words, “hundreds of experts from inside and outside the Intelligence Community …”

When pressed further to see what else he may have had that the Robb-Silberman Commission didn’t have access to, Liman said that he talked to an FBI agent who had some information about the matter and that he had Karl Rove’s memoir, which had not yet been published when the commission issued its report. Pretty paltry stuff.

Liman also claimed that he reached out to Scooter Libby’s attorneys to get his side of the story.

“We made several attempts to speak with Scooter Libby, through more than one lawyer,” he said.

When asked to name the lawyers, he replied that the lawyers “specifically asked me not use their names.”

But one of Libby’s attorneys told TheDC that he polled Libby’s attorneys involved in the case and none of them said they were contacted by Liman or anyone else associated with the movie.

“My law firm serves as counsel to Mr. Libby. We were not contacted,” said Alex J. Bourelly, an attorney at Baker Botts LLP, in an e-mail to TheDC, “and we are told by Mr. Libby’s other counsel that they were not contacted, during the preparation of the movie ‘Fair Game’ by the Director, or anyone else associated with the film, to discuss or screen the film, or to approach Mr. Libby to see if he would discuss or screen the film.”

He continued: “Counsel for Mr. Libby were publicly disclosed during the trial and are easy to find.”

Despite all the major myths propagated by his film that could have been corrected with just a minimal amount of reading, Liman somehow seems to view himself as some top-notch researcher, saying that if one was going to “pick a filmmaker who was just going to create a puff piece, that was just going to tell their [Wilson and Plame’s] point of view exclusively, I would not have been the filmmaker chosen.”

“I’m way too strong-willed and I have too strong of a background in research,” he told TheDC. “If I was Valerie and Joe and just wanted someone to parrot my side of the story there are other filmmakers who would be infinitely better choices than Doug Liman.”’

Actually, if you were Valerie Plame or Joe Wilson, it doesn’t seem like you could do much better than Doug Liman.

In the end, the movie is what you would expect from Hollywood, especially a film relating to the Iraq War that got Sean Penn — Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro’s favorite sycophant — to sign on. If accuracy matters, “Fair Game” should be destined for the dustbin. But if history is any guide, it is a shoe-in for an Academy Award.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2010/11/10/hollywood-hit-job-fair-game-propagates-easily-disprovable-myths-about-lead-up-to-iraq-war/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjhtsrt_7P9AhXoGFkFHRZBALo4MhAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw1I0FDgRrZb76ro0xsSCsWW,2010-11-10
Palin at Iowa State Fair: I’m still undecided on 2012,"DES MOINES, Iowa — 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin said Friday that she still hasn’t decided if she’s going to run for president.

Palin is also undecided about whom she would endorse if she ultimately decided against entering the race.

Swarmed by media and supporters at the Iowa State Fair, the former governor of Alaska told The Daily Caller that she’s not concerned that Mitt Romney is considered the frontrunner at this time.

“No, nothing worries me at this point,” Palin told TheDC. “Could I support somebody like Mitt Romney? Yeah.”

When TheDC pointed out that some tea partiers have pledged to make sure Romney doesn’t get the nomination, Palin said, “I’m of the mind of ABO — Anybody But Obama, at this time.”

“We’ve got to get this country on the right track, we need fiscal conservatives with executive experience who’ve run businesses, run a state, [and] understand what it takes to allow the private sector to create jobs,” Palin said, in full stump mode.

“We don’t see that in Barack Obama,” Palin added. “We don’t see that in the Pelosi–Reid agenda. So that has got to stop and we need a Republican to get in there. And whether that’s Mitt Romney or one of the other candidates or one of the potential candidates, I have great faith that we will get back on the right track when things change in 2012.”

It is widely speculated that if Palin were to skip the 2012 presidential race herself, she could support Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who is poised to officially enter the race on Saturday. Palin on Friday wished Perry well.

“That adds to the debate,” Palin said. “It adds another choice for Americans to consider heading into 2012. I appreciate that he’s willing to jump into this arena to be apart of this.”

She also insisted that she’s “glad Michele Bachmann is in the arena.”

“I’m glad she’s had the opportunity now to be on stage debating some good ideas,” Palin said. “[I’m] proud of anybody, male or female, willing to put it all on the line and get out there and fight for what’s right in this country and Michele’s one of those.”

It’s a big weekend in Iowa, and declared candidates are spending the weekend at the state fair ahead of Saturday’s Ames Straw Poll.

Palin said she chose to visit the fair as part of her “One Nation” bus tour, “to experience this wonderful historic event.”

She told onlookers how the event puts the spotlight “on the heartland of America, here at the historic Iowa State Fair, where you get to meet the farmers, you get to meet their kids, you get to see the future of America in these kids.

“It gives me hope for the future of America.”

UPDATE: In a subsequent phone call to The Daily Caller on Friday, Palin said her remarks to TheDC should not be interpreted as support for Romney in the race. Palin reiterated that she’s for ABO — “Anybody But Obama.”

A representative of SarahPAC also told TheDC that Palin has complained to Fox, whose site Fox Nation aggregated this article, for what she calls a misleading headline for this story.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2011/08/12/palin-at-iowa-state-fair-i%25E2%2580%2599m-still-undecided-on-2012/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjAm6bs_7P9AhVVEFkFHVchC544HhAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw3IPRuAKonOgVTk9SjP5EIv,2011-08-12
Foxconn allegedly hid underage workers before inspection by the Fair Labor Association,"Apple manufacturing partner Foxconn allegedly had prior knowledge of an upcoming inspection by the Fair Labor Association and transferred its underage workers out of sight, reports Apple Insider.

Debby Sze Wan Chan, a project officer at Students & Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior, said she had heard from Foxconn employees that the factory was “ready for inspection.”

“All underage workers between 16-17 years old were not assigned any overtime work and some of them were even sent to other departments,” Chan said.

Apple allows children as young as 16 to work under its supplier code of conduct, but only if they are legally able to work and only with certain limitations in place on hours and types of work.

If true, the allegations are pretty damning.

Chan also provided the following breakdown on Foxconn employee pay:

“In Zhengzhou, the basic salary of new workers is CNY 1350 ($214),” Chan said. “And there is a deduction of CNY 150 ($24) for the dorm. If a worker eats inside the factory, there is another CNY 200-300 ($32-48) to pay. It is far from the living wage standard. Without overtime premiums, a worker can hardly support his/herself.”

Demanding our fair share or choosing to share our fare?,"Are Americans no longer responding to John F. Kennedy’s plea to “Ask not what your country can do for you ─ ask what you can do for your country”? Or have they just begun to answer that question with “Ask the 1% what they can do, we the 99% have done all we are going to do”?

There is a lot of talk these days about those who have done all the right things deserving their fair share. But what exactly is a citizen’s fair share and who determines that share? How will a citizen from the 99% respond when he or she is asked for more because someone in a lower portion of that 99% is not getting their fair share?

Americans who work hard and play by the rules have never expected to be held responsible to make up the difference if other Americans who also worked hard and played by the rules felt short-changed for one reason or another. The promise that everyone has a chance to climb the ladder in American society has drawn millions of immigrants to this country. But the promise was not that you would be carried up the ladder. Often in America, people who have made it to the higher rungs of the ladder do offer a helping hand. But you cannot blame them for not wanting to be pulled off the ladder by too many hanging on.

If the goal is to level the playing field, many may instead be inspired to quit the game. Fewer and fewer players remaining on the field left with the responsibility of providing those who have left the field with their fair share is not a winning formula.

The winning formula for our nation has always been the God-given right to freedom and the pursuit of happiness. However, with that right also comes the right to failure.

True, too many as of late have been spared their right to fail. Financial institutions, automobile companies, preferred corporations and others are at the top of that list. Instead of trying to eliminate failure, which is of course impossible, why not level the playing field by allowing all a chance to fail and all a chance to succeed?

This brings to mind the tale of the ant and the grasshopper. As I am sure you recall, all summer long the ant worked hard to store food for the long winter ahead. The grasshopper chose instead to dance and play the summer away without making any preparation for the winter. In the version of the story I am holding up, the ant did in the end help the grasshopper. But it was of the ant’s own choosing. The ant was not mandated by anyone to help the grasshopper. The ant did so by its own free will.

It is important that we extend a hand to help others up the rungs of the ladder. But have we become more like the grasshopper than the ant? Are more and more of us expecting others to make up the difference for our shortcomings, as Charles J. Sykes, a senior fellow at the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute and the author of “A Nation of Moochers: America’s Addiction to Getting Something for Nothing,” suggests? Sykes is concerned that we are at the tipping point at which more Americans depend on the efforts of others than on their own.

Let’s move the scale in the right direction by returning to JFK’s call and answering it by helping each other out by choice and not by commanding others to do all the helping. Let’s make a pledge: Instead of demanding our fair share, let’s choose to share our fare.

Axelrod: Romney’s Mormonism ‘not fair game’,"On Sunday’s “State of the Union” on CNN, Obama senior campaign adviser David Axelrod reiterated the position that his campaign repudiates the use of Mormonism as a political weapon to attack former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.

However, Axelrod said he had hoped Romney would exercise the same judgment regarding Obama and his relationship with the controversial Rev. Jeremiah Wright.

“Absolutely, and we have right along,” Axelrod said to CNN “State of the Union” host Candy Crowley in repudiating the notion of politicizing Romney’s faith. “We’ve said that’s not fair game. And we wish that Gov. Romney would stand up as strongly and as resolutely consistently to refute these kinds of things on his side. Instead, he’s amplified them in the past. And he’s put logs on that fire. And that’s not leadership.”

However, he added that Romney’s response to those attempting to make hay out of the Wright issue was inadequate.

“Tepidly and reluctantly, he did,” Axelrod said of Romney’s condemnation of using the Wright issue. “But, in February, he actually raised the issue and said it was fair game. So, you know, the problem is you have to be consistent in your position. And you have to be genuine and firm in your — you can’t be grudging in your position, or you send the wrong signals.”

"No fair bringing up the Obama stimulus money, Mitt","There are many reasons The Evil Mitt Romney is evil and bad. He makes a lot of money. (Boooooo!) He put his dog on top of a car without even eating it. (Hissssssss!!) He worked for the company that literally broke Batman’s back. (Get off the stage, ya bum!!!)

But perhaps the most evil reason for The Evil Mitt Romney’s evil is that he’s made investments overseas. That’s right, he stooped that low. What kind of American lets his money go to other countries? Is The Evil Mitt Romney’s money too fancy for us Americans? “Oooh, lookit me, I’m so fancy!”

What do you have to say for yourself, The Evil Mitt Romney?

Ryan spokesman: ‘I’m not sure I would say’ Raddatz was fair,"Michael Steel, a spokesman for GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan, indicated Thursday night that he’s not at all certain ABC News journalist Martha Raddatz moderated the sole debate between Ryan and Vice President Joe Biden fairly.

“I thought she obviously asserted herself more than [Jim] Lehrer did,” Steel said, referencing the moderator of the first presidential debate last week, according to Politico. “[B]ut there was still a great deal of crosstalk, there was still a great deal of difficulty making points in a reasonable and progressive fashion.”

“So you think she made it fair, would you say?” a reporter asked in a follow-up question.

“I’m not sure I would say that,” Steel replied. (RELATED: Raddatz gives lopsided VP debate moderating performance)

After The Daily Caller reported Wednesday that President Barack Obama attended Raddatz’s second wedding, where she wed Obama’s current Federal Communications Commission chairman Julius Genachowski, Steel said the Ryan campaign had “no concerns” about Raddatz’s potential for running the debate with an uneven hand.

Raddatz and Genachowski have since divorced and are remarried to separate spouses. (RELATED: ABC News scrambles to downplay Obama’s attendance at Raddatz’s wedding)

Neither Steel nor another Ryan spokesman have responded to TheDC’s requests for comment about Steel’s very different statement now that the debate is over.

Even though Raddatz declined to stop Biden’s many interruptions, several reporters and commentators from establishment media outlets vigorously and quickly defended her.

The Poynter Institute touted Raddatz’ performance with a montage of tweets from media figures it said “praise[d]” her as moderator. BuzzFeed ran a headline claiming Raddatz was the debate’s “winner” and quoted Steel sparsely without noting his larger conclusion about the debate’s fairness.

In supporting Raddatz, Buzzfeed cited former Democratic former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland and tweets from liberal commentators and columnists Andrew Sullivan, Ezra Klein, Bill Maher and Dave Weigel, concluding that “[p]olitical reporters and commentators largely agreed.”

Politico media reporter Dylan Byers, who has defended Raddatz’s journalistic credentials throughout the week, also declared Raddatz the “winner.”

“”The response from the political media,” he said, “was almost unanimously positive.”

"Obama touts fair pay for women, despite records showing women paid less in his own White House [VIDEO]","At Tuesday’s Hofstra University presidential debate, President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney duked it out over pay equity for women, just as they have fought over female votes in the national polls.

While Obama made the empathetic case for his single mother and his belief in equal pay — pointing out that the first bill he signed as president was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act — he did not address reports this year that demonstrated that his own White House pays women less than men.

“The first bill I signed was something called the Lilly Ledbetter bill. And it’s named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldn’t bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it,” Obama said. “So we fixed that. And that’s an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family. This is not just a women’s issue — this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that’s why we’ve got to fight for it.

According to a report published by the Free Beacon in April, the 2011 annual report on White House staff revealed that the median annual salary for female White House employees was 18 percent less than male employees — $60,000 compared to $71,000.

And in 2008, Scripps Howard syndicated columnist Deroy Murdock noted that as in Obama’s U.S. Senate office, women were paid less than men: While the average male staffer brought home $54,397, female staffers averaged $45,152.

Romney detailed his professional history, recruiting women into positions of power during his tenure as governor of Massachusetts. He further pointed out the economic suffering women have endured under Obama, including the loss of 580,000 jobs among women and 3.5 million women in poverty.

“What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy — so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford,” Romney said.

Obama pressed Romney on the Lilly Ledbetter Act, noting that earlier in the year, when asked about the legislation, the former Massachusetts governor dodged the issue.

“I just want to point out that when Gov. Romney’s campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it, he said, ‘I’ll get back to you.’ And that’s not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy,” Obama said, going on to attack Romney for his opposition to government funding of Planned Parenthood and the contraception mandate in Obamacare, painting Romney’s opposition as a potential economic hindrance to women.

“In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured. Because this is not just a — a health issue, it’s an economic issue for women. It makes a difference. This is money out of that family’s pocket. Gov. Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage,” Obama said. “That’s not the kind of advocacy that women need. When Gov. Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care — they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.”

Following the debate, pro-life groups blasted out myriad statements disputing Obama’s assertion that Planned Parenthood provides mammograms.

Romney was not allotted time to respond fully to the president’s follow up, but in answering the next question the Republican nominee revisited his stance on contraception.

“I’d just note that I don’t believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not. And I don’t believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not. Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives,” Romney said. “And the president’s statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.”

Teamsters head Hoffa tries to squash his own employees’ union,"International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) general president Jimmy Hoffa Jr. is suspected by his members of trying to squash a union comprised of some of his own Teamsters organizers.

Hoffa’s battle with his own organizers’ union overlaps with a host of other problems for the prominent labor leader, including a pension crisis that is undercutting his support and a potential UPS strike that he might not be able to afford, according to insiders.

Hoffa still has not granted a contract to the Federation of Agents and International Representatives (FAIR), a union that represents Teamsters organizers. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) allowed FAIR to represent some Teamsters organizers last year in their negotiations with Hoffa, after organizers voted 18-16 to unionize in a Teamsters election.

The Hoffa administration’s battle with FAIR has been divisive, according to documents obtained by the Daily Caller. Teamsters officials openly threatened their own organizers to discourage them from joining FAIR, leading to accusations that the Teamsters were union-busting their own employees’ union.

The growing Teamsters pension crisis, which has seen the union’s retirement fund spiraling toward insolvency, has been one of FAIR’s foremost issues in its opposition to Hoffa.

But instead of drafting a contract with FAIR, the Hoffa administration is believed to be planning to try to strip FAIR of its certification.

Teamsters can begin FAIR’s decertification process in late May by getting 30 percent of its employees to sign a petition to the NLRB to force a new election, where FAIR can be voted out.

Last year the Teamsters sent out a mailing to organizers, obtained by TheDC, disparaging FAIR and asking members if they want to “betray” the Teamsters and “put what you currently have on the table” by joining or voting in favor of FAIR.

“Being disrespectful and making fun of your coworkers that do not agree with your stance is not the way to win friends and influence people. It is a direct reflection of those that are leading the FAIR campaign and the FAIR organization itself,” the mailing reads.

“Are you willing to betray the faith and respect given you by Teamster leaders?,” the mailing [pdf] reads. “Are you willing to put what you currently have on the table?…Choose to remain a Teamster.”

FAIR responded after the election with its own letter, obtained by TheDC, criticizing Hoffa’s union-busting tactics.

“We succeeded in the election…The continuing barrage of frivolous objections and appeals by our senior staff in order to stall and delay the exercise of our rights is appalling,” according to the FAIR letter.

“The use of Teamster member’s dues including yours and ours, to employ union busting tactics is not approved of by our membership or the labor movement at large. This shameful behavior is hypocritical to say the least,” according to the letter.

The FAIR letter [pdf] also accused the Teamsters of having “involved itself in the same unethical behavior as those employers we combat daily.”

TheDC reported this month that the International Brotherhood of Teamsters was forced late last year to issue a notice, pursuant to a settlement agreement with the NLRB and posted as flyers in Teamsters offices, conceding that the Teamsters are not allowed to bust the organizers union.

“Federal law gives you the right to: form, join, or assist a union; Choose a representative to bargain with us on your behalf;” according to the notice, dated August 29, 2012.

“WE WILL NOT do anything to prevent you from exercising the above rights,” according to the notice. “The International Union has been required by the NLRB to post notices that the IBT will cease harassing union organizers for joining a union.”

But the flyers on the office walls have done little to cool tensions.

Insiders are concerned that the Hoffa administration will utilize the same tactics that it used in 2008, when Teamsters organizers tried to unionize after they were removed from the International Brotherhood’s pension plan. The Hoffa administration sent out letters requiring field organizers to sign an admission that they counted merely as “temporary” and “at will” employees — and thus were officially expendable.

The Hoffa administration engaged in “Making phone calls, sending emails and threatening the consequences if they were not signed (using direct and indirect methods),” according to a statement made by a Teamsters organizer posted to a private Teamster chat forum. The veracity of this statement was confirmed by an insider to TheDC.

“It is not any secret after the first wave were ‘terminated’ in November 2008, those that remained were harassed further by the administration and they either conformed or they were fired. Leaving only a hand full [sic] of people that could be used for their gain,” according to a statement by an organizer.

Hoffa’s problems with FAIR are exacerbated by upcoming UPS negotiations.

United Postal Service (UPS) is hoping for concessions once its current contract with the Teamsters expires on July 31. UPS is planning to ask for a new contract that would among other thigns require the International Brotherhood to contribute to its own members’ health plans, according to insiders. The proposed give-back contract would likely necessitate a strike by Hoffa.

However, a lengthy UPS strike would deplete virtually all of the Hoffa administration’s strike resources. Hoffa might be considering a mere two-week strike, which is likely all he can afford to wage, according to one insider.

Hoffa, then, will be going into his UPS negotiations from a position of considerable weakness.

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters did not return requests for comment.

Vanity Fair: ‘Hail Breitbart’ (and damn The Breitbartians!),"When he was alive, the mainstream media sought to diminish him. Now that he is dead, the narrative seems to be that nobody on the right is good enough to fill his shoes.

That’s my interpretation, at least, of James Wolcott’s June 2013 Vanity Fair column, titled, “Andrew Breitbart’s Circus Maximus.”

As Wolcott writes,

“[P]ersonality cults are hard to perpetuate after Elvis has left the building. You can imitate tactics, emulate tone and posture, but you can’t inhale animal spirits from your fallen heroes and make them your own. Now that Breitbart’s metabolism is no longer exerting the magnetic force to bind everything together, the rinky-dinkitude of his school of right-wing muckraking is laid bare.”

He continues,

“[C]onservatives are more enslaved by hero worship than liberals are (they have Ronald Reagan bronzed in their brains), and Breitbart’s death leaves a gap in their superhero lineup that I feel confident somebody awful will fill, if only to maintain their morale for the remainder of the Obama presidency and the Hillary regency. It’ll take a zealot with the constitution of a ham actor, and ham actors aren’t made, they’re born.”

There are some elements of truth here. First, Andrew Breitbart was obviously a very special person. Nobody can replace him — and yes, I do suspect that some conservatives are desperately attempting to impersonate him (and falling far short in the process.)

Since Wolcott mentions Reagan, I do see a parallel, albeit not in regards to conservative hero worship. When he was alive, liberals hated Ronald Reagan. But in death, they have grudgingly come to appreciate him (or maybe they just realized co-opting him was easier than the fool’s errand of besmirching his legacy?)

Just as Reagan has become the standard for Republican politicians, I suspect current and future conservative bloggers and activists will be unfavorably compared to the legend.

“He’s no Breitbart,” they will say. “Not as smart. Not as charismatic.”

And they will be right.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2013/05/08/vanity-fair-hail-breitbart-and-damn-the-breitbartians/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiWuvXu_7P9AhXWkIkEHRYqC4E4RhAWegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw2py1oVo7FmOXy2w2NFH5O0,2013-05-08
Organizer Of Job Fair For Gay MBA Students Seeks To Ban Straight People,"The organizer of a yearly conference for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students pursuing MBAs is in a huff because entirely too many straight students are attending the event, which includes a recruitment fair.

Matt Kidd, executive director of Reaching Out MBA, has also charged that a few attendees made comments that he says some gay people did not appreciate, reports Campus Reform.

For example, in addition to having the temerity to show up while failing to be gay, one straight attendee allegedly said “Dude, I’m not gay.” Another allegedly said: “There needs to be less focus on gay stuff at this event.”

According to Kidd, just one out of 15 students from the MBA program at Rice University who showed up at last year’s gay MBA conference in New Orleans was really gay.

That sole gay student thus felt compelled “to go around introducing himself as ‘the actual gay guy,'” Kidd explained to Bloomberg Businessweek.

Kidd also charged that officials at the College of William & Mary’s business school advised students who were attending the conference to skip most of it and just head straight to the job fair.

“It’s largely done by schools who can’t get companies on their campus,” Kidd, who holds an MBA from New York University’s Stern School of Business and works in the event-organizing industry, told Businessweek.

Chequeta Allen, executive director of career services at William & Mary’s business school, graciously chose to avoid the bait.

“There are recruiters there who are happy to talk to anyone that’s talented,” Allen told Businessweek. “The idea of those groups is to ensure inclusiveness, not to say, ‘We only want LGBT people.'”

In any case, Kidd has said he plans to make it harder for straight job seekers to crash future Reaching Out MBA job fairs.

The exclusion method will be twofold. Would-be attendees will either have to write an essay about why they want to attend the conference or register though the LGBT student groups at their respective schools.

It’s not clear how local LGBT student groups will determine if job seekers are gay enough — or bisexual enough, or transgender enough — to attend.

As Businessweek notes, similar conferences designed for subgroups including black, Asian and Hispanic students have seen their MBA job fairs crashed by outsiders. For example, nearly 40 percent of the job seekers who attended last year’s annual conference of the National Society of Hispanic MBAs weren’t Hispanic.

Manny Gonzalez, the group’s CEO, was far more sanguine about the crossover than Kidd.

“We live in a diverse world, so whether you go to a Fortune 500 company or a midsize business, you’ll be engaged in a diverse workforce,” Gonzalez told Businessweek. “The more exposure as a student you have in these communities, the more you learn.”

School District Bans Birthday Cupcakes Because They AREN’T FAIR,"An elementary school in the outer suburbs of Atlanta has outlawed birthday cupcakes, cookies and, in fact, all food from birthday parties over fears that some kids with food allergies could feel sad and left out.

Officials at Brooks Elementary School in Newnan, Ga. announced the draconian new policy for the upcoming school year via a letter to parents, reports The Newnan Times-Herald.

“When parents have brought in goodies for birthdays, oftentimes these children are not included in the snack because of dietary restrictions and have felt left out,” Julie Raschen, principal of Brooks Elementary, said, according to the Times-Herald. “Parents can still send in treats for their child’s birthday, we just ask that they not be food items.”

Raschen claimed that upwards of 10 percent of the students at the school have suffered from all manner of food allergies to foods ranging from peanuts to gluten to blueberries.

“This is a school-based decision due to the high number of students with significant allergies at Brooks,” she explained.

While allergy concerns are important, the principal equally stressed fairness concerns. Thus, the cupcake ban will treat every student fairly by ensuring that no students receive cupcakes.

“Although our first priority above all else is the safety of our students, we are also trying to create an environment in which all students feel included and not singled out,” Raschen told the local newspaper. “So both safety and a positive environment for all students were the reasons for this change.”

A school district spokesman said the new policy will not apply to various holiday celebrations. It’s not clear why kids with allergies will presumably be left out of those events.

Raschen stressed that the policy is not a response to new guidelines under the Hunger-Free Kids Act which prevent bake sales and the sale of many kinds of food at all schools taking associated federal funding. (RELATED: Michelle Obama Policy Axes Cupcake Fundraiser For WWII Vets)

At the same time, the principal noted, Brooks Elementary will, indeed ban all such food sales.

Earlier this summer, a school district in the suburbs of Seattle also banned birthday cakes. School officials in Edmonds, Wash. said the ban is part of a broader set of wellness and nutrition policies that dovetails with the new federal wellness guidelines.

Banning things out of fear that kids’ feelings might be hurt has been a common theme at public schools around the country. For example, in May, officials at an affluent Rhode Island middle school sent a letter to parents explaining that a traditional honors night had been eliminated because rewarding students who do well is “exclusive.” Later, in the face of withering national ridicule, the school reinstituted the honors night.

Also in May, a Michigan elementary school sternly warned parents that their children should not try to win any of the events held at the school’s field day. (RELATED: Grade School Field Day Flyer Warns Parents: “Competitive Urge To Win Will Be Kept To A Minimum’)

PIE JINKS! Did The Kentucky State Fair’s Blue-Ribbon Buttermilk Pie Have A Pillsbury Crust?,"In what would certainly be the best viral advertising campaign in the 142-year history of baking giant Pillsbury, officials with the Kentucky State Fair are probing the origin of the crust used to make this year’s blue ribbon buttermilk pie to determine if it contained an off-the-shelf Pillsbury crust.

The culinary champion behind the award-winning buttermilk pie is Linda Horton, a retired factory worker from the Louisville suburb of Valley Station, The Courier-Journal reports.

Horton, 67, again took her buttermilk pie to the Kentucky State Fair, an annual 10-day affair which takes place in Louisville and wrapped up Aug. 30.

This year marks the second consecutive year Horton has bagged first prize. She describes her concoction as a hybrid between a chess pie — a Southern specialty — and a cheesecake, according to Macon, Ga. CBS affiliate WMAZ.

The controversy flared up after Horton shared her prize-winning recipe with a Courier-Journal reporter.

“This year, I used a Pillsbury pie crust,” she told the newspaper. She explained that homemade crusts had proved problematic in the past because they “didn’t crumble a whole lot.”

The great thing about a store-bought Pillsbury crust is that it’s “so buttery,” Horton added.

After learning that Horton had used a crust she purchased at a grocery store, other contestants who had entered the pie-baking contest complained.

These complaints led fair officials to investigate Horton’s delicious, oh-so-buttery pie.

“If we award her a first place ribbon for a pie crust that Pillsbury made, we would have to give the ribbon to Pillsbury,” Steve Lee, superintendent of the state fair’s culinary department, told The Courier-Journal.

“State Fair culinary competition management takes matters such as this very seriously,” Lee also promised.

If Horton did, in fact, use a Pillsbury crust, she would have blatantly broken the rules of the pie contest.

“No commercial pie crusts may be used,” the Kentucky State Fair Premium List and General Rules Book states on page 203.

When she submitted her scrumptious buttermilk pie recipe, Horton was vague about the crust, saying only that she lined “two 8-inch pie pans with pastry crust.”

Lee was diplomatic about the potential snafu, suggesting to The Courier Journal that perhaps Horton merely wanted “to show people how simple a good pie could be to make quickly at home.”

Ominously, however, the state fair official warned that Horton’s blue ribbon “will be voided” if, in fact, she used a Pillsbury crust.

The ingredients in Horton’s prize-winning buttermilk pie filling are butter, flour, buttermilk, sugar, eggs and vanilla extract.

Vanity Fair Cover Teases Bill De Blasio Sex Tape,"The newly-released January cover of magazine Vanity Fair has an interesting Easter egg: a half-hidden message seemingly teasing a sex tape featuring Democratic New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.

The cover depicts actor Bradley Cooper shooting pool, with various inside stories written across pool balls. But one pool ball, cut off by the edge of the photo, only reads “-ILL -LASIO -EX -APE!” It doesn’t take a master sleuth to fill in the blanks. (RELATED: De Blasio Sacrifices Jobs To Liberate NYC Horses From ‘Tortured’ Lives)

The New York Times reports that, no, there is not actually any story on a sex tape in Vanity Fair’s January issue. A representative for the magazine gave a bizarre explanation, saying, “That’s what you get for letting Kim Kardashian guest edit the cover lines.”

De Blasio’s wife, Chirlane McCray, emailed an alternate reading to the Times: “Bill de Blasio Spandex Cape? Great idea for Halloween next year!”

Gov Rauner Faces New Challenge In ‘Fair Share’ Fight,"The attorney general of Illinois challenged Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner Monday on a recent lawsuit aimed at ending fair share union dues for government workers in the state.

In February, after only a month of being in office, Rauner went after fair share dues in two ways. He ordered state agencies to stop collecting them while also filing a federal lawsuit to end the state law that requires them. Fair share is a fee nonunion employees must pay to the union to cover the costs of collective bargaining.

After the executive order and lawsuit, Rauner was quickly attacked by labor unions and other left leaning groups. Democratic Attorney General Lisa Madigan is now moving to dismiss the federal lawsuit.

“I have submitted a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that the governor does not have the legal authority . . . to challenge the law in federal court,” Madigan said in a statement to the Chicago Sun-Times.

“As attorney general, it is my job to represent the state and defend our laws when their constitutionality is challenged in court,” she continued. “Because the governor’s case questions the validity of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act, I moved to intervene to provide the court with arguments regarding the law’s constitutionality.”

The governor’s office was quick to respond by noting Rauner is in the right and that the challenge will not have an effect.

“As expected, the attorney general filed a motion in federal court to defend so-called ‘fair share’ union dues in state government, which is why the governor pro-actively asked the attorney general’s office to allow the governor’s office to use pro bono outside counsel,” the governor’s office told the Chicago Sun-Times. “The attorney general’s actions will have no impact on the governor’s efforts to protect taxpayers and state employees who don’t want to pay forced union dues.”

Prior to the executive order, Rauner had pointed towards prevailing wage laws and project labor agreements as some of the few examples of how labor unions are hurting the state through unfair laws.

Project labor agreements are deals between owners of construction projects and construction unions in which firms must enter into collective bargaining with a union, hire workers through the union and pay union wages and benefits. In government contracting, a prevailing wage is the hourly wage, benefits and overtime that must be paid to the majority of workers within a particular area.

According to a report by the libertarian Cato Institute, project labor agreements alone can add 12 to 18 percent to the cost of public projects.

Rauner hopes that reforming labor policy and unions will allow the state to overcome some major economic obstacles that have hindered progress in recent years. According to The Illinois Policy Institute, the state is struggling in jobs and education, two areas vital to economic growth and stability.

“Illinois’ low standing for total job growth is unusual given that Illinois has the largest population in the Midwest and the fifth largest nationally,” the Institute noted in a report for 2014. “It takes a particularly toxic combination of bad policy and corrupt dealings to hinder such a large and talented workforce from keeping up with the likes of Kentucky and Connecticut.”

“Illinois tracks last of all states for private-sector job creation in 2014, one of only four states to be negative for jobs on the year,” the report added.

Bernie Pulls Ahead Of Hillary In Poll After Both Campaign At Iowa State Fair,"Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders made dueling appearances just hours apart Saturday at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines. But if an informal straw poll conducted by the Iowa Secretary of State is any reliable measure of whose visit was more successful, the Vermont senator clearly won the day.

According to the Iowa secretary of state’s website, which monitors the votes in real-time, more than 52 percent of Democrats who have cast a vote in the straw poll say they support Sanders. Just over 41 percent said they support Clinton.

That’s a nice gain for Sanders, who was tied with Clinton at 46 percent after Friday — the second day of the fair.

While the straw poll has a small sample size and likely says little about how Iowans will vote in February’s all-important caucus, it does provide an apples-to-apples comparison of how voters view the two candidates when they appear at the same venue.

Like nearly all of the other presidential candidates who have attended or plan to attend the Iowa State Fair before it ends next week, Sanders held sway Saturday at The Des Moines Register Presidential Soapbox, a large forum held on the fair grounds.

The 73-year-old Sanders drew the largest crowd so far at the event, according to reporters on the ground in Des Moines.

Clinton opted out of the event, making her the only Democrat — and the only candidate of either party besides Donald Trump — to do so. Instead, she chose to answer questions from reporters on the outskirts of the fair grounds. She also mingled with state fair attendees as she walked with Iowa U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin, who endorsed her Thursday. Clinton shook hands and posed for pictures for about an hour before heading to Martha’s Vineyard, where she will attend a birthday party along with President Obama.

Clinton’s choice of the press conference over the soapbox event mirrors the tack she’s taken throughout her campaign. Utilizing her larger campaign staff and her Secret Service protection, she’s opted for controlled, tightly-scripted events. While she’s attended town hall meetings, attendees are often vetted before entering. During Saturday’s presser, her campaign spokesman, Nick Merrill, chose which reporters to call on.

Clinton still maintains a large lead over Sanders in Iowa, however. According to a CNN/ORC poll conducted last week, 50 percent support Clinton, 31 percent back Sanders, and 12 said they would vote for Vice President Joe Biden, who is reportedly considering running. Sanders has gained on the front-runner elsewhere, though. A surprising poll out of New Hampshire released this week showed him leading Clinton 44-38.

Black Lives Matter Marches On Minnesota State Fair,"By Marisa Helms

ST PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) – Several hundred protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement marched to the Minnesota State Fair on Saturday to bring attention to race issues ranging from policing to underrepresentation of minorities at one of the nation’s biggest state fairs.

The mixed-race crowd, including senior citizens and children, chanted slogans along the 1-1/2 mile route and briefly lay down on a bridge south of the fairgrounds.

“There’s a cliche that Minnesota is nice to everyone, but that’s not the case for people of color,” said 51-year-old marcher Tim, who did not want to give his last name because event organizers said they had received death threats.

“As a white person I want to be vocal about that … This (protest march) is a small inconvenience to state fair traffic compared to what people of color experience every day,” he said.

Fairgoers stopped to take photos of the marchers, organized by Black Lives St. Paul.

“We’re disturbed on a day-to-day basis. We don’t mind disturbing the status quo for one day,” said Trahern Crews, 40, an event organizer who is running for a seat on the St. Paul City Council.

Black Lives Matter, a decentralized national movement against racism in policing and the justice system, gained momentum last year during protests over police killings of unarmed black men.

The group also pressures 2016 presidential hopefuls to address issues such as mass incarcerations of African Americans.

St. Paul police put on extra staff for the march, which grew louder as it neared the entrance of the fair, which attracts up to 1.8 million visitors over its 12-day run each summer.

On Friday, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton said that while he understood the interest of the demonstrators, taking their protest to the fair is “inappropriate.”

The demonstration is expected to stay outside the fairgrounds due to a state restriction.

Rashad Turner, organizer of Black Lives St. Paul on Friday reminded protesters to remain peaceful. “Our opponents will claim victory if they push someone over the line. I don’t know about you, but let’s not give them the satisfaction.”

The ‘Fair Play Fair Pay Act’ Is A Corporate Music Label Cash Grab,"Technological innovation has changed the way we listen to music, and record executives are not happy about it. While record label revenues have plummeted, the glitz and glamor at the MTV Video Music Awards should be proof enough that artists and the industry are still finding financial success. Nevertheless, in what is little more than an attempt at a quick cash grab, huge corporate music label conglomerates are trying to get Congress to undo rules that have been in place 80 years and have allowed record labels and artists to thrive.

Introduced in April by Congressman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) and Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), the proposed “Fair Play Fair Pay Act” (H.R. 1733) would for the first time require AM/FM radio broadcasters to pay royalty fees to recording artists and record labels.

Currently, AM/FM stations only pay royalties to the songwriters of the songs they play on the air. The bill seeks to knock terrestrial radio to the same level as the Internet, since digital music platforms like Pandora and Spotify are paying royalties to the performing artists and record labels on top of royalties to the songwriters.

On the surface, the bill seems noble — artists should be paid for their work, right? — but radio airplay has long been considered a promotional tool and launching pad for artists rather than a revenue stream in and of itself. Artists have much more to lose and little to gain from supporting this kind of legislation.

Under the proposed legislation, royalty rates would be set by unaccountable “Copyright Royalty Judges” and if the framework digital music services operate under is any indication, most of the royalties from radio airplay are going to end up in the hands of record executives — not performers. Only 4 percent of Pandora’s revenues go to music publishers (the entities responsible for ensuring the songwriters and composers receive their royalties) and 50 percent goes to the record labels.

The National Association of Broadcasters notes that there is a direct correlation between the number of plays on a local radio station and the sales of albums and singles, resulting in approximately $2.4 billion in free promotion annually.

Contrary to what you might think, given the digital age we live in, most people still discover new music over terrestrial airwaves. Eighty-five percent of music listeners identify radio as the place they first hear new music.

Forcing radio stations into a government established and controlled pricing scheme would only benefit the established players in the music industry, and serve as yet another barrier to entry for new artists. If radio stations are going to have to pay more for every track they spin, they are going to be spinning fewer tracks, and you can bet that it’s not going to be the established pop music artists that get less spins — it’s going to be the up and coming artists people have yet to hear about.

New artists trying to break into the biz aren’t the only ones that will be impacted by this legislation. It could have real economic consequences for the average person too.

With more of their revenues going towards paying royalties to mega artists and record labels, radio stations will be left with fewer financial resources, and this could cost jobs. Local radio stations and their employees wouldn’t be the only ones affected; think about the small businesses that rely on radio stations to reach local consumers, and the listeners who rely on local radio for news, emergency information, and weather updates.

This sort of legislation will have repercussions for all.

A more ideal approach would allow artists and performers to enter into private contracts with themselves, their bandmates, and radio stations to determine how royalty checks are split and how big or small they will be. A major artist like Kanye West may demand that radio stations pay him a dollar every time they play his record, while smaller up and coming bands may allow radio stations to play their songs for free so they can get exposure.

The “Fair Play Fair Pay Act” forces radio stations to pay an arbitrary and minimum fee each time they play a song. It’s essentially government-backed price setting. Just because the act brings terrestrial radio royalty payments in line with how royalties are paid out by companies like Spotify and Pandora doesn’t mean it’s a great system. Terrestrial radio and digital music services serve two very different purposes. Making the two systems more equitable may prevent a lot of new music from ever being heard, and have severe economic consequences as well.

‘Captain Underpants’ Book With Gay Character Booted From Grade School Book Fair,"An elementary school in small-town southeastern Michigan has banned “Captain Underpants and the Sensational Sag of Sir Stinks-A-Lot” from its upcoming book fair this year because a main character ends up being gay.

The school is Arborwood Elementary School in Monroe, Mich., reports Detroit ABC affiliate WXYZ.

The book, the 12th in a series by Dav Pilkey, features a section — spoiler alert! — in which the fourth-grade main characters George Beard and Harold Hutchins travel 20 years into the future and encounter their 30-year-old selves. Harold is gay. He is an artist and married to a guy named Billy. The couple somehow has kids.

“Scholastic notified us and the school that there was a book that may be a little controversial,” Monroe Public Schools superintendent Barry Martin told WXYZ.

Martin said the decision not to sell the Captain Underpants book that reveals a gay character was made by the school’s parent-teacher organization and Arborwood’s principal.

“The school decided we’ll make it available online,” the superintendent told WXYZ. “But, we won’t make it available in the actual book fair itself.”

Other books in the Captain Underpants series will be on offer at the Arborwood Elementary book fair.

“I support the decision of the parent group and the principal for handling it this way,” Martin told the Detroit ABC station.

On Amazon, “Captain Underpants and the Sensational Sag of Sir Stinks-A-Lot” receives 3.9 stars out of 5 possible stars.

Positive reviewers gush about it.

“From the very first Captain Underpants book, I have seen so many children absolutely delighted,” one happy Amazon critic elates.

“My son and daughter didn’t even notice the two dads together with their kids,” swears another. “Pilkey makes no comment on the subject because it has nothing to do with the story.”

One-star reviewers disagreed.

“Harold has a husband and has kids. I am really disappointed now,” says one.

Unhappy purchasers note the large amount of political content in the children’s book including a chapter entitled “The GOP Guarantee.”

“My son was so confused by the references to the GOP, Fox News and other references meant to slam Republicans that he put the book down and went to play,” explains one dissatisfied customer.

Pilkey, the author, defends his Captain Underpants series.

“My primary goal with Captain Underpants is to make kids laugh and to give them a positive experience with reading at a crucial time in their development,” he wrote this summer in The Guardian.

The Monroe, Mich. school district was last the subject of national news when a middle school history teacher was suspended because he informed students that white entertainers used to paint their faces black to imitate black people and showed kids a video about it.

Musicians Fighting Back Against Big Radio for Performance Royalties,"(NewsUSA) – Americans can listen to the radio via AM/FM, Internet, satellite, or cable TV. The music is the same, but payments to the artists are not. Internet radio pays musicians a small amount, but AM/FM radio pays them nothing.

Most experts agree that this policy doesn’t fit the digital era, and many musicians say that it hurts performers and will continue to adversely affect the music industry.

“When many of us think of the song, ‘Respect,’ we think of Aretha Franklin,” notes David Byrne of the Talking Heads. “Many people are shocked to learn that Aretha never made a penny from all the radio broadcasts of her performance. Many musicians receive little compensation or struggle to pay bills despite having widely-aired recordings.”

Musician Sheryl Crow adds, “Dionne Warwick does not get paid for her beautiful recordings when they are played on the radio. She had to file for bankruptcy.”

Artists’ advocates, such as MusicFIRST, point out that AM/FM radio earns billions of dollars a year selling ads to listeners while musicians struggle to make ends meet.

A growing number of top stars including Rosanne Cash, Elvis Costello, Cyndi Lauper, Imogen Heap, Common, Elton John, and R.E.M., are taking the fight to Washington. Several of these artists helped launch the Fair Play, Fair Pay Act, bipartisan legislation that would pay musicians the same royalties no matter what kind of radio uses their work.

The National Association of Broadcasters claims that the Fair Play, Fair Pay Act is unnecessary, because artists are paid by the radio in “promotional value” or “exposure.” But many artists disagree. Grammy-winning artist Rosanne Cash says, “Exposure is something you die of,” and musicians deserve fair pay for their work.

Top U.S. Copyright official Maria Pallante also questions the decades-old justification for not compensating artists. “As consumer preferences shift away from music ownership, the potential for sales is becoming less relevant, and the promotional value of radio less apparent,” she says.

Many artists believe the Fair Play, Fair Pay Act can and should become law.

“I support the Fair Play, Fair Pay Act because I love music and I think all musicians should be paid,” says singer Cyndi Lauper.

“Every democratic country in the world pays musicians for radio play,” says Cake’s John McCrea. “We think the United States is a good enough country to do that as well.”

Trump: It’s ‘Fair Game’ To Discuss Bill Clinton’s ‘Abuse Of Women’ [VIDEO],"Donald Trump said Tuesday that it’s “fair game” to discuss Bill Clinton’s “abuse of women.”

Appearing on NBC’s “Today” with Savannah Guthrie, Trump insisted that the former president has “failed badly” as a surrogate for Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail.

Referring to a tweet Trump sent Monday night, Guthrie also asked the businessman if he thinks that Bill is “racist.” Trump replied, “No, he was called that by the Obama campaign. He was called it loud and clear. He was extremely insulted.”

Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008. He was terrible, failed badly, and was called a racist! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 29, 2015

Pushing for a clearer explanation, Guthrie continued to prod Trump as to why he Tweeted that Bill is “racist” and Trump said, “They said it. I didn’t say it. I didn’t call him a racist… That’s what they said, they called him a racist. I don’t believe he is a racist, if you want to know the truth, but they called him a racist.”

“It was a miserable campaign,” in 2008 for Hillary, Trump said, and Bill did “very poorly, and they are bringing him out again.”

“He’s being wheeled out, and we’re going to see what happens, but frankly he did very, very poorly. He was not good for her, and obviously she lost to Obama, and that was the end of that, but they brought him out before.”

Trump was then later asked about the specifics behind his tweet where he insisted that Bill has a “terrible record of women abuse.” Trump said, “Well, if you look at the different situations, of course, we can name many of them, I can get you a list and I’ll have it sent to your office in two seconds.”

If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2015

“But there were certainly a lot of abuse of women,” Trump insisted. “And you look at whether it’s Monica Lewinsky or Paula Jones or many of them, and that certainly will be fair game, certainly if they play the woman’s card with respect to me, that will be fair game.”

Trump argued, “I’ll do more for women than Hillary Clinton is going to do for women, including the safety of our country which is good for everybody, but if she’s going to play, which she started about a week ago, talking about, ‘Oh, he mentioned’ and, you know, the whole thing, playing up the woman’s card very, very strongly, and if she’s going to play that game and if he’s going to be out there campaigning, then he’s certainly fair game, and I think just about everybody agrees with me on that.”

“This is a person who, you know, he’s going to be out, and I like the fact that he’s campaigning for her. He failed in 2008. He failed really badly,” Trump said. “He frankly did a very poor job in campaigning, if you want to know the truth, and perhaps he’ll do well or perhaps he’ll do poorly, but if she’s going to play the woman card, it’s all fair game.”

Sanders: Not Fair For Trump To Go After ‘Bill Clinton’s Sex Life’ [VIDEO],"During a Sunday interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders said that it isn’t fair for Republican front-runner Donald Trump to attack “Bill Clinton’s sex life.”

“I think Donald Trump might want to worry about the fact that he is dead wrong,” when it comes to raising the minimum wage Sanders told Bash.

“He’s dead wrong when he thinks that we should give huge tax breaks to billionaires,” Sanders added “and he’s dead wrong when he thinks climate change is a hoax.”

“Maybe Trump should worry about those issues instead of Bill Clinton’s sex life.”

“Only Bernie Sanders can segue from Bill Clinton’s sex life to climate change. That was impressive,” Bash continued. “But what is the answer to the question? Is it fair game or not?”

“No. I think we have more important things to talk about in this country than Bill Clinton’s sex life,” Sanders concluded.

Bill Clinton Gives Nonsensical Answer When ABC Asks If His Sex Life Is ‘Fair Game’ [VIDEO],"Following Bill Clinton’s Monday campaign speech in New Hampshire, ABC’s Cecilia Vega asked him if Donald Trump’s attacks on his sex life were “fair game.”

“Donald Trump says your past is fair game. I’ve got to ask you, since you’re going to keep going out on the campaign trail,” Vega asked the former president, “is it fair game?” (VIDEO: MSNBC Blows Chance To Ask Bill The Question On Everyone’s Mind)

“The Republicans have to decide that,” Clinton responded. “I’m trying to tell the Democrats and the rest of the country that Hillary will be the best president.”

“I think there’s always an attempt to take the election away from you people, so I’m just going to give it to you.”

Prof: Economic Conditions Predict Republican Victory In Presidential Race,"Yale University economist Ray Fair has been using economic conditions to predict election outcomes for almost forty years. Since January 2015, Fair’s model has been predicting a Republican victory in the upcoming presidential election.

The Yale professor’s formula of economic forecasting has resulted an average prediction error between 2.5 and 3.5 percentage points in the 25 presidential elections since 1916. In 2012, he predicted Obama’s percentage of the popular vote within 2 points.

Factors for Fair’s presidential predictions include whether or not there is an incumbent running, how long a party has held control of the White House, a “slight but persistent” bias toward the Republican Party, and, chiefly, the state of the economy.

In his April update, Fair’s model continues to show that the 2016 race for the White House will result in a Republican victory. However, he acknowledges that this year’s prediction could “be trumped by other factors”. Fair exclusively told The Daily Caller, “it may be that this time personalities dominate economic factors in determining how people vote for president.”

Donald Trump has clinched the number of delegates necessary to secure the Republican Party’s nomination, but many have concerns about his temperament and ability to assume the position as the leader of the free world.

In regards to predicting how big of an impact this will have on the outcome of the election, Fair told TheDC that “there is no way to test for this; we will just have to wait and see.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2016/06/09/prof-economic-conditions-predict-republican-victory-in-presidential-race/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiz4fXw_7P9AhWMSTABHdHYArc4ZBAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw3NcLXkAYFXpQT1OGHRfiFE,2016-06-09
Vanity Fair: Huma Is A ‘Feminist Hero’ Because She Stayed With Weiner To Get Hillary Elected,"Huma Abedin is now being praised as a “feminist hero” after leaving her serially sexting husband.

After Anthony Weiner’s third sexting scandal broke this week, Hillary Clinton’s top aide announced the two were separating after six years of marriage. Now Vanity Fair is calling Abedin a “feminist hero” because — they believe — she only stayed with him so she could get Hillary Clinton elected president. (RELATED: Huma Abedin And Anthony Weiner Are Separating)

“Anyone questioning Abedin’s ability to stay with Weiner after he shamed her and degraded their marriage, calling her decision anti-feminist, seems to be missing the point,” Vanity Fair wrote in a piece published Wednesday. “Abedin wanted to work, hard, and Weiner, for all his flaws, appeared to have become a dutiful stay-at-home dad and caretaker in the years since he exited public life.”

“Abedin put her own desire to work to elect a female president before her own pride, before spending more time with her son, before disarming the firing squad of critics shooting at her for her personal decisions for the last five years.” (RELATED: Anthony Weiner Complained That He And Huma Abedin Rarely Had Sex)

“Once her husband’s selfies made it clear that she was no longer making the right choice for her son, her calculation got more complicated. Forget the humiliation factor. It was no longer easier for her or better for her child to keep this arrangement.”

“What she was willing to put up with in order to do her job well is perhaps the most feminist move we’ve witnessed in the entire election season.”

“And in a campaign supposedly all about breaking glass ceilings on one side and speaking the politically incorrect truth on the other, Abedin is leaving the most cracks, and is making the most real choices of anyone.” (RELATED: Huma Glowingly Praised Anthony Weiner’s Parenting Just Days Ago)

“Unsurprisingly, conservative media pounced on this as an opportunity to take a whack at Abedin’s judgment as a mother,” Vanity Fair continued.

“Rush Limbaugh asked his audience: Did she ‘really not know she had a deviant taking care of her child’? Even ‘The Washington Post’ made this about her parental decisions. ‘For the third time, his questionable decisions are ensnaring his wife, one of Hillary Clinton’s top aides, by raising questions about her decision to leave their son in a potentially dangerous situation.'”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2016/08/31/vanity-fair-huma-is-a-feminist-hero-because-she-stayed-with-weiner-to-get-hillary-elected/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjhtsrt_7P9AhXoGFkFHRZBALo4MhAWegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw21w_UhK07Ypo8bxrvigDfU,2016-08-31
Hillary’s Health Was Fair Game For The Washington Post Before She Ran Against Trump,"The Washington Post’s writers have consistently dismissed inquiries into Clinton’s health as illegitimate, the latest Post writer to do so being Chris Cillizza, who heads up the Post’s weblog “The Fix.”

“The simple fact is that there is zero evidence that anything is seriously wrong with Clinton. If suffering an occasional coughing fit is evidence of a major health problem, then 75 percent of the country must have that mystery illness. And I am one of them,” Cillizza wrote in a piece this week titled “Can we just stop talking about Clinton’s health now?”

And yet, up until just a few months before Clinton announced her candidacy, several of the Post’s writers — including Cillizza — argued that Clinton’s health was a legitimate subject of media inquiry and would continue to be so in the 2016 election.

December 2014: Hillary’s health and lack of stamina might keep her from running.

In December 2014 — just four months before Clinton officially announced her presidential campaign — the The Fix’s Aaron Blake wrote an article titled, “There’s a real chance Hillary Clinton won’t run for president. Here are five reasons why.”

One of the five reasons was Clinton’s “Age/health/stamina.”

“The age thing is always a difficult one to discuss, but if Clinton wins in 2016, she would become, at 69, the second-oldest president ever to assume office. Ronald Reagan was 69 in 1981, but was closing in on his 70th birthday,” Blake wrote.

“She and Bill Clinton say she is healthy, and save for an incident in 2012 in which she fell and suffered a concussion and subsequent blood clot, there’s little reason to believe otherwise. But even Bill Clinton has acknowledged the hurdle that is health, which he calls a ‘serious issue.'”

May 2014: Hillary health a factor in whether or not she’ll run

In May 2014, Cillizza wrote an article titled, “Hillary Clinton is the only person who can stop Hillary Clinton.”

“For all the sturm und drang caused by Karl Rove’s insinuations about Clinton’s health scare in late 2012, a blood clot in the brain is a serious thing, and even her allies acknowledge that it was not insignificant,” Cillizza noted.

“Bill Clinton insisted this week that his wife is in ‘better shape’ than he is, and her aides say she has an absolutely clean bill of health. But Clinton would be 69 years old on Election Day 2016. Couple her age with that scare in late 2012 and it’s hard to imagine Clinton not taking a full accounting of her health before officially deciding to run.”

January 2013: Hillary’s health will be a campaign issue in 2016

Before President Obama even had his second inauguration, Cillizza opined that Clinton’s health would be a legitimate campaign issue.

Cillizza wrote, “The simple fact is that running and serving as president is an incredibly stressful and demanding job. (There’s a reason that every president looks as though they’ve aged twice as fast as the average person when they leave the White House.)”

Cillizza reiterated his belief that Clinton faces increased scrutiny before concluding: “But, rest assured that if Clinton does eventually decide to run, her hospitalization for this clot near her brain will be a major topic of discussion. And she — and her political team — will have to find a way to come up with satisfactory answers.”

The piece was titled, “What Hillary Clinton’s health means for 2016.”

January 2013: It’s fair to question whether Hillary is telling the truth about her health.

The day before Cillizza’s article ran, Melinda Henneberger wrote an article for the Post titled “Questioning Hillary Clinton’s concussion.” In it, Henneberger argued that the seriousness of the issue, as well as Clinton’s penchant for hiding the truth, justified skepticism about her health.

“Would we really be shocked to learn down the road that reports during her hospitalization had put a positive spin on her condition?” Henneberger asked.

“Our public officials have trained us to take everything they say with a healthy dose of skepticism, and on a matter as sensitive as a head injury followed by denials of any neurological symptoms, I’m not sure why we would or should unquestioningly accept the word of any politician,” she continued. “After all she’s been accused of — and will be again if she runs next time — this is nothing.”

O’Reilly Asks Trump If Hillary’s Marriage Is Fair Game In The Debates. Here’s His Response.,"Donald Trump discussed the upcoming presidential debates in an interview that aired on Monday’s broadcast of “The O’Reilly Factor.”

Host Bill O’Reilly directly asked the Republican nominee if he plans on attacking Clinton’s marriage if she chooses to criticize Trump’s own past relationships.

“I don’t think I’m looking to do that, Bill,” Trump flatly answered. “I don’t know what I’m going to do that exactly. It depends on what level she hits you with, if she’s fair, if it’s unfair, but certainly I’m not looking to do that.”

Trump then told O’Reilly that “the New York Times wrote a story about [him] and women and it turned out that it was a false story.”

“The New York Times wrote a story about women and the women called the office and said, ‘We never said that about Donald Trump. We really like him. He’s really good,'” he continued. “They quoted women and they never even said it. It was on the front page, centerfold, massive big color picture. It was disgraceful. They are so dishonest – I’ll tell you what. There is nobody that respects women more than Donald Trump.”

O’Reilly continued to press Trump on whether or not he will launch personal attacks against Clinton, the mogul admitted that, at this point in time, he has “absolutely no idea.”

“I think this. If she treats me with respect, I will treat her with respect. It really depends.”

“People ask me that question, ‘oh you’re going to go out there and do this and that.’ I really don’t know that. You’re going to have to feel it out when you’re out there. She’s got to treat me with respect. I’m going to treat her with respect. I’d like to start off by saying that because that would be my intention.”

Trump Attacks ‘Dead’ Vanity Fair: It’s In ‘Big Trouble’,"President-elect Donald Trump’s latest Twitter target is lifestyle publication Vanity Fair.

A series of tweets Thursday morning had Trump declaring the death of the publication while lauding Time Magazine and the Financial Times for naming him “Person of the Year.”

Trump attacked Vanity Fair’s “really poor numbers,” and said Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter had “no talent.”

These tweets could potentially be in retaliation to Vanity Fair’s piece on the future president’s restaurant, Trump Grill.

The piece on the Manhattan Trump Tower-based steakhouse called it “the worst restaurant in America.”

“The allure of Trump’s restaurant, like the candidate, is that it seems like a cheap version of rich,” wrote Vanity Fair journalist Tina Nguyen. “Renowned butcher Pat LaFrieda once dared me to eat an eyeball that he himself popped out of the skull of a roasted pig. That eyeball tasted better than the Trump Grill’s (Grille’s) Gold Label Burger, a Pat LaFrieda–branded short-rib burger blend molded into a sad little meat thing, sitting in the center of a massive, rapidly staling brioche bun, hiding its shame under a slice of melted orange cheese.”

“If the cheeseburger is a quintessential part of America’s identity, Trump’s pledge to “make America great again” suddenly appeared not very promising,” Nguyen wrote. “(Presumably, Trump’s Great America tastes like an M.S.G.-flavored kitchen sponge lodged between two other sponges.)”

As reported by Politico, the editor of Vanity Fair is the originating source of the joke about Trump’s apparently tiny hands.

Vanity Fair now joins the ranks of The New York Times, The Washington Post and other major news outlets Trump has targeted.

"To Be Fair, Hilldog Got More Votes Than Any Other Total Loser In US History","Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election to Republican President-elect Donald Trump in November, but she did garner nearly 3 million more votes than Trump, according to the final election results.

Clinton finished with 48.2 percent of the vote, and Trump earned 46.1 percent of the total. As stunning as Clinton’s loss was, she still doesn’t have the most embarrassing loss in American political history.

That honor goes to former President Andrew Jackson, who won the popular vote by 10 percent, and lost the Electoral College in 1824. Clinton’s loss also comes behind former President Rutherford B. Hayes’ election in 1876, who won the Electoral College by one vote and lost the popular vote by 3 percent to Samuel Tilden.

A general election poll taken the day before the election by ABC News gave Clinton 49 percent compared to Trump’s 46 percent of the vote, nearly even with the final results of the election.

‘F**K YOU. GO TO HELL’: Georgetown Prof Loses It On Muslim Trump Voter,"A Georgetown University associate professor had a month-long meltdown after a Muslim woman explained why she voted for President-elect Donald Trump.

Asra Q. Nomani, a former Georgetown journalism professor and Wall Street Journal reporter, wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post Nov. 10 explaining why she, as a Muslim woman and “long-time liberal,” voted for Trump. “I support the Democratic Party’s position on abortion, same-sex marriage and climate change,” Nomani wrote. “But I am a single mother who can’t afford health insurance under Obamacare.”

C. Christine Fair, a previously “friendly colleague,” went on a 31-day screed against Nomani spanning across Twitter and Facebook. According to Nomani’s Dec. 23 follow-up complaint to the university, the “Peace and Security Studies” professor called her a “wretch,” “clueless dolt” and a fame-monger.

Fair also compared Trump to Adolf Hitler and asserted that Nomani’s vote for Trump “helped normalize Nazis in DC.” She didn’t clarify if she was referring to Trump supporters or actual Nazis marching the streets.

Nomani replied that she “condemns all hate” and called Fair’s attacks against her “unfortunate.” After another series of exchanges, Nomani told Fair to “take a deep breath & step away from the keyboard.”

Fair proceeded to call her a “fame-mongering clown show” and a “fraud.”

She again attacked Nomani Dec. 6 with “an open letter” on Facebook, in which Fair told her to “fuck off” and “GO TO HELL.”

It’s unclear why Fair announces that she’s “a slut.”

Nomani told The Daily Caller News Foundation that Georgetown professor Bruce Hoffman replied to her original Dec. 2 complaint on Dec. 3. He told her he forwarded her complaint to professor Irfan Nooruddin. Nooruddin is the faculty chair of Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service.

Nooruddin told Nomani in a Dec. 4 email that, “I shall follow up directly with Professor Fair.” Fair posted her Facebook rant about Nomani two days after Nooruddin said he would speak with her. Additionally, she threatened Nomani in an email Dec. 6 with “legal action.” “Your attempt to silence my opinion or force a dialogue by involving my employer is unacceptable and any further action on your part to involve Georgetown will be met with legal action,” Fair wrote. “Your social media and email appeal to my employer with the intent or threat of damaging my employment status is a form of cyber bullying, which will not be tolerated.”

Nooruddin emailed Nomani a day later on Dec. 7: “Let me answer your question directly by referring you to the “Faculty Responsibilities Code” of the Georgetown Faculty Handbook: https:// facultyhandbook.georgetown. edu/toc/section3#7. This section under point 5 lays out the formal steps. The first of these involves a complaint to the unit head (in this case, me). If I fail to resolve the situation satisfactorily, then I must take it to the Dean within 5 days. And it goes from there.”

He did not elaborate on what resolving “the situation satisfactorily” entailed, but said, “So, if you wish me to try again, i [sic] shall. If that doesn’t yield the desired outcome, I can then take it to the Dean if that’s what you want.”

Nomani emailed Nooruddin five days later on Dec. 12 to say that she wanted to proceed with a formal complaint. He replied that he would proceed once she sent a formal complaint. Nomani sent the formal complaint Dec. 23, the same day Fair called her an atheist on Twitter. Publicly stating a Muslim is an apostate by calling them an atheist on Twitter could have serious repercussions. Radical Islamic extremists often declare civilians apostates before attacking them, because in their interpretation of the Quran, renouncing Islam is punishable by death.

“This note acknowledges receipt of your complaint against Professor Fair,” Nooruddin replied. “I shall follow university policies as appropriate.”

“The attacks against me by a professor at Georgetown University are particularly disturbing because Georgetown gave me a home to complete the investigation of the murder of my friend and colleague Danny Pearl by militants in Pakistan,” Nomani told TheDCNF. “I would like to see Georgetown uphold its values for peace and civil discourse. And I would gently urge anyone who is as disturbed as I am about Prof. Fair’s conduct to remain civil and not engage in any personal attacks because we have to be the civility we want to see in the world.”

Neither Georgetown University nor Fair responded to repeated requests for comment.

Fair has worked at Georgetown since July 2009, according to her LinkedIn profile. A four-year undergraduate degree at Georgetown costs anywhere from $46,750 to $70,520 per year depending on the degree, according to its Office of Student Financial Services.

Fair’s personal website says “she can cause trouble in multiple languages,” and her YouTube features videos like “Introducing the Pussy Avenger” and “Tales of My Pussy.”

Other notable commentary on Fair’s public Facebook includes calling future first lady Melania Trump a “soft porn star,” lamenting that “gun nuts don’t shoot each other,” and supporting Black Lives Matter.

She occasionally breaks up the politically charged musings with posts about cute animals.

‘Psycho Shrew’: Georgetown Prof Doubles Down After Attacking Muslim Trump Voter [VIDEO],"Georgetown University associate professor C. Christine Fair is cranky that people don’t like her attacking a Muslim woman who voted for President-elect Donald Trump.

She continued her month-plus Twitter and Facebook ranting after The Daily Caller News Foundation’s piece revealing her attacks against Asra Q. Nomani. (RELATED: ‘F**K YOU. GO TO HELL’: Georgetown Prof Loses It On Muslim Trump Voter)

Fair attacked a Daily Mail reporter in a new Dec. 28 open letter on Facebook for reaching out for comment. She called The Daily Caller a “dubious news outlet,” questioned the Daily Mail reporter’s journalistic integrity, and said Nomani should have “expected responses” similar to her own.

Fair tweeted that she was proud of TheDCNF’s article, but later deleted the tweet.

She also appears to have removed her Facebook open letter Dec. 6 to Nomani, in which she told Nomani, “FUCK YOU. GO TO HELL”:

Nomani, a former Georgetown journalism professor and Wall Street Journal reporter, wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post Nov. 10 explaining why she, as a Muslim woman and “long-time liberal,” voted for Trump. Fair called her a “wretch” and a “psycho shrew.”

Fair seems to mock Nomani in a series of tweets for not having a job. Nomani told TheDCNF she chose to be self-employed after the birth of her son. “When my son was born, I decided to go freelance so I wouldn’t have to outsource his care because I’ve been a single mother,” she said.

Nomani appeared on “The Kelly File” Wednesday, saying, “I’ve lost a friend, that’s how it goes.”

“Do you think she should be fired?” Sandra Smith, who was anchoring for Megyn Kelly, asked. Smith said Fair described the situation as “a mob of unending, crazed nuttery.”

“I would never go that far with anybody,” Nomani replied. “I ultimately have forgiveness in my heart and compassion.”

She continued, “This is not a difficult conversation to be had … I have never felt unwelcome in this country. After this election, my fellow liberals have turned me into an enemy, as if I have horns on my head. That’s not a comfortable feeling.”

WATCH:

Twitter users descended en masse to condemn Fair’s behavior toward Nomani.

Fair was originally going to appear with Nomani on “The Kelly File,” but backed out, citing alleged threats from Trump supporters.

Neither Georgetown University nor Fair responded to a request for comment.

"Heroin Overdose Insurance Claims Jump 1,078 Percent In Opioid-Plagued Ohio","Insurance claims for heroin overdoses and dependence are surging in Ohio, one of the states hit hardest by rising rates of opioid abuse and overdose deaths, according to a Wednesday report.

Private claims for diagnoses including opioid abuse, opioid dependence, heroin overdose and overdose of opioids excluding heroin rose by 770 percent across Ohio between 2007 and 2014. Increases were seen throughout the state, however, Ohio’s five major cities were responsible for the majority of claims made over that period. The analysis by FAIR Health, a national nonprofit advocating healthcare transparency, revealed the largest statewide increase was for heroin overdose claims, which surged by 1,078 percent between 2007 and 2014.

A number of factors could be driving the rate of claims higher in the state’s cities rather than in more rural areas, despite cities containing a smaller share of the overall population, according to FAIR Health.

Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton and Toledo combine to make up only 17 percent of the total population. The analysis excludes those making claims through Medicaid, which may be used more frequently in rural Ohio. The nonprofit also suggests it could simply be there is greater access to opioids, including heroin, in the cities.

“Our data confirm that the dramatic increase in opioid abuse and dependence occurring nationally is also widespread in Ohio,” Robin Gelburd, president of FAIR Health, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “We hope that by illuminating the severity of this trend, we call attention to the growing need for treatment and for prevention strategies.”

Ohio is being hit particularly hard by the national opioid epidemic, which claimed a record 33,000 lives in the U.S. in 2015. The opioid death rate in the state spiked 13 percent between 2014 and 2015, among the largest increases in the country. Heroin deaths increased by nearly 20 percent over the same period, claiming 1,444 lives. FAIR Health has the largest private health claims database in the U.S.

The epidemic is posing risks to kids who are exposed to the drugs and other dangers by their parents. Officials in Ohio say opioids are the main driver of a 19 percent spike in the number of kids removed from parental custody to foster care since 2010.

Experts stress the need for greater access to addiction treatment counseling and greater education of the population about the dangers posed by opiate-based medication. Officials with the DEA say four out of five heroin addicts started with painkillers.

Fatal overdoses from heroin quadrupled over the last five years nationally, according to data released by the National Center for Health Statistics Feb. 24. They say the massive increase in heroin and general opioid abuse in the U.S. since 2010 is driven by lower drug prices and ingredients with higher potency, like fentanyl.

Authors of the study noted in 2010 only 8 percent of all fatal drug overdoses stemmed from heroin. In 2015, roughly 25 percent of fatal drug overdoses were caused by heroin.

"Bob Woodward Chides NYT, Mainstream Media: ‘Fair Mindedness is Essential’","Famed investigative journalist Bob Woodward criticized the media’s open bias toward President Trump on Tuesday in remarks following a screening of “All The President’s Men” in Washington, D.C.

Woodward, the reporter who broke the Nixon Watergate scandal the media now loves to compare to the Trump administration, said it’s crucial the press retain the trust of the public, and execute a deep “fair-mindedness” when reporting.

He pointed to a list of Trump’s “lies” compiled by The New York Times in which some of the president’s are misjudged as an example of overt bias, after he was asked about the media’s treatment of Trump in a Q&A session at Landmark E Street Cinema.

“[Number three on the list] was that Trump said he was on the cover of Time magazine 14 or 15 times when it was in fact 11 times,” Woodward said. “… That’s not a lie.” He likened Trump’s statement instead to someone getting pulled over for speeding and telling the police officer that they were driving the speed limit.

“Tone matters, and headlines matter, and you want people to [trust you],” he said.

“[It] really betrays the anti-Trump media bias,” Woodward added, regarding the media’s coverage of the investigation into Russian meddling in the election. “I think a kind of brief, deeply fair-mindedness is essential, but as essential or maybe more essential is a game plan for reporting this and going to Moscow and finding the bookkeeper.”

The bookkeeper was a reference to a key source for Woodward and Carl Bernstein in their Watergate coverage.

Woodward has been a consistent voice for journalism in recent months, calling the Buzzfeed dossier “a garbage document” and saying that the Comey investigation was “not yet Watergate,” contradicting frequent mainstream claims.

His comments come in the wake of a heated debate about whether or not the American people should trust the mainstream media. A Gallup poll released Monday states that Americans’ trust in newspapers is rising at 27 percent, but is still very low compared to confidence in other institutions, such as the military at 72 percent and small business at 70 percent.

"Scalise Undergoes Another Surgery For Infection, Updated To Fair Condition","House Majority Whip Steve Scalise underwent another surgery Thursday to treat an infection related to the injuries sustained after being shot in the hip at the GOP’s congressional baseball practice in June.

The Louisiana Republican’s condition was upgraded from serious to fair after having been readmitted to the intensive care unit July 5 and receiving another surgery July 6.

“Congressman Steve Scalise remains hospitalized at MedStar Washington Hospital Center,” the hospital said in a statement on behalf of the Scalise family. “Today, he underwent surgery for the management of deep tissue infection related to his bullet wounds. He is in fair condition, and will require careful monitoring to see if and when further interventions are necessary.”

Scalise, 51, underwent multiple surgeries following the shooting, having received multiple blood transfusions after suffering blood loss. Doctors noted that, shortly after the attack, the bullet caused substantial damage to “bones, internal organs and blood vessels and nerves.”

The lawmaker was one of five wounded at the Republicans’ congressional baseball practice June 14, and is the last to remain in the hospital.

"Carson: No Plans To Rescind Fair Housing Regulation, Just ‘Reinterpret It’","Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson says he does not plan to rescind an Obama era regulation related to fair housing but wants to reinterpret it instead, reports The Washington Examiner.

The regulation that Republican lawmakers want Carson to rollback is the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) rule, which was finalized by Obama’s HUD Secretary Julian Castro in 2015.

The HUD rule requires 1,200 cities and counties, which get $3 billion of annual community development block grants from the agency, to rezone neighborhoods along income and racial specifications. Otherwise, the localities will lose these block grants.

The regulation upset conservatives when the initiative was funded again last year on funding legislation. Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee said in a floor speech, that AFFH required cities and towns nationwide to audit their local housing policies through federal HUD regulators, “who may have never have lived anywhere near there.”

“If any aspect of a community’s housing and demographic patterns fails to meet HUD bureaucrats’ expansive definition of ‘fair housing,’ the local government must submit a plan to reorganize the community’s housing practices according to the preferences and priorities of the bureaucrats,” said Lee who attempted to defund the AFFH rule through an amendment on the funding bill last year.

Carson, however, told The Washington Examiner: “Do I believe in fair housing? Of course, I believe in fair housing.” But he said he doesn’t believe in “extra manipulation and cost.”

“So, we just have to reinterpret it, that’s all,” he said.

Carson previously panned the rule in 2015 as a crude attempt to “legislate racial equality” in 2015 but added that he would not completely eradicate it.

“I probably am not going to mess with something the Supreme Court has weighed in on,” Carson said. “In terms of interpreting what it means — that’s where the concentration is going to be,” he said.

Deadly Malfunction Causes State Fair Ride To Literally Fall Apart,"An unidentified object caused the “Fire Ball” roller coaster to fall apart mid-ride, killing one and injuring seven Wednesday evening at the Ohio State Fair.

The roller coaster malfunctioned after crashing into an object that caused part of the roller coaster to detach. The deadly accident was recorded on a cellphone video by an eyewitness.

WATCH:

The Fire Ball is characterized as an aggressive thrill ride, according to Amusements of America’s website: “The Fire Ball swings riders 40′ above the midway while spinning them at 13 revolutions per minute!”

Ohio Gov. John Kasich responded to the accident, saying that he was terribly saddened regarding the “loss of life” at the state fair. He added that an investigation is currently ongoing in response to the incident.

All rides at the Ohio State Fair are currently closed so that the matter can be more closely examined.

County Fair Bans Confederate Flag Because ‘Someone Got Their Feelings Hurt’,"A county fair in Wisconsin recently made the decision to ban the Confederate Flag because it offended someone.

The board of the Vernon County Fair decided to ban Confederate Flag from being sold at the fair. Vice President John McClelland Jr. gave the Lacrosse Tribune the reason for its banning, “It’s a piece of our history, but someone got their feelings hurt. So we decided not to sell it.”

One resident, Mark Kastel, is against the Confederate battle flag being sold at the fair, telling the Vernon County Broadcaster, “I just don’t have a lot of sympathy for people who claim that (the Confederate battle flag) is some important part of their heritage.”

“I’m asking the board to be conciliatory to everybody in the community. Even if there is one person negatively affected by this, that’s too many,” he added.

The Lacrosse Tribune also reports that after Kastel objected to a vendor selling the flag last summer, the vendor “became intimidating” towards him.

Kastel reportedly said, “It angers me personally because I consider (the Confederate battle flag) a symbol of hate.”

The Confederate Battle Flag, long a controversial topic, continues to be a major issue in the culture wars, and can occasionally stir violence among its objectors. In one example from June, a woman ripped a Confederate Flag tag off of a man’s car and hit him with her car. (RELATED: Woman Rips Confederate Flag Off Man’s Truck, Hits Him With Car)

That incident may have been part of a larger trend of violence and vandalism directed at supporters of the flag. One trend is known as the “No Flaggin’ Challenge,” where people rip down and destroy people’s flags.

Having Sex In The State Fair Stands Isn’t A Great Look For Wisconsin,"A married couple was recently arrested at the Wisconsin State Fair for having sexual relations in the stands.

Desiree Anderson and Robert Beasley were taken into custody after their explicit sexual acts were caught on video and spread across the internet, reports to Fox News. Beasley was enjoying the attention so much he even waved to the camera at one point.

Local news Fox 6 was told by one fair-goer, “We’re here for a horse show or a dog show — not to make babies.”

WATCH:

As a Wisconsin-native, I have to admit this is not the best look for my state.

The Badger state is all about cold beer, cheese, brats, the Packers (who I hate), the Badgers (who I would die for), venison, guns, the outdoors, freezing cold winters, mild summers, babes in bikinis, babes in hunting gear, babes in winter gear and just generally being better at everything and everybody we ever come into contact with.

It’s almost like God specifically decided Wisconsin would serve as the shining example of what everybody in America should strive to be.

What we’re not about is having sex in the stands of the state fair. That’s not even white trash, that’s just straight up pathetic human trash. How low do you have to sink before you’re whipping off your clothes to engage in sexual activity in one of the most public settings in the entire state? The only more public place might be a Packers or Badgers game.

These people don’t represent myself or my kind. Being a Wisconsin man is about raging Friday night and cracking cold ones before the game Saturday without missing a beat or slowing down. We’re not about this trash. These people should have the book thrown at them. They’re lucky I’m not the judge because anybody who disgraces my state, to quote Donald Trump, “Will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” People that sink to this level disgust me. They should be done away with immediately.

As for everybody else in Wisconsin, keep up the great work. Winning at everything isn’t easy, but somebody has to do it.

Guess Who Didn’t Make It Onto Vanity Fair’s Best Dressed List,"Vanity Fair’s 2017 International Best-Dressed List honors celebrities and politicians who stand out as fashion icons of the year, but one usually well-dressed figure is notably absent.

Melania Trump, a former model and current first lady of the U.S., did not make the cut, but former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama made the list for the third time.

“Heads of state are particularly well represented this year,” a press release for the list said, “with former president and First Lady Barack and Michelle Obama (Couples) honored for the third time.”

Other political leaders include Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was honored for the second consecutive year, and French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte.

Vanity Fair Magazine has criticized Melania Trump this summer as the first lady has stepped into a more public role at the White House. The magazine dinged the first lady for wearing high heels on the plane to visit Texas in the wake of Hurricane Harvey August 29.

Her aviator sunglasses and army green jacket say, “Business,” and, “Let’s get down to business,” and, “Hello, my name is Tom Cruise and I’m here to give you the business.” The heels scream, “Who’s in for brunch?”

The same day, another piece in the magazine suggested that Melania Trump “appears to be taking a page out of the Michelle Obama book of fashion” by wearing J. Crew instead of designer brands.

Vanity Fair did not immediately respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Vanity Fair Keeps Melania Trump Off Best Dressed List In Extremely Bizarre Move,"Vanity Fair celebrated the world’s royalty and celebrities in its annual Best Dressed List, published Wednesday.

Inductees included Prince Phillip, Queen Letizia of Spain, Justin Trudeau, Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron, and of course, Barack and Michelle Obama.

This year’s list seems to overrepresent politicians and royalty. Sure some celebrities are to be expected – like Rihanna who’s been the face of Dior – but did Prince Phillip really deserve to be in this year’s running? He’s 96 and rarely in the public eye.

And where is Melania Trump? You know, the First Lady and also the Slovenian immigrant who was a fashion model until 2016?

Who also dresses in a very similar style to previous First Ladies?

Thank you for the birthday wishes and for the greatest gift of all: the opportunity to serve as your First Lady. –mo A post shared by Michelle Obama (archived) (@michelleobama44) on Jan 17, 2017 at 6:24pm PST

Neither of these women has a patent on black heels and stripes, but I might go so far as to say that Melania looks better than Michelle.

I guess it shouldn’t come as a surprise that even fashion is political in 2017. We learned this last week when Melania was raked through the coals for boarding Air Force One in heels.

And Grayson Carter, an Editor at Vanity Fair, has had a longstanding feud the President, repeatedly calling public attention to his “short fingers.”

I didn’t know fashion editors were also experts in anatomical proportions.

Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine. Way down, big trouble, dead! Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2016

I can’t help but think that Melania forfeited a spot on the best dressed list not because she’s poorly dressed but because she is married to The Donald.

And maybe the magazine should consider deleting last week’s article, which points out Melania’s strikingly similar dress to its very own Michelle Obama:

Michelle Obama was often lauded for wearing J.Crew during her time in the White House, coming across as a more relatable and accessible First Lady than many in the past. It seems entirely possible that Trump is ripping out a page from the Obama handbook in order to drum up some much-needed goodwill from the public

You’re right, Vanity Fair. Michelle is so relatable. Remember when she wore nearly $600 shoes to a food bank? Or when her husband extended their vacation in Martha’s Vineyard during Louisiana’s historic 2016 flood? Good times.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2017/09/06/vanity-fair-keeps-melania-trump-off-best-dressed-list-in-extremely-bizarre-move/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiEwfns_7P9AhUEEFkFHTcnB2E4KBAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw2vlFfcx1QFBcuOz1hcpI9L,2017-09-06
Gun Test: F.A.I.R. Racing Prestige Sporting,"In late March 2017, Shotgun Life visited Fabbrica Armi Isidoro Rizzini, or F.A.I.R. as we have come to know it, in Brescia Italy. Owner Luca Rizzini impressed us as a straightforward, unpretentious guy committed to manufacturing affordable wing and clays guns that would last for generations.

Now back in our hometown of Thomasville, Georgia, we went to a sporting clays course to shoot a F.A.I.R. Racing Prestige Sporting over/under and discovered that in fact Mr. Rizzini has made good on his corporate mission with this 12-gauge clays gun.

The F.A.I.R. Racing Prestige in 12 gauge.

The F.A.I.R. Racing Prestige Sporting shares its tough, steel mechanicals with the Trap and Skeet models. The gun opens and locks with sturdy trunnions and underlug. The ejectors proved strong. An interchangeable fiber-optic site sat at the muzzle end of the narrow, vented rib. F.A.I.R. uses technologically enhanced, oil-finished walnut and checkering for an upgraded appearance on a budget, and complemented by the black sideplates emblazed with a gold clay target, the Racing Prestige Sporting aspires for a Perazzi presence. A comfortable pistol grip and slender field-style forend contribute to easy control. Rounding out the standard equipment is a set of five steel-compatible TECHNICHOKE extended tubes in popular constrictions.

The F.A.I.R. TECHNICHOKE chokes added accuracy and some glitz to the Racing Prestige.

If you want an adjustable comb and semi-Monte Carlo stock then upgrade to the Racing II Sporting or look at some of the F.A.I.R. Carrera line of competition over/unders.

So where does that place the $2,550 F.A.I.R. Racing Prestige Sporting on your decision tree? Those black sideplates with gold clay targets elevate the shotgun beyond run-of-the-mill, pseudo-classical laser engraving with a taut, athletic character. F.A.I.R.’s oil-finished walnut has a nice high-grade appearance. The perch-belly forend, gold-plated trigger, polished extended chokes and fiber-optic front bead combine utility with pizazz. Ultimately, the well-finished Racing Prestige Sporting stands out on the gun rack against comparably priced Berettas, Brownings and Fabarm derivatives.

The walnut on the F.A.I.R. Racing Prestige.

The F.A.I.R. Racing Prestige Sporting was put through its paces at leafy Ravenwood Sporting Clays in Headland, Alabama. Three trap machines per station delivered challenging presentations across the wooded, rolling terrain, in addition to the multi-level, covered five-stand that included wobble trap.

Matte black sideplates with gold clay targets gave the F.A.I.R. Racing Prestige a contemporary look.

We encountered the new-gun stiffness when loading shells, but was impressed at the lack of felt recoil from the 1⅛ ounce loads of 1200 feet-per-second. At a hair over seven pounds, the shotgun was balanced between the hands, enabling smooth and consistent swings punctuated by an easy, predictable trigger.

F.A.I.R.’s Racing Prestige Sporting is a moderately priced shotgun with no unpleasant surprises. It shoots where you look, shoulders nicely and bestows a predictable and consistent experience. In fact, it’s a very friendly shotgun that will break enough clays to make you feel good at the end of the day.

Vanity Affair Apologizes For Suggesting Hillary Clinton Take Up Knitting,"Liberal elite magazine Vanity Fair says it is very sorry it offended its subscriber base by suggesting Hillary Clinton move on with life and take up new hobbies like knitting.

The suggestion, part of an online video poking fun at the failed presidential candidate, was greeted with outrage, disdain and near-hysteria from Vanity Fair’s readership who immediately complained of sexism.

“It was an attempt at humor and we regret that it missed the mark,” Beth Kseniak, a spokeswoman for Vanity Fair said Wednesday. The video can still be found on Twitter.

Clinton supporters were so angry over incident that they created a #CancelVanityFair hashtag on social media.

The video, featured on Vanity Fair’s Hive website, featured some of the magazine’s editorial team raising glasses of champagne and suggesting it is time for the former first lady to stop running for office and start looking for new ways to occupy her time: like knitting or volunteering.

One wag even offered the possibility of writing another book: “It’s time to start working on a sequel to your book, ‘What Happened,'” he says, offering the title of “What the Hell Happened” as an attention-grabber.

Liberals were shocked and appalled, including actress and Clinton-devotee Patricia Arquette who tweeted: “Hey STOP TELLING WOMEN WHAT THE F-CK THEY SHOULD DO OR CAN DO. Get over your mommy issues.”

Another Clinton supporter was aghast, tweeting:

“Does Vanity Fair NOT realize how many readers of their magazine they have just alienated? They mock the first woman to ever win the popular vote in a general election? A woman who got the second most votes EVER! #CancelVanityFair.”

"Chelsea Clinton Says Ivanka Trump Is Fair Game For Criticism, Unlike Other Presidential Children","Chelsea Clinton has repeatedly defended the children of the president, having been the daughter of a president herself, but she’s making an exception for her former friend Ivanka Trump.

In an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Monday night Clinton revealed that she and Ivanka have drifted apart since the 2016 presidential election and declared that Ivanka is fair game for any criticism that comes her way.

Unlike any of the children of the president before her, Ivanka actually holds a position in the White House as an adviser to her father, Donald Trump. However, given Chelsea’s history of sticking up for children of the president, Colbert pressed her on whether or not Ivanka is an exception.

“Do you have any sympathy for her? Because she’s an adult who has taken on an official role in the White House,” Colbert explained. “Do you think she’s fair game for criticism or she’s just another presidential child?”

“I think anyone who works for the president is certainly — should expect to be scrutinized for whatever decisions not only he or she is making but whatever decisions the White House is making on any given day,” She responded.

Chelsea and Ivanka were good friends heading into the presidential election in 2016, but now it sounds as if they’ve grown apart. Perhaps it’s as simple as the fact that Donald Trump ruined Hillary Clinton’s dream of becoming president, but Chelsea blames it on disagreements on policy.

“I have not spoken to her in a long time, it’s clear though that she has supported policies and decisions that I don’t agree with. I’ve been very vocal about my opposition to President Trump.”

Colbert pried, asking whether or not she could call and urge against a war with North Korea.

“I’m just really sad that we’re at a point in time where that has to be said,” Clinton continued. “I mean that we’re at a point in time where we have a president who has such callous disregard for thoughtful, coherent, expert advised foreign policy I would hope regardless of where we sit on the political spectrum, we could agree on.”

FAIR IS FAIR: Trump’s 2020 Presidential Opponent May Want To Prepare For No-Knock Raids And FBI Spying,"We are fast approaching the halfway point between the last presidential election and the next presidential election, which makes right now a good time to think about how the events of 2016 will set precedent for 2020.

On May 16, 2018, The New York Times revealed that, in August of 2016, the FBI opened an investigation into the Trump campaign code named “Crossfire Hurricane.” The investigation appears to have employed a handful of FBI agents and some of the powerful tools of counterintelligence.

Accusing a political figure of a crime is, unfortunately, nothing new. The pretext is easy to manufacture. In the case of the Russia collusion story, Clinton appears to have hired Fusion GPS to concoct the pretext.

What is new is the FBI’s apparent cooperation with such partisan accusations — including the use of at least one informant and a wiretap warrant against the opposition’s campaign staff.

Looking ahead to 2020, appointees of President Donald Trump now head all of the intelligence agencies, the Department of Justice and the FBI. If it hasn’t happened already, soon the Trump 2020 campaign will very likely begin gearing up for a serious run for reelection.

Apologists for the Trump campaign surveillance need to ask themselves a simple question: How will they react if Trump turns to the FBI to push a Trumpian version of “Crossfire Hurricane”?

For Candidate Hillary Clinton, the pretext for investigation was Russia collusion. For Trump’s 2020 political opponent, who knows? To illustrate how easily a pretext for a criminal investigation can be conceived, let’s review history. An argument can be made that nearly all candidates for higher elected office end up fending off a criminal accusation at some point.

This is by no means an exhaustive list:

1. From 2015-2016, Hillary Clinton was investigated for mishandling classified information and inappropriately steering favors from the Department of State to wealthy Clinton Foundation donors.

2. In 2016-18, former Candidate Bernie Sanders and his wife were investigated for loan fraud.

3. In 2015, Marco Rubio, a candidate in the 2016 presidential election, was investigated for improper expenditures while in the Florida State House.

4. In 2016, two “watchdog” public interest groups called for candidate Jeb Bush to be investigated for breaking campaign finance laws.

5. In 2016, The New York Times urged an investigation of candidate Ted Cruz for failing to report a loan from Goldman Sachs.

6. Chris Christie’s 2016 presidential ambitions and later consideration for a vice president were perhaps dashed by an investigation into whether he or his staffers purposely closed a traffic lane to retaliate against a political opponent.

7. Martin O’Malley, briefly a candidate for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, was investigatedfor buying discounted furniture for the governor’s mansion.

8. Days before the 2012 election, Republican candidate Mitt Romney was accusedof running a company that stole millions of dollars from Medicare.

9. Republican candidate New Gingrich’s 2012 presidential campaign was partially hampered by an ethics investigation.

10. In 2012, candidate Mitt Romney called for a special counsel to investigate whether the Obama administration leaked classified information to help Obama’s 2012 presidential reelection bid.

11. In 2012, candidate Rick Santorum was investigated for belonging to the Board of Directors of a company that was accused of Medicaid fraud.

12. In 2008, we were reminded that John McCain played a prominent role in the 1989-1991 criminal savings-and-loan scandal.

13. In 2008, candidate for vice president Sarah Palin was investigated for attempting to fire a brother-in-law state trooper.

14. Also in 2008, Barrack Obama was outed for having a close friendship with Tony Rezko, a felon convicted on bribery charges who subsidized the purchase of Obama’s home.

15. In 2008, Senator Ted Stevens lost his Senate election after being wrongfully convicted of federal ethics charges. Two of the prosecutors received suspensions for their own ethics violations in the case but these suspensions were later overturned for procedural reasons.

16. From 2005-2014, Tom DeLay, former House Majority Leader, was wrongfully prosecuted and ultimately exonerated for “money laundering” and other violations. The prosecutions nevertheless forced him from office.

Even without knowing the identity of the Democrat whom President Trump will face in 2020, it’s a fairly safe bet that there will be some kind of criminal investigation against this opponent at some point.

So, President Trump might ask, why not use a pen register to track calls of campaign attorneys? Or a no-knock warrant of a private attorney’s legal office and home to investigate a potential campaign finance violation? Or get a warrant to wiretap at least one campaign aid? Or use an FBI “informant” to advise or join the opposition’s campaign’s staff? And then, why not leak, leak, leak, leak, and leak to tilt the election and/or destabilize the opponent if he wins?

There’s an often forgotten statute, 5 U.S.C. § 7323(a)(1) which prohibits an employee from using “his official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election.” The statute covers all government officials, including members of the intelligence community and the Department of Justice.

There’s no Trump exception to this law.

Again, I turn to the apologists for the surveillance of the Trump campaign: You must condemn the politically-motivated use of law enforcement tools against Trump in 2016 or lose all moral authority to oppose President Trump if he employs the same tactics in the 2020 presidential election.

President Trump: ‘Fair Trade Is Now To Be Called Fool Trade’,"The ongoing feud between President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau continued Sunday evening when Trump defined nonreciprocal trade as “fool trade” in a tweet.

Fair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade if it is not Reciprocal. According to a Canada release, they make almost 100 Billion Dollars in Trade with U.S. (guess they were bragging and got caught!). Minimum is 17B. Tax Dairy from us at 270%. Then Justin acts hurt when called out! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 11, 2018

“Fair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade if it is not Reciprocal,” Trump tweeted. “According to a Canada release, they make almost 100 Billion Dollars in Trade with U.S. (guess they were bragging and got caught!). Minimum is 17B. Tax Dairy from us at 270%. Then Justin acts hurt when called out!”

In three more tweets several minutes later, Trump stated that an $800 billion trade deficit is not “fair to the PEOPLE of America,” adding that the EU should use that trade surplus to “pay much more” for U.S. military protection. “Change is coming!” he tweeted.

Why should I, as President of the United States, allow countries to continue to make Massive Trade Surpluses, as they have for decades, while our Farmers, Workers & Taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay? Not fair to the PEOPLE of America! $800 Billion Trade Deficit… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 11, 2018

….And add to that the fact that the U.S. pays close to the entire cost of NATO-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on Trade (they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh!). The European Union had a $151 Billion Surplus-should pay much more for Military! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 11, 2018

….Germany pays 1% (slowly) of GDP towards NATO, while we pay 4% of a MUCH larger GDP. Does anybody believe that makes sense? We protect Europe (which is good) at great financial loss, and then get unfairly clobbered on Trade. Change is coming! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 11, 2018

On Saturday, Trump left the G7 summit to travel to Singapore optimistic about how things went. However, after learning that Trudeau criticized U.S. trade policy after the summit, the president used Twitter to fire back at the Canadian PM, calling his actions “dishonest & weak.” (RELATED: Schumer, Pelosi Go Ballistic After Trump Reverses G7 Communique Endorsement)

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro also criticized Trudeau for engaging in “bad faith diplomacy” with President Trump during a “Fox News Sunday” appearance.

“There’s a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door,” said Navarro. “And that’s what bad faith Justin Trudeau did with that stunt press conference.”

Vanity Fair Praises Melania Trump’s Butterfly Belt As A Sign Of Diplomacy,"Vanity Fair praised first lady Melania Trump’s butterfly belt as a sign of diplomacy during a meeting with Finnish first lady Jenni Haukio in Helsinki Monday.

Trump, dressed in a $3,700 light yellow Gucci outfit, received a rare accolade from Vanity Fair due to her addition of a butterfly belt. The first lady’s butterfly adornment was referred to as “sartorial diplomacy” due to Haukio’s matching butterfly-inspired dress, wrote Hilary Weaver for Vanity Fair. (RELATED: Melania Shines In Powder Blue Coat At Helsinki-Vantaa Airport In Finland [PHOTOS])

“Melania Trump is engaging in some much less high-stakes diplomacy, meeting on Monday with Finnish first lady Jenni Haukio and, whether intentionally or not, matching Haukio’s butterfly-patterned dress with a butterfly belt of her own,” Weaver wrote. (RELATED: Finnish Billboards Welcome Trump To The ‘Land Of Free Press’)

“Enjoyed conversation with the First Lady of Finland today – good conversation about issues facing our nations,” Trump wrote on Twitter, thanking Haukio for hosting her.

Butterfly symbols refer to resurrection in Christianity, according to USA Today. Butterflies can also mean endurance, change, life, and hope in different cultures.

President Trump Is Getting NATO Countries To Pay Their Fair Share,"Our North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies have been ripping off America in trade while also relying on American taxpayers to pay their defense bills for decades. President Trump’s pressure on them to pay their fair share for defense is the right call and embodies his America First agenda.

“The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country. This is not fair, nor is it acceptable,” President Donald Trump tweeted.

“On top of this the European Union has a Trade Surplus of $151 million with the United States, with big trade barriers on U.S. goods. NO!” he continued.

To say that most NATO member countries aren’t quite meeting their commitment to the alliance is an understatement.

In 2006, NATO countries agreed to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense and reaffirmed that agreement in 2014. While the United States spends over 3.5 percent of its GDP on defense, only five other countries — the United Kingdom, Estonia, Poland, Greece, and Romania — have ever met the 2 percent mark. In 2016, Germany spent less than 1.5 percent of its GDP on defense.

This is especially egregious considering Germany claims it needs protection from Putin — all the while buying large amounts of gas from Russia and, thus, helping fund the very potential and potent adversary. This is, in a word, insane.

Last year, the United States accounted for 51.1 percent of the combined GDP among all NATO countries and was responsible for a whopping 71.7 percent of its defense spending. This means the United States contributes more money to NATO than Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Canada and the United Kingdom combined.

President Trump has demanded our NATO allies live up to their promises since he took office, and it appears that he’s already producing results. “Everyone has agreed to substantially up their commitment. They’re going to up it at levels that they never thought of before,” Trump said this week.

It’s about time, too. For decades, American leadership — and money — have protected NATO countries from Soviet aggression. The Soviet Union may be dissolved, but the 21st Century challenges of Islamic terror and asymmetric warfare still necessitate this successful alliance.

NATO proved to be an effective deterrent during the Cold War – it must return to serve again as an effective deterrent.

Not only is it the right thing to do, it’s imperative. With every member country spending at least 2 percent of GDP on defense, NATO will be far better equipped to meet today’s security threats. NATO member countries need to streamline and better coordinate on areas such as counterterrorism and intelligence sharing efforts, and cyber and strategic communications; and modernize their nuclear arsenals and submarine fleets. A modernized NATO 2.0 — ready for the 21st Century.

In calling out our NATO allies to pay their fair share, President Trump is sending a loud and clear message that America will no longer sit quietly and be taken advantage of by our friends.

This is why the president condemned the EU’s $151 billion trade surplus with the U.S. The failure of most NATO countries to meet their defense spending commitments is bad enough. That many are doing so while benefiting from unfair trade practices with is unacceptable.

President Trump is keeping America’s end of the bargain. It’s well past time for our NATO partners to share the burden. While other recent presidents have made this demand of NATO, President Trump will make sure they do honor this commitment — and do so for their own and NATO effectiveness as a real deterrent.

Kellyanne Conway: ‘With A Free Press Should Come A Fair Press’,"Kellyanne Conway defended the free press on Friday but also said that too many people in the press have started sharing untruths about the president.

WATCH:

“I just have a slightly different perspective than everybody else on this. I’m not sure it matters much anymore,” Conway declared on Fox News. “As I was saying, even before the election in 2016, the media constantly fed everybody their repressive poll numbers, inaccurate. Their spin, ‘She can’t lose. He can never win. What a joke. What are they doing?’ People turned out anyway.”

“Are you saying a free press doesn’t matter anymore? I want to be clear,” anchor Ed Henry asked.

“Absolutely not,” Conway replied. “It’s a bedrock of our democratic society. It is a bedrock. But with a free press should come a fair press. And yes, a critical press. But criticism and skepticism have given way to cynicism. And frankly, I see people on TV every day saying things that just aren’t true.”

Rudy Giuliani Tells Mueller When Trump Team Will ‘Admit’ He Was Fair,"Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani on Saturday tweeted notice to Robert Mueller about when President Trump’s team would consider the special counsel’s investigation a “fair” one.

“Just a few days before 60 day run-up to 2018 elections,” Giuliani tweeted. “If Mueller wants to show he’s not partisan, then issue a report on collusion and obstruction. They will show President Trump did nothing wrong. Then we will have to admit you were fair. And we will.”

Giuliani’s challenge comes as President Trump and others accuse Democrats of using the Mueller investigation as a way to “meddle” in the mid-term elections. The president also weighed in Saturday, hammering Jeff Sessions again and accusing Mueller “and his gang of 17 Angry Dems” of “having a field day” as the Clinton email scandal “goes untouched.”

"Georgetown Professor Says White Men Should Be Castrated, Fed To Swine","A professor at Georgetown University known for making incendiary comments against supporters of President Donald Trump said white men deserve “miserable deaths” for supporting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

C. Christine Fair, an associate professor at Georgetown in the School of Foreign Service, tweeted Saturday, saying white Republican men should die and an added bonus would be if women “castrate their corpses and feed them to swine.”

Her tweet was in response to South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham’s comments in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He defended Kavanaugh against an “unethical sham” and slammed Democrats for not releasing sexual assault allegations against the judge for weeks after they first received them.

In the tweet Fair called Kavanaugh a “serial rapist,” although he has never been convicted or even accused of rape. The FBI is currently investigating the accusations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh and plans to have its investigation finished by Friday.

Look at thus chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapist’s arrogated entitlement.

All of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps. Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine? Yes. https://t.co/tT7Igu157y — (((Christine Fair))) (@CChristineFair) September 29, 2018

Fair has previously made offensive comments on social media, telling a Muslim Trump supporter “fuck off” and “GO TO HELL.” (RELATED: ‘F**K YOU. GO TO HELL’: Georgetown Prof Loses It On Muslim Trump Voter)

Georgetown University said Fair’s views are her own and “not the views of the University,” in a statement to The Daily Caller News Foundation.

“The views of faculty members expressed in their private capacities are their own and not the views of the University,” the university said. “Our policy does not prohibit speech based on the person presenting ideas or the content of those ideas, even when those ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable. While faculty members may exercise freedom of speech, we expect that their classrooms and interaction with students be free of bias and geared toward thoughtful, respectful dialogue.”

Diane Lane Injects Bizarre ‘Rectal’ Verbiage Into Vanity Fair Interview,"Anyone can have a momentary, mindless slip of the tongue.

But “rectal?”

Is this even normal?

Actress Diane Lane got awfully confused during a lengthy interview with Vanity Fair. The magazine interviewed her for her appearance in the final season of House of Cards. She’s a former school chum of Claire Underwood‘s, a star character played by Robin Wright. Kevin Spacey‘s character, Frank Underwood, was expunged due to his lengthy number of men who have accused him of sexual assault, harassment and attempted rape, which currently stands strong at 15.

His blistering character will be missed. Writers had to do something.

While plowing through chatter about women and the #MeToo moment, at one point, Lane jokingly says “me, also” when replying to a question.

But the showstopper happened during the Q & A portion of the interview when Lane was apparently kidnapped by a proctologist. The weirdest part of the whole thing is that she seems to not get that she just used the word “rectal” in place of a word that isn’t anything like that word.

It rhymes — I’ll give her that.

From Vanity Fair:

Interviewer: There are some fantastic interactions between your character and Claire Underwood. The repartee is like something out of an old movie. Diane Lane: But we don’t [pass] the rectal test, right? Am I saying it right? Interviewer: You mean Bechdel? Like Alison Bechdel, the Bechdel test [which looks at whether a movie, TV show, or book features at least two women talking to each other about something besides men]? Diane Lane: Yes, that’s it. When the Bechdel test was first mentioned, I thought, yeah, what’s up with that? Why are guys always able to talk about whatever is going on in the story and then the ladies are coming on talking about the guys? I mean, it’s just dumb … we are playing history back now, looking at things differently.

Lane is famous for movies like Unfaithful, in which she sleeps with a man much younger than her husband, Richard Gere, who eventually blows up into a rage and murders her lover, Olivier Martinez, with a snow globe.

In 2004, she called the police on her then-husband Josh Brolin, who was arrested for domestic battery. Lane passed on pressing charges.

Lane’s politics lean left. She joined a climate protest in Washington in 2017. Her presence was overshadowed by Leonardo DiCaprio. Also in 2017: The Daily Mail called her “ageless” and featured her in a splashy story about how “sensational” she looks in a tiny bikini in Mexico.

As Vanity Fair‘s Tyler Coates wrote Monday night as he tweeted the “rectal” section of the story that did not have his byline, “I’m dying????”

How Will Vanity Fair’s Oscar Party Survive Without NBC’s Dylan Byers?,"Since when does an invitation to an Oscar party — or any party for that matter — mean that the host can’t uninvited you if you behave like a shithead?

Enter the New York Times, which trashed the upcoming Vanity Fair Oscar party and NBC media reporter Dylan Byers, who thinks his standing up for The Gray Lady means anything. The NYT published a hit piece saying the party has lost its luster. “It Was the Hottest Oscar Night Party. What Happened?” the headline blared Thursday. The story with the double byline of Katherine Rosman and Brooks Barnes dragged the party for having so many “brand partners.” In 45 graphs, the reporters wrote that the party used to be something of a “status symbol” and is no longer causing the “hysterical frenzy” it once did.

And what do you think happened next? No, Vanity Fair didn’t roll out the red carpet for NYT reporters and their photog. With dignity, the magazine ripped up their invites.

I’m not even sure their collective heads would fit through the door at this point.

Just got word that Vanity Fair has disinvited The New York Times from covering their annual Oscars party. They said it “feels like the Times has already run their coverage of the VF party this year,” they said. I guess we did!https://t.co/xZUWpbQnJH — choire (@Choire) February 22, 2019

My apologies to the New York Times reporter who has been disinvited from the @VanityFair Oscar party because of my and @brooksbarnesNYT’s reporting. You’re welcome to come to my apartment to watch with me & my kids. Not a single brand exec will be there! https://t.co/MkRfkyARaA — katie rosman (@katierosman) February 22, 2019

Byers, who lives in LA, came riding in with his inflated ego on his white horse. He used to smoke a lot of weed. Oh, the wandering. If you don’t know what I’m referring to, watch here.

I have decided not to attend this year’s Vanity Fair Oscars party in light of their decision to ban the @NYTimes on account of their very legitimate reporting. The decision to ban the Times because of critical reporting is incongruous with journalistic values VF claims to uphold. https://t.co/cv0l3nGo9c — Dylan Byers (@DylanByers) February 22, 2019

“So brave,” a Washington reporter wrote regarding Byers’ ridiculous tweet.

“What a pompous ass,” remarked another DC journalist.

Here’s the thing. If you badmouth a party before you show up, why should you expect party throwers to let you in? At least wait until the soirée is over, or do it during if you must. I mean, haven’t we all been left off Tammy Haddad‘s White House Corresopndents’ weekend garden brunch list at some point or another?

I recall a shaggy hair-ed guy in green pants sifting through his roster and saying he couldn’t find my name. Hmmm….I wonder why that was. I had been formally invited by one of the co-hosts. Once inside, a woman with blonde hair pulled me aside and lectured me like a child about what I would write and tried to implement rules regarding my coverage. That year, I enjoyed myself. I got to say hello to Vox‘s Ezra Klein. I met CNN’s Brian Stelter in the flesh (not too exciting). A party-goer grabbed my goblet of mimosa and downed the whole thing in one gulp (yes, rude). So-called Washington socialites trying to control me was so irritating that the next year I didn’t mind writing a story bashing her party after it fell into my lap. I wrote about how Haddad behaved like a mob boss with her invites. Many Washington insiders who actually wanted to come and donate to her fucking charity were coldly left off the list.

But I wrote it and published it as it was happening, not before, you idiots. And I never expected to receive an invitation to the ghoulish garden brunch after I wrote that. At the time, my then-boss, whom you could hardly call an editor, wasn’t too pleased with my story. You see, he had worked with her at MSNBC and God forbid you upset a woman with a gray stripe in her hair who hosts an annual garden brunch during Nerd Prom.

“It used to be a special insider event,” Marty Kaplan, an entertainment prof at the University of Southern California told the NYT of the Vanity Fair Oscar party. “Now it’s a week-long corporate branding-palooza.”

Ugh. Doesn’t all this make you antsy for this year’s White House Correspondents’ Dinner?",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2019/02/22/vanity-fair-nbc-dylan-byers-stands-up-nyt/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjdw5vu_7P9AhVnFVkFHf9BBwU4PBAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw3kayTl945Ge9QwE2cPdwir,2019-02-22
Stacey Abrams’ Nonprofit Slapped With IRS Complaint,"FACT, an ethics watchdog group, filed a complaint with the IRS against Fair Fight Action, a nonprofit organization founded by Stacey Abrams.

FACT says Fair Fight is violating its tax-exempt status by promoting Abrams’ political career instead of solely focusing on its stated goal of promoting voting rights.

After losing her 2018 gubernatorial bid, Abrams openly considered a 2020 run for Senate and the White House.

An ethics watchdog group filed a complaint with the IRS against Stacey Abrams’ nonprofit organization, Fair Fight Action, alleging it violated federal law.

The Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) — a government watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. — said Fair Fight is working to promote Abrams’ political career in lieu of promoting voting rights, which it said would be in violation of its 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status.

Originally founded in 2014 as Voter Access Institute, Abrams changed the name to Fair Fight Action in December 2018. Fair Fight’s stated goal is the promotion of voter rights, and it advocates for a number of different election reforms. However, under its 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status, it cannot provide “support for an individual’s personal political activities.”

In its complaint to the IRS, FACT argues Abrams used Fair Fight to promote her own political ambitions.

The complaint says since Abrams lost her gubernatorial election, Fair Fight has helped pay for Abrams’ statewide speaking tour, Facebook ads that attacked Georgia GOP Gov. Brian Kemp and promoted herself, a Super Bowl ad, hosted watch parties for supporters to “cheer” for Abrams as she gave the Democratic response to the State of the Union, and accepted donations from a “Stacey Abrams Fundraiser.”

These activities have gone on as Abrams openly mulled a 2020 Senate candidacy and even a presidential bid. Former Vice President Joe Biden is reportedly considering Abrams as his running mate, should he run and win the Democratic presidential nomination. Any political run for office by Abrams, experts argue, would elevate concerns over Fair Fight’s activities.

“It is extremely concerning that Stacey Abrams appears to be abusing our nation’s tax laws for her personal political gain,” Kendra Arnold, the executive director of FACT, said in a statement Tuesday. “The IRS has on numerous occasions ruled against groups trying to advance personal interests, and it is imperative the IRS investigate Fair Fight Action’s conduct.”

Abrams’ team hit back against the complaint.

“We know the playbook for Trump and his allies. They’re going to do whatever it takes to undermine our movement to ensure free and fair elections. We have to fight back now,” said Lauren Groh-Wargo — Abrams’ 2018 campaign manager who runs Fair Fight — in an email to supporters.

Groh-Wargo called the complaint “baseless” and said her group was not promoting Abrams.

FACT pushed back against the accusation that it is a partisan organization, pointing out that it filed similar complaints with Republicans as well.

“Whoever we identify with questionable behavior, they fail to respond to the actual legitimacy of the complaint and just try to characterize us in one way or another,” Arnold told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “We have filed complaints against every type of candidate and elected official. We do not consider party affiliation.” (RELATED: House Oversight Committee Opens Investigation Into Alleged Georgia Voter Suppression)

This is not the first time a nonprofit led by Abrams received negative headlines.

Third Sector Development, a nonprofit launched by Abrams that focuses on registering black voters, has been hit with seven different tax liens over the past few years for unpaid employment contributions. Georgia state regulators filed three tax liens against the group in the past year, and the Georgia Department of Labor filed four tax liens between 2014 and 2016. Abrams blamed the issues on clerical errors.

Former Vanity Fair Reporter Accuses Editor Of Covering Up Evidence Against Epstein,"A former Vanity Fair reporter alleged Monday that the publication’s editor cut out salacious details regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s involvement with underage girls in a profile story written in 2002.

Epstein was arrested and charged with underage sex trafficking Saturday. He was formally accused of paying underage girls for sexual massages in Florida between 1999 and 2005, The New York Times reported Saturday. He is a registered sex offender in Florida.

Vicky Ward, who previously worked for Vanity Fair and is now a NYT investigative reporter, called out former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter over Twitter Monday for allegedly covering up details in a profile story published in 2002. She tweeted that the information Carter took out of her piece would have exposed Epstein as a sexual predator and potentially saved some of his victims.

Ward alleges that she uncovered “concrete, irrefutable examples of strange business practices,” including “three first-person accounts from a mother and her two [underage] daughters” detailing how Epstein tried to seduce both girls.

I tried to expose Jeffrey Epstein for what he is and I was silenced. Everyone who knew about Epstein was—silenced by people with more money and power and influence. Now that silence is over. It’s time for the truth to see the light. — Vicky Ward (@VickyPJWard) July 8, 2019

After submitting her piece to Carter, Ward tweeted that he cut out the first-person accounts because “He’s [Epstein] sensitive to young women,” according to one of Ward’s tweets.

Ward also tweeted that “people KNEW” about what Epstein was doing long before he was arrested Saturday. She wrote that President Donald Trump made comments in 2002 that Epstein likes “beautiful women…many of them on the younger side.”

The thing about Jeffrey Epstein is that people KNEW this. See Trump’s comment back in 2002 about Epstein liking “beautiful women…many of them on the younger side.” — Vicky Ward (@VickyPJWard) July 8, 2019

Trump allegedly banned Epstein from his Mar-A-Largo estate after Epstein “sexually assaulted an underage girl at the club,” according to Bradley Edwards, a lawyer who represented Epstein’s victims.

Ward included tweets stating that many of Epstein’s friends are a “BIG part of this story” and “are not insignificant.” (RELATED: Lawyers For Jeffrey Epstein Once Said He Helped Conceive The Clinton Global Initiative)

Epstein pleaded not guilty Monday to the charges.

Carter did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Illinois Governor Reaps Backlash After Dumping Band From Fair Over Confederate Flag Images,"Illinois Governor J.B Pritzker responded to the backlash created after he dumped a country band from the state fair over the group’s confederate flag images.

“The Confederate flag is a symbol of not just slavery, but of treason against the United States,” Pritzker told reporters about the decision to pull Confederate Railroad from the Du Quoin State Fair, per the Chicago Sun-Times in a piece published Wednesday. (RELATED: UNC Chapel Hill Suggests Moving Toppled Confederate Statue Inside Campus Building)

“That’s what happened under the banner of the Confederate flag many years ago in this country,” he added. “It is today the symbol of racists, of white nationalists, of the alt-right and so I do not think that the state of Illinois should be sponsoring something that is amplifying that symbol.” (RELATED: Hospital Worker Fired After He Was Spotted At Polls Sporting Confederate Flag With Noose)

When asked about performer Snoop Dogg still being on the line-up at the state fair in Springfield and the rapper’s use of imagery that has also been controversial, Pritzker said it wasn’t the same. On Snoop’s latest album titled, “Make America Crip Again,” there is an image of the rapper standing next to a cartoon body corpse with a toe-tag that reads “Trump.”

“There is an enormous difference between the political satire, the discussion by a single artist, his political views, and the representation of truly millions of people being enslaved, hundreds of thousands of people being killed under the banner of treason, essentially,” Pritzker shared, per KMOX Radio.

“There’s a big difference between what I just described and the hundreds of thousands of people [who] died; millions, in fact tens of millions of people, were enslaved,” he added. “We’re talking about a history, a terrible history in the United States. Death and destruction that took place under that flag — and on the other side, political satire.”

The band, formed in 1987, features a logo that includes a steam engine with Confederate Flags, per the Associated Press.

The logo for the Grammy-nominated band, known for acoustic ballads such as “Jesus and Mama” as well as its raucous anthem, “Trashy Women,” features a steam engine from which waves dual Confederate Navy Jacks, whose stars and bars are the most widely recognized symbol of the Confederacy.

In a statement posted on Twitter, the group said being removed from the show was “very disappointing.

“We have since been removed from that show by the Illinois Department of Agriculture because of the name of our band,” the band’s statement read in part. “This was very disappointing as we have played this fair before and enjoyed it very much. The outpouring of support from Confederate Railroad fans, fans of other acts, and the public in general, has been both overwhelming and very much appreciated.”

“Confederate Railroad Releases Statement on Illinois State Fair Concert Cancellation,” the official account for the band’s Twitter account read.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2019/07/10/illinois-governor-backlash-dumping-confederate-flag-band/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiWuvXu_7P9AhXWkIkEHRYqC4E4RhAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw3xrjzWk9ap4XuDVKPOVGHz,2019-07-10
MSNBC Host Says Democrats Aren’t Going To ‘Play Fair’ To Put Trump In Jail,"MSNBC host Donny Deutsch said Democrats have to remove “this criminal President,” and they are not going to “play fair” to put President Donald Trump in jail.

Deutsch went on MSNBC‘s “Morning Joe” Friday to talk about what he thinks Democrats should do in order to beat Trump in the 2020 election and ultimately send him to jail. Co-host Joe Scarborough gave Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, the nickname “Moscow Mitch” during the segment.

The MSNBC host said Democrats are “at war” with Trump. (RELATED: Fox News Hits Back On Rumors That It Won’t Air The Mueller Testimony)

“What you said in a couple of minutes yesterday to me is the most important thing that’s ever been said on this show – on any show on this air. We are at war,” Deutsch said. “It is time for the Democrats to wake up … We may not have won the battle of impeachment, but we’re going to win the war of putting him in jail. Whatever we have to do. And we’re not going to necessarily play fair…”

“We are playing against cheaters and liars or stealers, and with all due respect to Michelle Obama, when they go low … we’ve got to do whatever we have to do,” he added.

Deutsch also gave Democrats some advice on how they should refer to Trump. “Playing fair” is when you “call him President Trump,” Deutsch noted. However, since he suggested that Democrats not play fair, Deutsch stated that Trump should be called “criminal Trump.”

“By the way, we’re going to call him ‘un-indicted criminal Trump’ now, because in two instances he has been an un-indicted criminal,” Deutsch said. “When you’re playing fair, you’re supposed to call him President Trump. Just like we’re gonna call him ‘Moscow Mitch, we’re gonna call him ‘criminal Trump.’ Another message for the Democrats – it is time to move forward.”

“The one tool we have to use that the Democrats never use is fear … We cannot lose the next election. We will go back 50 years … We cannot bring a knife fight to a bazooka gunfight.”

Deutsch said in June that he is not sure in his “heart of hearts” if a Democrat can beat Trump in the 2020 election, The Hill reported.

‘It’s Not Fair’: Idaho State Rep. To Introduce Bill Barring Biological Males From Girls’ Sports,"An Idaho state legislator plans to introduce a bill that would require biologically male athletes to compete on boys’ sports teams, regardless of whether they identify as a transgender girl or not.

Idaho state Rep. Barbara Ehardt is the latest Republican lawmaker across the country to introduce legislation ensuring girls aren’t forced to compete against biologically male athletes.

The wave of proposed legislation comes as biological males have piled up victories in female athletics.

“Boys and men will not be able to take the place of girls and women in sports because it’s not fair. We cannot physically compete against boys and men,” Ehardt told East Idaho News on Monday. (RELATED: Democrats Unanimous As House Passes Bill Forcing Schools To Let Male Athletes Compete In Girls’ Sports)

“The inherent biological, scientific advantages that boys and men have over girls and women, even if they were to take hormones, even if they were to spend a couple of years on estrogen, that’s not going to replace the inherent biological advantages that boys and men have,” she added.

Ehardt’s view is backed up by scientific research on the subject, which shows that biologically male athletes who identify as transgender retain physiological advantages over female athletes, even after undergoing hormone therapy.

Biological males who identify as transgender have excelled in female athletics. Two biologically male runners in Connecticut have dominated girls’ high school track in the liberal state, which allows athletes to compete as the gender with which they identify.

Franklin Pierce University runner CeCe Telfer, a biological male who identifies as a transgender woman, won an NCAA DII national championship in women’s track and field last May. Telfer told ESPN in June that female runners are actually the ones with an advantage.

A biologically male runner at the University of Montana, a Division I NCAA school, was named the Big Sky Conference’s cross-country female athlete of the week in October.

Ehardt’s forthcoming bill follows similar legislation from Republican state legislators around the country. Alabama state Rep. Rep. Chris Pringle, for example, authored the Gender is Real Legislative (GIRL) Act, which he announced earlier this month. (RELATED: Every Democratic 2020 Frontrunner Supports Bill Forcing Male Athletes Into Girls’ Sports)

Other bills meant to protect female athletes from being forced to compete against biological males are in the works in New Hampshire, Washington, Georgia, Tennessee and Missouri, the Wall Street Journal previously reported.

BUCK: America’s Brewers Need A Fair And Free Aluminum Market,"Today is National Beer Can Appreciation Day and in Colorado, we know a thing or two about beer. Our state is the largest beer-producing state, employing nearly 3,000 people in my home district alone.

America’s economy was built on a bedrock of free-market principles, that’s why our nation’s 7,000 brewers have contributed over $300 billion year after year to our economy. Brewers across the country rely on a fair and free market for aluminum purchases. But within the past year, concerns have been voiced about whether this multi-billion dollar industry has been operating in a fair and free market when it comes to an important part of their supply chain: aluminum.

These market irregularities have cost America’s brewing industry hundreds of millions of dollars and raised the price of beer, soda, and other household goods my constituents use every day. That’s why I’ve sponsored the Aluminum Pricing Examination (APEX) Act, to give the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) proper oversight authority of the aluminum market.

With this bill, our nation’s brewers can continue to produce some of America’s most popular beverages. I’ve been a lifetime defender of free markets and my bill ensures the thousands of businesses that rely on a steady stream of aluminum have access to a fairly and transparently priced product.

What’s causing prices on aluminum to rise?

These anomalies stem from pricing spikes in the Midwest Premium. Brewers and other businesses that purchase aluminum must pay a benchmark fee called the Midwest Premium, which is intended to serve as a “shipping and handling” cost for transporting aluminum.

The process to establish a benchmark for the Midwest Premium is unclear. I’ve looked at the impact on the many American industries that rely on aluminum and it concerns me that besides the Midwest Premium provider, no one has the authority to oversee these benchmarks.

This unclear process and lack of oversight are both troubling, especially as the Midwest Premium has more than doubled — yes you read that right, doubled — since the beginning of 2018.

Rate setters will tell you that President Trump’s tariffs on aluminum and steel are the culprit. However, President Trump’s tariff policy has sought to target bad actors from taking advantage of American aluminum producers.

I’ve also heard concerns that players in aluminum markets may have used this policy to artificially alter the marketplace. As such, the aluminum market has experienced unprecedented cost fluctuations that are disconnected from marketing fundamentals since the beginning of 2018.

Even U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross admits “the fact of aluminum’s price going up does not seem to justify a huge increase in the Midwest Premium.”

When asked about aluminum benchmarking, the former CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo told Congress, “I think there are concerns about the way the index, used by some of the index providers is constructed. That’s an area that’s actually outside of our jurisdiction. We do not regulate the formulation of benchmarks; we only oversee where there may be manipulation that would affect one of our derivative markets.”

Without federal oversight, the potential exists for our free market to be distorted. We need to fully equip the CFTC, along with the U.S. Department of Justice, with proper oversight authority to ensure this market is free from influence.

The APEX Act’s positive impacts would be far from a collapse of the free market as some experts suggest. As the primary sponsor of this legislation, I can assure Americans that this bill does not allow any federal government official or agency to set the price of aluminum or artificially impact the aluminum market.

My bill ensures our brewers are operating on a level playing field and get back to what they do best: brewing the best beer in the world.

Congressman Ken Buck is a Republican from Windsor, representing Colorado’s 4th Congressional District. He was first elected to Congress on November 4, 2014, and is currently serving his third term in the United States House of Representatives.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2020/01/24/buck-americas-brewers-need-a-fair-and-free-aluminum-market/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiEwfns_7P9AhUEEFkFHTcnB2E4KBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw3j-tIS434GM0kzTcLeocWh,2020-01-24
"Why Republicans Should Not Go YIMBY, And HUD Should Get Rid Of Obama’s Fair Housing Rule Completely","The Trump administration’s Department of Housing and Urban Development has proposed new rules for Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH), slightly rolling back the rules put in place at the end of Barack Obama’s presidency. While the proposed rule has provoked a freak-out in the media — the Washington Post’s editorial board called it a “disturbing retreat” — in reality the proposed rule doesn’t go far enough in rolling it back.

HUD’s proposed rule appears to be influenced by growing pro-developer sentiment in the GOP, which has been expressed in a variety of different ways, from conservative urbanism to the counterintuitive argument that a housing shortage caused the great recession, to the YIMBY (Yes In My Backyard) movement, which offers the prospect of conservatives making inroads in overwhelmingly Democratic coastal cities. One might also note that the White House is currently occupied by a property developer. There are serious reasons to be skeptical of this growing tendency, both on political and policy grounds.

In reality what the administration’s proposed HUD rule does is change the AFFH requirement from a left-wing social engineering experiment to a right-wing attack on local control. The new rule still uses the threat of withholding HUD grant money as a cudgel, only its attack on local zoning is indirect rather than prescriptive, as the Obama-era rule was. The proposed rule enumerates several “inherent barriers to fair housing choice,” including “lack of a sufficient supply” of housing, the presence of rent control or restrictions on manufactured housing, and the worryingly vague, “inflexible or unduly rigorous design standards or other similar barriers.” (RELATED: Democrats Seek To Outlaw Suburban, Single-Family House Zoning, Calling It Racist And Bad For The Environment)

Conservative urbanists should take note of that last one: What is envisioned here is closer to Houston than Poundbury. Howard Husock at City Journal writes that the new rule is “pulling back, but not abolishing, these [Obama-era] rules, setting the stage for production of housing that will prove ‘naturally affordable’ because of its design and density.” Whether grant money is withheld because of some bureaucrat’s zoning analysis or because some bureaucrat decided there wasn’t enough local supply is, on the ground, likely to prove a distinction without a difference.

While the prospect of using federal power to cut through the regulatory rat’s nest of developing housing in California, for example, is compelling, it should be resisted. YIMBY-ism is attractive to right-leaning people for a few reasons: 1) it fits well with the laissez-faire anti-regulation stance they like. 2) It offers the prospect of common ground with progressives in certain places, like San Francisco, and 3) it speaks to an issue that exists where young, right-of-center political people live, namely Washington, DC or New York City. And one can’t deny that there are some cities where YIMBYism makes sense. San Francisco really does need more housing units. But most of the country is not San Francisco, and to normalize the federal arm-twisting of municipal governments in a bipartisan way is going to make it worse during the next Democratic administration.

Moreover, it is out of step with both current right-of-center political trends and the GOP’s history: Republicans have historically been the party of homeowners, whereas the Democratic Party has been the party of renters and construction unions. Renters tend to lean left while homeowners lean right. During the Bush years, the conventional wisdom about an “ownership society” was that if you could turn more renters into homeowners, that would be advantageous for Republicans. The effort to do so, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars a year, is widely seen as a failure, after fueling what became the subprime mortgage crisis and not increasing the proportion of homeowners significantly. And yet to the extent that the pro-development push in the GOP means “switching sides” from homeowners to renters and developers, conservatives should be wary of it for political reasons.

Politics has a geographic dimension. In a conversation with Michael Lind before an interview several weeks ago, he remarked that two different groups of people came into the Republican Party during the Reagan wave: former Dixiecrats in the South and the “white ethnic” Reagan Democrats of the midwest. Either one of those groups could have become the driving force in the party, but both Bush administrations had a decidedly Southern cast, with both the virtues and vices that that entails: oligarchical, pro-big business, and protestant, where it could have been union-friendly, supportive of tariffs and infrastructure development, and Catholic. The big development of Trump-era Republican politics is reversing that Bush-era polarity: when coastal journalists go to write features peering into the mind of the Trump voter, they’re almost always going to towns in the Midwest.

The reason why this matters for housing policy is that the local housing markets of these pro-Trump constituencies are even more different from those of the big coastal cities than the growing cities of the New South were. They’re declining or flattening out rather than growing, and, by and large, they do not have housing shortages. The major concern is making sure the people who still live in these places, or who have moved back, live in homes that are likely to retain and ideally grow their value, which is why Cleveland demolished around 10,000 homes as of two years ago. Making it easier to build thousands of units in Cleveland or Kansas City or Indianapolis is not going to help the people trying to bring these places out of post-industrial turpitude. In fact, it’s more likely to hurt them. (RELATED: Why These Two Democratic Candidates Have Been Involved In Bulldozing Houses)

Going YIMBY is a mistake for the GOP for both political and policy reasons: it offers very little political benefit because the areas that actually do need more housing are solidly blue and not likely to change, and it does not address the actual market conditions of the vast majority of localities in the United States, especially not the ones Trump has recently brought back into the fold.

‘Cops Are Never Fair’: Sen. Mark Warner’s Campaign Staffer Calls For Defunding The Police,"A woman claiming to be a field director for Democratic Virginia Sen. Mark Warner’s reelection campaign has repeatedly called for defunding the police on Twitter, a policy stance far outside anything Warner has officially endorsed.

The staffer, retired Marine Corps sergeant Tonya James, criticized Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for participating in protests but being unwilling to defund the police, according to tweets sent from her account on Monday. Prior to working on Warner’s campaign, James worked as the South Carolina campaign director for Democratic Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton’s brief presidential run in 2019.

James locked her Twitter account shortly after this article was published, but screenshots of the tweets are still available for viewing.

“When you hear us say, love us like you love our culture this is what we mean. Mayor, you can’t come and do the cupid shuffle with us and then when you are asked to defund the police say no. That is not how any of this is going to work. Shuffle out the door,” James wrote in a tweet. (RELATED: ‘Act This Month’ — Joe Biden Calls On Congress To Fast-Track Police Reform Bill For Trump To Sign Into Law)

When another Twitter user called Frey’s dancing with protesters “endearing,” James disagreed.

“Not really,” she wrote. “He loves our culture up until the point he was asked to defund the police and he said no. Nothing enduring[sic] about this guy.”

The slogan of defunding the police has gained steam amid protests against the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. (RELATED: DC Archbishop Rips Saint John Paul II National Shrine For Allowing Itself To Be ‘Manipulated’ Ahead Of Trump Visit)

James has a history of criticizing the police that predates the Floyd protests, however. She tweeted in December 2019 that it was impossible for police to be unbiased in their work.

“Cops should be fair referees not political pawns.” The idea that one should ever think that cops could be fair referees is the whole reason why immigrants have to have government step in. Cops are never fair, because the institution is never fair,” she said.

Warner’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the senator has made no public remarks in favor of defunding the police. He has criticized President Donald Trump for clearing out mostly peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square so the president and administration officials could the photographed at St. Johns church.

Warner is running as an incumbent against retired Army Lt. Col. Daniel Gade, an Iraq veteran who lost his right leg in combat overseas. Gade told the Daily Caller he is not in favor of defunding the police.

“It’s unfortunate and unforgivable that my opponent’s campaign would call for defunding the brave police departments that serve out communities and label these heroes as racist,” he said. “I served honorably for over 25 years in uniform and sacrificed greatly to serve my fellow man. My opponent’s comments are what career politicians say because it’s what their party bosses and DC lobbyists expect them to say.”

“Virginia’s service members, officers and citizens deserve better from their U.S. Senator,” Gade added. “I’m ready to send him packing and Virginia is ready to elect a servant as the Commonwealth’s next Senator.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2020/06/09/mark-warner-campaign-staffer-defund-police/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjhtsrt_7P9AhXoGFkFHRZBALo4MhAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw23WtXUaMbZSAcihalIJKrZ,2020-06-09
George Washington University Apologizes For Sharing Email About Police Recruitment Fair,"George Washington University issued an apology Wednesday to students after sending an email about an upcoming police employment fair.

The chair of the sociology department, Hiromi Ishizawa, said the employment email sent a few days prior, “hurt many people in this context of national and international focus on police violence and police abuses, especially against Black people,” according to pictures of the email chain obtained by Young Americans For Freedom, a conservative advocacy organization.

“Our Department’s programs and classes provide students with knowledge and analytical tools to understand and improve society, including to research, recognize, and redress systematic inequalities and injustice,” she added. “Current events have solidified our continued and renewed commitment to challenge ourselves and our students to be part of ending systemic racism, state violence, and other inequities.”

The previous email, which was sent on June 5, informed students of an upcoming virtual career showcase with officers from four different law enforcement agencies. The email was sent to criminal justice majors among others and offered a $500 cash prize or book scholarship to a winner of a competition.

The college also came under fire on June 5 when law school faculty requested Attorney General Bill Barr’s honorary degree be revoked following statements that he sought to quash destructive riots throughout the country, according to The Daily Beast.

The email statements and law school actions come amid demonstrations across the country following the death of George Floyd, who died after a police officer knelt on his neck for over 8 minutes, viral video shows.

‘I Hope He Gets A Fair Shake’: Trump Reacts To Charges Against Former Officer Who Shot Rayshard Brooks,"President Donald Trump said that he hopes the former police officer who shot Rayshard Brooks last week “gets a fair shake” during a Wednesday appearance on “Hannity.”

Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced 11 charges Wednesday, including felony murder, against former Atlanta Police Department officer Garrett Rolfe for his role in the death of Rayshard Brooks, who was seen on video resisting arrest, grabbing a taser, running, then shooting that taser back at Rolfe before getting shot.

Fox News host Sean Hannity asked the president for his “thoughts on the charges that went down in Atlanta today.”

WATCH:

After speaking to clear differences between the death of George Floyd and Brooks, Trump called the former “a different kind of a case.”

“I thought it was a terrible situation but you can’t resist a police officer and if you have a disagreement, you have to take it up after the fact,” Trump said. “It was a very, very sad thing. You take a look and it was out of control, the whole situation was out of control.”

“I heard today and just got a report that the police officers’ lawyer said that he heard a sound like a gun, like a gunshot, and he saw a flash in front of him,” the president continued. “I don’t know that I would have necessarily believed that, but I will tell you, that’s a very interesting thing and maybe that’s so. They’re gonna have to find out. It’s up to justice now. It’s gonna be up to justice.”

The president told Hannity that he hopes the officer “gets a fair shake because police have not been treated fairly in our country.” (RELATED: Jesse Watters: Fulton County DA Engaging In A ‘Political Overcharge,’ Police Will ‘Let The Streets Run Wild’)

“But again, you can’t resist a police officer like that and they ended up in a very terrible disagreement and look at the way it ended,” he concluded.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2020/06/17/donald-trump-garrett-rolfe-rayshard-brooks-charges/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjhtsrt_7P9AhXoGFkFHRZBALo4MhAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw2GzZwFoUNoWitPlvAHSY34,2020-06-17
NBC News Spent Weeks Reporting On A Contributor’s Journey Battling Coronavirus – But He Never Had It,"NBC News spent weeks documenting its science contributor’s battle with COVID-19, but now he admits that he never tested positive for it.

Dr. Joseph Fair, a virologist, believed he had the virus and appeared on air numerous times to discuss his struggle with illness in May and June. On Tuesday, Fair admitted that he tested negative for the virus multiple times but had originally believed he had it regardless. Fair also tested negative upon taking an antibody test.

“My undiagnosed/suspected COVID illness from nearly 2 months ago remains an undiagnosed mystery as a recent antibody test was negative,” Fair tweeted Tuesday. “I had myriad COVID symptoms, was hospitalized in a COVID ward & treated for COVID-related co-morbidities, despite testing negative by nasal swab.”

I was severely ill for 2 weeks, 4 days of it in critical condition, resulting in pneumonia, diffuse lung injury & 18lbs of weight loss. My path forward is a 2nd AB test, & follow-up with a pulmonologist & tropical medicine specialist in an effort to diagnose what made me so ill. — Dr. Joseph Fair (@curefinder) July 7, 2020

I was truly humbled by this experience and again thank you all for the support throughout. — Dr. Joseph Fair (@curefinder) July 7, 2020

Fair suggested during an interview on the “Today” show May 14 that he may have gotten the virus through his eye during a flight. He conducted the interview while in a New Orleans hospital, the Washington Free Beacon reported. (RELATED: MSNBC Analyst Suggests Using Coronavirus To Prosecute Trump For ‘Negligent Homicide’ — Gets An Assist From Former Democratic Candidate)

NBC News originally told viewers about the negative tests, but abandoned that part of the narrative as the story continued, according to Steve Krakauer’s “Fourth Watch” newsletter. During a June 14 interview with Chuck Todd on “Meet the Press,” no one noted that Fair had already tested negative at least five times, according to Krakauer.

“In the end, NBC’s viewers were left with two very alarming – and false – impressions,” Krakauer wrote. “First, that an expert virologist can take every precaution but can still catch COVID-19 through his eyes. False. Second, that tests can be so untrustworthy that you can have multiple negative tests and still have coronavirus.”

NBC News has not yet updated its May 14 article claiming the virologist got “coronavirus despite being in good health and taking precautions.” The network did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller.

“This pandemic is scary enough without this false storyline introduced into the news picture,” Krakauer added.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2020/07/10/nbc-news-contributor-battle-coronavirus-negative-antibodies/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjdw5vu_7P9AhVnFVkFHf9BBwU4PBAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw2nd-tW24esyN1Hg16BW7G6,2020-07-10

Sen Lisa Murkowski Has Said She Will Not Vote On Any Supreme Court Nominee Until After The Inauguration,"Republican Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski has said she would not vote to replace a Supreme Court justice until after the inauguration.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died Friday evening at her home at the age of 87. Murkowski, a pro-choice moderate from Alaska, is often a swing vote in the Senate.

“When Republicans held off Merrick Garland because nine months prior to the election was too close, we needed to let the people decide,” Murkowski said in August, according to The Hill. “And I agreed to do that. If we say now that months prior to the election is OK when nine months is not, that is a double standard and I don’t believe we should do it.”

Last month, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she would not support confirming a new Supreme Court justice before the election or in a lame-duck session. She said that would be a “double standard” after what happened in 2016.https://t.co/BJqcDjP2oG pic.twitter.com/VOW1wSqsyR — Mike Baker (@ByMikeBaker) September 19, 2020

Murkowski also commented on the issue Friday afternoon only hours before Ginsburg’s death, echoing her previous stance.

“Fair is fair,” she said. (RELATED: Murkowski Votes ‘Present’ For Justice Brett Kavanaugh)

News: @SenatorCollins told me earlier this month in Maine that she would not seat a Supreme Court justice in October. “I think that’s too close, I really do,” she said.

“I think that’s too close, I really do,” Collins said when asked whether she would vote to confirm a Supreme Court justice in October. Collins also said that she would oppose seating a justice in the lame duck session of Congress if President Donald Trump loses the election in November.

"Up To 52 Million New Immigrants Could Settle In The US Under The Biden-Harris Plan, Analysis Finds","The Biden-Harris immigration plan could allow up to 52 million new immigrants to settle in the U.S., according to a Federation for American Immigration Reform analysis provided to the Daily Caller News Foundation.

“This dramatic increase would eclipse the entire current foreign-born population of the country,” the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), a nonprofit that advocates for reduced immigration, stated.

The campaign’s proposals, which include eliminating detention for many illegal border crossers, halting border wall construction, and scaling back deportation, would also increase the taxpayer-funded costs of services and benefits for illegal immigrants to more than $200 billion annually — a 50% increase, according to FAIR’s analysis.

“Campaigns are an opportunity for candidates to present to the voters their vision on important policy matters,” FAIR President Dan Stein said said in a statement. “To their credit, the Biden-Harris campaign has done just that on immigration policy.”

“But policy proposals are not just words on paper,” he continued. “If implemented, they will have quantifiable results. They can mean more legal and illegal immigration or less; greater costs to taxpayers, or less.”

FAIR’s President Dan Stein talks to @CIS_org‘s Director of Policy Studies, @JessicaV_CIS, about the immigration enforcement (or lack thereof) and changes we can expect from a Biden administration. https://t.co/jDzQBaJoin — FAIR (@FAIRImmigration) September 18, 2020

The Biden-Harris immigration plan would enable 43 million individuals to participate in family-chain migration through an amnesty program, according to FAIR. The analysis determined that figure based on its estimate that 12.6 million adult illegal immigrants reside in the U.S., and according to the Department of Homeland Security, each immigrant sponsors 3.45 family members for green cards.

Former Vice President Joe Biden proposes “providing a roadmap to citizenship for nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants.” This will increase the number of illegal immigrants that attempt to cross the southern border, according to FAIR.

The Democratic presidential nominee also plans to reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The FAIR analysis noted that, according to the Migration Policy Institute, there are at least 1.3 million illegal immigrants eligible for DACA.

According to FAIR, the illegal alien population has increased by 3.1 million primarily because “there have been few consequences for employers who hire illegal aliens.” FAIR projects that the total illegal immigrant population will reach 20 million by 2024.

But Biden’s plan to end large-scale workplace raids “will only incentivize more illegal immigration,” meaning that FAIR’s “estimate is almost certainly on the conservative side” if he is elected, the analysis said.

“It is important to get beyond rhetoric and look at the real-world implication of policy proposals if they become law, so that voters can understand the choices they are making,” Stein said in his statement.

FAIR’s analysis concludes: “During a time when tens of millions of Americans are out of work, the focus of all presidential candidates needs to be on how to help American citizens find gainful employment, not importing millions of new migrants to compete for the few jobs currently available. “

"Billionaire Leon Cooperman Rips Into Reddit Traders, Says Calls For ‘Fair Share’ Taxes Attack Wealthy","Billionaire Leon Cooperman said Thursday that investors who were flooding the market and manipulating stocks like GameStop and AMC would only end up losing.

WATCH:

“There’s no one that can convince me that GameStop will not be a lower priced stock a year or two years from now. Nobody,” Cooperman said, arguing that most of the people buying up the stock did not understand the way the market would work in the longer term and may not achieve the outcome they were hoping for.

“It will end in tears, in my opinion … It’s a loser’s game and they have no idea what they’re doing,” he said.

Cooperman stayed on for a second segment, during which he pivoted to address President Joe Biden’s potential economic policies and how they might impact the markets.

WATCH:

“Right now President Biden is tackling the easy things,” Cooperman said. “All of us want to get the virus behind us, right? So anything he does to battle the virus is universally welcome.”

Cooperman went on to say that tunes might change when Biden started to talk about raising taxes on capital gains or ordinary income.

“In a recent speech he talked about fair share. I hate that expression with a passion. What does fair share mean?” Cooperman asked.

“I’ve said on your program numerous times, I’m willing to work six months a year for the government and six months for myself, which means a marginal tax rate of 50%,” he continued. “If you live in California, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York you’re already well past that and this fair share is a bulls**t concept and it’s just a way of attacking wealthy people and you know, I think it’s inappropriate.

Plaintiffs Suing Harvard Over Race-Based Acceptances Asks Supreme Court To Intervene,"An anti-affirmative action group sued Harvard University over its admissions policies and asked the Supreme Court to use their case to overrule precedent, which, if successful, could end the use of race in college admissions, numerous sources reported.

Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), the challengers in the case, claim that Harvard favors certain minority students and unlawfully discriminates against Asian American applicants. The group, which includes Asian Americans who were denied admission, asked Thursday if the Supreme Court could ban the consideration of race in college admissions, and the court could decide in the spring whether to review the case with its new 6-3 conservative majority, according to the Associated Press (AP).

NEW: Supreme Court asked to outlaw race-based college admissions. Group challenging Harvard admissions policy says it files appeal asking court to over 2003 Grutter decision. pic.twitter.com/6JYSZ3KzF0 — Greg Stohr (@GregStohr) February 25, 2021

A lower court ruled in November in favor of Harvard, rejecting claims made by the challengers that Harvard’s admissions process stereotyped and imposed a “racial penalty” on Asian American applicants. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals determined that race was not “impermissibly extensive” and was “meaningful” because it “ensures that Harvard can retain the benefits of diversity it has already achieved.”

“After six and one-half years of litigation, the hundreds of Asian-American students who were unfairly and illegally rejected from Harvard because of their race may soon have this lawsuit reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court,” Edward Blum, SFFA’s president, said in a press release. “It is our hope that the justices will accept this case and finally end the consideration of race and ethnicity in college admissions.”

The litigation began in 2014, when SFFA sued Harvard over its alleged “racial balancing” that made it easier for blacks and Hispanics to gain admission to the school at the expense of Asian-American applicants.

The group argued that Harvard’s policy violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits racial discrimination by any program recieving federal funding, Reuters reported.

“Americans of all races overwhelmingly disapprove of using race as a factor in college admissions,” Blum said in the press release. “The nonpartisan Pew Research Center and others have found that 73% of Americans do not approve of colleges treating applicants differently by skin color or ethnic heritage.”

The Supreme Court first authorized the use of race in admissions in 1978, and justices including Anthony Kennedy and the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who are no longer on the bench, helped uphold affirmative action in subsequent cases. The last college admissions case the Supreme Court looked at was in 2016, when they upheld the University of Texas’ affirmative action program in a 4-3 decision.

Several years later, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court could end affirmative action, CNN reported.

The Supreme Court has ruled that colleges and universities that receive taxpayer funding may consider race in admissions as one of a number of factors. However, the Justice Department sued Yale University in 2020 over allegations that its consideration of race was not limited and the college used race at “multiple steps of its admissions process,” resulting in a “multiplied effect of race on an applicant’s likelihood of admission.” (RELATED: Justice Department Sues Yale Over Alleged Racial Discrimination Against Asian American And White Applicants)

The Department of Justice also filed a legal brief in 2018 in support of SFFA’s lawsuit against Harvard.

Weeks into the Biden administration, the Department of Justice dropped the lawsuit against Yale without citing a specific reason for the decision. The Biden administration is almost certain to take Harvard’s side at the Supreme Court, according to the AP.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/02/25/students-for-fair-admissions-harvard-lawsuit-supreme-court-ban-race-college-admissions/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiz4fXw_7P9AhWMSTABHdHYArc4ZBAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw28wBmEOxPrVqGv9WwcEllL,2021-02-25
Police Arrest Landlord Who Allegedly Drilled Holes In Walls To Watch Naked Tenants For Over A Decade,"Florida police arrested a landlord who allegedly drilled holes in walls to watch female tenants and stalk them, with allegations dating back for roughly a decade, numerous sources reported.

Steven Fair, 61, was arrested Wednesday and charged with three counts of voyeurism, one count of stalking, and six counts of burglary in an unoccupied dwelling, WPTV reported, based on the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office booking records.

Multiple former tenants of Fair accused him of video voyeurism and stalking. A 21-year-old woman told police Fair repeatedly made sexual comments to her, and once asked her if she would go with him to nude beaches. The woman also said he asked if he could “borrow her for 1K,” WPTV reported.

The woman had only spent about a month living in the apartment between August and September 2020 when Fair asked her to move out so a family member could move in, according to WPTV. After moving out, the woman said she began receiving phone calls and messages from a man who threatened to post nude videos of her online. The woman told police she had never given anyone permission to record her, according to CBS 12.

The woman said she recognized the man’s voice as her former landlord, and when she called March 12 to ask if the man was Fair, the man confirmed he was, according to WPTV. Fair allegedly told her what happened “was karma because she left the apartment the mess.”

He denied calling her, but reiterated the insults he made during the previous calls on the consent-controlled phone call in March. (RELATED: Attorney General Barr Directs US Attorneys To Prioritize Cases Of Landlords Demanding Sex From Tenants)

When the woman asked Fair if he recorded her, he refused to admit to anything but said “he got the last laugh,” according to CBS 12.

Another woman who had rented the apartment from Fair between January and May 2008 had filed a video voyeurism report in Feb. 2013, according to CBS 12. The woman’s report of what happened appeared similar to the other female tenant — she claimed soon after moving out, Fair called her several times and said he had videos of her in the shower.

The woman claimed Fair would also regularly text her and describe details about her body that he wouldn’t know unless he was watching her while she was naked, according to CBS 12.

Police executed a search warrant of Fair’s apartment Wednesday and found small drill holes in the wall of the bedroom and what appeared to be a face mask on the wall to look into the apartment, WPTV reported. They also found holes in a detached cottage where a woman was living after moving from an upstairs apartment in July 2020, saying she wanted more living space, according to WPTV. The cottage’s bedroom wall is attached to Fair’s garage.

During the search, Fair reportedly admitted to calling and harassing prior tenants. Sgt. David Lefont of the West Palm Beach Police Department told WPTV it’s possible there could be more victims.

“We know for certain that additional people rented from him. Whether they’re victims or not, we have to establish that.”

‘Fair Competition’: Tennessee Governor Signs Bill Requiring Student Athletes Compete Based On Biological Sex,"Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed a bill into law Friday requiring that transgender athletes only compete in school sports competitions that align with their biological sex.

Tennessee joins Mississippi and Arkansas as the third state in the nation to implement such a law, the Tennessean reported.

“I signed the bill to preserve women’s athletics and ensure fair competition,” Lee said on Twitter after the legislation’s signing. “This legislation responds to damaging federal policies that stand in opposition to the years of progress made under Title IX.” (RELATED: 14 States Considering Transgender Athlete Bills)

Bill Lee (@GovBillLee) March 26, 2021

The bill was passed on Mar 1. 2021 by Tennessee’s state Senate.

The law, not applicable to children in kindergarten through fourth grade, charges the Tennessee State Board of Education and local education boards with enforcing “polices to ensure compliance with this bill.”

According to the law, students competing in athletic competitions in Tennessee should provide proof of their sex at birth if not indicated on their birth certificate.

“Governor Lee’s rush to discriminate against transgender children is appalling. Transgender people have the right to participate in sports consistent with who they are, just like everyone else. Denying this right is pure discrimination,” the ACLU stated. “Should any student be excluded because of this shameful legislation, we will see him in court.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/03/27/tennessee-governor-bill-lee-signs-bill-transgender-student-athletes-biological-sex/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj014Hr_7P9AhXKMlkFHYXQA684ChAWegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw2iGJQJq-p4v0nhJCMVfvoK,2021-03-27

‘Get Us A Fair Contract’: Hundreds Of Alabama Coal Miners Protest Outside BlackRock Headquarters In New York City,"Hundreds of Alabama coal miners traveled by bus to New York City to demonstrate outside the headquarters of multinational investment management firm BlackRock, it was reported Wednesday.

The protest was organized by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), involving their union members from Alabama’s Warrior Met Coal who have been on strike against the company since April 1.

The protest reportedly drew over 1,000 people, including union members from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, as well as actress Susan Sarandon

“Do you hear that BlackRock? Get us a fair contract and we’ll go away. We’ll go back to work in those coal mines where we should be,” one of the speakers at the rally said. “We rode up here on buses to tell you your investments need to be put to use in these guy’s salaries, in these guy’s benefits, these guys that have earned you the profits that you’re making from these coal mines.”

The union members say they made concessions in pay, benefits, holidays, overtime and in other areas that totaled upwards of $1.1 billion after their previous employer Walter Energy filed for bankruptcy in 2016. Warrior Met Coal would end up purchasing the company’s assets. (RELATED: Concerned About BlackRock Pricing Out Home Buyers? Wait Until You Hear How Connected They Are To The Government)

“We’re in New York City because we are simply following the money, and demanding that those who created that wealth, the miners, get their fair share of it,” UNMA President Cecil E. Roberts said.

BlackRock has also drawn attention for buying up single-family houses all over the country, pricing middle-class buyers out of the housing market.

USA Swimming Official Quits Over UPenn Trans Athlete Lia Thomas: ‘Everything Fair … Is Being Destroyed’,"A USA Swimming official with three decades of experience in the sport recently resigned over swimmer Lia Thomas, a transgender student-athlete.

Cynthia Millen submitted her resignation letter Dec. 17.

“I told my fellow officials that I can no longer participate in a sport which allows biological men to compete against women. Everything fair about swimming is being destroyed,” she stated, as reported Friday by Swimming World.

“It’s placing women who can never compete with a man at a gross disadvantage by basically … calling this person a female competitor. He’s not. It’s his body that will always be different and always be faster as a competitive swimmer. And it’s this great illusion that somehow, because he feels he’s a female, that he can be a female swimmer,” Millen told Fox News. “This is grossly unfair to all the women who have worked so hard. Women biologically will never be faster than men.”

Thomas came out as transgender in 2019 after competing for three years on the men’s swim team at the University of Pennsylvania. Since joining the women’s team, Thomas has shattered multiple records, winning one meet with the closest competitor 38 seconds behind, according to the New York Post.

Sam Darnold Says The Pressure Put On Quarterbacks Is Fair Because They Earn So Much Money,"Sam Darnold has no problem with the pressure put on quarterbacks in the NFL.

The quarterback position is notoriously the most scrutinized position in all of sports, and if a QB has a few bad games, fans and the media will undoubtedly come for his neck. (RELATED: David Hookstead Is The True King In The North When It Comes To College Football)

Is the criticism and pressure far? During an interview on “Bussin’ with the Boys,” the Carolina Panthers quarterback was asked his thoughts and he said he has no problem in part with the pressure because the position is compensated so well.

You can watch him break it down below.

More or less, I think Darnold hit the nail on the head with his comments. Even though he admitted he was kind of joking about the cash, he’s not wrong.

Quarterbacks are paid outrageously well. If you’re a starting QB in the NFL and you are really good, you can easily earn north of $40 million a year.

When you’re making that kind of cash, you can deal with the pressure and expectations placed on your shoulders.

Now, do some people take it too far? Without a doubt. There are obviously jerks out there who take things too far, but overall, when you’re making QB cash, you better be able to handle the world you’re living in.

That’s just the way it is. If you can’t handle the heat, stay out of the kitchen.

POLL: Majority Of Voters View Biden’s Handling Of Immigration As ‘Poor’ Or ‘Fair’,"Voters are increasingly worried about illegal immigration and say it will affect their vote this upcoming election cycle, according to a new Rasmussen Reports poll released Thursday. A majority of people from the survey said they do not think Biden is doing a good job on the issue.

The poll found 52% of likely U.S. voters think illegal immigration is getting worse, while just 11% think it’s getting better, according to the poll. Sixty-seven percent said President Joe Biden’s handling of immigration was “fair” or “poor.”

The issue of immigration is set to affect voters in November, with 73% saying immigration would be an “important” topic in the elections, while 42% said it would be “very important.” When broken down amongst party lines, 85% of Republicans think the issue will play some role in the midterms, compared to 69% of Democrats and 90% of unaffiliated voters.

The poll was conducted between June 28-29 among 1,000 likely voters and has a +/- 3% margin of error. (RELATED: GRAPHIC: Illegal Migrant Trying To Run Away From Agents Gets Hit And Killed By Car)

The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Biden administration can stop the implementation of the Trump-era “Remain in Mexico” policy. The policy forced migrants to wait in Mexico as their asylum cases were being processed.

The border has seen an influx of migrants, with at least four human smugglers arrested earlier in the week after smuggling in dozens of illegal migrants in a tractor-trailer. Fifty-three of those migrants were found deceased.

MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough criticized progressives for their stance on immigration, saying the tragedies will continue to happen so long as the U.S. “keeps sending the message” that the nation does not “have laws.”

“There’s also nothing progressive about encouraging migrants to risk their lives going across the desert to come into the United States illegally,” Scarborough added.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/07/01/rasmussen-reports-poll-voters-illegal-immigration-border-biden-fair-poor/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiWuvXu_7P9AhXWkIkEHRYqC4E4RhAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw1lKsE3FUPMw2tSFSIBS6j2,2022-07-01

"EXCLUSIVE: ‘Free, Fair And Honest’: Former Trump Spokesperson Praises States’ New Election Laws","CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that all seven red states in favor of prohibiting “Zuckerbucks” moved from red to green on the new election map. It has since been corrected.

The America First Policy Institute’s Center for Election Integrity (CEI) praised seven states for recently passing election integrity laws in a new report.

Former Trump spokesperson and CEI director Hogan Gidley discussed the report with the Daily Caller News Foundation.

“People are always concerned with the outcomes of these elections because the faith, trust and confidence in the election process has been eroded for years in this country,” he told the DCNF.

Former Trump spokesperson Hogan Gidley praised seven states for protecting election integrity in an interview with the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Seven states are being praised by the America First Policy Institute’s (AFPI) Center For Election Integrity (CEI) in a new report for recent legislative efforts to prevent voter fraud. Hogan Gidley, director of the CEI, explained the importance of the report during an interview with the Daily Caller News Foundation.

“You want elections to be free, fair and honest – and people on the right and the left have been complaining about the outcomes of elections for decades in this country,” Gidley told the DCNF. “People are always concerned with the outcomes of these elections because the faith, trust and confidence in the election process has been eroded for years in this country.”

CEI developed a color-coded, interactive, online map to rate states across three key areas of voter protection measures that make it harder to cheat. They include requiring photo identification to vote, prohibiting ballot harvesting and returning ballots to election officials by Election Day.

“Eighty-five percent of people in this country want voters to prove they are who they say they are with a photo identification when they cast a ballot. Not voter identification. Photo identification,” said Gidley. “So voting with an electric bill or a water bill is unacceptable to most voters because they know, try to use an electric bill to get on a plane. You can’t do it.” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: House Administration Republicans Demand Answers From Fulton County Over Allegedly Shredded Ballot Applications)

The report singled out Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Utah. CEI said the states have adopted into law a variety of election integrity measures that “now better protect every single legally cast vote and every legal voter.”

“The U.S. Constitution gives the right and responsibility to the state legislatures to decide the time, manner and place of how they conduct elections,” Gidley said. “So what works in Montana may not work in Massachusetts, may not work in Mississippi, may not work in Maine.”

CEI also rates the states on whether they have banned private money from being illegally used to influence public elections – something commonly referred to as “Zuckerbucks.” That nickname references an estimated $420 million Mark Zuckerberg of Meta (Facebook) allegedly poured into the 2020 election.

Yellow colored states have some voter protection laws in place and green colored states have voter protection laws in place under the CEI key. There is an additional notation of black lines in some states that indicate where laws were on the books but were not followed in the 2020 election.

“The states that are marked as red are the states that really offer no voter protection whatsoever, no or very little voter protection whatsoever and I think that’s a problem not for the state itself but for the rest of the country too,” Gidley said.

CEI’s report highlighted a few states where governors vetoed significant election integrity measures passed by their legislature. For Example, Pennsylvania’s governor vetoed a bill promoting comprehensive election reform, including voting machine evaluation and auditing, mail in ballot regulation and increasing penalties for fraud.

‘It’s Just Not Fair’: Virginia Mom To Call On State Legislature After School Suspended Her Kids For Not Wearing Masks,"Fairfax County Public Schools suspended Stephanie Lundquist-Arora’s three sons for not wearing masks after they had received permission to do so.

“Isn’t it crazy that his future academic pursuits can be affected by conscientious civil disobedience when he’s 12-years-old over a piece of cloth on his face?” Lundquist-Arora told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

After a failed lawsuit and appeals, Lundquist-Arora plans to call on Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin for help wiping her sons’ records clean.

A Virginia mother is preparing to call on Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and the Virginia Board of Education to remove her sons’ out-of-school suspensions from their permanent record as it threatens their higher education chances, Stephanie Lundquist-Arora told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Lundquist-Arora’s three sons were suspended in January from Fairfax County Public School, in Fairfax, Virginia, for not wearing a mask which the school claimed was in violation of the school dress code, according to documents obtained by the DCNF. Lundquist-Arora has since filed a lawsuit against the school that was dismissed and then submitted two appeals to the school, one which was denied and the other that is pending, Lundquist-Arora told the DCNF. (RELATED: Oregon Library Asks For Chest Binder Donations For Gender Affirming Closet)

“I’m going to use all of the resources I have. I’m going to try to ask the Youngkin administration to help me out, maybe the Virginia Board of Education,” Linquist-Arora told the DCNF. “Legally, I’ll have to see what kind of legal avenues there are in order to have their records expunged. It’s just not fair.”

Youngkin issued an executive order in January that omitted students from the mask mandate if they had parental approval, however Lundquist-Arora’s three sons were suspended for not wearing a mask because it was a level-three infraction to the school dress code, documents obtained by the DCNF showed. Judge Louise DiMateo put the executive order on hold, requiring masks in schools again, but it was after Lundquist-Arora’s sons had been suspended.

Lundquist-Arora’s February lawsuit was dismissed, so she filed two appeals of the suspensions, one to Irving middle school and the other to Hunt Valley Elementary school, she told the DCNF. Irving Middle School Principal Cindy Conley denied the appeal leaving the suspension on her 11 and 13 year olds’ permanent transcript.

The appeal to Hunt Valley Elementary School is still pending, Lundquist-Arora told the DCNF.

Lundquist-Arora’s oldest son is 13-years-old and next year plans to apply to the Thomas Jefferson High School For Science And Technology, a magnet charter school that focuses on math, science and technology, Lundquist-Arora told the DCNF. The suspension, she worries, will hurt his chances at furthering his education.

“I try to shield them from it a lot,” Lundquist-Arora told the DCNF. “They know that I’m upset about it, but I think they believe that I’m very committed to seeing the records expunged, and I think because they believe that I can do that, they don’t worry too much about it. I am careful to not put the fear into their hearts like ‘oh, you might not get into college because of this.’ That’s not a conversation I’m gonna have with them yet.”

“Isn’t it crazy that his future academic pursuits can be affected by conscientious civil disobedience when he’s 12 years old over a piece of cloth on his face?” she said.

A teacher training titled “Supporting Gender-Expansive and Transgender Youth” at Fairfax County Public School was discovered in July and taught teachers to hide students’ changes in gender identity from their parents.

“The biggest problem is that the top administrators and school board members focus is not on academics, it’s on politics. And that’s the way that all of this is related,” Lundquist-Arora told the DCNF.

Fairfax County Public Schools and Conley did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

‘Tucker’s Doing Great Right Now’: Rachel Maddow Expresses Praise For Tucker Carlson,"MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow praised Fox News host and Daily Caller co-founder Tucker Carlson during an interview with Vanity Fair published Sunday.

“Tucker’s doing great right now,” Maddow said in the interview.

Maddow, who recently scaled back her nightly hosting position on MSNBC to now once-a-week, got her first paid position back in 2005 when she started appearing on “Tucker” as a panelist, according to Vanity Fair.

“The first show I worked on was his 11 o’clock show on MSNBC that nobody remembers,” Maddow told the outlet. “But he was always kicking around the business and has always been talented. It just – this turned out to be his moment.”

The pair have remained amicable, with Carlson speaking highly of Maddow in a 2019 New York Times Magazine profile, according to Vanity Fair. Maddow added that “it was really nice to see him” after she ran into him at an event, the outlet reported.

Maddow also told Vanity Fair that she views Carlson and other competitors the same way an athlete would view rivals. (RELATED: ‘He Is Not Faking It’: Rachel Maddow Defends Former Colleague Tucker Carlson)

“If you think about baseball players, who are extremely competitive and who are fighting to win and who have rivalries, and some of those rivalries are bitter rivalries, that doesn’t mean you don’t study the pitching technique of their star pitcher,” Maddow said. “It doesn’t mean you don’t appreciate whatever they’re doing in terms of, you know, where they put their shortstop in order to give them a better defense. There’s a sort of, like, respecting the game, in terms of people who are doing well and people who are good at it.”

Maddow has previously praised Carlson, telling Salon in 2013 that she wished Carlson “the best” as he prepared to leave MSNBC for “Fox & Friends.”

“Tucker and I agree on just about nothing, but he has always been kind to me, and a fun person to fight with. I wish him all the best.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/08/08/rachel-maddow-tucker-carlson-vanity-fair/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjTzcrv_7P9AhW5FlkFHRzZAKs4UBAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw3bH6ZkPU_vZ7wi2eoGdUEN,2022-08-08
"Democrat Demanding The Rich ‘Pay Their Fair Share’ Paid His Own Taxes Months Late, Records Show","Democratic Nevada Rep. Steven Horsford, who has demanded wealthy people pay more in taxes, was fined after not paying thousands in property taxes on time in connection to his million dollar home, state records show.

Horsford said in an April press conference that the “current federal tax code is rigged for the wealthy against the worker,” noting, “It’s only fair that the wealthy pay their fair share.” However, Horsford did not pay more than $13,800 combined in taxes in a timely manner on his residence in Arlington, Virginia, owed during a two year period, according to public tax records reviewed by the Daily Caller News Foundation. (Democrats Plan To Shell Out Almost $80 Billion To Supersize The IRS)

Horsford, who as a member of Congress earns a salary of $174,000 per year and assumed office in 2019, was hit with over $2,500 in penalties, interest and fines between 2015 and 2016 for the late payments, records show. The home is valued at over $1.5 million and was purchased in September 2015, according to public records.

“First, when Mr. Horsford purchased this property, he was not in Congress,” a spokesman for Horsford told the DCNF. “Second, the property taxes were paid after a mortgage processing error was identified. Third, Congressman Horsford pays his taxes and continues to advocate for policies that level the playing field and will make sure the richest 1% pay theirs.”

Horsford’s office did not provide corresponding documents verifying whether or not there was a mortgage processing error. The Arlington County Treasurer’s office confirmed to the DCNF the taxes were paid late.

Horsford paid a first installment on his 2015 taxes roughly five months late, on April 22, 2016, and a second installment six months late, on June 28, 2016, according to the treasurer’s office.

The congressman paid a first installment on his 2016 taxes roughly four months late, on Oct. 18, 2016, according to the treasurers office. He then paid a second installment on Nov. 1, 2016, roughly one month late.

Horsford notably voted in favor of the Democrat-led Build Back Better Act in November 2021, which did not pass and would have raised taxes for Americans of all income levels, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.

Horsford has also supported the Democrat-led $740 billion “Inflation Reduction Act” spending package — which cleared the Senate Sunday and heads to the House for a vote after recess ends on Aug. 12.

The bill will raise taxes from 20.3% to 20.6% in 2023, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, and by $10.8 billion in 2023 for people who earn between $100,000 and $200,000.

“While ordinary Nevadans have faced economic hardship due to the pandemic, billionaires have profited tremendously,” Horsford also said in April. “We must ensure the wealthiest pay their fair share and bring benefits for all Nevadans.”

‘Is That Fair?’: Dem Sen. Chris Murphy Spars With CNN Host After Claiming ‘Chaos’ At Border Is GOP’s Fault,"Democratic Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said Tuesday on CNN that there will be “chaos” at the border in the New Year because of Republicans.

The United States Supreme Court on Monday temporarily halted the end of Title 42 after 19 Republican states filed an emergency appeal. Title 42 is a Trump-era policy that allows authorities to expel certain migrants back to their native countries without legal review in order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

CNN’s Jim Sciutto asked Murphy whether Democrats, who have controlled Congress for two years, bear any responsibility for “failing to enact reforms that would have helped address the situation at the southern border?”

“I think all 50 Democrats in the Senate support immigration reform as you mentioned. The problem is we do not have enough Republicans to get it done,” Murphy said, referring to a bipartisan immigration reform package introduced by now-Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Sen. Thom Tillis.

The proposal was rejected for several reasons, including opposition to its proposed pathway to permanent legal status as well as Republicans’ demand to curb releases of migrants, according to CBS News.

“We need a handful of Republicans to support immigration reform, and they won’t. Now, the budget includes some money to manage these increased numbers at the border, but it is much less than what the administration needs,” Murphy said. “Why is that? Because not only do Republicans oppose immigration reform, they also are opposing the money necessary to deal with the emergency.”

“So you’re just going to see scenes of chaos at the border in January and February and that is going to be in large part because Republicans aren’t allowing us enough funding to deal with these increased numbers,” he added.

Sciutto again pushed back. “But is that fair?” he asked. “You got the president. The president has things that he could do independently of broader reform which — trust me, I know, and I’ve covered it for years — it is just tough to get it through the Hill. Shared responsibility, is there not?” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: ‘Unacceptable’: Texas GOP Rep Demands Mayorkas Answer To Data ‘Miscalculations’ After DCNF Reports)

Murphy said President Joe Biden has no choice but to allow migrants to present asylum claims at the border and that Trump “went above is statutory authority in denying many people the ability to make that claim,” in reference to Title 42. Murphy also said that Congress has the responsibility to change the law, not Biden.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/12/20/chris-murphy-chaos-border-republicans-jim-sciutto-cnn/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiEwfns_7P9AhUEEFkFHTcnB2E4KBAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw3hLDHhkp5xLO0M8pZFnk2T,2022-12-20
64-Year-Old Madonna Apparently Doesn’t Realize Blasphemy Stopped Being Edgy 20 Years Ago,"Madonna’s entire career has been built on a foundation of edgy, risk-taking content, but the 64-year-old icon may have taken things too far with her recent photoshoot for Vanity Fair.

She posed for the “icon issue” of the publication, which acts as a collaboration between the Italian, Spanish, and French editions of the monthly magazine. Madonna displayed images that many are describing as “offensive,” demonic,” and “blasphemous,” with fans pointing the finger at the singer for not knowing the difference between what’s edgy and what’s downright inappropriate in modern-day pop culture.

Madonna has long been known to blur the lines between cultural norms and freedom of expression, but her latest promotional adventure has left fans wondering if she has forgotten to read the room in her older years.

The photoshoot includes Madonna dressed in a costumed outfit that resembles the Last Supper, and fans trying to give the star an “out” by saying this may not be what she was trying to project will have a hard time explaining away the 12 apostles that surround her.

Madonna sparked outrage with her likeness of the Virgin Mary on the cover of the special issue in what can only be described as a tone-deaf marketing campaign to generate attention to her upcoming new tour.

There has been a mixture of praise for her creative expressions, but the online complaints accusing the singer of mocking Jesus far surpass any compliments being thrown her way.

“This is a good time for me — I’m gathering ideas, getting inspired, hanging out with creative people, watching films, seeing art, listening to music,” Madonna said in her interview with the magazine, according to Geo TV.

‘Fair And Safe Competition’: How One Legal Group Is Leading The Charge To Protect Women’s Sports,"Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) is currently juggling several legal cases intended to prohibit biological male athletes from competing in female sports.

ADF intervened to defend several laws in states across the country to protect women’s sports that are being challenged in court.

“I am incredibly proud of our clients and their willingness to be a voice, not just to protect and defend themselves, but to defend future generations of female athletes, as well,” ADF senior counsel Christiana Kiefer told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

A legal organization is gearing up to defend female athletes across the country as the debate over whether to allow transgender participation in women’s sports steamrolls ahead.

Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) is currently juggling several legal cases defending female athletes who have personally competed against men who identify as women, ADF senior counsel Christiana Kiefer told the Daily Caller News Foundation. Each case intends to prohibit biological men from being allowed to compete in female-only divisions and defend those athletes who have lost opportunities because of policies which permit athletes to compete as the opposite gender. (RELATED: Several Female Athletes Support GOP Ban On Men In Women’s Sports)

“The end goal is to, first and foremost, protect the integrity of women’s sports and ensure that girls like our clients have fair and safe competition,” Kiefer said.

In 2020, ADF filed in Connecticut the first federal lawsuit to defend female athletes under Title IX, Kiefer explained. The plaintiffs, four female athletes, allegedly lost track & field opportunities because two males were permitted to compete in the girls’ division.

“In the state of Connecticut, those two males athletes won, over the course of their high school career, 15 women state championship titles, which I think just really underscores how devastating it was for young women across the state of Connecticut to be forced to compete against, bigger, faster and stronger male athletes,” Kiefer explained.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit ruled in December that the athletes’ complaint lacked standing since they competed in high school championship meets. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which defends the male athletes, called the plaintiffs’ complaints “zero-sum arguments” and called the decision a “victory for fairness, equality, and inclusion,” according to its press release.

Kiefer told the DCNF the case is “currently pending” and that the law inspired lawmakers across the country to begin enacting laws to prohibit men and boys from competing as women and girls. To date, 18 states have laws on the books to designate athletic competition must be segregated by sex — and ADF has defended laws in three of the states in court.

The ACLU filed a federal lawsuit against Idaho in 2020 after it became the first state to adopt a law to protect women’s sports, to which ADF intervened “on behalf of two collegiate runners, both of whom have also competed against and lost to a male athlete in their track and cross country competition,” Kiefer told the DCNF. The case, Hecox v. Little, is “also currently ongoing and is up at the ninth circuit on appeal,” she said.

ADF also intervened after the ACLU filed a lawsuit challenging West Virginia’s women’s sports law. The federal court ruled in January the law was “both constitutional and consistent with Title IX,” Kiefer said, and permitted the law to stand.

The ACLU appealed the decision and B.P.J. v. West Virginia State Board of Education will face the fourth circuit “shortly,” according to Kiefer. ADF also requested to intervene on behalf of female athlete and Florida college student Selina Soule to defend the state’s women’s sports law, however the case is currently “at the very early stages.”

“It’s important for our laws and policies to recognize that there are real, physical differences between the sexes, and when we try to erase those differences and ignore them, in certain context like sports, privacy, women’s shelters and domestic abuse safe houses, women and girls are the ones who lose the most,” Kiefer told the DCNF.

The concern over male athletes competing in women’s sports gained traction during the 2021-2022 academic year when University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas won a women’s national championship after having previously competed on the men’s team. While a majority of Americans reportedly oppose men competing in women’s sports, Kiefer said that one of the biggest challenges is getting female athletes to speak out.

“It’s a really scary thing to put yourself out there and to risk being labeled all sorts of hateful names, to be attacked on social media,” Kiefer said. “I am incredibly proud of our clients and their willingness to be a voice, not just to protect and defend themselves, but to defend future generations of female athletes, as well.”

The ACLU did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

"Teen Fatally Shot At Florida County Fair, Police Search For Subjects Seen In Smartphone Video: Reports","Police in Arcadia, Florida, are investigating three people seen in a smartphone video in connection with the fatal Saturday shooting of 17-year-old Daniel Rodriguez Lopez at the DeSoto County Fair, according to multiple reports.

Fair attendees in the rural Florida county known for its rodeos fled Saturday night after a gunman shot the teenager in the chest, according to NBC2. The Arcadia Police Department released a statement asking for the public’s help in identifying three subjects who may have information about the incident, the outlet reported. The department is also reportedly working to determine a shooter at the time of writing.

“A young Hispanic female wearing a black jacket and light jeans, male subject wearing a light shirt and shorts, and an adult male standing in the back that appears to have a beard. These subjects may have valuable information and need to be spoken to,” a statement from the Arcadia Police Department posted Sunday on Facebook reads.

While police did not believe the gunman posed a greater threat to the area, the fair closed midway through Sunday and solely held a livestock grooming contest and a Jr. Miss DeSoto County Pageant, according to CBS News. Both events reportedly restricted viewership to contestants, exhibitors and family members.

“The victim and the suspect knew each other. There has been a rift between the two for quite some time, and it wasn’t a random act of violence,” Arcadia Lt. Troy Carrillo told NBC2.

Rodriguez-Lopez is survived by his three sisters, his father and his mother, the outlet reported, citing family friend Ashely Beck.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/06/desoto-county-fair-shooting-teen-florida/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj014Hr_7P9AhXKMlkFHYXQA684ChAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw2-P2OxG3wmBdYf9gUzUASO,2023-02-06
