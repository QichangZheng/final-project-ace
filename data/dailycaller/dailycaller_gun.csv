"Democratic aide brings gun into courthouse, receives ticket","An aide to Michigan Democratic Rep. John Conyers got off with a warning after illegally bringing a gun into a public building.

Security officers at a federal building in downtown Detroit found a gun in the purse of Betty Petrenz, Conyers’ office manager. Bringing weapons into government buildings is strictly forbidden, but Petrenz received no sentence or formal punishment. Just a ticket, which will be stricken from her record if she demonstrates good behavior.

Conyers is a strong advocate of stronger gun control laws whose votes have earned him an “F” grade from the National Rifle Association.

The lenient punishment is in stark contrast with the fates of three other people who broke the law, and were either fired, forced to resign, or criminally charged, according to The Detroit Free Press.

Petrenz is fortunate that she isn’t a kindergartner on her way to school. Kids who were discovered carrying toy guns on buses have faced steep punishments, including expulsion.

“Children are literally suspended from school for bringing gun-shaped pop tarts to school, yet this Democratic clerk gets off scott-free,” read a post at the conservative site Rare.

Chewing a pop tart into the shape of a gun earned eight-year-old Joshua Welch a suspension.

A North Carolina high school student and Eagle Scout was arrested and suspended after accidentally parking on campus with a gun in his car. And wearing a t-shirt with a National Rifle Association logo was enough to get Jared Marcum, a West Virginian eighth-grader, suspended and arrested.

Conyers’ staffer is not alone among anti-gun political figures who have gotten in trouble for bringing weapons into ostensibly gun-free zones. Last year, Illinois state Sen. Donne Trotter was charged with a felony when he tried to bring a loaded handgun onto a flight from Chicago’s O’Hare airport to Washington, D.C. Trotter’s case was reduced to a misdemeanor reckless conduct charge, to which he pleaded guilty in April and was sentenced to a year of court supervision. His state Senate job was unaffected by the incident.

SHOCK AUDIO: Katie Couric Edited Gun Documentary To Silence Pro-Gun Opinions,"Newly surface audio revealed that a Katie Couric-hosted documentary, called “Under the Gun,” intentionally edited video to make pro-gun Americans appear dumbfounded.

That audio, obtained by The Washington Free Beacon, shows that the movie was edited in an overwhelmingly deceptive fashion. (SLIDESHOW: Celebrate The Second Amendment With These Gorgeous Gun-Loving Women)

In the clip, Couric asks a group of pro-gun individuals from the Virginia Citizens Defense League, “If there are no background checks for gun purchasers, how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a gun?”

WATCH:

In the film, the pro-gun group appears to be stunned into silence, with no apparent answer to the question.

But a separate audio recording of the conversation reveals that the group responded quickly, and hit Couric back with nearly 4 minutes of thoughts on the subject.

Virginia Citizens Defense League president Philip Van Cleave told The Washington Free Beacon, “Katie Couric asked a key question during an interview of some members of our organization. She then intentionally removed their answers and spliced in nine seconds of some prior video of our members sitting quietly and not responding. Viewers are left with the misunderstanding that the members had no answer to her question.”

The film was released May 13, and has not received been received well, according to its IMDB score of barely over a six.

"Scalia takes Kagan to gun range, sources say","According to two witnesses, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia took fellow Justice Elena Kagan out for a lesson in skeet shooting at his shooting club in Virginia last week.

The witnesses saw Scalia at the Fairfax Rod and Gun Club, where he is a member, around noon on Wednesday of last week. He was with a woman who was noticeably diminutive in height, like Kagan, who stands at about five feet three inches. The witnesses, who got a very close look at the pair, say that the woman was the newest Supreme Court Justice.

Scalia was bending down in order to teach Kagan how to hold the shotgun, the witnesses say, and the pair were shooting skeet.

Kagan, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Obama in May and confirmed by the Senate in August, is generally believed to hold negative opinions toward the Second Amendment. The perception is based on a memo she penned in the eighties as Justice Thurgood Marshall’s law clerk, in which she said she was “not sympathetic” to the Second Amendment argument in a case that dealt with the District of Columbia’s gun laws. Also, during her time as a member of the Clinton administration, she played a role in instituting a temporary suspension of licenses for the importation of assault rifles. Kagan did not comment on the issue of gun rights during her confirmation hearings.

The Fairfax Rod and Gun Club would not comment on the matter. The Supreme Court of the United States did not respond to request for a comment.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2010/10/25/scalia-takes-kagan-to-gun-range-sources-say/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwin1tqe_7P9AhXoTTABHbYrBok4ZBAWegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw2GiQyT3pw1c8eEpWDFvgCg,2010-10-25
"Gun crime continues to decrease, despite increase in gun sales","Despite increases in gun sales, gun crimes continued to decrease in the United States for the fourth straight year in 2010, according to the FBI.

The FBI recently released its Crime in The United States statistics for 2010. Overall, murders in the U.S. have decreased steadily since 2006, dropping from 15,087 to 12,996. Firearms murders — which made up 67 percent of all murders in the U.S. in 2010 — have followed this trend, decreasing by 14 percent.

At the same time that firearms murders were dropping, gun sales were surging. In 2009, FBI background checks for guns increased by 30 percent over the previous year, while firearms sales in large retail outlets increased by almost 40 percent. The number of applications for concealed carry permits jumped across the country as well.

“There was a huge spike,” NRA spokesperson Rachel Parsons said. “It’s probably mellowed out and gone back to normal now.”

There is no national registry of guns, but based on sales-tracking and other figures, the National Rifle Association estimates there are 80 to 90 million gun owners in the U.S.

Naturally, there is dispute over the significance of the surge in gun sales. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, for instance, says gun ownership in America is actually declining.

“While there are more people with concealed carry permits and there has been an increase in gun sales, the research indicates overwhelmingly that the same people are simply buying more guns and that there has been a sharp decline in the percentage of Americans who own guns,” Brady Campaign spokesperson Caroline Brewer said. “So while there may be more guns, they are in the hands of a smaller percentage of Americans.”

Pro-Second Amendment advocacy groups have used the decrease in gun crime, and crime in general, as a counter to gun control advocates’ claims that more firearms lead to more gun violence. They also point to the statistics as evidence of the ineffectiveness of gun control laws. (RELATED: Widow of ‘Whitey’ Bulger victim suggests foul play in payment of $2.1 million FBI reward)

The top three states for gun murders in 2010 were, in order, California, Texas and New York. While Texas has lax gun control laws, California and New York are among the strictest gun-control states in the country.

“California is in a category of its own as far as gun control laws there,” Parsons said. “New York is a little bit better, but they still have discretionary concealed carry laws.”

According to FBI data, California had the most gun murders last year —- 1,257, which is 69 percent of all murders in 2010.

Nevertheless, California gun murders are still down by 8 percent from the previous year.

Broken down by firearms murder rate per 100,000 people, the District of Columbia is number one, with 16 firearms murders per 100,000 people in the District.

D.C. also topped the list of firearm robberies per 100,000 people with 255.98.

Yet D.C. arguably has the tightest gun laws in the country. Although an outright ban on handguns was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2008, legislators ensured the new regulations for obtaining a registered handgun would be anything but easy.

Like California, the number of firearms murders in D.C. — 99 in 2010 — dropped by 12 percent from the previous year.

However, the Brady Campaign argues cities with high rates of gun crime, yet strict gun laws, suffer from being next to states with more lax gun control.

“You’ve got states with weaker laws right at the border and have populations that are constantly coming in and out,” Brewer said. “Chicago is right next to Indiana, which has almost no gun laws.”

Likewise, Washington, D.C. is sandwiched between Maryland and Virginia.

The Brady Campaign also points to the Brady Law, which was enacted in 1993 and requires background checks for firearms purchases, as a reducer of gun crime.

Assigning causes to increases or decreases in the national crime rate is a notorious fool’s errand because of the amount of variables at play, but what the numbers don’t suggest is any clear correlation between gun crime, gun ownership and gun-control laws.

It bears noting that the FBI’s data, based on reports from local law enforcement, is far from comprehensive. There are no numbers for Florida on firearm murders, and the data for Illinois is “incomplete.”

The FBI also warns against using the data to rank areas against each other, noting that rankings “are merely a quick choice made by the data user; they provide no insight into the many variables that mold the crime in a particular town, city, county, state, region or other jurisdiction.”

“Consequently, these rankings lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting cities and counties, along with their residents,” the FBI continued.

Gun Review: Kimber Stainless Target II,"Kimber’s Stainless Target II is a full-size, production 1911 with many custom-like features and precision tolerances that set it apart from the run-of-mill version of this old warhorse.

Kimber’s Stainless Target II is a full-size, production 1911 with many custom-like features and precision tolerances that set it apart from the run-of-mill version of this old warhorse. The heart of package resides in its 5-inch, 1:16 left-hand twist, match-grade barrel, which is designed for one purpose: to perform. Kimber’s match-grade barrels are made from a single piece of solid steel and are renowned for their accuracy and longevity. Additionally, it has match-grade stainless steel barrel bushings, an aluminum match-grade trigger group, kidney-cut frame, a full-length, one-piece guide rod and Commander-style hammer, all of which enhance operation and accuracy. Adding to the overall look and functionality of the pistol is the machined stainless steel slide with beveled-front and rear-slide serrations. The serrations not only look good, they add purchase when racking the slide. Further adding to the gun’s nice appearance is the machined stainless frame, accented by black synthetic grips with a molded-in checkering pattern, which provides a comfortable grip surface and extra purchase. The lower half of backstrap has fine checkering to aid grip, but with the mild .38 Super round, it’s not really necessary. A lowered and flared ejection port is added to guarantee positive ejection, which helps ensure reliability under all circumstances.

The Stainless Target II has the two standard safeties: a high-ride beavertail grip safety and extended thumb safety. Since I am used to polymer pistols—I carry a Springfield Armory XD—the extended thumb safety was different than what I was used to, but the Stainless Target II’s grip safety made me feel right at home. Transitioning from polymers to this 1911 is relatively easy.

Full capacity for the Stainless Target II in .38 Super is 9+1. To facilitate quick reloads, the magazine well is beveled. This is vital, in a life-or-death situation or at a competition, as quick reloads can alter the outcome. The rear sight is Kimber’s micro-adjustable, while the front sight is a standard post. Both are solid black and dovetailed into the slide. The Target II’s height measured 90 degrees to the barrel is 5.25 inches, its frame is 1.28 inches wide and its overall length is 8.7 inches. With an empty magazine in place, the Stainless Target II weighs in at a moderate 38 ounces.

The Stainless Target II is available in four calibers: .45 ACP, .38 Super, 9 mm and 10 mm, with the latter two being 2005 introductions. The availability of this 1911 in a cartridge other than .45 ACP is a plus, which allows more shooters to select a cartridge to better match their recoil tolerance or intended use. My test pistol was chambered in .38 Super. I chose this cartridge for several specific reasons, including its relative obscurity in the handgun world (except on the IPSC competition scene), superior ballistic performance over most 1911 cartridge offerings and quite simply, a general interest.

To test the Stainless Target II’s performance, I selected three types of ammunition: two full metal jackets and one hollow point. Five, five-shot groups were shot from a sandbagged rest at 25 yards with each ammunition. The most accurate was Winchester’s .38 Super +P, 130-grain full metal jacket, which averaged 2.9 inches. On several occasions a single flyer spoiled what would have been some pretty amazing groups. This could have resulted from a couple of inconsistent cartridges. Also, I found the 4-pound, 13-ounce trigger weight was a tad too heavy for target shooting, but suppose it could be valued as an asset for a shooter blazing through a course. The trigger broke crisply, without any discernible creep or overtravel.

After I finished shooting the Kimber for groups, the real fun began. I fully loaded three magazines—Kimbers come with one—with several cartridges from each of the ammo types and proceeded through some rapid-fire sessions. The pistol emptied each magazine exceptionally fast without a hiccup, regardless of the ammunition mixture it was fed. Not once did the Target II fail to feed or fire, which demonstrates the reliability of the 1911 design. The moderate recoil of the .38 Super cartridge allowed for lightning-fast follow-up shots, as the sight picture retuned to the target very quickly after each trigger pull. Best of all, even shooting at rapid pace, the majority of rounds hit center of mass.

While testing the Kimber, I did made several observations. The gun’s 38-ounce weight coupled with the .38 Super cartridge seemed to minimize recoil and muzzle flip, making it more comfortable than a .45 ACP for recoil-shy or smaller shooters, as well as reduced time to get back on target after each shot. The black synthetic grips not only add an appealing contrast to the Target II’s stainless frame and slide, they are very functional. They provide excellent purchase, even if your hands are moist, and seemed to help cushion recoil. As for the sights, I found the adjustable rear and post front sights a bit too large for shooting at farther distances. A thinner sight or a three-dot version might be a better choice. When approaching 25 yards, the factory sights seem to overpower the target and cover a large part of it. I believe smaller sights would be better, and fortunately, Kimber offers other sight options.

Chambered for the .38 Super cartridge, this Kimber is ready to assume many roles. First, the .38 Super has a flat trajectory and sufficient velocity and energy to hunt small game at reasonable distances. The only problem with this resides in the poor selection of factory ammunition suitable for hunting, as there are few offerings with hollow points. This dilemma can be overcome by reloading any of the numerous .355-inch hollow point bullets suitable for the 9 mm. For competition, the .38 Super is hard to beat, for many of the same reasons that makes it a good hunting pistol. Flat trajectory, moderate recoil and high velocity make the round ideal for competitions where legal. The target shooter can find several ammunition brands that make target ammo, as target shooting is what most .38 Supers are used for. As a self-defense pistol, the .38 Super is an excellent cartridge. Once again, the problem resides with bullet selection. But, with the right hollow-point bullet, the .38 Super offers several advantages over more popular self-defense rounds, namely high energy, which helps stop confrontations quickly.

Kimber has a long-standing and well-deserved reputation for producing high-quality 1911s. It has taken the proven 1911 platform, coupled it with a potent cartridge, and added many features that make the Stainless Target II far superior to the original from which it was designed. Handgun shooters and hunters ought to take a second look at this handgun. I have.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2011/11/16/gun-review-kimber-stainless-target-ii/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjXv_ib_7P9AhXkFlkFHUDaBH04PBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw0EqKBDDpLlPg7aG9pnS7lv,2011-11-16
Gun Review: Beretta Px4 Storm Subcompact,"Beretta’s Px4 Storm subcompact offers a new look from an old gun company.

In the world of handguns, Beretta is best known as the carry gun of Martin Riggs in “Lethal Weapon” and for replacing the M1911A1 as the U.S. military’s service pistol. However, Beretta also produces many handgun models for a variety of purposes including concealed carry. One of Beretta’s more recent offerings is the Px4 Storm series of semi-auto handguns.

With its covered barrel and polymer frame, the Px4 Storm doesn’t resemble a Beretta at first look. But a closer examination shows some similarities. The Storm’s controls mimic those of the 92FS, which should make transitioning to the Storm quite easy for those familiar with military’s standard issue pistol or its civilian counterpart.

The Storm is available in three calibers and four models, from a Special Duty model designed around the needs of Special Forces operators to a subcompact in 9 mm or .40 S&W that is easily hidden for concealed carry. The models are similar in appearance, but while the full-size and compact models feature a new proprietary rotating barrel breech to provide lockup, the subcompact uses the more standard delayed locking system familiar to most pistol shooters.

The polymer frame on the Px4 Storm subcompact is dull black with aggressive checkering on both the front and back straps, as well as recesses on both sides for lining up the trigger finger outside the guard. The grip feels good for a handgun of its size, and with its replaceable backstraps, the Storm can be adapted to fit most hands quite well.

Beretta even took an interesting approach to overcome the length-of-grip problem of most subcompact pistols, which requires shooters to loop the pinky finger under the magazine. One of the two 13-round magazines included with the Storm has a spring-operated lever—Beretta calls this the “GripSnap”—on the front at the bottom that drops down about 1/3 of an inch to provide additional length. The GripSnap works seamlessly, releasing as the hand tightens around the handle.

The black metal slide has serrations along the front and rear, and controls that are well known to Beretta users: The slide release is located on the left side just above where the thumb rests, and an ambidextrous safety is located below the rear sights. Both the front and rear sights are dovetailed and feature white dots for visibility in low-light situations. The Storm subcompact also has a small accessory rail for attaching lights or lasers. While this is probably unnecessary for a handgun with its purpose, having this option is good for those wanting only one gun for both concealed carry and home defense.

Breakdown is just as simple as with the 92FS, and very similar. After ensuring the gun is unloaded, simply lock back the slide and rotate the takedown lever, pulling it away from the frame until you hear it click. (Beretta recommends never fully removing the takedown lever, but I didn’t have any problems when I pulled it too far.) Then, release the slide lock and pull the slide forward off of the gun. Remove the recoil spring assembly and tilt the barrel using the cam lug to pull the barrel away from the slide. Reassembly is performed in reverse order.

While the 3-inch, stainless-steel barrel is short, accuracy was above average for self-defense, with groups averaging 3 to 4 inches when shooting five consecutive, five-shot groups at 25 yards from a rest using both Winchester PDX1 124-grain loads and Federal American Eagle 115-grain full metal jacket loads. Overall, the heavier self-defense loads performed a little better, which is good since this gun is all about self-defense.

In addition to accuracy testing at 25 yards, I shot the Px4 Storm subcompact at a variety of ranges and scenarios to truly determine the gun’s real-world accuracy and use. At self-defense range, the accuracy was adequate with groups averaging around the size of a half dollar, but when I stepped back to shoot at 25 yards standing, the holes spread out significantly, though all rounds stayed in the 10-ring. During controlled pairs and two-shot hammer drills, rounds landed in center-of-mass even though the double-action trigger pull decreased the accuracy of the first shot. But firing sequential rounds in single-action put bullets right in the sweet spot even in rapid strings. In both double- and single-action, the trigger had some play before it engaged, with almost an 1/8-inch movement in the trigger during single-action engagement.

Even though the trigger was only adequate with a 12-pound double-action pull and a 5-pound single-action pull, and significant play, the GripSnap made a real difference in both handling and felt recoil, making the Storm subcompact a real joy to shoot. It took a small squeeze of the handle to get the GripSnap to drop into place, but once down, it provided ample room for my whole hand to fit, though shooters with exceptionally large hands will still have issues.

I really liked carrying and training with the Storm subcompact. It’s light enough for all-day carry, small enough to easily conceal and powerful enough in either 9 mm or .40 S&W for confidence. I also liked carrying a handgun that was made in Beretta’s Maryland plant, though the other models are made overseas. The Beretta Px4 Storm subcompact shows that “Made in America” still means something in the gun world.

Gun Review: Ruger Model 77 in .357,"By Payton Miller, Guns & Ammo

The .357 Magnum has been used in rifles ever since guys started rechambering shot-out Model 92 Winchesters way back when. Up to now it’s been pretty much of a lever-action thing. But with the recent introduction of Ruger’s M77 .357, we now have an 18.5-inch barreled, stainless/synthetic-stocked bolt action that incorporates two of the company’s signature innovations.

Specifically, the integral base/ring scope mounting system and the bombproof detachable rotary magazine (a five-round unit in this case). All this comes in a very handy 5.5-pound package.

Ruger, of course, isn’t new to the pistol cartridge/bolt-action carbine concept. But in terms of versatility and potential ammo diet, this one’s something else. After all, we’re talking about a range of bullet weights in varying configurations from (roughly) 90 to 200 grains over a (more or less) 1,000 fps velocity span.

When you stop to consider that the increase in some of the more energetic .357 commercial loadings is on the order of several hundred fps, it isn’t a stretch to note that the M77 .357, for all practical purposes, boosts magnum loadings to approach the performance of the almost-defunct .357 Maximum (from a 14-inch pressure barrel, no less).

It actually pushed Winchester’s classic .38 Special 158-grain LHP Plus-P into low-end .357 Mag territory; it picked up 257 fps over its listed 890 fps from a four-inch vented barrel. As one of my shooting buddies told me, only half-facetiously, after checking some “high teens” .357 chrono numbers—”Jeez, this thing is almost a real rifle!”

I’m all for lever guns (heck, I’m a card-carrying Marlin fetishist), but I must admit, the super-crisp five-pound trigger pull of the M77 .357 beats any handgun-caliber lever action I’ve ever seen. Ejection with the magnum stuff was no problem, and most of the .38s cleared out briskly. But a couple of times the .38s required a bit of a shake to get the brass out. But if you don’t baby the bolt, with most stuff you shouldn’t have any problems—although I’d leave target wadcutters alone unless I was going to single-load them for rabbits.

I grouped most of the standard .357/.38 Special stuff at 50 yards. But the high-performance loadings, I figured, would be better served by a 100-yard trial. These included Federal Vital-Shok 180-grain Swift A-Frame, Barnes Vor-TX 140 grain and Hornady LeverEvolution 140 grain. Anyone serious about using the M77 .357 as a short-range whitetail gun (and, no doubt, many will be) should most likely be interested in the potential of these three.

To do my shooting, I hung a Weaver Grand Slam 1.5-5X on the rifle. Now, since most of my good 50-yard groups weren’t dramatically superior to my 100-yard efforts, I did have a nagging suspicion that perhaps something with an adjustable parallax for the 50-yard shots might have been a wiser choice. But, all second-guessing aside, what I got at 50 with the Weaver would have more than enough for predators, small game or whatever.

And the 100-yard results more than justified shooting at that distance. The Barnes Vor-TX was spectacular. My best effort was almost one-half MOA. The Hornady LeverEvolution came in at 1.5 inches and the Federal 180-grain Swift A-Frame (my choice if I was going to try to whack a deer with this rifle) came in at 2.0. All groups were three-shot ones. May as well treat this as a real rifle, was my line of reasoning. Overall, I found that the optimum accuracy —.38 and .357—came in the 140/158-grain weight range.

People have been successfully taking deer—and hogs and whatever—with the .357 Magnum since way before I was born. And the vast bulk of that work has been done with a revolver. Personally, I wouldn’t advocate the .357 Magnum—from any length barrel—as a primary deer gun. But for a general utility rifle that may be called upon to take a deer under the right circumstances, the M77 .357 is a pretty cool item. It puts a potent handgun cartridge in an easy to handle, very accurate rifle platform that allows you to re-zero for .38 Special in case you want to hunt small game and/or eliminate pests with more authority than any rimfire.

‘Toaster Pastry Gun Freedom Act’ proposed in Maryland,"A Maryland state senator has crafted a bill to curb the zeal of public school officials who are tempted to suspend students as young as kindergarten for having things — or talking about things, or eating things — that represent guns, but aren’t actually anything like real guns.

Sen. J. B. Jennings, a Republican who represents Baltimore Harford Counties, introduced “The Reasonable School Discipline Act of 2013” on Thursday, reports The Star Democrat.

“We really need to re-evaluate how kids are punished,” Jennings told The Star Democrat. “These kids can’t comprehend what they are doing or the ramifications of their actions.”

“These suspensions are going on their permanent records and could have lasting effects on their educations,” he added.

A nationwide flurry of suspensions seemed to reach an absurd level recently when Josh Welch, a second-grader at Park Elementary School in Baltimore, Maryland, was suspended for two days because his teacher thought he shaped a strawberry, pre-baked toaster pastry into something resembling a gun. (RELATED: Second-grader suspended for breakfast pastry)

“I just kept on biting it and biting it and tore off the top of it and kind of looked like a gun,” the seven-year-old told Fox News.

“But it wasn’t,” he astutely added.

As Reason’s Hit & Run blog noted, Park Elementary School officials later offered counseling to other students who may have been traumatized by the pastry.

Senate Bill 1058 restricts the disciplinary options Maryland public school officials can use for any student who “brings to school or possesses” an image of a gun or an object that might look like a gun but isn’t one.

Students could also form their fingers in the shape of a gun without fear of reprisal.

The bill also includes a section mandating counseling for school officials who fail to distinguish between guns and things that resemble guns. School officials who fail to make such a distinction more than once would face discipline themselves.

Another provision of the proposed law would keep incidents involving non-threatening objects and images from going on a student’s permanent record. Elementary school-age students would be especially protected.

The bill also does not change any law or guidelines concerning actual violence or students who bring actual weapons to school.

Jennings admitted to The Star Tribune that his bill doesn’t have a high probability of becoming law.

For whatever reason, Maryland and neighboring Pennsylvania seem to be teeming with school officials who have reacted extraordinarily strongly to things that aren’t anything like real guns.

At Roscoe R. Nix Elementary School in Maryland, a six-year-old boy was suspended for making the universal kid sign for a gun, pointing at another student and saying “pow.” That boy’s suspension was later lifted and his name cleared. (RELATED: Pow! You’re suspended, kid)

At D. Newlin Fell School in Philadelphia, school officials reportedly yelled at a student and then searched her in front of her class after she was found with a paper gun her grandfather had made for her. (RELATED: Paper gun causes panic)

In rural Pennsylvania, a kindergarten girl was suspended for making a “terroristic threat” after she told another girl that she planned to shoot her with a pink Hello Kitty toy gun that bombards targets with soapy bubbles. (RELATED: Girl suspended for Hello Kitty bubble gun)

"EXCLUSIVE: ACLU says Reid’s gun legislation could threaten privacy rights, civil liberties","As Senate Democrats struggle to build support for new gun control legislation, the American Civil Liberties Union now says it’s among those who have “serious concerns” about the bill.

Those concerns have the capacity to prove a major setback to Sen. Harry Reid’s current gun bill, which includes language from earlier bills introduced by Sens. Chuck Schumer and Barbara Boxer.

In an exclusive interview with The Daily Caller, a top lobbyist for the ACLU announced that the group thinks Reid’s current gun bill could threaten both privacy rights and civil liberties.

The inclusion of universal background checks — the poll-tested lynchpin of most Democratic proposals — “raises two significant concerns,” the ACLU’s Chris Calabrese told TheDC Wednesday.

Calabrese — a privacy lobbyist — was first careful to note that the ACLU doesn’t strictly oppose universal background checks for gun purchases. “If you’re going to require a background check, we think it should be effective,” Calabrese explained.

“However, we also believe those checks have to be conducted in a way that protects privacy and civil liberties. So, in that regard, we think the current legislation, the current proposal on universal background checks raises two significant concerns,” he went on.

“The first is that it treats the records for private purchases very differently than purchases made through licensed sellers. Under existing law, most information regarding an approved purchase is destroyed within 24 hours when a licensed seller does a [National Instant Criminal Background Check System] check now,” Calabrese said, “and almost all of it is destroyed within 90 days.”

Calabrese wouldn’t characterize the current legislation’s record-keeping provision as a “national gun registry” — which the White House has denied pursuing — but he did say that such a registry could be “a second step.”

“[U]nfortunately, we have seen in the past that the creation of these types of records leads sometimes to the creation of government databases and collections of personal information on all of us,” Calabrese warned. “That’s not an inevitable result, but we have seen that happen in the past, certainly.”

“As we’ve seen with many large government databases, if you build it, they will come.”

“And existing law also bars the use of those records for other purposes,” Calabrese continued, explaining that the government is supposed to be barred by the Privacy Act from transferring database information between agencies without the consent of the individual citizen.

“We think those are privacy best practices,” Calabrese said. “We think almost all government databases should operate that way.”

“Once you no longer need the information, you should destroy it. Information collected for one purpose shouldn’t be used for another purpose,” he said.

But Calabrese says that Reid’s legislation fails to include those “privacy best practices.”

“Contrast this with what the existing [Reid] legislation says, which is simply that a record has to be kept of a private transfer,” Calabrese highlighted, “and it doesn’t have any of the protections that we have in current law for existing licensees.”

“We think that that kind of record-keeping requirement could result in keeping long-term detailed records of purchases and creation of a new government database.”

“And they come to use databases for all sorts of different purposes,” Calabrese said. “For example, the National Counterterrorism Center recently gave itself the authority to collect all kinds of existing federal databases and performed terrorism related searches regarding those databases. They essentially exempted themselves from a lot of existing Privacy Act protections.”

“So you just worry that you’re going to see searches of the databases and an expansion for purposes that were not intended when the information was collected.”

Reid’s legislation is hauntingly vague about who would physically keep information about American gun purchases, but it’s crystal clear that records will be kept.

“Regulations … shall include a provision requiring a record of transaction of any transfer that occurred between an unlicensed transfer or and unlicensed transferee,” according to the bill.

The ACLU’s second “significant concern” with Reid’s legislation is that it too broadly defines the term “transfer,” creating complicated criminal law that law-abiding Americans may unwittingly break.

“[I]t’s certainly a civil liberties concern,” Calabrese told TheDC. “You worry about, in essence, a criminal justice trap where a lawful gun owner who wants to obey the law inadvertently runs afoul of the criminal law.”

“They don’t intend to transfer a gun or they don’t think that’s what they’re doing, but under the law they can be defined as making a transfer. We think it’s important that anything that is tied to a criminal sanction be easy to understand and avoid allowing too much prosecutorial discretion.”

“For example, different gun ranges are treated differently,” Calabrese said. “You’re firing a firearm in one geographic location, you’re OK, but in another, you’re not. And those kind things, it’s going to be hard for your average consumer to really internalize and figure out the difference.”

“Criminal sanctions shouldn’t hinge on those kinds of differences,” he said.

Separate from the ACLU’s concerns with a universal background check system, Calabrese flagged another provision of the legislation invented by Sen. Boxer that the ACLU is “worried about” — school tiplines for the reporting of “potentially dangerous students”

“We’re worried about this tip line,” Calabrese admitted. “We think we already have a phone number for reporting dangerous situations — it’s called 9-1-1.”

“The tip line doesn’t have any guidance for who should be included, how we should vet these requests, who should be included in the system, what you should do with this information once you get it,” he warned. “It just seems like a dangerously unregulated avenue that’s going to risk pushing more kids into the criminal justice system.”

“What’s a school supposed to do if they get an anonymous phone call that some kid is dangerous?” Calabrese went on. “How are they supposed to treat that? Do they have liability if they ignore it? Should this kid be suspended? Or should he be scrutinized by a school safety officer because of an anonymous tip?”

“You could see how this could run amok very quickly. These are high schools. Lord knows, if you’re going to give a kid an anonymous opportunity to lash out at someone, you’re going to see a lot of problems.”

Gun Test: Kahr CM9,"By Massad Ayoob, Personal Defense World

Time goes by quickly. It has been many years now since Justin Moon debuted his first Kahr pistol, the K9. That first trim Kahr has spawned a long line of popular concealed carry sidearms.

The K9 quickly proved that it was no dog. My first one gave me 25-yard groups as tight as 1.88 inches for five shots with the most accurate 9mm ammunition, such as Federal’s 115-grain 9BP and Winchester’s Olin Super Match 147-grain subsonic, both jacketed hollow points. However, its all-steel construction made it seem heavy for its size, and a clamor arose in the marketplace for something lighter. Kahr Arms chose the polymer route rather than the aluminum-frame models.

Now offering dozens of variations in calibers .380 ACP, 9mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP, Kahr has kept certain features consistent throughout its line. One is its signature slimness, made possible in large part by Justin Moon’s ingenious concept of a slightly offset feed ramp. As a result, they can advertise a 9mm pistol whose slide is only 0.9 inches wide, and a .45 ACP carry gun measuring only 1.01 inches in that dimension. To keep their pistols slim, flat, and oh-so-comfortable inside the waistband, Kahr does not offer anything with a double-stack magazine. Even their “Target” model is slim and compact enough for easy concealed carry.

Gun Details

A standout in the line-up, in my opinion, is the CM9, introduced in 2011. This is essentially an economy version of their outstanding little Kahr PM9, which set a new benchmark for “slim-nines,” or super-slim 9mm carry pistols.

The CM9 and the PM9 are identically small in height and length. The CM9 weighs 14 ounces, and its six-round magazine, another 1.9 ounces. Weight specifications are exactly the same for the PM9. The CM9 measures 0.9 inches across its slide; so does the PM9. Each has the same smooth, easy double-action-only trigger pull, in the low 6-pound range, for every shot.

What’s different? The slide is sculpted a bit differently. The front sight of the CM9 is fixed in place, not in a dovetail like the PM9’s. The lettering on the slide appears more Spartan, more crudely stamped. Night sights are not listed as a factory option on the CM9, though they are on the PM9.

Oh, and one more thing. Kahr lists its manufacturer suggested retail price for the CM9 as $460. They list the price for the PM9 as $739, and $857 with the optional night sights.

When the CM9 first came out in 2011, it was $221 cheaper than its predecessor, the PM9. Today, at the prices just listed here, the value advantage of the CM9 is even more stark: it’s now $279 less than the PM9.

Shooting Impressions

It shot pretty much where it looked, right out of the box—something I don’t get much of the time even with far more expensive guns, believe me. I don’t have the notes in front of me as I write this, unfortunately, but I do remember that it put five rounds of Black Hills 124-grain 9mm jacketed hollow point into less than 2 inches at 25 yards, and an absolutely magnificent “best three shots” cluster at the same distance with 115-grain Mag-Tech full metal jacket.

Despite the light weight, recoil is quite controllable, and not at all unpleasant. The only thing you might find unpleasant would the sharp rear corners of the slide stop, both on top and on bottom, and even that depends how you hold the pistol. If you shoot left-handed, it shouldn’t be a problem. If you hold it with a primary right-hand grasp, those little corners can bite the thumb, if you let that part of the hand make contact with that part of the pistol. Curling the thumb down, revolver-style, will certainly keep the thumb away from the sharp corners of the slide stop/slide release lever, but now you may find that your thumb blocks the completion of the index finger’s trigger stroke. I’ve learned to shoot Kahrs with a high thumbs grasp to prevent either problem from occurring.

Kahr was the first gun company to come out of the closet and recommend a 200-round break in before using their pistol for anything serious. Some folks, usually found on the Internet or “around the cracker barrel” at the gun shop, have suggested that this is an admission on Kahr’s part of poor quality control.

I beg to differ.

For years before Kahr pistols existed, this writer made the same recommendation for any new pistol, and still does. Hilton Yam, the master tactical gunsmith who runs 10-8 Performance, reportedly recommends a 1,000-round break-in for any new service or self-defense pistol. It simply makes good sense. It’s analogous to those slow first few hundred miles every automobile manufacturer suggests we put on one of their new cars before putting pedal to the metal at Autobahn speed.

The CM9 I tested went its first 200 rounds without a single malfunction. The same was true of its next 200. And its next…

One price you pay for that wafer-slimness of the CM9 is that its magazine is thin, too—a mere six in the single magazine that comes with it, and a seventh in the firing chamber. Kahr makes a seven-rounder with finger extension, and it would be sensible to carry one as a spare… or maybe two.

Next, Concealed Carry and the Ultimate Backup

Concealed Carry

That benevolent slimness, plus its compact dimensions, make it easy to conceal the CM9. A belly band under a tucked in shirt, or a “tuckable” holster intended to be carried in similar places, is perfect for one of these baby 9mms. The two little sharp corners on the slide stop that aggravate my thumb in some shooting grasps don’t seem to touch the body, even when next to bare skin in a belly band.

The pocket is another favorite hiding place for the CM9 and its more pricey sister gun, the PM9. A word of caution on that, though—I’d suggest the right pocket only. Those of us who’ve tried it in the left side pocket have found that if we bump into anything on that side, it seems to activate the magazine release button and pop the magazine. Until the magazine is pushed back in to full lock, that turns the Kahr into a single shot pistol in your left side pocket, instead of a seven-round semi-automatic. A friend of mine is a very gun-savvy attorney in the American Southwest. He’s left-handed.

He loves his baby Kahr… when it is holstered inside his waistband. He has tried it with the pocket carry he prefers in hot weather, and ended up with a prematurely released magazine so many times, he regretfully gave up the practice of carrying the Kahr there. He switched to a Ruger LCP for pocket carry on his left side. The LCP is a fine little gun, to be sure, but its .380 ACP chambering is a bit on the light side, by both my friend’s standard and my own. I’d like to see Kahr put in a stronger magazine release spring to address this issue, or perhaps mold the frame with a protective build-up around the magazine release button. That isn’t just for the southpaws among us; it would also benefit those of us righties who might like to carry a subcompact Kahr in the left trouser pocket to put a backup gun within reach of our non-dominant hand.

Carried in an ankle holster on the left leg, the CM9 seems to present no problem. One issue with ankle rigs is that they are inches above the ground, where dust is kicked up with almost every step when outdoors, and the handguns in them quickly become cov-ered with a fine layer of grit. Most small autos are too finely fitted to survive that without daily cleaning, or running the risk of them malfunctioning when you most desperately need them to work.

This does not seem to be true of the Kahr. For some time after they first came out, I carried the larger, heavier, all-stainless steel K9 in an Alessi ankle holster, and found that it survived dirt and ran fine from that carry, just like the Glock and the Kel-Tec before it.

The dimensions appear to be the same on the CM9, and I would expect it to survive ankle carry and stay functional just as its big brother did. It will hide better and ride more comfortably, too, being so distinctly smaller and lighter.

Ultimate Backup

If seven rounds of 9mm seem a little light in the firepower department, remember that many who cherish these guns don’t always use them for EDC (everyday carry). For some, it’s a hideout backup gun to a 9mm with higher cartridge capacity, or to a more powerful handgun. In Florida, I met a Fish & Wildlife officer who was ambushed by a man with a 1911 .45 ACP. Both of the officer’s upper limbs were severely injured in the initial barrage. He sprinted to cover, where he found his injured hand couldn’t get his duty Glock out of its security holster. He was, however, able to retrieve his concealed backup, a little Kahr. Between one functioning hand at the end of an injured arm, and one wounded hand at the end of a functional arm, he was able to get into position to engage the gunman, who was searching for him. Some survival instinct perhaps taught the punk that he had lost the advantage and now was in deadly danger; in any case, he fled, was captured later and now dwells behind bars. The courageous officer, grateful that he had the Kahr for backup, is now recovered and back on duty.

Another friend is a petite female who works in the medical profession, in a job environment where it’s against workplace rules—but not against the law—for her to carry. After a nurse was brutally raped at the hospital where she worked, she chose to carry. On her own time, she wears a concealed high-capacity 9mm, usually either a Springfield Armory XDM Compact or a Glock 19. Too small to conceal guns of that size within the hospital dress code, she went with a subcompact Kahr 9mm in a belly band holster under her scrubs. It hasn’t been noticed yet.

Whether or not a CM9 fits your idea of a primary concealed carry handgun, you may well find that on special occasions with special “dress codes,” this flat little micro-9mm nonetheless has a worthwhile place in what some call “the carry rotation.”

Gun Test: Smith & Wesson M&P22 Compact,"By Jay Grazio, Shooting Illustrated

Earlier this year, Smith & Wesson re-launched its Bodyguard line incorporating Crimson Trace lasers, and invited a group of gunwriters to unveil its upgraded pistols. At the same time, the company was preparing to release a brand-new pistol—the new M&P22 Compact—and gave our group the first glimpses of the new hardware. Hints were dropped on the first day, and after a full day of testing the Bodyguards, touring the impressive Smith & Wesson factory and even running a sample stage of the Backup Gun Nationals, we were ready to see what this new mystery firearm might be. The next morning we had a brief introduction to the M&P22 Compact, then we were off to the range.

The M&P22 Compact differs from the full-size M&P22 in several key ways. The most obvious, of course, is size—the Compact is 15 percent smaller in all dimensions than the full-size M&P22, which was designed as a straight-up trainer for the full-size M&P series. Naturally, the M&P22 Compact is sized to be a trainer for the M&P Compact variant. However, it is not an exact match the way the M&P22 is to the full-size M&P line. The other major difference, one not apparent at first (or even second) glance, is the M&P22 Compact is 100-percent Smith & Wesson. Unlike the full-size M&P22, the Compact is not a Walther-made firearm.

One of the major points the company made about this new rimfire was reliability—engineers ran a series of tests using a variety of ammunition through the M&P22 Compact in tandem with other comparable rimfire handguns from several other manufacturers. They found the M&P22 Compact to have the fewest failures of all the models, and while our testing did produce a small handful of failures, we found the new pistol to be about as failure-free as a firearm dependent on rimfire ammunition can be. In one informal test, slightly less than 200 rounds were run through the pistol without a single failure. We’ve tested numerous centerfire handguns that didn’t function as reliably.

In the hand, the M&P22 Compact fits well. Average-size hands should find full purchase, without any fingers hanging off the grip or curling under the bottom of the magazine. Trigger pull is quite reasonable, coming in slightly less than 7 pounds for a single-action trigger. The reset is crisp and distinct, the take-up is familiar to anyone who has shot the M&P series and the hinged trigger functions in the same manner as the rest of the M&P pistol line. After a day on the range firing the Bodyguard 38 and 380, the M&P22 Compact felt like a custom-tuned race gun (not a knock at either of the Bodyguards, mind you, just the difference between a double-action-only trigger meant for pocket carry and a single-action trigger on a rimfire pistol).

Similar only in appearance to centerfire M&P variants, the hinged trigger is a single-action-only model.

Controls on the newest Smith & Wesson are familiar, with the notable addition of the ambidextrous safety lever, included for peace of mind with the single-action trigger. Takedown of the handgun is quite simple: With the slide locked back (on a for-sure empty firearm, of course) and the takedown lever rotated 90 degrees clockwise, the slide is lifted up and off the frame. The barrel is fixed to the frame and the recoil spring fits into a notch under the barrel. Best of all, the entire assembly can be cleaned, oiled and reassembled in record time for a rimfire pistol.

Reliability was excellent, with full range sessions using entirely bulk, budget .22 LR ammo passing without incident. In excess of 500 rounds ran through the Compact with only two or three failures to load and no failures to fire or eject. Informal practice with the M&P22 Compact proved it to be handy, quick and accurate—a 10-inch steel plate at 25 yards was so easy to hit with the pistol, I decided to make it more challenging by letting the plate spin and trying to hit both sides, essentially dueling myself. Formal accuracy testing supported this hypothesis, with groups between 2 and 2.5 inches for all ammunition tested.

The barrel is threaded with a 3⁄8×24 pitch and can utilize an adapter to mount common suppressors. A cap protects the threads when the Compact is operated unsuppressed.

The Smith & Wesson M&P22 Compact was billed as an accurate, reliable rimfire trainer for fans of the M&P Compact series. In formal and informal testing, it lived up to claims made for accuracy and reliability, but more importantly, it was a heck of a lot of fun to shoot.

Gun Test: Beretta A400 Xplor Action 28 Gauge,"By American Rifleman staff

Traditionally fancied mostly by shooters of high-end side-by-sides and over-unders, the often underestimated 28 gauge is currently experiencing an uptick in popularity. One of Beretta’s most recent offerings, the semi-automatic A400 Xplor Action, is likely to further interest in the “lowly” 28.

All A400-series shotguns feature Beretta’s “Blink” gas-operating system, which the company claims allows the user to fire four shots in less than one second. —–

Once assembled, the 28-ga. A400 Xplor Action’s paltry 5-lb., 9-oz. weight is immediately noticeable. Much of the savings can be attributed to the bronze-color-anodized aluminum-alloy receiver, which measures a scant 1.420″ at its widest. Below the ejection port is the bolt-release button, while on the left, front side of the receiver is an inward-tilting magazine cutoff. The bolt latch is located at the rear of the magazine loading port, immediately forward of the front of the trigger guard. With the hammer cocked, the bolt will not remain locked to the rear unless the bolt latch is activated.

As with the other A400-series shotguns, the Xplor Action features the company’s “Blink” gas-operation system. The system includes: a newly designed gas piston for improved metering and enhanced cleanliness; dual action arms with the bolt body welded in place; a Benelli-style rotating bolt head with dual lugs and a large, spring-tensioned extractor; and an action-return spring surrounding the magazine tube yet contained within a polymer sleeve. Purportedly, the system enables the user to fire four shots in less than one second. We didn’t challenge this proclamation by measuring its speed; really, we didn’t need to. At no point during testing was a subsequent shell not in place for the successive trigger pull. Suffice it to say, it’s fast enough to not leave shooters desiring an increase in speed.

The Xplor Action’s trigger group is contained within a polymer housing. The chrome-plated trigger on the test gun was surprisingly consistent, with an average pull weight of 4 lbs., 11 ozs., and it exhibited minimal creep and only a modest amount of overtravel. At the front of the trigger guard is the polymer cross-bolt safety with a triangular button that has molded-in checkering for increased purchase. When in the “fire” position, a sliver of red is apparent. As for the trigger guard, we were surprised to find that it is insufficiently sized for access to the trigger with anything thicker than lightweight gloves. Removing the trigger group for cleaning and maintenance requires only a single pin to be driven out; it’s as user-friendly as any system we’ve encountered.

Available in 26″ and 28″ lengths, the 28-ga. Xplor Action’s barrel is made from a proprietary alloy of chromium-molybdenum steel that Beretta refers to as Steelium. The blued barrel is created by deep-drilling a billet then cold hammer-forging it and, finally, subjecting it to vacuum extension, which is touted as reorienting the steel’s molecular structure. The result is said to be more consistent patterning. The barrel is topped with a checkered, 0.195″-wide ventilated rib with a single, 0.120″-diameter red fiber-optic sight near the muzzle, and is threaded for the Optima-Bore HP screw-in choke tubes.

The gun comes with full, modified and cylinder tubes. The Xplor Action is capped with a plush, 3/4″-thick Micro Core recoil pad, which is contoured to facilitate quick mounting. Despite exhibiting no tackiness, texturing on its face is sufficient to keep the gun in place.

The Xplor Action’s impressive speed is due in part to its Benelli-style rotating bolt head.

The Xplor Action’s stock is made from walnut featuring the company’s X-Tra Grain technology. Essentially, Beretta enhances the wood’s natural appearance through the application of an oil finish. The Grade-2 walnut on the evaluation sample exhibited noteworthy grain; however, the finish wasn’t consistent, leaving many areas that appeared to be comparitively dry. Despite that, the Xplor Action’s wood contributed to the gun’s overall aesthetically pleasing appearance.

To enhance purchase, the pistol grip has three sections of well-executed checkering per side and, on the fore-end, there’s a large section of checkering, too. A Beretta logo is in the center of the latter. Above the checkering on the fore-end are sections in which its width is reduced, and at the front is a polymer portion against which the deeply grooved magazine tube cap rests. Indicative of its intended use as a field gun, the A400 Xplor Action features sling swivel studs; one is on the butt while the other is on the aforementioned magazine tube cap.

Lastly, to better fit a variety of shooters, the Xplor Action comes with extra shims to adjust the length of pull. For evaluation purposes, however, we found changing the original configuration to be unnecessary.

We tested the 28″-barreled, 28-ga. model in two phases. First, with multiple boxes of Winchester AA Target 2¾”, 3/4-oz. No. 8 shells in the range bag, we headed to a local sporting clays range. For several hours straight, we engaged targets mimicking a variety of upland game and waterfowl, and in each situation the gun excelled. We noted that it was especially quick to the shoulder and effortless to swing, making it easy to break fast crossers and springing targets alike. The gun cycled flawlessly, and ejection was brisk, sending hulls 10 or more feet to the right in a relatively tight dispersion.

Next, we spent time at the patterning board. Using Winchester’s Xpert Game/Target Steel Shot 2¾”, 5/8-oz. No. 7 loads and the factory modified choke, we patterned the Xplor Action at 40 yds. We were thoroughly impressed with the consistency of the patterns; seldom do patterns show such uniformity with regard to pellet distribution. That being said, the center of the shot pattern was noticeably low and right of the point of aim.

Will the 28 gauge ever be as popular as the 12 or 20 gauge? That’s not likely. But, in the right platform its beauty and ability are fully realized. The Beretta A400 Xplor Action is one such platform.

Gun Test: HK P30SK,"By Massad Ayoob, GUNS Magazine

The latest in Heckler and Koch’s series of hammer-fired pistols is the P30SK. Angela Harrell at HK tells me the suffix comes from German spelling: SubKompact. With a stubby 2-finger grip frame, 10+1 9mm Luger cartridge capacity, 1.37 inches thick and 6.42 inches long, it seems designed to compete squarely in the market now dominated by the Glock 26.

The P30SK can be had in traditional double-action first shot/single action thereafter mode, with its odd push-button decocker on the back of the slide to the left of the hammer, or in LEM configuration. Our sample was the light LEM. LEM stands for Law Enforcement Modification, a concept going back to when double-action-only, hammer-fired autoloaders were all the rage.

On our test sample, serial number 214-000260, the trigger pull averaged 6.13 pounds on a Lyman digital trigger pull gauge from Brownells. It has “second strike” capability without racking the slide in the event of a misfire, but this brings the shooter to a default trigger pull almost double the LEM’s standard weight at 11 pounds on average. Fortunately the test pistol never misfired and we never needed that long, heavy second chance at a recalcitrant primer, but it never hurts to know the capability is there.

The fixed sights have good visibility, aided by luminous inserts front and rear. Europe seems to regard Tritium the way “progressives” regard the Confederate flag, and we see a lot of these sights on guns from the Continent. Usually, they need 15 or 30 seconds of flashlight beam to get a good glow on, but the ones on this HK lit up almost immediately.

Another feature is long, slim ambidextrous slide-lock levers. This speeds reloading and administrative handling for southpaws, and for anyone the front edge of the slide stop lever provides a very handy felt index for keeping the trigger finger in register on the frame in any sort of ready position. A good and often overlooked safety feature, methinks. However, a straight thumbs grasp can override the lever and cause the slide to fail to lock back when empty.

The P30SK’s external extractor is designed to act also as a loaded chamber indicator when its red part shows. Be wary: it extruded enough on our test sample to show red whether or not a round was chambered.

The P30SK’s relatively high bore axis gave some muzzle rise, but wasn’t noticeable (arrow shows flying brass).

HK P30 unique magazine release design allows very fast reloads. The arrow shows empty mag falling, while a fresh one is en route to the pistol.

Race day. In front of 30-person audience, P30SK still delivered perfect qualification score. The arrow shows the low hit in the A-zone and Mas says

was all his fault. Final qualifying target scored 300/300 despite low shot.

Press Contact Range

A big positive, I think, is the recoil spring guide on this SK aligns with the muzzle in such a way the slide won’t go back out of battery at press contact. If the gun has to be rammed against a homicidal attacker’s body and fired, this means it will actually discharge, while many competing products will go out of battery and fall silent.

From the Caldwell Matrix rest on my 25-yard bay, we group tested the P30SK with the three most popular bullet weights for 9mm Parabellum. Representing 115-grain was the famously effective Federal 9BPLE, a jacketed hollowpoint at +P+ velocity. Five shots formed a 2.45-inch group, with the best three in 1.75 inches. The 124-grain choice proved most accurate: Black Hills’ standard pressure load with the Hornady XTP bullet delivered five shots into an exact 1.50 inches, with the bullet holes measured center to center. The best three were in 1-3/4 inches. Finally, the 147-grain subsonic in the form of Winchester’s WinClean training load with jacketed truncated cone bullet drilled five rounds into 1.85 inches, and delivered the tightest “best three” cluster of 0.95 inch.

This is impressive from a subcompact concealment pistol with a 3.27-inch barrel weighing 24 ounces unloaded. The test gun did shoot high, though, with the 124-grain centered about 3 inches high at 25 yards, as did the 115-grain, and the 147-grain subsonic’s point of impact was more like 5 inches north of point of aim. Nothing a replacement front sight couldn’t fix, but still a bit disappointing.

Trigger reach was comfortable, and the LEM trigger pull itself was quite manageable once I took a few shots to re-familiarize myself with it. Unfortunately, I was also re-familiarized with my hand’s incompatibility with the P30 series since it came out. On the inside bottom surface of the triggerguard a little bump sits directly in line with the toe of the P30’s pivoting trigger, and it tends to pinch my index finger. Nothing I can’t get over, but I wouldn’t want to take a 1,000 rounds a day immersion shooting course with it. While I’m not the only person who has this problem with the P30 series, most folks don’t. Dry fire it in the gun shop and if it’s gonna be a problem for you, you’ll recognize it immediately.

To test a deer rifle, you’d want to take it deer hunting. To test a defensive pistol, you want to do some combat shooting with it, which means either an action pistol match or shooting a police-type qualification or teaching a class with it. There weren’t any IDPA or similar matches that fit my schedule, so I took the P30SK with me in June 2015 to teach a MAG-40 class for Thunderbird Tactical Academy in Wichita, Kansas.

The HK worked out well for the course, though to teach reloading, I borrowed a student’s pistol. Most autoloaders have a side-button magazine release, but a signature feature of the HK series is the ambidextrous paddle along the bottom edges of the triggerguard which, when pressed down, dumps the mag. This also has the useful benefit of getting your trigger finger out of the guard during the process. While unconventional, the HK’s mag release setup is fast once you get used to it. When this system first came out on the HK many years ago, the great Ken Hackathorn said it was the fastest auto pistol to reload he had yet seen. It was certainly quick for yours truly.

The Green Force Tactical IWB worked great in several days of constant concealed carry.

Mas shot this 60-round group practicing for qualification with the P30SK.

Speed Shooting

Before leaving for the class, mindful of the fact the gun shot high, I took it for a test drive over the MAG qualification course, a 4- to 15-yard 60-shot compendium of various long-standing police handgun quals. Using the same target as Bianchi Cup and the GLOCK Sport Shooting Foundation, I was able to keep 59 of the 60 shots in the 4-inch-diameter center X ring. One drifted out into the 10-ring, resulting in a score of 600-59X out of 600-60X possible. The group ran about 4-1/2 inches.

But, as my old friend Tom Campbell used to say when he was building his reputation as one of the International Practical Shooting Confederation’s great champions, “practice ain’t race day.” The time came to shoot a “pace-setter” qualification on the last day of the class. Using a deep 6 o’clock hold because I knew this particular pistol shot high, I managed to honk a shot low in the “A” zone of the IPSC targets we were using.

This forced me to bear down, and I managed to finish the run with a 300 “possible” score, but nowhere near the 4.5-inch practice group. (Congratulations to Andy Padilla of the Thunderbird staff, who beat me with the same 300 score and an inch tighter group for tie-breaker.)

Continuing with the “How do you test a deer rifle” analogy, you test a carry gun by, well, carrying it. The P30SK spent about 10 days on my right hip, mostly in a Green Force Tactical Kydex inside the waistband holster, which fit it perfectly and was delivered with alacrity. The makers will make it the way you want it. I like it without a sweat shield to allow a full grasp before the draw begins. For outside the waistband wear, I found a Galco Cordovan holster for a GLOCK 30 fit the P30SK adequately. In all-day carry, I found no sharp edges or abrasive grip surfaces. It felt as if I was carrying a GLOCK 26 with a stubby little hammer spur.

The best performance of the day came with this Black Hills 124-grain JHP 25-yard group of 1.5 inches.

Winchester’s 147-grain subsonic stayed under 2 inches at 25 yards.

Federal’s street-proven 115-grain +P+ grouped under 2.5 inches at 25 yards—exceptional performance in a subcompact.

Bottom Line

Noting the most important thing—no malfunctions of any kind in several hundred rounds—I was by and large happy with the P30SK. Except for the pinched trigger finger, I liked most of its shooting characteristics. A relatively high bore axis gives it a bit more muzzle rise than most of its striker-fired competitors, but it didn’t feel like a handicap in shooting. The price of $719 is reasonable given the evident quality and performance, though $59 per spare magazine tends to raise eyebrows. On balance, I like the HK P30SK.

Law Enforcement Modification Trigger Pull Sequence

A The LEM trigger pull from the user perspective is slightly different from other DAO trigger pulls. Here, the P30SK, it is at rest. At initial contact, the trigger finger feels light resistance, and at this point the hammer is coming back and finger is feeling more resistance.

B Here, hammer is full cocked and trigger finger is a whisker away from the release of the sear, hammer falling and discharging the round.

C The trigger needs to return only this far forward to reset for next shot. Note position of hammer at this point. Once your finger is completely forward, so are trigger and hammer, to position seen in “A.” In firing most shooters learn to run it forward only to reset, sort of like a traditional-double-action shooter “riding the sear” or “riding the link” when the TDA is in single-action mode.

Gun Test: Winchester’s 20-Gauge SX3,"By Nick Sisley, Shotgun Life

The Model 1 is still seen often in competition circles. The SX2 was introduced in 1999. While this one took the lead-in name from the model 1 the second version was based on a totally different gas-operated system. The Super X3 (SX3), introduced in 2006, provided more innovation with overbored 12 gauge barrels, a lighter, sleeker profile, the new Active Valve System and more. For 2010 the company has just announced a 20 gauge version of the SX3, and that’s the semi-auto I have for testing.

There are three versions of Winchester’s Super X (now shortened to the SX). The Super X Model 1 semi-auto first appeared in 1974. This was one heck of a shotgun, but production ceased in 1984 as the Super X was very expensive to produce because many of its parts were milled rather than stamped.

Winchester’s SX3 now offered in the new 20-gauge model. –

I’ve been banging away at clay targets with this 20 bore, and shooting this one has been pure pleasure. You would not want to shoot this gun at trap without a shell catcher attached – as empties are thrown a remarkable distance – so you wouldn’t want the trap shooter on the station to your right to get too battered by the wildly flying empties. On second thought I’ve shot with a few trap mates that I wouldn’t have minded that happening. Despite the empties flying 15 and more feet I was only shooting target-type loads. The SX3 20 bore worked flawlessly whether I was feeding it Remington Gun Club factory fodder – or my own Winchester AA reloads.

This SX3 20 gauge won’t hurt your eyes one bit as the gun is very attractive. The wood wears what looks a lot like traditional oil finish, and there are some nice grain streaks to add to the eye candy. But it’s the receiver, barrel and trigger guard that wear a special grey finish that provides the additional eye candy. Of course, this finish is both scratch and corrosion resistant, far more so than traditional bluing, but the bottom line is how good the metal finish appeals cosmetically.

The barrels, which have the Perma Coat UT (the UT for Ultra Tough) finish wear a somewhat high vented rib (also in that Perma Coat finish), and it measures .237 in width and is nicely serrated horizontally on top for glare reduction. Those serrations match up with the top of the receiver and its forward-running grooves. The receiver, also in grey but with a nickel protective coating, has some milled-away lines for added eye appeal, plus milled away lines near the receiver back are in red. Further, Winchester is in red on the left side of the receiver while SX3 is in red on the right side of the receiver. The bolt has a grey finish as well, and it’s probably tumbled in beads to result in its non-glare look.

View of the right side of the SX3 20 gauge receiver. –

The safety is positioned at the rear of the trigger guard, and it can be switched for left-hand use. The trigger is a little heavy at six pounds on my Lyman Digital Trigger-Pull scale, but that trigger has no creep, and I shot several hundred targets with the gun before I checked the trigger with the Lyman, and I considered the trigger pull to be just fine. Then again I’m not a fan of light triggers on my shotguns. That’s probably because I mistakenly increase trigger pressure as the target is flying, so a light trigger often goes off on me before I’m actually ready.

Both 26- and 28-inch barrels are available. My test gun’s barrel is the shorter of the two. A non-overbored 20 gauge would have an inner diameter of about .615. The SX3 test gun’s barrel measures .630 – so it’s well overbored by about .015 compared to 20s that have standard bores. Naturally, the gun comes with screw-in chokes. I measured the Improved Cylinder at .622 – so .008 constriction – the Modified at .617 – so .013 constriction – the Full at .603 – so .027 constriction.

Two weight-saving factors are a lightened magazine tube and a slim fore-end. The latter hefts 5.8 ounces. It’s nicely checkered. Note the photos depicting the different checkering on the bottom of the fore-end compared to the checkering on the fore-end sides. This fore-end has finger grooves, but the depth of those finger grooves is very minimal – might not even show up in the accompanying photo.

The checkering on the fore-end transitions from one type of checkering to another – from sides to bottom.

The very different checkering pattern on the SX3 20-gauge pistol grip. –

In contrast the checkering on the pistol grip is totally different. Again – see grip photo. Despite the differing looks I thought that checkering provided a good enough grip. The recoil pad is a Pachmayr Decelerator, but note the grey plastic in front of that pad – with grey portions extending forward at both top and bottom. Maybe this is added eye candy, and I like the looks. Length of pull is 14.25, but Winchester packs two extra plastic inserts with each gun – each insert measures .25 – and one or both can be added between the recoil pad and the grey portion just ahead of the pad – providing a choice of 14.50 or 14.75 in length of pull. The drop at comb is 1.62, the drop at heel 2.0. Overall the gun went 6 pounds 10 ounces on my digital postal scale.

Note the inserts supplied with this SX3. Insert between the recoil pad and the grey portion. The insert’s weight is next to nothing. Each is .25-inch thick. –

It does not appear that the forcing cones have been lengthened. The fore-end screw cap is partially hidden in the front of the fore-end. Knock two retaining pins out for easy removal of the trigger system and subsequent cleaning. You should not feel the need to do this very often – perhaps after hunting in the rain or snow or at the end of the hunting year. A set of extra spacers are provided – that fit between the front of the stock and the rear of the receiver – to change the amount of drop at comb and cast. This is a very desirable feature that more and more semi-autos are being supplied with, and it’s a feature that every owner should experiment with to see which of these spacers allows him or her to print the shotgun’s pattern exactly where he or she is looking.

Check the new SX3 20 gauge out at your Winchester dealer. You’ll be pleased with this gun’s good looks, and when you shoot it you will find it passes the ultimate test for an autoloader – it works.

Gun Test: Big Horn Armory’s Model 90 In .460 S&W,"By Payton Miller, GUNS Magazine

Photos By Joseph R. Novelozo

If you want to put things in their simplest terms, I suppose you could describe Big Horn Armory’s Spikedriver leverguns like this: “Premium rifles and carbines chambered for magnum handgun cartridges, which equal—and often surpass—the performance of older (and longer) big-bore lever-action standbys such as the .45-70 or .444 Marlin.”

The cartridges in question are, of course, the .500 and .460 S&W Magnums. I was fortunate to be around at the time both were unveiled in S&W’s massive X-Frame revolver; the .500 first in around 2003, the .460 a couple of years later. During both rollouts, however, the reaction among the assorted gun magazine types was remarkably similar. Almost immediately after coming off the firing line, the most common thing I heard was “Jeez. What a cartridge! If only somebody would make a lever-action carbine for it…”

I can remember when guys I hunted with using the first X-Frame .500 revolvers were chattering about a .500 S&W levergun the minute they fired those mega-wheelguns. Whether or not this was due to the realization they’d exceeded their “hand-cannon” tolerance, I couldn’t say because I didn’t ask. But for me the answer would’ve been yes.

No “handgun cartridge” levergun at the time was a large enough platform to handle either one of these bruisers. So Big Horn definitely answered the call with the Model 89. Now, they’ve doubled down on things with the Model 90 in .460 S&W.

This carbine variation of Big Horn Armory’s .460 S&W Model 90 features a full-length magazine, maple stock and matte stainless finish. It’s upscale all the way.

Scoped, the Model 90 runs a bit over 9 pounds, but balances very well. With the Leupold Scout Scope mounted, it’d be tough to come up with a

better setup for quick offhand shooting. Photo: Payton Miller

Big Horn’s Model 90

Prior to Big Horn’s Spikedriver leverguns, the closest thing to a “handgun caliber” carbine in excess of the .44 Magnum was, to the best of my knowledge, Rossi’s Puma Carbine in .454 Casull, a beefed up Winchester M92 clone with an industrial strength recoil pad (which, in view of its 5-pound weight, was much appreciated).

But the Big Horn Model 90 weighs an honest 8 pounds, and is chambered for the considerably more potent .460 S&W (which pushes the same 300-grain JFN bullet more than 300 fps faster in the Buffalo Bore loads we used). Our particular specimen was the carbine version, featuring an 18-1/2-inch barrel, full-length magazine, and an eye-catching stock and fore-end of what the company refers to as “Hot Wood Treated Maple.” It’s a beautiful blonde color with a distinctive grain, making for a very attractive combination with the matte stainless barrel and receiver. Actually, “very attractive” is an understatement. This thing turns heads.

Unscoped, it weighs 8 pounds, 6 ounces. There is a 22-inch barreled rifle version with a half-magazine. But in view of the fact the carbine has a 6-round capacity over the rifle’s 4 rounds, and considering 3-1/2 inches of barrel length isn’t going to be a deal-breaker in terms of velocity loss in dealing with a monster handgun cartridge, the carbine seems to be the way to go.

For those who simply can’t abide glass on a levergun, the Model 90 has an integral adjustable receiver sight with a generous aperture (below) and a drift-adjustable front sight with a high-visibility bead (above).

–

Considering the fact heavy-bullet .460 S&W loads can surpass many factory .45-70 loads in terms of power, the Model 90’s industrial-strength recoil pad is by no means an affectation.

Power, Versatility

In fact, the Buffalo Bore .460 loads we used were pretty much dead-even with some of the “magnum .45-70” loadings in a similar 300- to 350-grain bullet-weight range, and they surpass standard-pressure .45-70’s in the 300- and 325-grain range. The .45-70 will pull ahead—obviously—when we’re talking about Buffalo Bore or Garrett super-heavyweight hard-cast offerings (500 grains or so). So, if you’re somewhat recoil-hardened and are seriously interested in really upping weight and frontal area past a .460, you’d probably be better off with Big Horn’s .500 S&W Model 89.

But what the .460 Model 90 also offers besides velocity is versatility, thanks to its ability to also digest .454 Casull and .45 Colt. We had only one type of .45 Colt ammo—Buffalo Bore’s 225-grain Barnes copper load. It averaged a whopping 1,752 fps, but didn’t group very well—a heavier bullet more than likely would’ve. But there are a few important caveats in regard to .45 Colt ammo (see sidebar).

After admiring the Model 90 carbine itself for a spell, I wanted to know more about it. My first question to Greg Buchel, Big Horn Armory president, was a fairly simple one. I asked if his Spikdedrivers were simply “beefed-up” Model 92’s. Imprecise as the question was, Greg managed to amplify things a bit for me:

“We realized early on that no existing action would be suitable for the pressures required by the .500 and .460 S&W cartridges. So we designed an action purpose-built for them. Our Models 89 and 90 are based upon John Browning’s 1886 and 1892 designs. They’re “1886” in external appearance with “1892” internals. All action parts are made from 17-4PH hardened to Rc32 and then further case hardened using a nitrocarburizing process. The surface hardness is approximately Rc82.

“We augmented metal thicknesses in areas like the barrel ring, the locking bolts and receiver sides. During destruction testing, we failed to destroy our test guns. One had 24 proof loads run through it with zero change in headspace. I am not sure our guns are indestructible, but using reasonable tests, we have failed to damage them.”

At 50 yards, Buffalo Bore’s 325-grain HC .454 Casull proved usable, but not as impressive as the .460 S&W.

Outstanding 100-yard results were obtained with Buffalo Bore’s 300-grain JFN .460 load (above), and the company’s potent 360-grain HC exhibited good accuracy (below) at the same distance.

–

Shoot It

The Model 90 proved extremely shootable. Recoil with the stouter .460 Buffalo Bore loads was slightly less pronounced than .45-70 loads in a similar bullet-weight range through a Marlin Guide Gun, which has about the same overall length and weighs slightly more than a pound less. The trigger on our test rifle was uncommonly crisp for a levergun, breaking at 3-1/4 pounds.

Although Big Horn leverguns feature an excellent aperture sight, we opted to mount Leupold’s VXR 1.5-5X Scout Scope to the forward rail using Leupold QD mounts. This did add an additional pound to the rig, but the balance was still excellent. And with the scope set at 1.5X with its FireDot duplex reticle, it’ll pretty much equal or outperform any ghost ring/aperture in terms of speedy target acquisition. The fact it’s a bit kinder to older eyes is a plus as well. If we would’ve opted to go with the irons, however, we’d have probably yanked the forward-mounted rail—it doesn’t prevent the use of the receiver sights, but it is annoying to see as much of the rail as you will through the generous ghost ring aperture.

We did, of course try some of Buffalo Bore’s .454 Casull loads through the gun. Although the .454 does have a shorter OAL than the .460, feeding problems can be avoided by holding the barrel at an 30-degree upward angle while working the lever in order to avoid running afoul of the longer cartridge guides for the carrier. At 50 yards, the groups with our .454 loads—a 300-grain JFN and a 325-grain HC LFN were 2 and 2-1/2 inches respectively.

It was when we switched to the .460 stuff the Model 90 really showed what it’s made of. The corker was the 300-grain JFN. At 100 yards it stayed at an inch even, and did so at a relatively blistering 2,200 fps. That’s about .30-30 speed with roughly twice the throw weight and with more frontal area.

To be honest, for a “stopper” levergun, the .500 S&W Model 89 probably makes more sense. But the higher velocity and ranging potential of the .460 S&W Model 90—not to mention its multi-caliber versatility—is going to appeal to many.

It’s worth remembering this: Before America’s turn-of-the-century shift to “smallbore” .30-caliber rifles, big-bore leverguns were state-of-the-art hunting tools. And those Marlin 1895’s and Winchester Model 1886’s were popular well into the smokeless era. The Big Horn Model 90 is a fitting heir to that tradition, while enhancing it considerably.

Three in one. The Model 90 can chamber (left to right) .460 S&W (case length 1.80 inches), .454 Casull (1.383 inches) and .45 Colt (1.285 inches). Although this high-performance .45 Colt Buffalo Bore factory load features a Barnes 225-grain copper bullet, make sure to remove any lead buildup if you use soft-lead .45 Colt “cowboy” or factory ammo.

The .45 Colt Question

Part of the advantage of owning a .460 S&W (or .454 Casull) rifle or handgun is being able use .45 Colt ammo. However, Buffalo Bore’s Tim Sundles cautioned me concerning using soft lead “cowboy” bullets and then switching to full-house jacketed or super hard-cast .460 or .454 ammo without thoroughly removing any lead deposits. To neglect this can cause a potentially dangerous spike in pressures. Since the cartridge guides for the carrier in my particular Model 90 were tailored to the .460, I had to single-load the .45 Colt stuff.

It’s highly unlikely anyone is going to buy a Big Horn .460 primarily to shoot .45 Colt, so shorter guides really don’t make much sense. But being able to single load and pop off a round of .45 Colt is a nice—and handy—little option. Just watch the lead!

Gun Test: The Skinner Bush Pilot Kit With Takedown Chiappa Model 92 .44 Magnum,"Mike “Duke” Venturino, GUNS Magazine

Photos: Yvonne Venturino

For our 20th wedding anniversary Yvonne presented me with a beautiful Damascus Bowie knife handmade by our friend Steve Brooks. What did I get her? Nothing! She caught me flatfooted because never before had we exchanged gifts for our wedding anniversaries. And neither did I plan to get her anything for our 38th one in 2016. Besides I was away at a gun show.

Fate intervened. At that gun show in Kalispell, Montana, a young fellow named Andy Larsson, owner of Skinner Sights visited me. He asked, “Do you have a moment to look at something?” Certainly, but little did I expect to buy it. And even less did I figure something called a Bush Pilot Kit to be Yvonne’s long awaited anniversary present.

Of course some readers must be thinking, “Sure, you found something you like and then used her as justification to buy it.” Not at all. I certainly do like it but she actually had asked for something similar. What Larsson unveiled for me was a nifty survival kit all rolled into a 22-inch package.

Yvonne and I are not pilots but we do drive about Montana in the wintertime. Also, Yvonne still loves her horses and envisioned having a camping kit including a gun. At only about 6-1/2 pounds and 22 inches in length, this Bush Pilot’s Kit is extremely handy. Of course the heart of such a kit must be a firearm. Some might think a small .22 rifle of some sort would be preferable. But Larsson has thought this through. Most people needing a survival kit are in country where critters can be harsh—as in bears or wolves—both of which we have in plenty here in Montana.

Therefore, a more powerful caliber is appropriate. Yet the firearm still need be small enough to fit into a kit. Larsson made a fine choice here. It’s a .44 Magnum lever action. But not just any lever action. It’s a takedown replica of Winchester’s Model 1892. Back in Winchester’s heyday of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, one of their special order options was a takedown feature.

–

For their 20th wedding anniversary Yvonne had this beautiful Damascus Bowie knife made for Duke by Steve Brooks.

–

The method by which this was accomplished is referred to as the interrupted thread. Instead of the barrel and receiver threads being totally around its circumference, they have smooth portions. To install, the barrel is turned 90 degrees, making it possible to slide it into the frame. When turned upright the threads engage. Of course, such thread engagement isn’t tight enough, so the full-length tubular magazine is threaded at its frame end. A lever on the muzzle end folds out to provide a handle. Once the magazine tube is dropped into the frame, by tightening it with the handle the barrel and receiver are snugged tight. Once tight, the handle folds back alongside the tube. Mounting or dismounting the barrel takes but a minute or so.

The heart of Larsson’s Bush Pilot kit is a fine replica of Winchester’s Model 1892 as produced by Chiappa Firearms of Italy. In the past some shoddy workmanship has shown up on Italian firearms. That is not the case with this Chiappa. It is a smoothly operating carbine with fine wood to metal fit. Consider the following as its bona fides. I bought this kit. It was not a “gun’riter present” and I don’t throw my bucks about lavishly.

Inscribed “Bush Pilot Skinner Sights Limited Edition” in two lines on the action’s left side, its 16-1/2-inch barrel is of octagon configuration. Rifling is six grooves with twist rate of 1:20 inches. All the metal is steel with a finish described as “stainless hard chrome.” Wood is semi-fancy walnut with nicely sanded oil finish. Buttstock shape is straight grip with a slightly curved steel buttplate as was standard on original Winchester levergun carbines. Length of pull is 13 inches. The walnut fore-end is capped in steel as were vintage Winchester rifles so Chiappa has combined the features of original ’92 carbines and rifles. The result is a fine little lever gun.

This is where the Skinner Sights come in. There is no open rear sight. Instead one of the Skinner aperture arrangements is dovetailed to the barrel. It has provision for windage by loosening a set screw and moving it laterally. There is a scale by which amount of movement can be judged. Also it can be easily changed for elevation by replacing the stem holding the aperture with a taller one. This likewise is done by loosening a single set screw. Front sight is also by Skinner; a fiber-optic red one also dovetailed to the barrel.

The left side of the receiver sports the Skinner Sights Bush Pilot Kit logo.

The rifle wears a Skinner Sights red fiber optic front sight.

To start dismounting the barrel, a lever at the end of the magazine tube folds out to provide a handle to unlock the magazine tube.

A Skinner Sights aperture rear is adjustable for windage.

–

Andy Larsson doesn’t intend this little lever gun for target shooting. Its purpose would be hunting or self-defense so it is pleasing that throwing it to your shoulder quickly brings the rear aperture in perfect alignment to your eye. It works for me and Yvonne both. She is a bit recoil shy so I’ve been having her mostly shoot .44 Specials in it with just a few full .44 Magnum factory loads. It’s perfectly sighted in windage-wise and varies slightly up and down by load fired. Function with the shorter .44 Special rounds is perfect.

As said earlier, this Chiappa .44 is only part of the kit. Inside that well-designed nylon pack are several other necessities for someone stranded out of doors. Next to a firearm, or perhaps even more important at times, is a knife. The Bush Pilot Kit contains a hefty one by the Ontario Knife Company. The blade is 7-inches long and overall length is 12 inches. Thickness at the hilt is 3/16 inch narrowing down to 1/8 inch just in front of the Micarta handle. On top of the blade is a small area of serrations that could be useful for cutting or breaking wire. In other words, this is a “utility knife” not a showpiece.

Along with a knife and firearm are means to start a fire. The Bush Pilot Kit has two methods. The easy one is a set of Titan stormproof flare matches in a waterproof container. I’d like to try one for a test but there are only a dozen so I didn’t waste one. The second method is a Doan Magnesium Fire Starter Tool. This is a 3-inch long by 3/8-inch thick piece of magnesium with a steel rod set into one side. In use, a small pile of magnesium shavings are sliced off with a knife. Then the knife is used to throw sparks into them by striking it against the steel.

The Bush Pilot Kit’s Chiappa .44 Magnum takedowns and fits in a 22-inch case with plenty of survival accessories.

Although the Chiappa Model 1892 take-down is chambered for .44 Magnum, Duke and Yvonne found that it functioned perfectly also with .44 Special loads (above). Some of the groups Yvonne fired at 25 yards (below) in getting the feel of the Chiappa Model 1892 and in checking its zero.

–

Included is a heavy duty sheath made of the same fabric as the larger kit bag. It can be dismounted from the kit and belt carried. On the sheath is a pocket for the Doan Magnesium Fire Starter. I think perhaps we will shift the Doan tool to another pocket and carry a knife sharpening steel in the sheath pocket.

Some might argue this point, but I’ve always told Yvonne the following when we were hunting in Montana’s mountains: If we get separated for some reason just follow water downhill and you will eventually come to people. Hence we have never carried a compass. However, one time I hunted on Quebec’s Anticosti Island where the terrain was flat as a pool table and densely forested. There I wished I had a compass and knew how to use it. The Bush Pilot Kit comes with a Brunton Tru-Arc 3 compass. I still do not know how to use one properly but I have former Army and Marine friends who can instruct me.

A component in this kit is similar to one that came in handy in the past. It is a tube tent. Many years ago I was caught out in the hills on horseback when an unseasonal snow storm brewed up. I strung a rope between two trees and crawled in my tube tent. It kept me warm and dry overnight. One big enough for two people comes with the Bush Pilot Kit along with 50 feet of mil-spec paracord to help string it.

It’s likely Yvonne and I will never have to use this Bush Pilot Kit for an emergency. After all, we have lived all these years in Montana without one. Still, it is an unobtrusive thing to have along. Besides, now I don’t carry the guilt of not having a return anniversary gift all those years ago.

Gun Test: Beretta Cx4 Storm,"By Mike “Duke” Venturino, GUNS Magazine

Photos: Yvonne Venturino

Recently when I was bouncing article ideas off of my good friend Kirk Stovall he said, “Why not do one on the Storm?” Showing off my great firearms knowledge I replied, “Yeah that storm the other night was brutal. It left gullies in my driveway but it’s really not suitable for a gun magazine article.”

“No dummy,” he said, “the Storm carbine.” And then I said, “What pray tell is a Storm carbine?” I had honestly never heard of such a thing. Well it turns out they are a real firearm, actually made by Beretta in Italy with the full name being Cx4 Storm. They are semi-auto currently being chambered for 9x19mm (Luger), .40 S&W and 9x21mm. In the recent past they also offered a .45 ACP version but it’s not listed now. Stovall has all three Storms, so he loaned them to me for some shooting and photography.

Now, let me stress I am no stranger to carbines—especially ones firing handgun cartridges. I’ve owned levergun and pump action carbines in calibers from .22 LR up to .45 Colt. Although I’m partial to firearms crafted of wood and steel, I am coming to accept synthetics to a degree.

My introduction to his Storms went like this. He pulled one out of its case and I exclaimed, “Wow, that thing is ugly!” In true fact the Beretta Cx4 Storm looks like it belongs in a science fiction movie. They have 16.7-inch barrel lengths with only about 5 inches extending past the black synthetic stock. Overall length according to the Beretta USA is 29.7 inches and nominal weight a bit less than 6 pounds.

Beretta says the Storm is accessory friendly. I can see why. As shipped there is a long Picatinny rail atop action and handguard. Supplied with it are short rails easily attached to the forearm sides. Now get this: there is even an extendable rail inside the forearm under the barrel. I broke off my thumbnail trying to pull it out before reading in the instructions that the front sling swivel must be pushed in simultaneously with pulling the rail out.

Duke’s friend Kirk Stovall uses his Beretta Storms primarily for rabbit hunting. Two shot during testing included (below, left) one as issued by Beretta, and the other (right), has been gussied up with vertical foregrip and Aimpoint sight.

–

Features

Instead of an extending buttstock as seen on so many “black” rifles and carbines nowadays, Storms have a fairly traditional one except it is cut-out behind the pistol grip. That does save weight. Length of pull of Stovall’s 9mm Storm with supplied extender is 14-1/4 inches. It appears without the extender it would be about 13-1/2 inches. As made Storms have a horizontal area with checkering serving as a forearm. However, by means of an attachable bottom rail, they can also be fitted with a vertical grip such as has become favored by our soldiers and Marines on their M4 carbines.

Whereas most semi-autos firing centerfire cartridges have a magazine in front of the triggerguard, these Storms utilize a magazine going into the pistol grip just like most semi-auto pistols. In fact, they use the same magazines as used in Beretta’s pistols of the same caliber. Those are of 10-round capacity for the .40 S&W and 10 or 15 rounds for the 9mm.

There are some other interesting features on these carbines. One is the bolt handle can be attached on either side for right- or left-handed shooters. In fact, Stovall has fitted his 9mm Storm with bolt handles on both sides.

Storms’ operate with a simple blowback system. There are no gas ports or op-rods to contend with. Triggers are single action only, meaning that to fire, the loaded magazine is inserted, the bolt retracted fully and then released. Then the carbine is ready to fire. The safety is a cross-bolt type directly over the triggerguard. Pressed to the left a red band is exposed meaning the safety is off. Pushed to the right and it is engaged. There is a bolt hold open device for when the last round in a magazine is fired. Magazine release is another button on the receiver’s left side behind the triggerguard. Dropping out the empty magazine and pulling the bolt back slightly releases it to close on an empty chamber.

Another accessory Kirk put on his 9mm Storm is this perforated barrel guard.

Duke’s friend Kirk obviously favors his 9mm Storm more highly than the others

because it wears an Aimpoint sight.

The Storm comes with buttstock extender allowing length of pull as long as 14-1/4 inches.

The Storm can be fired with bolt retraction handles on right, left or both sides.

The red banded button is the safety in off position. The button behind trigger

is magazine release.

Adjustable Sights

Sights as issued by Beretta consist of a 2-leaf rear peep with one labeled SR and the other LR which I assume mean “short range” and “long range.” Instead of that rear sight being adjustable as most of us are familiar with, it is the front sight that can be moved for zero. A special spanner wrench is supplied for this. Also worthy of note is that Storms come with a fitted hardcase with extra magazine and supplied accessories in their proper places.

It was easy to tell how my friend’s three Storms rated to him. The 9mm was truly gussied up with vertical foregrip, perforated barrel cover and Aimpoint sight. The .40 S&W version was as shipped from Beretta except for a TruGlo sight and the .45 ACP had an American Defense sight. Both of those are also dot-type sights. To be honest I have next to no experience with such sighting equipment so it was fun to try them. However, on the .45 Auto version I took the optical sight off entirely so I could try the issue peep and post sights.

Storm magazines insert into the pistol grip, which took a while for Duke’s hands to adapt to.

Duke’s average group size for .40 S&W Storm was in 3+ inch range. Duke’s average

group size for 9mm Luger Storm was about like this (below).

–

In shooting Beretta’s Cx4 Storm 9mm, Duke obviously has not gotten used to the vertical foregrip yet.

Velocity Boost

Also it was interesting to fire a few handguns of the same caliber with the same factory loads to see how the 16.7-inch barrel’s velocities compared with regular pistols. With my Smith & Wesson Model 39 9mm with 4-inch barrel, Federal 115-grain FMJ’s gave 1,176 fps. The 9mm Storm hit 1,325 fps. My Kimber Pro Carry .40 S&W with 4-inch barrel likewise showed 1,008 fps with Winchester 180-grain FMJ’s on the chronograph. The .40 S&W Storm gave 1,198 fps. And finally for a .45 ACP, an Inland Model 1911A1 was used with 5-inch barrel. It gave 887 fps with Black Hills 230-grain FMJ and the .45 Auto Storm gave 1,026 fps. To me it appears the longer Storm barrels will gain about 150 to 200 fps over normal pistols.

Shooting the Storms to determine precision (accuracy) was interesting. With their strange (to me) stocks and even stranger sighting equipment it was a challenge to print decent groups with them. For instance I was shooting at 8-inch diameter black bull’s-eyes. The Aimpoint on the .45 Auto Storm was giving me a red dot approximately the same size as the bull’s-eye. Furthermore there was a halo around it. So with some fiddling I learned two things. One is the Aimpoint red dot is adjustable. And if you are looking directly square with the Aimpoint the halo leaves the red dot.

The green dot TruGlo sight on the .40 S&W was second so there was some learning behind me making things go faster. With the .45 Auto Storm using its supplied peep sights I learned something about myself. My eyesight has deteriorated so much with age that a front post sight only 13-1/4 inches away from a rear peep sight is a mere blur to me. I had great difficulty shooting groups with the .45 Auto so sighted. In fact I gave up on group shooting with it.

Initially my group shooting with 9mm Luger and .40 S&W Storms was poor also. As light as they are and with such low recoil I tended to just lay them on the stand bags and hold them loosely. That caused them to recoil differently from shot to shot which is a sure way to cause flyers. Then I began to grasp them tightly, more like I would do with rifles giving heavier recoil and groups began to form. I wouldn’t call these carbines tackdrivers but the 9mm and .40 each printed about 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 for 3- and 5-shot groups. Obviously friend Kirk had them sighted in because they hit elevation-wise right on for me. And just as obviously Kirk and I shoot differently because both shot to the right for me. I will say that with the red and green dot optics, standing up with these carbines and hitting my steel torso targets was easier than with iron sighted carbines.

There were no malfunctions or problems of any sort with these borrowed carbines except my muscle memory trained hands kept trying to put magazines in forward of the triggerguard as with more traditional semi-autos.

Gun Test: Kimber Micro 9,"By Massad Ayoob, GUNS Magazine

Photos by Takashi Sato

At the 2016 SHOT Show in Las Vegas, editor Jeff John and I fondled the preview version of the Micro 9 at the Kimber booth. “I want you to write this up,” he said. But it took a while for them to come off the production line. Apparently, Kimber was waiting to make sure they had it right. Not until the following September was I able to test it. This petite pistola tips my scale at 20.35 ounces with a full six 124-grain JHP rounds in its magazine and a seventh in its launch tube. Width is a svelte 1.06 inches. While the owner’s manual contains warnings against carrying with a round in the chamber and a statement it might go off if dropped or struck, I expect this is out of an abundance of legal caution as the owner’s manual also states the Micro 9 has a firing pin lock, which disengages only when the trigger is pulled. I felt comfortable carrying it in Condition One (the thumb safety is a right- hand-only setup). Ours was the stainless steel model with aluminum frame and handsome wooden stocks.

The Accuracy Factor

It became apparent early in testing if I wanted a Kimber that shot tight groups, I wanted one of their .45’s already in my safe. My first shot with the Micro 9 at 7 yards hit the tiny red center of a 2-inch Birchwood Casey “Shoot-N-C” aiming dot. “We’re off to a good start,” I thought.

The rest of the magazine opened things up, and the whole 6-shot group was right at an inch and a half. Well, we’re still in a “deep brain size” group—at 7 paces. Next came the 25-yard line. While it’s popular on the Internet and even in the gun press to claim pistols this size should be tested at 7 yards because they’re unlikely to be used at any greater distance, I’m staying conservative in my belief bad guys don’t offer easier shots to good guys who have small handguns instead of big ones.

From a Caldwell Matrix rest on a concrete bench, each 5-shot group was measured overall and again for the best three, since I’ve found the latter measurement compensates for enough unnoticed human error to closely duplicate what the same guns and ammo will do for all five from a machine rest. Ammo represented the three most common bullet weights for the 9mm.

Most practice shooting was done with SIG Elite 115-grain FMJ, which is getting a good reputation and which I’m seeing in more and more gun shops. Even at 7 yards shots were starting to go a little high right and of course this was exacerbated at 25 yards. The 115-grain FMJ centered its group about 3.25 inches high and 2.5 inches right—the group measuring 5.35 inches for all five and 2.85 inches for the best three. Some feel short-barrel 9mms need all the velocity they can get, so the 124-grain chosen test load was Winchester Ranger Bonded +P JHP. With it, the 25-yard group centered some 4 inches high and about half that much right. All five shots created a 4.85-inch group, but the best three were in 1.95.

Many like a 147-grain JHP for stubby 9mms because it seems to lose less velocity than lighter, faster loads from very short barrels. The exemplar here was Remington-UMC jacketed truncated cone ammo. This proved to be the tightest shooting of the test, and the only one to make the oft-quoted standard for “acceptable service pistol accuracy at 25 yards,” meaning 4 inches. Five shots plunked into 3.95 and the best three in 2.80. The group centered about 4.5 inches high, but only an inch and a half right.

–

The 1911 heritage is obvious before and after fieldstripping (top, right).

The relatively large rear sight (above) and corresponding front post made

the Micro 9 more shootable.

Thumb Safety Issue

Our test team ranged from 6-foot Testosterone Creatures to 5-foot representatives of the Vast Estrogen Conspiracy, with proportionately-sized hands. None of the men felt the petite pistol was too small, and both of our female testers thought the trigger reach was pretty much perfect.

All these shooters were 1911 owners and very familiar with the platform. All noticed how the dimensions of frame and placement of the thumb safety subtly alter the familiar “1911 manual of arms.” If you are accustomed to “off-safing” your Government Model with the ball of your thumb, you find you are now hitting it with the skin on the web of the same thumb. Which still works, but feels weird at first.

Thumbing the lever down from “safe” to “fire” was positive and palpable, “just right” as it were. However, it’s so far back from where the thumb is used to hitting it, to put the gun back on “safe” all shooters—even the small-handed ones—had to break their grip slightly with the firing hand. And, obviously, it’s not an ambidextrous safety.

The angle of the thumb safety movement is also different from a full size 1911. Assuming a standard 1911’s safety is in the “fire” position, both gun and thumb will be—more or less—straight to point of aim (call this a “neutral” position). The “safe” position will be higher. On the little Micro 9, “safe” is going to be the “neutral” position, and the “fire” position will be lower. In other words, you may find yourself having to depress the lever farther downward than on your big 1911 to make this tiny one go “bang.”

The Micro 9 is dwarfed by Mas’ old full-size Kimber Classic .45.

Sights, Trigger, Magazine

Our testers all agreed the sights were excellent, even if they didn’t send the bullets where the shooters were aiming. There’s a big (for a subcompact) fixed rear sight, and a commensurately large front post. Fortunately, both are dovetailed. A sight pusher would have easily corrected the bullets’ drift to starboard, and a taller front sight could easily have been installed to correct for elevation.

Collective impressions of the Micro 9’s trigger are fascinating and seemingly counterintuitive. We all “ballparked” the pull-weight to be lighter than it was. It turned out to be 9.87 pounds average. None of the experienced shooters on the test team felt the weight affected their hit potential with it and all found it to have a clean break (the Kimber website lists the pull weight spec for the Micro 9 at 7 pounds). Mike Cumpston’s November 2016 article on the Micro Carry .380 lists the pull-weight at 8 pounds. I suspect Kimber, fearing some customers might be careless enough to carry a loaded pistol loose in their pocket, made the trigger on the Micro 9 heavier.

Reloading the Micro 9 was a chore. While the mag well is beveled, the magazines themselves were “deeper than flush-fit,” requiring pushing the floorplate past the edge of the butt to lock the mag into place. I found myself doing it with my thumb to guarantee seating. The floorplates are not drilled for base pads and don’t extend past the frame, giving you little if anything to grasp should a malfunction require ripping the mag out. The frame where the front floorplate of the magazine rests is sharp and pointy, and a bit hostile to the hand slapping in the fresh magazine.

On a 60-shot, timed police-style qualification course, groups were nice and tight in the “weak hand only” and “strong hand only” stages at the 4-yard line. By 7 yards, I was already using a little Kentucky windage with a 7 o’clock hold, and applied it progressively as the distances increased. However, I didn’t apply it enough at 15 yards and four shots out of the 60 total escaped the center zone. I’d like to get the sights lined up for me and have a rematch.

I ran it on the Bianchi Cup falling plates from the 11-yard line. It ended up with all the plates down on each of four runs, but on one stage I was glad to have all 7 rounds in the tiny pistol instead of just 6. My times were just a little over what I generally get with a GLOCK 42 or 43 in the Pocket GLOCK event at GSSF matches, which uses the same steel plate setup.

The 25-yard results: Winchester Ranger Bonded 124-grain +P JHP. Kimber approves

+P but warns it accelerates wear. They do not recommend +P+.

115-grain SIG Elite FMJ went high right. All loads were reliable.

The Bottom Line

At a price of $654, this pistol is designed to compete directly with the SIG P938 and indirectly with other 9mm compacts. With hundreds of rounds through it, we had no malfunctions whatsoever, and no testing parameter of a self-defense gun is more important than reliability.

Kimber’s Micro 9 is set off by a Streamlight ProTac 1L flashlight, a Spyderco

Delicia A4 and American Eagle HST 9mm ammo. Out of 60 shots, Mas dropped only

4 shots (below) out of the center zone on qualification with the Micro 9. He

shot the pistol 1-handed only and found it very controllable. Photos: Gail Pepin

The Verdicts Are In

Said Steve Denney, “The two-finger grip turned out to be much more comfortable

and controllable than I expected. Nice trigger! The safety felt just a little

awkward compared to the full-size 1911 I used to carry on duty.” Photo: Gail Pepin

It’s always good to get feedback from more than one experienced shooter for a test such as this. Here’s what our test team had to say:

Terri Strayer (female champion in IDPA and NRA Hunter Pistol and gun shop co-owner) said, “I think it shot very nice. It was very controllable and comfortable to shoot. With the manual safety it would be good for purse or bellyband carry.”

John Strayer (state and regional IDPA champ and gun shop co-owner) said, “Very controllable. Sights will need to be regulated, though they give a great sight picture. The slide left tracks on the back of my hand as it fired. The safety was a little awkward compared to the full-size 1911 I usually shoot.”

Allen Davis (division champion shooter, gun store manager, retired LE officer) said, “It’s way more comfortable to shoot than my 642 J-Frame! Nice sights!”

Steve Denney (retired police supervisor and current firearms instructor) said, “The 2-finger grip turned out to be much more comfortable and controllable than I expected. Nice trigger! The safety felt just a little awkward compared to the full-size 1911 I used to carry on duty.”

Gail Pepin (female state and regional IDPA champ) said, “I love the trigger. I like the idea of the manual safety on this type of pistol. I wish I could have carried it in my bellyband at the convention last week instead of the .380 I wound up wearing.”

CCW Notes

Mas found the Micro 9 was to be extremely comfortable in this

CrossBreed Hybrid IWB holster. Photo: Gail Pepin

The new BugBite holster provides another carry option when ankle

carry is on the agenda. Photo: Gail Pepin

I wore the Micro 9 loaded with 124-grain +P JHP for three days, every waking hour. Here’s how it went:

Day 1: Used a CrossBreed IWB between tucked-in shirt and concealment garment. No problem at all, and predictably, so comfortable I hardly knew it was there.

Day 2: Same carry, but against bare skin under an un-tucked polo shirt. Felt no sharp edges, no discomfort.

Day 3: Used the new BugBite holster, which slides over the inside of the calf. Because this Spandex rig holds the pistol much higher above the foot than a conventional ankle holster, it took a good bit of getting used to. Took practice getting the pants cuff way up with the support hand to clear a path for the drawing hand. It proved remarkably comfortable, but also remarkably slow. Would add style points to an open carry demonstration if worn with shorts, I suppose.

Overall, the Micro 9 was designed for concealed carry. It absolutely fit its design parameters.

Gun Test: Weatherby Orion Over And Under,"By Jeff Helsdon, Shotgun Life

Mention Weatherby, and most people associate the company with its line of magnum rifle cartridges and the associated rifles. The Weatherby name also stands for quality and that carries through to the company’s shotgun line as well.

Through its many incarnations the Weatherby over and under has continued to stand for a quality gun at a reasonable price.

The latest version of the Orion, Weatherby’s over and under launched in 2014, is no exception to the quality mantra the company maintains. This is the latest of several different incarnations of the Orion, giving a good compromise for affordability and quality.

Although the newest Weatherby Orion is at home in the field, its good balance makes the shotgun a natural for wingshooting.

To step back in time, Weatherby got its start when Roy Weatherby launched the Weatherby magnum calibers in the 1940s. Gun manufacturing started with the Mark V rifle in 1957, The Mark V was known as a premium rifle to shoot Weatherby’s line of magnum cartridges.

The company took a different approach when it started designing and selling shotguns in the 1960s. The shotguns were designed by Weatherby, were up to the company’s quality benchmarks, but were always built by a different manufacturer. While Weatherby rifles were known as premium guns with a premium price tag, the company’s shotguns were known for quality and a more economical price.

The latest version of the Orion came after a hiatus when the gun wasn’t built. It is now manufactured by ATA in Turkey, which is a different company than is presently manufacturing Weatherby pumps and semi-automatics in Turkey.

The latest version of the Orion continues a long line of quality over and unders from Weatherby.

“Turkey now reminds me of what Italy was in the early years with a lot of manufacturers,” said Dean Rumbaugh, Weatherby’s historian.

Although some might have concerns about Turkish guns, Rumbaugh assures the Orion still has to meet Weatherby standards and the company designed the gun. “If Weatherby’s name is on it, it will be a quality product.”

Out of the Box

Taking the Orion out of the box, the first standout is the Weatherby name etched in gold lettering on the receiver. Done with a modern font, this adds character to the gun, giving a modern flare to a classically styled firearm.

The Weatherby name etched in gold on the Orion receiver compliments the gold trigger.

Available with 26 and 28-inch barrels, the model I have has the shorter barrel. Barrels are chrome lined, with a vented matte rib to cut down on glare on top. Both models have three-inch chambers for hunting. The only option for beads is a single brass bead at the front of the rib.

The company is calling the grip a Prince of Wales with its relaxed curve and rounded knob. Although every manufacturer varies the stock dimensions to a certain degree, the Prince of Wales is more than just a rounded grip cap. As a generality, the circumference of the grip is not as tight as with a standard pistol grip. It is sometimes considered a compromise between a pistol grip and a straight grip.

The Prince of Wales grip is shown in this profile photo of the Weatherby Orion.

Examining the technical stuff, the Orion has a length of pull of 14-5/8 inches, drop at heel of 2-3/8 inches and the drop at the comb is 1-5/8 inches. The weight of both versions is 7 pounds.

At present, the gun is only available in 12 gauge. My comparison for the new model is my 20-gauge Orion, built in the SKB era. It was my first over and under and a pleasure to shoot.

Besides guns produced with its own name, SKB was known for building over-and-unders and side-by-sides for Ithaca.

The Orion SKB-era, above, and the newest version of the Orion. Big changes between the two are the location of the barrel selector and the Prince of Wales grip on the new version.

SKB was the longest-standing manufacturer of Weatherby over and unders, producing them from 1982 to 2007. There were two grades: the plainer Orion and higher grade Athena. A new manufacturer was sought when SKB stopped building guns for all other companies. Fausti was the next Weatherby over and under manufacturer, building both models 2008-2011 with the name Athena d’Italia and Orion d’Italia.

The original Weatherby over-and-under was the Regency line from 1967-1982, built by Angelo Zoli. Nikko, the company that built Winchester’s Model 101s at the time, produced the Weatherby Olympian from 1977 to 1981.

Getting back to the newest model, throwing the gun up to my shoulder, it has nice balance and pointability – something that impressed me with my SKB Orion.

I decided to do a side-by-side test with my Orion and the newest one. There were many similarities between the two. Both have a boxlock action and ejectors. The receiver of the new Orion is trimmer though, something that contributes to faster handling. Both have Grade A walnut with high-gloss finish.

The tang safety also doubles as a barrel selector on the new Orion.

One change was the barrel selection system. With the SKB, barrel changes were done with a push button on the trigger. Although I don’t hunt with a pointing dog and have a little less time cushion, I often thought it impractical to slide a switch to the side on the safety and get the gun up in less than a second – especially with gloves on. Yet, this is the design most doubles go with. It’s also the system on the new Weatherby.

Which barrel was firing was indicated by a graphic showing one dot or two over one another. This system is fine once you get onto it, but it had a small learning curve. Having the letters O and U would make it more apparent.

One thing that hadn’t changed from the 1980s is the Winchoke system for the Orion’s tubes. Used by Winchester, Mossberg and the first generation of Browning Invector, the Winchoke system chokes are readily available and chokes are economical.

The Winchoke system is used for the latest Weatherby Orion.

The forend is completely different with the new Orion. Removal is now with an easy-to-operate pin system and the forend isn’t as trim as it was with the SKB. The last observation might be the difference between 12 and 20 models though.

The recoil pad is of the modern-looking with rounded edges. A Weatherby “W” embossed in the middle is another touch of class.

Taking the gun to the range

I always thought if I was to buy a 12 gauge over and under it would be a Weatherby to match my 20. That’s why I looked forward to testing the new Orion with extra anticipation.

Coincidentally, when I first try the gun at the trap range another shooter who had a new Orion told me it shot flat. Although I took his advice, it took until the second target before I caught on.

Although the gun was new and the action stiff, it’s not overly tight and did loosen up with the little I shot it while testing it.

My plan was to shoot two different boxes of target loads to test the difference in recoil. I started with 1-1/8-ounce loads and then tried lighter one-ounce shells.

I have two boxes of target loads with me – one each in ounce and ounce-and-an-eighth. I took the different loads to see how this gun handles the recoil.

After the first box, I could tell I had been through a whole box by the way my shoulder felt. It should be noted, though, that when I was a regular trap shooter, one-ounce loads were my preference.

With one box down, a little more comfort with the gun and less recoil, my score improved slightly on the second round with one-ounce loads. Although it’s hard to judge recoil unless shooting guns immediately after each other, I felt the Orion tamed the recoil as well as some trap guns I have shot.

My experimentation at the trap range included shooting out of both modified and full chokes to compare how they broke birds. Both broke targets quite well and I didn’t see any pattern inadequacies responsible for a missed bird.

The next test was at the skeet range. While I wished for a longer barrel at the trap range, the Orion with 26-inch barrels was perfect for skeet. Even though it was only the third box of shells I shot through the gun, it fit so well it had a familiarity to it.

My only hunting test with the gun was limited to a quick pheasant hunt that was unproductive, but I note the Orion was a pleasure to carry.

The next experiment was patterning the gun on a patterning board to test the choke spread and coverage. With #8 pellet, one-ounce target loads fired through a full choke at a 30-inch circle at 40 yards, the pellet count was 268. With #4 Winchester 1-1/4-ounce pheasant loads, there were 122 in a 30-inch circle at 40 yards. Both of these loads are within the normal 65 to 75 per cent expectations for full choke.

Examining the pattern on a practical basis, I would say it would take a lucky pheasant to squeeze through any of the small holes in the #4 pattern. There were a few holes in the target load pattern a clay bird would fit through, but all were tiny enough that with the speed of the target, there is little doubt they would be crushed.

Through the three boxes of shells, the gun operated flawlessly. The ejectors worked well, throwing the shells clear if I opened the gun with that intention in mind, or enabling easy removal if at a range.

Parting thoughts

With many options out there for Turkish-made double barrels, there is no doubt you could spend less money than the Orion’s $1,100 MSRP. But, you won’t find one that gives as much value. This gun would be high in my rankings when looking for a 12 gauge double barrel.

No matter what the reason, modern shooters are left with another option when choosing a shotgun.

Gun Test: SIG P226 CO2 Pistol,"By Scott Smith

I am sitting at my computer with the weather on TV; most of the country is covered in cold, snow and rain. For those in the southern climes, this will pass quickly but for much of the country this is winter and it lasts for twelve to sixteen weeks. How do you get trigger time without freezing?

The answer is a quality CO2 powered replica firearm. I chose a Sig P226 that looks and feels just like my 9mm that I carry. Before you gasp and scream blasphemy, hear me out.

Sig’s P226 .177 sixteen shot pellet pistol ($110.99) has the same controls as my P226 9mm, fits the same holsters and at fifteen feet is just as wicked accurate. While you do not get the report and recoil of a 9mm, you have the same feel in your hand. This allows you to practice your draws and target engagements since Sig offers a complete target system. Two things are different on the pellet pistol from the centerfire pistol; the safety is not a spring loaded decocking lever, it’s a safety and the slide will not lock back. These features are minor differences that do not affect getting quality trigger time in my garage.

When the big brown truck delivered the CO2 version of the 226 and targets I was pleased to see there was a number of targets Resetting Quad Shooting Gallery ($69.99), a “Texas Star” ($77.99) and Air Reflex ($27.99). The star and spinner are designed to stick in the ground so they will not work in the garage, but the Resetting Quad Shooting Gallery is ideal for indoor use (again if you have a safe area). I have been able to test the spinners and star at my gun club. The star does not spin nearly as fast as its competition version but for practice it is a lot easier to set-up and transport than an armored steel centerfire model. One important note, do not reuse pellets; they do not look it but they do deform on the spinners and will jam the airgun.

When shooting the P226 pellet pistol you will know when the CO2 cartridge is running out; the accuracy rapidly drops off and the slide does not cycle. I found this to be around sixty shots (four to five “magazines” full; each end holds nine pellets) with the 12 gram cartridge, with the 25 or 40 gram versions I am sure this will easily double or triple. When the cartridge is full your will easily knock down the “steel” targets and punch holes in a cardboard IPSC target. The steel not reacting is one of the first clues you need to chance CO2 cartridges.

The P226-pellet pistol not only allows one to practice basic shooting drills, it also forces you to work on trigger control. The fire controls are not as crisp as a quality pistol so they force you to work on the basics. This pellet gun has helped make me a better shooter because of this. The small “steel” targets also have no room for error for proper shot placement; forcing you to stare down the front sight on target. Another bonus of the pellet gun is you can do dry fire drills without fear of damaging the engagement surfaces of your centerfire pistol. In all the years I have fired Daisy airguns and now Sig Sauer’s I have not had a pellet gun break from dry firing one.

A big bonus of true size replica handguns is being able to teach a non-shooter to shoot without fear of recoil or muzzle noise. While safety glasses must be worn to protect your eyes, hearing protection is not. Without all the noise and felt recoil novice shooters will not develop the dreaded flinch many do when starting out centerfire firearm. The cost per shot is substantially less with a CO2 powered true copy gun like this Sig P226 .177 caliber versus a 9mm or 22LR.

While these pellet guns allow shooters to practice the basics of shooting, they allow us to do something else; have fun. When a lot of folks get out their serious 9mm P226 they forget, shooting is fun. Pellet guns allow us to put fun back into practice. When was the last time you plinked at a beer can with your 9mm or 22LR, try it with a .177 pellet gun? I tied one to a string to hang it from the seven yard target frame at the club and had a ball making it dance with each shot. Not only was it fun making that can “dance”, but it teaches you to track the pistol on a moving target. Shooting hanging bowling pins is about as close as you get with a centerfire handgun; but they lack that twang/clang of a pellet hitting an aluminum can and are just not as lively.

Sig Sauer CO2 powered versions of several of their handguns and rifles. They all feel like their centerfire siblings to allow you to have the fit and feel of your full size firearm. I can recommend owning at least one copy cat quality airgun for practice and fun shooting all year round. CO2 powered firearms will help you shoot fast, shoot fast, shoot accurately and bring fun back to shooting.

This is the CO2 P226 in FDE on the left and my well used 9mm P226 on the right in front of the Quad Shooting Gallery.

The back of the grip opens where a CO2 cartridge is installed to power the pistol. It rests on the dual feed magazine.

I was getting ready to shoot in the garage on a balmy 15 degree morning.

This is a pistol view of my garage, note the heavy canvas drop cloth to stop any misses. As with any firearm make sure you have a clear back stop to contain pellets.

Sig’s “Texas Star” for airguns, it works as well as those I have shot in USPSA,IDPA and three gun competition.

Sig’s Quad Spinner rack, like the Gallery it has auto reset and is a lot of fun.

The Air Reflex is a spinner that reacts when you hit either target, if you get really fast you will be able to make it spin.

Gun Test: CZ 805 Bren S1 Carbine,"By Doug Larson, Gun Digest

The Czechs have been making some very high quality firearms for many years, and that tradition continues with the CZ 805 Bren S1 Carbine. It’s a lightweight, semi-automatic with a 16.2-inch barrel chambered in 5.56x45mm, the standard NATO cartridge.

Many people familiar with firearms mistake it for the FN SCAR 16S. There are similarities and differences, some considered significant and some of no consequence, depending on preference. A few are addressed here, but let’s first discuss the name, which has been applied to a few different firearms.

The use of the word “Bren” in naming guns traces back to the mid-1930s when the British were in search of a reliable light machine gun. Several designs were submitted for testing, one being the Czech ZB vz. 26 made in the Czech city of Brno. Tests revealed the gun as better than the other entries, but it needed modifications to make it suitable for use by the British. After a number of changes, the military adopted the improved gun.

Agreements were made with the Czechs for it to be produced at the Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield Lock, which led to the name Bren—a combination of BRno and ENfield. At least one expert has described the Bren as “the finest magazine fed light machine gun ever put into service by anyone at any time.” Given this, it is no wonder that the Czechs have continued to use the Bren moniker for current production models.

Features

The original select-fire 805 Bren is a standard arm of the Czech military, but it’s now available in the U.S. in a semi-automatic version. Made in the city of Brno by Ceska Zbrojovka, it is imported into the U.S. by CZ U.S.A. located in Kansas City, Kansas.

On the front end of the lightweight barrel is an effective muzzle brake that, while loud, does an admirable job of reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. Admittedly, the 5.56 NATO round is pretty tame and isn’t known for heavy recoil, but the brake does make follow-up shots a bit faster.

–

The gas piston action also helps reduce felt recoil. There are two settings, one for normal operation and the other for adverse conditions when the gun is extremely dirty and more gas is needed to operate the action. A spring-loaded detent must be pressed to rotate the gas valve setting or to remove the gas piston assembly for cleaning. Beneath the gas block is a bayonet lug, something the SCAR 16S lacks.

The aluminum upper receiver has a Picatinny accessory rail running from the front of the handguard to the rear on which flip-up front and rear iron sights are mounted. Both are alloy, not polymer, with the rear having a large and small aperture. It is adjustable for windage, whereas the front is an elevation-adjustable post surrounded by protective wings.

–

Another Picatinny rail is located on the bottom of the upper and runs from the front of the magazine well to the front of the handguard. There are no rails on the sides like there are on the SCAR.

The charging handle can be easily installed on the left or right, while the magazine latch and safety selector are ambidextrous, making the 805 right- or left-hand friendly. Although the bolt is held back after the last round is fired, the bolt latch is located only on the left side of the receiver. To release the bolt to return to battery, the charging handle must be retracted and released. The SCAR’s bolt can be released the same way, but also by pressing the bolt catch toggle on the left side. The charging handle reciprocates when the gun is fired.

Controls

Those shooters with small- to medium-size hands will find the reach to be longer than on an AR or the SCAR. Some may have difficulty reaching the controls without altering their grip. For an even longer reach, the grip backstrap can be replaced with a larger one available from the manufacturer.

The two-stage military trigger broke at just less than 5 pounds after a short take-up and just a small bit of creep. It’s not a bad trigger for a stock unit. And the gun is designed to accept standard AR-15 style magazines. It is supplied with two, and the magazine well is beveled for faster reloads.

The 805 has a polymer buttstock that can be folded to the right by pressing a button and can be adjusted for length. A non-slip rubber buttpad is installed, and the cheek piece on the comb can be moved from one side to the other.

Take Down

Field stripping for cleaning purposes is simple and requires no special tools. First, after making certain the gun is unloaded, the charging handle is retracted and allowed to go forward. The safety is engaged, and then the front takedown pin is removed. This allows the lower receiver to be moved slightly forward and pulled down, separating it from the rest of the gun.

Next, the rear takedown pin is removed and then, while pressing the takedown button at the rear of the upper receiver, the buttstock assembly slides down and away from the upper. This allows the recoil spring assembly to be withdrawn from the rear of the upper. Then the bolt carrier assembly is pulled to the rear using the charging handle and when the charging handle is aligned with the cutout in the receiver, it is withdrawn which allows the bolt carrier to be removed from the back.

The gas piston assembly is removed by rotating the valve 180 degrees while pressing a spring-loaded detent with a pointed object. The assembly can then be pulled forward and separated from the upper. The gas valve and piston are then easily pulled apart. Those familiar with the SCAR 16S may wonder why disassembly stops here and the bolt and firing pin are not removed from the bolt carrier. To do so requires a punch to drive retaining pins, something that is not easily done in the field and is probably best left to a gunsmith or armorer.

On the Line

The gun proved to be plenty accurate for a gun designed for self-defense, target practice, hunting or fun. Groups averaged around 2 inches at 100 yards, much better than the military standard for the M4 carbine. The best group was delivered by Black Hills 75-grain Match Hollow Point ammunition.

This gun has a lot of features for shooters interested in something other than an AR-15. And with an MSRP of $1,999 compared to the SCAR 16S MSRP of $2,995, the CZ 805 Bren S1 Carbine will appeal to many. For more information, contact CZ-USA, 800-955-4486, CZ-USA.com.

Gun Test: M&P 45 Shield,"By Massad Ayoob, GUNS Magazine

In only about 4 years after its introduction, Smith & Wesson’s Shield variation of their polymer-framed, striker-fired Military & Police series had already sold a million units. The pistol fit the hand well, with great trigger reach, yet was slim and flat as well as compact in all dimensions, and hit the bull’s-eye of its target, the concealed carry market. Originally offered in 9mm Parabellum and .40 S&W (with the former by far the most popular), it was introduced in .45 ACP in 2016.

The .45 Shield met with instant welcome. Two claims stood out from early adopters: “awesome trigger” and “great ergonomics.” When my test sample Shield .45 arrived, serial number HNS6552, one of my test crew got to shoot it before I did. Steve Denney, a retired police supervisor, told me it had come out of the box shooting left, but he corrected it with a universal sight pusher. Thanks, Steve!

Steve was the first on the test team to shoot this gun. He was the first to like it, but not the last.

The S&W Shield proved utterly reliable in our test. Mas handed

it around to a large group of disparate people in his classes

and it ran 100 percent. The knife is a Kruder Bliss Black.

Firing Line

In the month of August 2016 I had the chance to pass this gun around to fellow instructors while teaching in Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Connecticut. We could all tell we were shooting a .45 Shield and not the 9mm or the .40 (duh!), but this group of experienced handgunners were pretty much agreed the recoil was less than we would have expected from a full-power .45 ACP out of a petite polymer pistol weighing only about 21 ounces unloaded.

The right-hand-only thumb safety was easier for me to off-safe than the ones on my other Shields, though there seems to be no visible difference in dimension. (If you’ll forgive a pun, my thumb just tells me so, even if I can’t put my finger on it.) However, to on-safe, I had to turn the pistol a bit and break my hold for the shooting hand’s thumb to reach it, or use my support hand thumb. I find the same true with my 9mm and .40 Shields. For those who don’t care for a thumb safety at all on this type of pistol, S&W offers the .45 Shield in a no-thumb-safety configuration.

The stainless steel slide and frame is nicely sculpted for

concealed carry and the slide is coated in black Melonite.

Mas advises against using the forward under-slide serrations

to manipulate the slide.

The triggerguard (right, middle) is rounded and the trigger

itself pivots to start the release. Mas found the trigger

smooth and light.

Capacity

Each Shield in each chambering comes with one short magazine for maximum concealment of the loaded pistol, and one extended magazine creating room for the pinky finger on the grip. In the 9mm, round count is 7 and 8 respectively, while in both .40 and .45, it’s 6 and 7. In each caliber, add one more for the chambered round; these pistols are engineered to be “drop-safe.”

Recoil is subjective. Firing the 9mm, .40, and .45 Shields side by side on my range, the 9mm naturally kicked the least. To my own subjective senses, the .40 (with 180-grain subsonic FMJ) and the .45 (with 230-grain FMJ) were about equal, and neither objectionably more than the 9mm. For perspective, recoil is a lot more comfortable in the .45 Shield than .38 Special +P in the 5-shot, all-steel J-Frames once S&W’s bread-and-butter concealed handguns. Only one shooter felt the Shield .45’s greater recoil wasn’t worth the bigger hole. Several other testers said, “I’m getting one of these.” And one already had. He goes by the Internet nom de plume of “Justin Opinion” and his review of the .45 Shield can be found on the GunsAmerica website.

Although some testers found the stippling too aggressive, Mas

found it glued the pistol to his hand and caused no discomfort

in shooting. This version features a slide safety just under

the rear slide serrations, and to the left is the slide release.

Below is the mag release, which is positive in use yet secure

from accidental dropping of the mag in carry.

Ergonomics

Reach to the trigger is short. This is one reason it has become very popular for folks with smaller hands. My fingers are about average length for an adult male, and this lets me get my distal joint instead of the pad of the index finger on the trigger, affording more leverage.

The .45 Shield has a new, more aggressive stippling pattern. It’s one of the first things a shooter notices picking it up. Shooters with .45 Shield experience seem split on this. I really like it, and so did most folks on the test team. On the Internet however, I see a few owners who feel the stippling is too aggressive, and feel it stings their hand upon recoil. Using my usual hard grasp I did feel the stippling each time the .45 Shield discharged, but it was closer to a “tingle” than a “sting.” If I had been shooting a thousand rounds a day, I might have changed my opinion partway through. The aforementioned Justin Opinion loves the rubbery Talon grip treatment for the Shield .45, and with this or a grip sleeve available, any downside to the .45 Shield’s aggressive stippling pretty much goes away.

Trigger

A few years ago when Jim Unger of Smith & Wesson showed me the first Shields at a trade show, I exclaimed, “My God, Jim, the trigger is better than on your regular M&P’s!” Déjà vu! Almost everyone who tried our test sample said something like, “That’s the best pull I’ve ever felt on a factory Shield!” There’s a light, grit-free take-up… then a smooth, short “roll,” and finally, a clean release.

Testing the Shield .45’s trigger pull on the Lyman digital gauge, average pull weight from the toe of trigger ran 6 pounds. Average from the center of trigger turned out to be 6.63 pounds, which is less than the usual difference between these two measuring points on a pivoting trigger like the Shield’s.

At 25 yards from a Caldwell Matrix rest on a concrete bench, S&W’s .45 Shield was tested with factory loads in the three most popular bullet weights for the caliber. Group size was determined between the farthest shots being measured, center-to-center of the bullet holes, to the nearest 0.05-inch. Overall group size came first, a good determinant of what the gun could do in stabilized, experienced human hands with stress factored out, followed by measurement of the best three hits, which is a reliable predictor of what the whole 5-shot group would have been with the same gun and ammo from a machine rest.

Remington’s 185-grain JHP put all five shots in 1.45 inches, and the best three 0.30 center to center. This amazing “sub-group” consisted of one raggedy hole, the third bullet hole all but disappearing at the bottom between the other two in the cluster. This was the best group of the test.

SIG V-crown 200-grain JHP delivered five hits in 3.80 inches, the best three in 1.90. The 230-grain full metal jacket is the classic training load for a .45 ACP, and was represented here with Federal’s RTP, which stands for “Range, Target, Practice.” This load put all five 230-grain FMJ’s into 2.30 inches (talk about coincidence!) and 0.55 for the best three. Needless to say, I was happy with the accuracy.

There’s not a lot of size difference between Shields. Here are

the .45 (top), .40 (center, with mini Viridian light attached),

and (bottom) the 9mm.

The SIG 200-grain V-Crown JHP fired at 25 yards delivered

fine accuracy from the small pistol.

Reliability

I lost count of how many rounds got put through the gun by the many hands offered a chance to shoot it, but several hundred including ball, assorted JHP, and even the occasional lead bullet reload went downrange. There were zero malfunctions of any kind. The only Shields I’ve seen malfunction in classes turned out to be bone dry, and once lubed perked 100 percent again. I expect similar performance long-term with the .45 version.

Worn in a Galco belt slide after 3 months plus carrying a full-size, all-steel 1911, the feathery Shield almost felt as if it wasn’t there; I kept touching it with my forearm or elbow to make sure the holster wasn’t empty. Concealment under an un-tucked, open-front shirt was fine. Switching a Kydex IWB from Green Force Tactical, the Shield .45 disappeared under a T-shirt… for a bit less than an hour. Remember our discussion of the aggressive stippling? The skin on my side was not as forgiving as that on my palm. I tucked in the T-shirt between gun and flesh, donned a vest, and all was fine again.

Dislikes? There were a few. I’ve mentioned the downside of the stippling issue, and the difficulty in putting it on-safe 1-handed. I am still trying to figure out the purpose of the ugly, vestigial little scallops on the lower front of the slide. They’re too small to give traction to a support hand performing a chamber check from the front, and to my mind, are close enough to the muzzle on this very short pistol for me to worry about using. Several users on the Internet and a couple of my test team complained about getting the last round or two in the magazine by hand, though even my old arthritic fingers could do it. I did notice inserting a full magazine with the slide forward on a tactical reload took a good, solid smack to guarantee seating, and this is a downside point for me.

The perks clearly outweigh the quirks, though. The accuracy was much better than I had dared to hope for, the recoil controllable, and the size almost unnoticeably greater than the smaller Shields that preceded the .45. It’s an excellent value at a manufacturer’s suggested retail of $479 comparing favorably with the price of subcompact .45’s of similar design, weight, size and capacity.

Steve Denny’s sight adjustment was spot on. Remington 185-grain

gave Mas the tightest group from the 25-yard bench right where

he aimed them.

Even practice ammo delivers fine accuracy. Here Federal RTP 230-grain

FMJ fired at 25 yards from the S&W Shield .45 put three together.

“Justin Opinion” demonstrates why he likes the .45 Shield.

Carrying the Shield

As the .45 Automatic Colt Pistol version joins the 9mm and .40 S&W Shield in your gunshop’s showcase, we are reminded why this pistol has become so popular for concealed carry permit holders, off duty cops and uniformed officers who carry backup guns. The .45 is 1.05-inch thick at its widest point, and the 9mm and .40 only 1/10-inch narrower. The Shield’s dimensions widen the number of its concealed carry options.

In a belly band, it conceals and carries quite comfortably under a tucked-in shirt in crossdraw, appendix, or behind on the strong-side hip. In the former two positions it’s short enough it probably won’t dig into your groin or thigh when sitting.

I found the Shield a little big for pocket carry, but many have found it more adaptable for this purpose than I. Its flat profile conceals well in “Dockers”-style dress slacks, or in cargo pants. Use a pocket holster!

Breast pocket carry suits the Shield also, though you’ll want heavier than tropical-weight fabric to prevent sag. Again, use some sort of “pistol pocket protector.” I like the Remora holster for this application.

The Shield seems to be most commonly carried on the belt. Its slim profile lends itself well to inside the waistband carry. I’ve found the CrossBreed with its wide, soft leather backing to be exquisitely comfortable with both .45 and smaller Shields. For the many who prefer outside the waistband holsters, the thinness of the Shield combined with its short dimension from butt to top of slide allows the best possible concealment while still affording swift access.

Don’t carry a pistol of this type loose in a pocket, or with anything else in the same pocket that’s holding it and its holster! For those who disregard this advice, the option of a right-hand-only thumb safety on the Shield allows at least one safety net.

Gun Test: Savage B.MAG .17 Winchester Super Magnum,"By Eric Conn, Gun Digest

There we sat, a group of gun writers perched on a rolling South Dakota hill on the Rosebud Indian Reservation, blasting away at prairie dogs with a host of new Savage rifles. The summer sun baked down on us and the barrels ran hot, but none of it was enough to deter us from slinging round after round at the hundreds of dogs scattered before us. We drank from giant, frozen jugs of ice melted in the sunlight, quenching our thirst but not our appetite for more shooting.

It was on that trip that I inherited a fondness for Savage’s new B.Mag, a bolt-action rifle chambered in .17 Winchester Super Magnum (WSM). At first glance it’s just another black, synthetic-stocked rifle, but upon closer inspection, there are plenty of features to fall in love with. Over the course of a few days spent in South Dakota, I had ample time behind the rifle, most of which was marked by the kind of hearty laughter and cackling that every experienced prairie dog shooter knows all too well.

Speed Kills

The .17 WSM, which was released in conjunction with Savage at the 2013 SHOT Show in Las Vegas, launches a 20-grain projectile at roughly 3,000 fps, an impressive feat for such a pint-sized cartridge. During the trip we shot Federal Premium’s American Eagle loads with 20-grain tipped bullets. The load performed admirably and is a good choice for a full day of blasting away, with a box of 50 rounds running about $16 at your local sporting goods store. The rifle and ammunition, not to mention the 2.5-pound AccuTrigger, made for an incredibly accurate combination.

–

Interestingly enough, the .17 WSM was developed from a .27-caliber nail gun blank, which was then necked down for a .17-caliber bullet. Maximum internal pressure is around 33,000 psi and roughly 7,000 psi more than the .17 HMR. The 3,000 fps velocity is about 630 fps faster than the HMR, giving you about 7.5 inches of movement in a 10 mph crosswind at 200 yards versus the HMR’s 16.5 inches. Less wind drift and bullet drop mean better accuracy at considerable range. The .17 WSM doesn’t create the kind of carnage and high-flying gymnastic moves on prairie dogs that are so common with cartridges like the .22-250 or .204 Ruger, but it’s got plenty of pop out to at least 150 yards and is still more accurate at longer ranges than the .17 HMR or .22 Magnum, both close range killers in their own right.

It also lacks the wallop of another of my favorites, the .17 Hornet, but is affordable to shoot and produces virtually no recoil. While Winchester boasts of “devastating performance” at “ranges well past 200 yards,” I found the cartridge consistently accurate and lethal out to 150 yards, especially given South Dakota’s notoriously obnoxious winds. If you’re coyote or bobcat hunting, the .17 WSM is effective out to moderate ranges and helps limit pelt damage, something everyone who’s spent evenings sowing fur can appreciate.

17 Series

The B.Mag rifle fits neatly into Savage’s 17 Series and weighs about 4.5 pounds without a scope, making it an ideal walk-around or maneuverable truck gun. With scope you’re still at less than 7 pounds, which is ideal for field carry but more susceptible to movement with the wind. To help alleviate that issue, I employed sandbags in the front and rear of the rifle atop a sturdy steel tripod-style shooting bench.

One of the most interesting features on the B.Mag is the bolt, which is a completely new design for this rifle. Savage’s engineers tailored the bolt specifically for the .17 WSM; it features dual, opposed, rear-locking lugs and it cocks on closing. The rationale is that this gives the shooter better cocking leverage against a stout firing pin spring, which is also required for reliable ignition on the rimfire. Practically, this means it’s easy to short stroke the bolt, and many times you think you’ve closed it but haven’t. The solution, which requires a bit of practice and reformed muscle memory, is to firmly push all the way forward and then close the bolt. A bit unusual and not altogether smooth, but it’s a workable design once you figure out the mechanics of it.

The other staple of the rifle is of course the AccuTrigger, a revolutionary design that incorporates an adjustable, finely tuned trigger into an affordable package. Out of the box, the trigger on my rifle was under 3 pounds and crisp as always.

The 22-inch barrel is button rifled and features a light contour, sporter-type barrel. A heavier barrel contour makes sense for hardcore varmint applications, an option Savage now offers in several other B.Mag packages, including blued heavy barrel, stainless heavy barrel, sporter and target models. Prices range from $379 for the standard rifle to $578 for the target model.

Field Comparisons

One of the biggest benefits of our South Dakota adventure was that we got to shoot multiple different calibers and rifles in the same conditions, everything from .17 HMR to .22-250. So how do the mighty .17s stack up? Personally, I’d rank them in this order: .17 Hornet, .17 WSM, .17 HMR. It’s not really a fair comparison, two being rimfires and the Hornet a centerfire, but it’s always fun to stir the pot.

The .17 Hornet is, in my opinion, one of the finest of the varmint cartridges around, sending a 20-grain V-Max bullet downrange at a whopping 3,650 fps. I shot the Savage rifle in .17 Hornet one afternoon until, ammo supplies starting to run low, they had to pry that rifle out of my hands. Not only is the round insanely accurate, it remains steady in the wind and relatively flat shooting out to 300 yards. Impact on prairie dogs is more similar to what you’d see from the .204 and .22-250 and again, there’s very little recoil. On the downside, Hornet ammo is about double the price of WSM, depending on which load you select.

Next, I’d rank the .17 WSM. It carries more velocity and is accurate to greater distances than the HMR, and prices on ammunition are fairly similar (depending on load). Both are effective rounds for varmint and coyote, so long as you don’t go trying to pull off a 300-yard shot in 30 mph winds. Especially inside 100 yards, the HMR is extremely effective. The main thing, as always, is knowing your own capability as a shooter, combined with your load, optic, rest and rifle pairing.

Parting Shots

For a budget-friendly rifle that’s built to last, incredibly accurate and enjoyable to shoot, Savage’s B.Mag does the trick. The .17 WSM is a highly accurate, lethal round out to 200 yards, great for varmint and coyote applications and assuredly pelt-friendly. The rifle is light (4.5 pounds) and thus great for carry afield or for shooters of smaller stature. While the bolt design takes some getting used to, it makes for a reliable platform. For well under $400 on the street, the B.Mag in .17 WSM is one of the best varmint rifles available today.

Army Howitzer Has ‘Covfefe’ Stamped On The Gun [PHOTO],"A U.S. Army howitzer is trolling the world thanks to a Trump-related message one soldier stamped on the gun.

A photo provided to The Daily Caller shows the word “Covfefe’ stamped on the gun of an M109 Paladin.

A source told TheDC that an individual made the stamp, not the U.S. Army.

Twitter exploded about the possible meaning of “covfefe” when Trump made a typo in a tweet on May 30, accidentally writing, “Despite the constant negative press covfefe.”

He followed it up, “Who can figure out the true meaning of ‘covfefe’ ??? Enjoy!”

Most Twitter users joked about the typo, but some oddly suggested it might be secret message to the Russians. Trump supporters on Twitter started changing their names to “covfefe” to show solidarity with the president.

Now, a service member with a sense of humor has gotten in on the action with the freshly painted howitzer.

UPDATE (8:19 pm EDT): An earlier version of this article misidentified the M109 Paladin as a “tank.” It is a self propelled howitzer.

Gun Test: Browning X-Bolt Pro,"By Jeff Johnston, American Hunter

I believe Browning’s X-Bolt hunting rifle line is one of the most underrated on the market. Introduced in 2008, the original Hunter version still represents a great mid-level production rifle at a reasonable price. It also has a few features that are truly innovative.

Today Browning offers the X-Bolt in nearly two dozen variations in an array of calibers. For its latest version, the iconic Utah-based company rolled out what is likely the finest pure hunting rifle to ever be stamped with the Buckmark. It’s called the X-Bolt Pro.

While the original X-Bolt was an evolution of the company’s excellent A-Bolt, the X-Bolt Pro is a deluxe version of the X-Bolt that borders on semi-custom. The Pro’s streamlined design appears modern to my eyes but not abstract as it did back in ’08, so I’ll spare you the description of its aesthetics and get right into the guts of the gun.

In essence, it’s a bolt-action, 6.5-pound rifle featuring a detachable box magazine, true carbon-fiber stock, sporter-weight fluted barrel, innovative trigger and striking bronze-colored Cerakote finish. The rifle is made in Japan by the 124-year-old Miroku company, just as Browning firearms have been since 1977. In terms of engineering and quality manufacturing, Miroku holds its own with anyone, something that’s apparent the moment you heft the Pro.

The X-Bolt’s action is a six-sided, steel affair with the recoil lug sandwiched between the receiver and the barrel. A raceway on the right side of the receiver’s interior accepts a small nodule on the bolt. While it looks somewhat like a wart, the bump prevents the bolt from binding no matter how hard you try to bind the thing. The three-lug, spiral-fluted bolt features a hybrid extractor and a plunger ejector. During testing I had only silky smooth feeding, which is also a product of the rifle’s rotary magazine that does not stagger shells but aligns them with the chamber.

The Pro’s bolt handle terminates in a custom-looking fluted knob while its root houses one of the line’s innovative features: a bolt-unlock button that, when pushed, allows the bolt to open even when the safety is engaged and the bolt is otherwise locked. The safety is tang-mounted so it’s ambidextrous; its movement is minimal so it’s fast and quiet. Finally, a cocking indicator under the rear of the bolt reveals the rig’s status. In total, I think the X-Bolt’s safety system that allows carrying the gun with the bolt locked but also opening the bolt without taking the gun off safe is one of the best currently available.

Browning’s Feather trigger is another innovation. A patented, three-lever design maximizes leverage so pull weight can be kept fairly low while remaining safe if the rifle is dropped. The gold-colored trigger is unique in that it has literally zero creep or overtravel. While it is adjustable, I found that the trigger in my test rifle couldn’t be adjusted for a pull weight of less than 3 pounds, 8 ounces. Not bad, but I wish it were 3 pounds or a whisper under.

Perhaps the Pro’s most distinguishing feature is its ultra-high-end stock. It’s made of a carbon-fiber weave that’s wrapped 360 degrees around a core. The 1.6-ounce job is superior to most other wood, plastic and composite stocks, including earlier carbon-fiber stocks, in that it’s many times more rigid, yet also lighter. That means the barrel will remain free-floated even if you rest the tip of the fore-end on a rock and lean in. It won’t bend. What’s more, it’s filled with compressed foam to muffle sound. The stock supplies the foundation upon which glass bedding material is laid and to which the action is mated, just as with custom guns. Finally, the lithe, straight-line stock features a subtle palm swell and ends in Browning’s Inflex recoil pad that has a mushy interior to mitigate kick. I was glad to have it.

The X-Bolt’s bottom metal is actually metal—as it should be for a $2,000 rifle—though its magazine is made of polymer. It’s the very rigid variety that in many ways is tougher than metal. You might say I’m playing both sides here, but even our troops think polymer detachable box magazines are superior to metal ones because if a thin feed lip of a metal magazine gets dented even slightly, the mag is useless. Polymer magazines also don’t rust. The flush-fitting, nearly seamless X-Bolt mag pops in and out of the gun with ease.

After a quality barrel is rifled, lapping is generally what separates the good ones from the great ones, and that’s exactly what’s done to the X-Bolt Pro’s stainless steel barrel before it leaves the factory. The process smoothes microscopic imperfections in the steel, which leads to a more accurate rifle. The Pro’s muzzle is threaded, and the rifle comes with a muzzle brake and a thread protector. I like the brake for the range and the thread protector while hunting. Unfortunately, though, the barrel’s thin contour does not permit the muzzle to be threaded in any of the common patterns typically used by suppressors and their mounting devices.

Nearly every exterior part, including the stock, is finished in a burnt-bronze shade of Cerakote. This adds cost, but it’s worth it. Cerakote makes the rifle virtually impervious to the elements. The color is the best of both worlds: I’ve noticed it turns human heads but not those of animals.

A custom-like gun has got to shoot or it’s got nothing on many of today’s budget rifles. Considering the Pro’s barrel is only .61 inch in diameter at the muzzle, my guess was groups would open after the barrel heated. That was confirmed, but I rode it hard anyway. Groups started out under an inch and then widened as the barrel became too hot to handle. That’s the tradeoff to the Pro’s weight, reduced in part by thinning the barrel. Frankly, though, this isn’t a target rifle. It’s a sub-inch-when-not-blistering-hot hunting rifle designed to be carried all month in any weather, and then shot with deadly precision when called. As such, the Browning X-Bolt Pro is one of my favorites.

Gun Test: SIG Sauer P290RS,"By Massad Ayoob, Gun Digest

A double-action-only variation of the original P290, the SIG P290RS offers shooters a reliable and compact pistol, with the peace of mind of re-strike capabilities.

The SIG P290RS was released in 2012, a double-action only variant of the original P290, produced to meet users’ demands for re-strike capabilities.

There are four other major redesign points on the P290RS from the original: an added beavertail, rounded slide-lock lever, trimmed down magazine release button and a lengthened lip on the magazine.

The trigger pull is consistent on the P290RS, breaking at a predictable 9 pounds each time; however, being DAO, it is an extremely long trigger pull.

The P290RS proved reliable in the author’s testing, though due to its extremely small size, it does take time to grow accustomed to shooting the handgun.

A year after its introduction, SIG’s smallest 9mm gets some meaningful design changes.

The guns I call “slim-nines,” 9mm carry pistols made thin and ultra-compact, are a hot item today. SIG’s entry is the P290. I first saw it in the fall of 2010 at the IACP (International Association of Chiefs of Police) conference. It was introduced in January 2011 at the SHOT Show.

–

Some concerns showed up in its first year in the field. There were reports of occasional misfires. Because a lot of buyers were fans of traditional double-action SIG Sauer pistols, they didn’t appreciate the fact that, like so many striker-fired autos, these new guns wouldn’t let you just pull the trigger again if you got a misfire, one SIG exec later informed me. The folks at SIG Sauer in Exeter, N.H., came up with a few other tweaks that could be wrought on the P290, too.

As a result, the redesigned P290RS was introduced right at a year after the original P290, at the 2012 SHOT Show. It’s not another option, it’s a total replacement of the older gun.

Key Features

The trigger mechanism is the defining new feature — but not the only one — on the P290 RS. The suffix in its designation stands for Re-Strike. SIG Sauer’s product manager at the Exeter plant, Tim Butler, tells me that the change involved a redesign of trigger bar, sear, and hammer. The result is a long, conventional double-action-only trigger stroke. The trigger goes much farther back before sear release than on the first iteration, but has proportionally less backlash.

The obvious advantage is that it gives an immediate second “shot” at a recalcitrant primer in the event of a misfire. Some don’t see this as a big deal, because they follow the doctrine that a bad round that’s failed them once doesn’t get a second chance, and their preferred response to a “click” instead of a “bang” is a fast “tap-rack-assess the situation in front of you.”

An absolutely undeniable advantage of the P290RS over its predecessor, however, is that it’s much more friendly for dry fire. Instead of having to interrupt your trigger pulling practice by breaking your hold and retracting the slide between dry “shots,” the P290RS owner can roll the trigger continuously.

There have been four other changes. Apparently some folks had hands beefy enough that the web of their palm could ride up and get pinched by the bottom of the external hammer during the slide cycle. (That never happened to this writer with the P290, but this writer doesn’t have the world’s biggest hands, either.) In any case, a subtle, rounded beavertail has been added at the rear of the grip tang. For smaller-handed shooters, it won’t hurt anything; for those with meatier paws, it could be a deal-sealer for this little 9mm.

The lower rear edge on the slide-lock lever of the earlier P290 had a rather sharp corner, and I can see where that would have been a problem for those who shoot with straight thumbs. That corner has been very nicely rounded. Good for you, SIG! There’s another manufacturer of powerful subcompact pistols which has long ignored a similar well-founded criticism.

On the first variation, the magazine release button stood up “loud and proud.” The good news was, when you were doing a speed reload, that big button was easy to hit. The bad news was, when you weren’t trying to dump the mag, it was still easy to hit. There were reports of some buyers carrying it inside their waistband, along with a personal “spare tire,” whose excess flesh accidentally popped the magazines. For the P290RS, the mag release button was trimmed down some in hopes of curing that problem.

–

Finally, for some users, the super-small profile that was the P290’s raison d’etre proved to be too small. Those consumers felt they couldn’t get enough hand on the gun when shooting. A lengthened lip on the P290RS magazine created enough additional frontal length for both middle finger and ring finger to gain a secure purchase. (For those who want minimum butt size in every dimension, the P290RS comes with a flush-bottom floorplate that can be installed on the new magazine which, like the old, holds six rounds. Older mags will work in the new version of the P290, and vice versa.)

Moreover, the P290RS comes with an additional eight-round magazine featuring a grip extension. The thing was a test of strength insofar as getting the eighth round in, but it worked fine, and didn’t bind upon insertion, even with the slide closed.

The slide stop on the first P290 had a sharp edge at the lower rear. It is rounded on the P290RS.

Trigger pull

P290s in their first generation had a trigger pull somewhere between 9 pounds and off-the-chart, the latter referring to the fact that the most popular pull gauge hits its limit at about 12 pounds. The test P290RS when tested on a Lyman digital trigger pull gauge from Brownells averaged 9.23 pounds of pull weight, when leaving the slide forward throughout and just pulling the gauge on the trigger. However, when cocking the slide to duplicate live fire cycling between each test trigger pull, the average weight went up to 9.60 pounds of average pull.

Accuracy

Strangely enough, over the years it has become common to test short-barrel handguns at short ranges — 5, 7, 10, or 15 yards — instead of at the 25-yard line, which is where fighting handgun accuracy has been judged ever since this old man came on the scene. Not yet having “gotten the memo” that people with short-barrel hand guns will be “given a handicap” in a gunfight across a parking lot, this writer continues to test short barrel and longer-barrel defensive handguns alike at the traditional distance of 25 yards.

–

Working hand-held off a Matrix rest on a concrete bench at a measured 75 feet, I tried out the P290RS with the three most popular bullet weights in 9mm Luger/9mm Parabellum/9×19. (You know the cartridge has been around for a while when there are at least three different designations for the same darn thing.) I used my standard protocol: measuring each five-shot group center to center between the farthest hits, and then taking a second measurement of the best three hits. A test done for American Handgunner a decade ago, with me and Charles Petty, confirmed that the “best three” measurement under these circumstances would come remarkably close to what the same gun and cartridge would do from a properly adjusted Ransom machine rest. It’s a useful tool, because most folks don’t have access to a machine rest, but most of them can test their hardware from a solid bench rest, to compare their results with what the gun writer might be getting.

147-grain subsonic 9mm rounds became trendy in the late 1980s. Winchester developed the concept with their original OSM (Olin Super Match), created at the behest of Special Forces personnel who wanted super-accurate 9mm rounds that could center an enemy sentry’s head from a suppressed MP5 submachine gun. The exemplar of the concept for this test was the inexpensive Remington-UMC 147-grain full metal jacket round, which this writer has seen win many a pistol match. From the SIG Sauer P290RS, it put five shots into 4.25 inches from 25 yards. It must be noted that four of those five shots were in 2.45 inches, and the significant “best three” shots created a tight group of 1.10 inches. (Measurements were to the nearest 0.05 inch.)

For most of the epoch of the 9mm Luger cartridge, the 124-grain bullet was the heaviest load available. For this test, our 124-grain exemplar was the Hornady XTP load, using a deep-penetrating jacketed hollow point projectile. The five shots went into 4.35 inches, and the best three of those formed a 2.80-inch group.

–

When this writer was a young puppy cop, if you wanted a hollow point 9mm round, it was going to weigh 115 grains. Our test load in that bullet weight was the Federal Classic, coded by its manufacturer as “9BP,” which over the decades proved itself to be one of the most accurate loads ever produced in its caliber. It re-proved that in this test, with a five-shot group measuring 4.05 inches. Four of those shots were a mere two and a quarter inches apart, and the “best three hits” measurement was “the best of the test,” 65/100ths of one inch center to center. That is simply amazing performance from a short barrel pocket pistol with a heavy trigger pull at, remember, 25 yards, not 25 feet.

For a very long time now, “conventional gun wisdom” has held that a 4-inch group at 25 yards was “acceptable combat accuracy” from a full-size 9mm service pistol. The P290RS, an itty bitty pocket pistol, came achingly close to that: 4.15 inches with 147 grain, 4.35 inches with 124 grain, and 4.05 inches with 115 grain averages under four and a quarter inches. By that standard, we have in the SIG P290RS a pocket-size 9mm that needs to make no apologies at all in terms of accuracy. This was, after all, a small, light gun with a long trigger pull much heavier than the gun’s own weight. I have no doubt that its intrinsic accuracy is much greater than what I was able to wring out of it in five-shot groups.

Shooting and carrying the P290RS

I wore the little SIG 9mm for a while on my non-dominant-side hip as a backup, in the useful new Remora holster. Comfort was exquisite: no sharp edges anywhere.

Because of the long trigger pull and concomitantly long trigger return, I wasn’t able to get the speed in rapid fire that I’d expect from some other fire control mechanisms. Recoil had a bit of a snap for 9mm Parabellum, but nothing I could call uncomfortable. The shape of the P290RS causes it to point low for me, but that’s subjective: dry handling in the gun shop will quickly show whether it’ll be a problem for you, before you put your money on the counter.

This little pistol passed through a lot of hands among my test group. Only one shooter had a problem: A man with very long fingers found his middle finger (and particularly his thumb, in the thumb-down grasp he prefers) rode the magazine release and three times caused the mag to drop when he didn’t want it to. The long, heavy trigger pull didn’t make a lot of friends, but the little SIG’s comfortable size and rounded edges were both unanimously appreciated. Several also liked the fact that by putting their thumb on its flat hammer, they could holster the P290RS without fear of an unintended discharge if a drawstring from a warm-up jacket or something like that got fouled in the trigger area.

Throughout the whole test, there were only two malfunctions. One was a 12 o’clock misfeed with a 147-grain load, quickly rectified with a tug on the slide. The other was a misfire (on a Federal round, of all things, famous for sensitive primers). As per the “RS” design, I just pulled the trigger again, and the shot went downrange. Both malfs occurred early in the first 50 shots during “break-in.” There were no further mechanical malfunctions.

All in all, despite a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $758, this handy little 20.5-ounce seven-shooter is a definite contender in the currently hot niche of subcompact 9mm carry pistols.

Would Stricter Gun Control Laws Have Prevented Mandalay Bay Massacre?,"Gun control has once again become a central issue in national politics, following the Mandalay Bay shooting in Las Vegas, and Democratic lawmakers are already calling for stricter gun control reforms. But can these desired gun control laws actually prevent mass shootings?

John Lott, author of “More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime And Gun Control Laws,” claims that gun violence is not a problem that can be legislated away. The author said that it’s Democrats pushing gun control that don’t have American’s best interests at heart.

“We don’t even know all the facts yet. What is going to happen is Democrats are trying to push for this poison pill. The main reason they push these reforms is because they want to make it costly for people to go and buy guns,” Lott told The Daily Caller News Foundation.

Background checks are presented as simple and cheap, Lott said, but are actually a way of pricing out potential gun owners by charging them higher rates for approval.

“It costs $175 to do a background check on a private transfer. Those are real costs. It may not stop you or I from buying a gun but it will stop minorities in high crime neighborhoods,” Lott said. “Under Obama you had things like the social security rule that said if people got help with their finances, they couldn’t go and own a gun. Two million people on social security would be banned from buying a gun, and they’ve been doing the same things to veterans.”

Democratic lawmakers, like Sens. Chris Murphy and Dick Blumenthal of Connecticut have already started insisting on gun legislation, along with Sen. Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts.

Murphy said on MSNBC that the idea of a mourning period was just a “tool” used by the gun lobby to delay talk of reform. He also released a statement less than 24 hours after the massacre, urging Congress to “get off its ass and do something.”

Connecticut state Sen. Joe Markley, who is currently running for lieutenant governor, opposes Murphy’s gun control agenda and told TheDCNF that it’s ill advised to assume the government can fix this problem.

“I’ve read this maniac had been thorough background checks and there was nothing to flag him. So this idea that more background checks or banning certain types of guns will stop someone like this isn’t true,” Markley said. “It’s simply intellectually dishonest. Doing more of the same, and enacting laws that aren’t working only serves to harass law abiding citizens and Murphy knows it. He’s banking on the fact that the public is confused enough to buy his rhetoric because it sounds good. But in the end it doesn’t produce results.”

Markley thinks mass shootings and mental breakdowns can be linked to society’s newfound dependence on technology. That, coupled with the erosion of spirituality have created a recipe for disaster.

“It may be the price of the kind of society we live in nowadays. Which has made an awful lot of people unable to function and has left them in a state of extreme depression,” he said. “Most people are in need of medication to deal with their day to day lives and I think there is something at the root of society that’s gone wrong. The fading of religious faith has left a hole in people’s lives that has gnawed at them, and led to ridiculous acts of violence like the one we saw in Nevada.”

Gun Test: A Used $200 Fugly Colt Detective Special,"By Massad Ayoob, GUNS Magazine

So there I was in one of my favorite gun shops, when something a couple of shelves down in the “used” showcase caught my eye. I did a double take and asked, “Could I see that one, please?”

I could’ve sworn it was a Colt Detective Special with silvery aftermarket finish, and a price tag of just under $200. It turned out I had. Closer inspection explained the price tag.

Some shade-tree ‘smith had made this little snubbie a guinea pig for what was likely a first attempt at a baked-on finish job. The surface was beyond rough. It was flaking off on the cylinder yoke, scratched through elsewhere, and appeared to have been applied unevenly toward the front of the cylinder.

The salesman told me it was a trade-in from a fellow who liked to do his own gunsmithing at home. Gun dealers cringe at that. They’ve seen too many DIY action jobs where the guns don’t reliably go bang anymore. Or safety devices neutered in hope of making the trigger a little lighter. They see them as a liability, and if they take them in trade at all, they buy at a low-ball price and sell accordingly, with the caveat the gun goes out the door “as-is.”

I gave it a quick armorer’s check. The yoke was solidly flush with the frame. Timing was perfect, as was barrel/cylinder gap. No end-shake. Whoever had slicked up the inside had known his Colts: there was barely a hint of the V-shaped mainspring’s trigger “stacking” that had long since given the Colt a reputation for a 2-stage double-action trigger. Because they have a longer hammer throw and trigger pull than their J-Frame counterparts from Smith & Wesson, these D-Frame Colts have a proportionally lighter DA pull. This one had been made lighter still—but very smooth.

Finally, the hammer spur had been bobbed off. This doesn’t seem to be a problem on a Smith or Ruger, but on D-Frame Colts the procedure had a reputation for making ignition dicey. Pachmayr Compac grips completed the package.

Here’s the deal with shade-tree ’smiths. For all their reputation of “Bubba-izing” good guns, some of them stay with it long enough to get darn good at it. One such when I was young (who will remain nameless) got such a rep for too-slick S&W’s to the point they were no longer reliable, any used Smith found in local gun shops would draw the question from the cognoscenti, “Did (name deleted) trade this gun in?” If the answer was yes, the customer would make the sign of the cross or something and step back from the counter. But so-and-so stayed with it, and long before his untimely passing, he created some of the sweetest custom S&W’s on the planet. I had the feeling whoever had done this little Colt might have been following the same path.

For a $199 price tag, Mas can forgive a lot of “bad optics.”

First rapid fire 7-yard cylinderful showed promise.

Six high-chest hits in a hand-span from the 25-yard barricade is plenty OK for a 2-inch DAO .38 snubbie.

Performance vs. Appearance

Naturally, I reached for the credit card with one hand and the iPhone for the FFL with the other. When I got home the DS was waiting for me. On the range, six fast shots at 7 yards went into an inch and a half with four touching. Back at 25 yards from a right-hand barricade stance, the next six bullets went into a hand-size cluster. The groups were a bit high left of point of aim, but that was common with fixed-sight D-Frame Colts back in the day, and nothing that couldn’t be fixed. Primer hits were deep and centered. I was happy. My little orphan rescue puppy was turning out to be a shooter.

When I was looking the Detective Special over at the sales counter with the price tag still on it, folks standing nearby looked at the finish and said “God, that’s ugly.” My significant other looked at it and said “Mas, it’s not just ugly, it’s fugly!”

My answer? “Who cares? I’m gonna carry it concealed anyway! And it’s so ugly, I’ll be all the more motivated to keep it concealed…”

“But it’s hideous!”

“It’s a Colt Detective Special. For 200 bucks!”

And there the matter sits. I’m a happy owner. I don’t care my late friend Larry Wilson would never have put it in one of his gorgeous Colt collector coffeetable books. It’s ugly but it works. And that’s true of me too, so who am I to judge?

Gun Test: SIG Sauer P365 Pistol,"By Joe Kurtenbach, American Rifleman

It’s all about the magazine. We started with the magazine, and then designed everything around that,” remarked SIG Sauer President and CEO Ron Cohen of the company’s new P365—a striker-fired, semi-automatic pistol chambered for 9 mm Luger and intended for everyday concealed carry. I caught up with Cohen during SIG’s range event in advance of the 2018 SHOT Show in Las Vegas, which was my first opportunity to put hands on the gun and put rounds downrange. Attendance at the event was limited to premier media representatives, and the buzz among my peers was wonderment at how the company had managed to pack more capacity—10 rounds of 9 mm Luger in the standard, flush-fit magazine—into a micro-compact firearm that is dimensionally similar to Smith & Wesson’s Shield, Springfield Armory’s XD-S, Ruger’s LC9s and the Glock 43. Each of those, for reference, holds seven 9 mm cartridges in their standard magazines, save the Glock, which carries six.

–

Cohen was quickly echoed by SIG’s Pistol Product Manager Phil Strader, “We actually developed a magazine from the ground up. This is our magazine, our magazine design. It’s patent-pending, and we found a way we can get 10 rounds in this tiny, little, short mag.” Prior to holding the gun, I expected to encounter a pistol that was slightly larger and wider than the aforementioned competitive models. What I found, instead, was a gun that, if anything, was smaller and lighter than others in the field. Strader continued, “We were able to keep the same width, 1″ width, a much smaller-contour grip, and actually keep the size of the gun on par, actually below, the industry average. We took four major competitive guns … averaged their heights, their weights, their lengths and we’re shorter, lighter and thinner than almost every gun in the market.”

In the spirit of “trust but verify,” I had a P365 sent to the office posthaste, and like any championship contender, the gun wasn’t going to make it into the ring without first submitting to a thorough weigh-in. At 18.6 ozs., with an empty magazine, it is definitely among the lightest guns in the category. Too, in terms of width it is on par with the competition, though, like the competition, the gun is actually closer to 0.9″ across the slide, and just a few hundredths over 1″ at the controls. The P365 offers the same 3.1″ barrel as the Shield and the LC9s, and it’s shorter than the G43 (3.4″) and XD-S (3.3″), though I think the difference is ballistically negligible. Overall length and height for the P365 are 5.8″ and 4.3″ (with the flush-fit 10-round magazine), respectively, meaning the gun will, indeed, fit inside a smaller box than its competitors. However, the most noticeable difference, in my opinion, is how narrow the grip frame is. The circumference measures just 4.9″ at its narrowest and right around 5″ at the widest portion—both noticeably smaller, visually and tactically, than the micro-compact I’m best acquainted with, the Shield, at about 5.3″ around.

How, then, did SIG pack more ammunition into a gun that is as small or smaller, in every dimension, than its direct competitors? “Pixie dust,” quipped Strader.

Regarding major components and disassembly/reassembly procedures, SIG’s P365 is similar to other polymer-frame striker-fired pistols. One difference, though, is that its slide lock/release must be pressed upward in order to fully rotate the spring-tensioned takedown lever.

–

Semi-Double-Stack

Without doubt, SIG Sauer designed a micro-compact worthy of the name, but the hook, of course, is that despite its slim, trim and featherweight dimensions, the P365 gives up nothing in terms of magazine capacity—indeed, it outmatches its peers by a relatively wide margin. So how did SIG designers do it? At the most basic level, the P365 makes use of a double-stack magazine in a category populated by single-stacks—though, in both cases, such simplistic designations are not totally accurate. Take, for example, Smith & Wesson’s M&P Shield, now a stalwart in the micro-compact category, and perhaps the most popular 9 mm rendering to date. Despite its magazine often being classified as a single-stack or single-column design, the cartridges within are not actually vertically aligned, as in, say, an M1911 magazine. Instead, it is a semi-staggered stack, and the slight left- and right-offset frees up just enough real estate to accommodate seven cartridges, where a straight vertical stack might only have fit six. The trade-off is a magazine that is slightly wider than a single-stack, but since the parent gun still comes in at around 1″ wide—the “standard” for the micro-compact category—it’s hardly an issue.

–

The P365 goes to the opposite end of the spectrum, in that it is very close to being a true double-column arrangement. Here again, though, we see a slight adjustment to the design, in this case a tighter, more vertical staggering than in standard double-stacks. To compare, the double-column magazine of SIG’s larger P320 is 0.86″ wide, which allows two 9 mm Luger cartridges to very nearly sit side-by-side. The P365’s magazine is narrower at 0.81″ wide, causing the cartridges to stack in a more staggered formation. Also, the uppermost portion of the P365 magazine—about 1″ below the feed lips—is more aggressively “funneled” than the P320 magazine, ensuring the top two cartridges form a single, vertical stack for reliable feeding. Each P365 will ship with two 10-round units, one flush-fitting and one with a small, 0.45″ grip extension. Even more interesting is the 12-round magazine, sold separately, that increases the grip height by 0.65″ and effectively gives the gun twice the capacity of its competitors, putting it “danger close” to competing with larger, double-stack compacts. The innovative hybrid design—Strader referred to it as “semi-double-stack”—accomplished two major priorities for SIG Sauer’s design team: it facilitated an overall width very close to the 1″ mark, and it measurably increases the capacity over current competitive models.

The P365 comes with two 10-round magazines, one flush-fitting, the other with a grip extension. An extended 12-round magazine is also sold seperately and greatly enhances handling. –

Beyond The Mag

It’s no secret that the American commercial firearm industry is still getting used to the new, post-Obama normal. One area that continues to be a bright spot is the market for small, personal-defense semi-automatics, and the P365 is, no doubt, SIG’s best attempt to capture a share. However, it was not that long ago that a new Shield could be purchased for just $250, after rebates, so SIG’s engineers were going to have to really deliver a feature-filled firearm that would also be efficient to manufacture. Significantly upping the onboard ammunition was a good start, but with a suggested retail price of $600 (likely closer to $500 at the gun shop counter) the P365 would still have to offer shooters some compelling characteristics to justify the investment. In the features department, it delivers.

X-Ray3 Day/Night Sights rely on a big, green, single dot for use in bright environments, and a glowing, tritium-powered, three-dot arrangement in low-light conditions. –

Starting from the top, the P365 has a very good set of sights. SIG’s X-Ray3 Day/Night Sights feature a bright, fluorescent green front dot with a central tritium vial, paired with a black, horizontally serrated square-notch rear, also equipped with tritium inserts. The result is a fast, single-dot arrangement in bright conditions, and a glowing three-dot sight picture in low light. The X-Ray3 sights have been used before on SIG Sauer’s Legion series of pistols and other upgraded models such as the P320 X-Carry. They are very good sights, very easy to use, and, considering similar aftermarket sights cost $100 or more, they add real value to the P365.

The slide, though slim, features bilateral cocking serrations fore and aft. Forward cocking serrations are becoming more common on personal-defense and competition-style pistols because they facilitate “press-checking” the firearm—that is, double-checking the gun’s condition, loaded or unloaded, by partially retracting the slide to visually observe the chamber. This is usually done by gripping the gun near the front of the slide to ensure the support hand does not block the view of the chamber. A rectangular window at the rear of the P365’s barrel assembly serves as a visual loaded-chamber indicator, rendering the press-check unnecessary, but the forward cocking serrations still make good sense because the gun and slide are so small. Large-handed shooters, or anyone trying to manipulate the slide under duress, may experience incidental contact with the forward serrations, and the angled cuts will provide improved purchase.

The P365’s controls include the left-side-only take-down lever and slide lock/release, and a user-reversible (left- or right-side)magazine release. All the controls are contoured so as not to snag or hinder concealment. –

Moving on to the polymer frame, the left side of the P365 features three familiar controls: takedown lever, slide lock/release and magazine release. The takedown lever is directly above the trigger with the slide lock just to the rear, and the triangular magazine release is in its usual position at the bottom, rear junction of the trigger guard and frame. The magazine-release button is actually reversible for use by lefties, and it’s smooth engagement surface contours down and in, toward the trigger guard, following the natural lines of the frame. The arrangement is quite stylish and certainly helps maintain the P365’s slim dimensions. In fact, all aspects of the frame are cut and contoured to improve ergonomics and utility, and to minimize width. Bilateral recesses behind the trigger provide the strong-hand digits an easy approach to the trigger and a natural thumb rest; the frame is undercut beneath the trigger guard and paired with a relatively deep beavertail to facilitate a high grip; four textured panels (front, rear and both sides) improve purchase with gritty, but not aggressive, molded stippling; and the magazine well features bilateral cutouts to aid magazine removal. There is even an integral accessory rail for the addition of a light or laser sight, however, I expect opinions to be split on this feature since, rather than using a standard Picatinny-style rail, the P365 sports a proprietary arrangement of bilateral V-shaped grooves designed to allow accessories from SIG’s electro-optics division to be clamped on. I suppose such design decisions are a privilege enjoyed by “the complete systems provider.”

Realities And Remedies

As I stated at the top, my first opportunity to shoot the P365 was at SIG Sauer’s pre-SHOT Show media event in January. At the time, I was among the agog, eager to see the little SIG with the big magazine. On the line, shooting the P365 was a treat. The sample gun ran like a champ for not just me but dozens of shooters. Recoil was a bit snappy, but that was to be expected from such a small, lightweight pistol. Overall, the gun looked great, felt great and shot great. I couldn’t wait to get one back on the NRA test range, and before I had even returned from Las Vegas, a P365 had arrived at the office for evaluation. As soon as I was able, I was on the range and ready to ride the wave of excitement that the gun had generated at SHOT. Unfortunately, what I got instead was a total wipeout.

On the very first magazine, the gun failed to go fully into battery when I released the slide—this should have been a sign. Over the course of approximately 150 rounds, this issue never corrected itself, despite cleaning and lubrication, and occurred on nearly every fresh magazine and occasionally during firing. I wanted to blame debris, my grip, anything, but the fact is, the gun just didn’t work. In addition, the first P365 I received was topped with SIGLite Night Sights—as was universally advertised at the gun’s launch—which are fine tritium-powered sights that top many SIG pistols. Unfortunately, even my brief range session had managed to kill the tritium vial in the front sight, dead. You see, the slide on a small 9 mm pistol reciprocates much faster and with more force than a larger, heavier gun, so while the SIGLites had proven their mettle with military and law enforcement agencies—taking down trash the world over—the recoil of the diminutive P365, a gun designed for civilian carry and personal defense, proved too much for the steel-clad sights.

Luckily, that is not where this story ends. Calls to SIG revealed that we had received the wrong gun. The glorified paperweight I’d first tried to shoot was actually a pre-production model that should never have been released from the factory. In SIG’s earnest attempt to get your American Rifleman an evaluation pistol, a mistake had been made—with the best of intentions, but poor execution. Thankfully, the company quickly made things right. A new gun arrived, built to spec and sporting new, and more robust, X-Ray3 Day/Night Sights—seems SIG engineers found the same weakness I had, and quietly corrected it. What follows is a performance evaluation of the P365 using a sample gun pulled straight off the production line.

On The Range

With a production sample P365 in hand, I went straight to work at the range, and was immediately relieved when it fed, fired and ejected five magazines worth of mixed 9 mm Luger cartridges—ranging in weight from 65 grs. to 147 grs.—without issue. Velocity testing of three selected loads continued without incident, and accuracy testing was extremely satisfying (full results on p. 51). For a pistol with less than 5″ of sight radius, the P365 continually shot ragged-hole five-shot groups at 7 yds., and was easy to keep “in the black” at 15 and 25 yds. The X-Ray3 sights are easy for the eyes to acquire, from the draw and after recoil, and are sighted to a combat or center hold—the part of the target that is covered by the front sight is exactly where the bullets impact.

–

I will warn readers, though, that the P365 does have some idiosyncrasies. This is a small gun, and there is very little real estate to hang on to. I typically use a high, aggressive, thumbs-forward grip when I shoot, and there just was not room to accommodate that style of grip. Early on, in fact, the meat of my support hand accidentally engaged the left-side controls and caused a couple of problems before I corrected my grip. As with any gun of this type, it doesn’t take much to engage the slide lock/release during a multi-shot string, and the most common side effect is a failure of the gun to lock open on an empty magazine. The P365’s slide lock can also be pressed upward, causing additional friction as the slide reciprocates and, in the worst case, can prevent the slide from returning fully to battery, resulting in failures to fire and identifiable by light primer strikes. The bottom line, in my opinion, is that the P365 definitely requires training and practice to perfect its use. Good, steady, two-handed grips are possible to achieve, and I was able to run the gun with 100 percent reliability, but it required an adjustment of my preferred hand position. For those who intend to carry the P365, or any micro-compact, make sure you are comfortable and confident with its characteristics and manual of arms.

With formal testing completed, and being more familiar with the handling qualities of the gun, I was able to spend some time just shooting. I did informal strings of fire, timed drills, precise shots from various distances and some work from the holster using a BlackPoint Tactical AIWB rig furnished by SIG. Throughout, the gun performed admirably. And how about that 12-round magazine? The larger grip is a revelation when it comes to controlling the gun and making fast follow-on shots—a trait especially apparent as I performed two high-speed, six-shot Bill Drills. Did I mention that I didn’t have to reload in between? It’s hard not to be impressed by the gun’s capacity. Sure, it’s a bit snappy with heavier loads, and it requires a little practice to shoot quickly, but for such a little gun to hold so much ammunition and still “disappear” into a concealment holster beneath a loose T-shirt, it really challenges the perception that concealment requires compromise.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2018/02/20/gun-test-sig-sauer-p365-pistol/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwit3aKb_7P9AhW9EFkFHWhXAZU4MhAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw1Bpf58saqm4Ev4cFli3--k,2018-02-20
Overwhelming Majority Of Studies Find That Gun Control Policies Don’t Work,"An analysis of thousands of gun control studies claims that just 63 of those studies found connections between more stringent gun control laws violent crime and suicide reductions.

The non-profit RAND corporation spent two years and $1 million on the analysis, searching for evidence of benefit from gun control policies. RAND’s analysis looked to establish connections between gun policies and rates of homicide, suicide, self-defense gun use, hunting, and other categories. The vast majority of those categories went unaffected by legislation, however, according to NPR.

“Most of the effects that we were looking for evidence on, we didn’t find any evidence,” Andrew Morral, who lead the analysis.

RAND’s analysis found some evidence that laws aimed at keeping firearms out of the hands of small children had some effect on rates of suicide and accidental gun injuries. Morral also surveyed 95 gun policy experts on both sides of the debate, asking them to rank the ideal outcomes of any given gun control legislation. The outcomes included lowering homicides, suicides, and mass shootings as well as protecting privacy, and enabling hunting and sport shooting. The vast majority of the expert responded that cutting suicides and homicides should be the top priorities.

“That was a surprise, actually,” Morral told NPR. “I think people on either side of gun policy debates think that the other side has misplaced values — or that it’s a values problem, in any case. But that’s not what we find. We find people prioritize the same things in the same order. Where they disagree is on which laws will achieve those objectives. So this is a disagreement about facts. And the facts are sparse.”

ALSO WATCH:

Many gun control advocates have called on the federal government to invest more into gathering accurate data on gun violence in America. Congress has long limited the funding for such studies and prevented gun violence from being considered a health issue that would fall under the jurisdiction of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The Kennesaw, Georgia, law states that “every head of household residing in the city limits is required to maintain a firearm,” according to CNN, and was reportedly passed as a deterrent to crime.

“It was meant to be kind of a crime deterrent,” Kennesaw Police Lt. Craig Graydon, a 30-year law enforcement veteran, told CNN. “It was also more or less a political statement because the city of Morton Grove, Illinois, passed a city ordinance banning handguns from their city limits.”

As for would-be criminals looking for an easy mark, judging by the crime statistics it seems most have bypassed the Georgia town and moved on to easier targets. Even CNN was forced to admit that Kennesaw, populated by 33,000 people, has only had “one murder in the last six years and a violent crime rate of below 2%.”

“But,” writes CNN, “it’s unclear whether that has anything to do with the gun law.”

Kennesaw’s mayor sees it differently.

“If you’re going to commit a crime in Kennesaw and you’re the criminal — are you going to take a chance that that homeowner is a law-abiding citizen?” asked Mayor Derek Easterling.

“It gives me the ability to protect myself as opposed to being somewhere where you weren’t allowed to have a firearm or it was frowned upon,” said Wayne Arnold, a local resident who is a fan of the law.

With the gun issue being in the spotlight of late, town officials have been getting plenty of attention from all over the world about their law.

“We get a lot of calls, conversation, and it seems to keep crime control, gun safety, things like that on the minds of many of the residents, because people are constantly talking about the gun law,” Lt. Graydon told CNN. “So that’s been somewhat of a benefit to us.”

Arnold noted the expectation of a “Wild West” environment with everyone walking around “with a firearm strapped to their side.”

“And it’s not like that,” said Arnold. “It’s strictly a home defense system type of deal. There’s no shootouts down the street.”

And a lot less crime than your average American city.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2018/03/08/kennesaw-georgia-gun-ownership-cnn/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwih08ya_7P9AhXDElkFHeBDDk44KBAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw1xnGKBKJtrfYpL4_fOISEk,2018-03-08
Gun Test: Kimber 10mm Super Jägare,"By Mark Hampton, American Handgunner

Photos By R. Jones/The Imagesmith, LLC

It seems every time I turn around, gun manufacturers are introducing new 10mm pistols. What’s up with the resurgence of the Centimeter? Is it hunters, folks looking for a powerful personal defense or home protection round, or shooters who simply enjoy the 10? Or is it, as I suspect, all of the above?

I’ll confess I’m happy to see the 10mm gaining traction. It’s a fine caliber, easy to shoot, easy to load and reliable in the field and for defense — maybe especially for defense. When Kimber asked me to come by their booth at a trade show I figured they wanted me to look over some new products. I wasn’t surprised when they handed me what I took to be “another 1911.” But once my vision cleared and I focused, I began to notice things setting this one apart. The big smiles from the Kimber crew should have been a tip too. Kimber’s new Super Jagare 10mm pistol was loaded with embellishments far exceeding my expectations. This is a handgunner’s handgun at every level and something special, indeed.

From The Swedish Word

Jagare is derived from a Swedish term for “Hunter.” So I guess we could say “Super Jagare” would exemplify a supreme hunter. You can basically tick off every cool point you can dream up for a gun like this, starting with the 6″ ported long slide. And it’s not only optics-ready, but comes stock with a Leupold DeltaPoint Pro already installed. This categorically takes a huge leap out of the starting gate. You start the race already ahead.

The red dot sight from Leupold is definitely an asset when it comes to hunting or shooting for groups on paper — especially for aging eyes. I’ve enjoyed this optic fitted on other 10mm pistols in the past and have never encountered a problem. The 2.5 MOA dot reticle will enhance shot placement when that big mean hog or whitetail buck comes strolling along, and target acquisition can be expeditious with a little practice. The rugged Leupold optic is directly mounted to the slide in the lowest profile possible. Nothing looks added on, it’s as if the sight was simply part of the design from the beginning. Which it likely was.

The match grade, 6″ ported stainless barrel — mated to a match-grade bushing too — wears a weather resistant coating Kimber calls Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC). There are three ports on each side of the barrel and they do indeed help with reducing muzzle flip. The Super Carry cocking serrations on the slide make slide manipulation painless even when your fingers are sweaty — which they just might be when you lay eyes on the huge hog in your sights.

This elegant gun features an ambidextrous thumb safety with a high ride grip safety. A portion of the green and black G-10 grips feature a checkered highlight, not only attractive, but also contributing to a comfortable, secure grip. The front and backstrap come with scale-like serrations Kimber calls Super Carry, providing the pistol with a positive grip under recoil.

The stainless steel rounded heel grip frame eliminates sharp edges. I appreciate its ascetic appearance too. The face of the two-hole trigger wears thin serrations and was perfectly comfortable during targeting. Kimber states a full carry melt on the frame and slide offers an increase in “wear-ability” and snag-free performance. My test gun tipped the scales at 42 ounces with an empty 8-round magazine inserted.

Kimber Quality

Overall fit and finish were what you’d expect from Kimber. The Super Jagare is well-balanced and points great. That long slide sort of “hangs” out there offering added weight to stabilize things. And the extra barrel length helps ballistics from that hot cartridge, too.

The pistol is loaded with trimmings and has a “custom shop” feel to it, making it a serious handgun not only for hunting, but personal defensive and just plain shooting pleasure. In my opinion, it’s a semi-custom production pistol ready for serious work right out of the box. It looked good, and I was anxious to find out if it was that good in the real world too.

Ammo Wealth

Not only are gun manufacturers embracing the 10mm auto but ammo companies are jumping aboard as well. There is some mighty fine factory ammo available in a variety of bullet weights designed for specific applications. For testing purposes I loaded the truck full of CorBon, Winchester, Federal, HSM, Buffalo Bore, DoubleTap, HPR, Hornady, SIG and American Eagle ammo. Just a few years ago, this would have been impossible, but this factory ammo line-up shows how shooters are driving the growth of this great round. If you make it they will come.

For plinking, practice and some range work, I shoot mainly 180-gr. FMJ loads. When hunting season approaches I switch to hunting bullets — mainly 180-gr. bullets from several makers. There are some excellent factory loads for hunting, including Federal’s 180-gr. Trophy Bonded JSP; SIG SAUER’s 180-gr. V-Crown JHP; Hornady’s 180-gr. XTP, as well as other 180-gr. offerings from HSM, CorBon, HPR, DoubleTap and Buffalo Bore. Any way you slice it; there’s plenty of quality ammo available.

At the range I started shooting at 25 yards. A black target was used in order to see the red dot more easily. The Leupold DeltaPoint Pro is easily adjusted using windage and elevation screws and it didn’t take long to get sighted-in with 180-gr. bullets. By pushing the top button on the optic you can adjust the intensity of the red dot. This is a big plus when shooting in different lighting conditions and you need to learn how to use this feature to your best advantage. Low light means a softer red glow. Bright, sunny desert days? Crank the red up.

Once everything was sorted out, I began shooting 5-shot groups. Several things caught my attention early on — this pistol can shoot. When I did my part, several groups around 2″ were achieved with more than one brand of ammo. I’m thinking younger eyes could do even better. The gun is very mild mannered, and obviously the 6″ ported barrel contributes to recoil management. Empty cases were ejected cleanly. Thanks to the assistance of Caldwell’s brass trap, I didn’t have to waste time and go searching for empty cases. The mesh netting catches all the brass slinging out of any semi-auto and it sure eliminates a lot of time-consuming frustration trying to find empty brass.

50 Yards

After dialing-in at 25 yards I moved out to 50. Groups opened up a bit but when the stars lined-up nicely, 5-shot groups hovered around 3″ to 4″. Overall, I was pleased. It was sort of an amazing thing to put the dot on the target and see bullet holes appear in the same spot. Very fun!

The 6″ long slide wasn’t too picky about ammo but did tend to favor certain loads. At least my gun did, so it’d be good to do some experimenting with yours. I moved to 75 yards, and to be perfectly honest, this is about as far as I would feel comfortable shooting at game. With Federal’s 180-gr. Trophy Bonded JSP I could put five shots inside “minute-of-boar” consistently. I’m too used to those 1″ 100-yard groups from my single-shot pistols, but still found the 5″ groups at 75 to be well within what’s needed for hunting.

At this point I only had one complaint about this remarkable 10mm. According to my Lyman digital trigger pull gauge, the trigger on my test gun broke at 5.57 lbs. Honestly, I believe my groups would shrink somewhat with a lighter trigger pull and it’d be worthwhile to invest in a bit of tweaking if your gun is the same. I’d like to see it more like a solid four, but very crisp and sharp.

–

100 Yards?

With reservations, I moved out to 100 yards. Keep in mind the 2.5 MOA dot will cover 2.5″ at this distance, which is why the size of the dot in any “dot” sight is important to know. Bigger dots might cover 6″ or more at that distance. I didn’t adjust the red dot for 100 yards, and just shot it as it was originally sighted-in at 25 yards.

Interestingly enough, the groups were not terribly low, but with my old eyes, I wouldn’t feel comfortable shooting at game from this distance with this trigger and sight combo. But what I did learn is in the right hands, I’ll readily admit I’m sure there are folks who could put this Kimber to work at 100 yards.

For me, the 10mm would be a good choice for hunting in the woods or where shots stayed inside 75 yards. But heck, I’ve killed a lot of boar and deer at 50 yards or less. Sometimes way less. On a lark, I went to the farm and shot steel plates off-hand out to 60 yards or so. I believe I could down a big pig with this pistol within 75 yards or so, even off-hand. I may have to do just that soon.

After running over 250 rounds through the Super Jagare there was not one failure encountered. I’ve found this to be the case with the 10mm in most platforms. I think the stout loads and big cartridge tend to run the 1911 design very reliably. And all of the factory ammo tested performed well. Modern technology is amazing and the consistency and overall high quality of virtually every factory load was impressive. It’s not exactly cheap to buy 10mm factory ammo, but you do seem to get what you pay for.

Even though I did not shoot any handloads, there are some very good bullets and loading data available. When I do load, I run Sierra, Nosler or Hornady 180-gr. bullets in quality Starline brass. There are many powders working well in the 10mm, including Blue Dot, W 231, Unique, 800-X, Universal and many others. I frequently use CCI primers. With the help of Redding’s T 7 turret press, you can crank out loads for practice, bowling pin matches, serious hunting medicine, or any other application you need. Handloaders can certainly add versatility to the 10mm Auto.

Final Thoughts

A friend of mine asked how I plan on carrying this pistol, and it’s really an easy choice for me. Diamond D Custom Leather makes a dandy across-the-chest rig they call the “Guides Choice.” It can even accommodate the red dot optic and comes with a spare magazine pouch. This makes a great option for long hikes, driving around on the Polaris Ranger on the farm, or even riding a horse or trail bike. The gun is carried safely and comfortably riding across your chest, not weighing your pants down or getting in the way under your arm like a standard shoulder rig.

For those who like hunting with a semi-auto, the Super Jagare is a worthy candidate. I would feel comfortable hunting hogs, deer and varmints with the Kimber, keeping in mind to keep inside the effective range of the cartridge — and your talents. There are some really good hunting bullets available for handloaders, and quality factory rounds if you don’t handload.

Hunting is not the only reason for choosing the Super Jagare. Connoisseurs of Kimber may want to add this pistol to their collection — just because. There are some who just enjoy and appreciate shooting a powerful semi-auto even if it’s at paper targets, steel plates, Zombies, or rocks on the pond bank. And, the 10mm provides plenty of stopping power for personal defense, if that’s a concern.

Who’s going to want the Super Jagare 10mm? Likely you will.

Bluing – What Is It And Why Is It Necessary For My Gun?,"By Nathan Vasick, Precision Bluing

Rust – enemy number one of your firearm. Even the smallest bit of moisture can lead to the rapid development of rust, which weakens metals on a cellular level and can lead to severe pitting more quickly than you might imagine, often in only a matter of days. So if rust attacks your gun, what can you do?

Steel treatment has existed for centuries, since well before the invention of firearms. Since the first irons were smelted in different locations around the world, the need to protect them from rust has been a principal concern, both in the kitchen and on the battlefield.

The smelting process can produce various carbon concentrations, depending on the ingredients in the smelter, and adding the carbon to wrought iron to create steel is a more reliable method that was perfected later on. Bluing was a natural progression of protecting that steel, and the treatments we use today, while more refined, carry on the ancient tradition.

If you know guns, you might have heard the term bluing before. Different forms of bluing have been used by gunsmiths and gun enthusiasts for centuries now to protect guns from wear and damage, but you might still be wondering what bluing actually is.

True bluing is an electrochemical conversion process, where the surface of the steel is converted to a form of controlled rust called Magnetite (FE3O4). This finish is extremely porous, therefore a water-displacing oil seal must be applied and maintained to prevent moisture from getting in.

While there are a few different types of bluing, the most durable forms are hot salt bluing and its predecessor, rust bluing. In the hot salt bluing process, after being beaded and polished, your firearm is soaked in an alkali salt solution at a temperature of around 300 degrees Fahrenheit.

The first step of the process is removing all of the old finish and rust. To do this, the gun is most often put into a cabinet and blasted with a fine glass bead, which ensures not a speck of rust is left to undo the change. Afterwords, the firearm is polished to the finish of your choice.

The Matte Finish is the most durable, as it creates the most surface area, and also removes the shine, making it a prime choice for hunters. The goal of a Factory Finish is to make your gun appear as though brand new, and the High Polish – a 500 grit – is for those special pieces that will most likely only be on display as this is the least durable of the three options.

After a soak in the solution, the gun is removed, rinsed, and hung to allow any additional salts to leak out – we call this creep – before being cleaned, well oiled, wrapped, and returned to its owner. Rust Bluing can provide the best rust and corrosion resistance as the process continually converts any metal that is capable of rusting into magnetite, but as it’s a much more labor intensive process, hot salt bluing is often used instead.

By creating a watertight seal around the steel on your firearm, it will be able to withstand the elements for years to come. With proper care and maintenance, it can be passed down for generations. When it comes to maintaining your firearms or restoring damaged ones, bluing is always your best option.

Gun Test: Lone Wolf Distributor’s Timberwolf T19,"By Scott Smith

Odds are pretty good that the Glock 17, 19, 34 are the most popular pistols on the market today. The pistols hold 17+1 rounds unless you are in a progressive controlled state that is making you safer by reducing their capacity to 10+1. The popularity of the 9mm Glock is driven by the fact it is reliable and it is easily customizable.

One of the largest providers of parts and custom work for Glocks is Lone Wolf Distributors. The offer virtually every part imaginable to customize a Glock and do amazing custom work to slides, frames or complete pistols. While I had used LWD internals on my Glocks, several years ago they had some of their custom slide at the SHOT Show. This was before optics ready slides became popular.

Their work intrigued me enough to have them do some work for me. I had them machine a Lone Wolf Distributor slide to fit a Trijicon RMR. This was years ago when the industry was first dabbling in mini-red dots on pistols. There was no such thing as an optic ready pistol. I approached them to upgrade my well traveled first generation G17 into an “open class” pistol for USPSA. Because there are a number of RMRs variants, LWD needed to have my sight to make sure the cut was right. When the sight returned home it was perfectly mated to a polished stainless slide. The fit was so perfect looked like one piece of metal.

While LWD makes excellent barrels; I did not have LWD install a barrel because I had a single port KKM Precision barrel that I had picked up off a prize table. The barrel fit perfectly in Lone Wolf’s slide. KKM barrels are known to be quite accurate. When mated with the RMR and LWD slide it was wicked accurate. Off a bench rest at 25 yards using Federal 9BP 115 grain hollow points 10 shot groups hovered at 1 ¾”. To be honest, that is probably as good as I can shoot. I have used this pistol in numerous local USPSA matches and it makes me look good. Several hundred rounds have been sent down range without any failures to feed, extract or go bang.

After the successful upgrade of my G17, I turned to Lone Wolf Distributors to see about getting a one of their Timberwolf pistols. These are a proprietary LWD frame that has an interchangeable back strap. The frame is also smaller than a Glock frame so it fits more people’s hands. Like LWD’s slides the Timberwolf frame will accept GLOCK OEM parts or any other parts for Glock pistols as long as you ensure they are the appropriate size; G19, G17, G20, G21 etc.

Since I had a first generation Glock 17 and 19, I figured a G34 sized Timberwolf would be a good addition. This would be a perfect pistol to let other folks shoot at the range and for three gun. As I had expected, the T34 was wicked accurate, reliable and it fit a lot of folk’s hands well. Over the years dozens of folks have used this pistol to cut their teeth on striker fired pistols.

When one of my best friends told me she wanted a Glock, I let her shoot this one. She is a smaller stature lady so I figured the Timberwolf would fit her. We found that it did and she liked it. Since she wanted it as a carry gun the T34 would be too big.

I dropped LWD an email to see if we could get them to send a sample of a Timberwolf built as a Glock 19. Unlike my 34, which has Glock OEM fire control; I wanted them to build this one completely with their parts to give us a pistol that handled like a Glock but had the trigger of a tuned 1911.

Lone Wolf build the Timberwolf 19 with their match grade parts; barrel, internals, suppressor sights and trigger. LWD’s trigger is flat for a shorter reach and the polished aluminum trigger shoe is smoother. I have noticed is OEM polymer triggers can be problematic with reduced weight trigger springs and connectors. Since this pistol was going to be used to teach her to shoot, we wanted it to be as close to perfect as possible.

Fit and finish were flawless. Lock-up between the barrel, slide and frame was so tight it bordered on too perfect. During the initial trip to the range I found it was a bit slow to unlock. The frame and slide were fit to well. Turned out the angle at the top of the barrel hood was too square. With lighter non-duty loads the barrel was having issues unlocking. A couple passes with a finish file on the top corner and it ran like a champ. What this did was let the slide and hood move by one another easier.

After addressing the use of the barrel and slide fit it was back to the range. After filing the barrel there were no more feeding issues. The LWD T19 shot consistently and accurately. Test ammunition was from Black Hills 115 grain FMJ, 124gr JHP, Federal 115 grain Syntech and 115 grain TP JHP, Sig Sauer 115 grain FMJs and 124 grain V Crown JHP Over 300 rounds were fired through the Timberwolf without a hitch. At fifteen yards 10 shot groups from a rest were all less than 2” The only issue I had was the suppressor sights were causing me to hit low and without any contrast I was losing the front post. Since my best bud was a new shooter I realized she might have the same issue.

To correct the sight picture, I contacted XS Sights for a set of their new FR8 sights. These sights are a radical change for XS from their Express Sights. FR8s have a “U” rear notch and a bright orange front dot around tritium vial. Like LWD’s, these sights too are suppressor height to co-witness with a mini-red dot. Once installed groups were centered and point of aim, point of impact at 15 yards.

To put the Timberwolf through its paces, I made sure to have a mix of ammunition. We had 115 grain full metal jacket and 124 grain hollow points from Black Hills Ammunition; 115 grain Syntech and 115 hollow point Train & Protect from Federal; 125 grain HAP Steel Match and 115 grain XTP American Gunner from Hornady and last from Sig Sauer there was 115 grain full metal jacket and 124 grain V-crown hollow points. This mix would cover training and self-defense ammunition. If there were feeding issues this mix of bullet styles would find them.

Since weather was problematic, rain; I shot at 15 yards because I was not trekking further down range through mud down to 25 yard target. Our initial testing was with mixed ammunition from several partial boxes. I did not want to waste our test ammunition. Having addressed the barrel hood, the Timberwolf ran like a champ. There were no issues. With the new XS Sights FR8 Sights, groups were nicely centered. Offhand ten shot groups at fifteen yards with mixed ammunition were consistently hovering at 3 ½”.

Since we confirmed the pistol was now running properly and well, we loaded up our test ammunition; to shoot five shot groups. Sadly I cannot report that the Timberwolf did not shoot one load of the test ammunition markedly better than others. What I can say is off a bench five shot groups were all 2”-2 ½”. We got this performance even when we fired mixed ammunition in the magazines. Lone Wolf Distributor’s Timberwolf just flat out shoots well. It has no preference of ammunition make or bullet style which is what you want out of a personal defense pistol.

What we did find the Timberwolf T19 to be an ideal pistol for small statured folks. My best bud found the Timberwolf to fit her perfectly from trigger finger placement to how it felt while shooting. After a couple magazines she was hammering the “A” zone of an USPSA target. This speaks highly to the quality of the Timberwolf and the high visibility FR8 XS Sights. Another bonus of the Timberwolf frame is it will fit Glock holsters. This means you will have your choice of holsters for any application.

Lone Wolf Distributors can build you a compact, full size or large bore (10mm, 45ACP) utilitarian pistol, a full blown competition pistol or supply you with just a frame. If you want to make your Glock or a Timberwolf more exotic; LWD can texture the frame, laser engrave parts, machine the slide and do a wild PVD or Cerakote finish for you. You are only limited by your imagination and checkbook. Whether you choose a frame or complete pistol it has to be shipped to your local FFL holder to do the paperwork to keep things legal. Their website; www.lonewolfdist.com will give you all the details on what services they offer.

Get your custom built Timberwolf T19 or have your Glock customized by Lone Wolf Distributors and head out to the range. You will raise eyebrows and have a pistol to be proud of. While you are out there making noise; remember to shoot safely, accurately and have fun.

New Gun Control Laws Spawn Second Amendment Protest In Vermont,"Vermont’s Republican Governor Phil Scott pledged to sign three new gun-control bills next week, making it easier for the state to confiscate firearms from certain people.

The first bill would make it easier to confiscate guns from someone considered to be at risk of harming themselves or others. The second allows the police to confiscate firearms from anyone whose been arrested or cited for domestic violence. The third bill would raise the gun purchase age to 21 and expand background checks. It would also ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines, according to WVNY.

Hundreds of Second Amendment supporters gathered in South Burlington Saturday to protest the Governor’s decision and express their disappointment.

“Those bills won’t be able to protect us,” pre-school teacher Naomi Snelling told WVNY. “I know how to protect myself and other people, and I know the lines of when [sic] I need to draw that.”

Most people carried protests signs, but others open carried AR-15’s across their chest to make a point, WVNY reports.

Rally organizer Christopher Covey never expected he’d lead a gun rights protest but is now fully committed to spreading the group’s message, he told WVNY

The group, “Vermont Gun March,” plans to hold several rallies over the summer to protest gun control. Their tagline: “Remember in November.”

“We’re trying to get people to understand us and understand why we want our right to bear arms,” Covey told WVNY.

WVNY reached out to Gov. Scott’s office and Gun Sense Vermont, a local group advocating for stricter gun control. Neither responded to their request for comment.

Gun Tests: Ruger SR1911 10mm – Super Redhawk 10mm,"By John Taffin, GUNS Magazine

It took a while. But patience has been rewarded and the 10mm is now alive and well. Two of the latest offerings in this excellent chambering come from Ruger. First to arrive was the stainless steel SR1911 with adjustable sights. Now it’s been joined by the Super Redhawk. The 10mm cartridge has a somewhat rocky history, but with Ruger offering it in two well-respected packages, its future should be assured.

From Cult to Mainstream

In 1971 two men, Whit Collins and gunsmith John French came up with the .40 G&A using the .224 Weatherby case trimmed back and loaded with (would you believe?) a 180-gr. .38-40 bullet at 1,100 fps. This proprietary wildcat was chambered in a Browning Hi-Power and six years later the velocity was upped to 1,250 fps. The next step was Dornhaus & Dixon offering a CZ-75 style pistol chambered in the new 10mm with a 200-gr. bullet at 1,200 fps. Both the gun and the cartridge caught Jeff Cooper’s attention and he promoted the project. Unfortunately, the manufacturers were unable to deliver and that was almost the end of that — except for Colt throwing a lifeline to the cartridge by chambering it in their Delta Elite.

The 10mm is the most powerful semi-auto pistol cartridge offered in a portable package. Yes, there are more powerful offerings such as the .50AE in the Desert Eagle. But the 1911 platform carries much easier all day long and is certainly quicker into action. With the SR1911 we basically have everything we could want in a 10mm. It can be carried all day, yet still be able to handle anything encountered.

The finish is a low-glare stainless steel — accented by black for the extended slide release and thumb safety and the beavertail grip safety, complete with memory bump. I personally need both of these as the memory bump ensures I get a proper grip to depress the safety and the beavertail protects the top of my shooting hand from taking a beating. The serrated flat mainspring housing (something else I prefer on a 1911) is also black.

The sights are Bomar-style — a fully adjustable rear matched up with a post front sloping towards the front. Both sights are set in a dovetail on the slide. The slide itself has cocking serrations at the rear and both slide and frame are CNC machined for a smooth, close fit with no expensive hand-fitting required. The skeletonized hammer is mated up with a skeletonized trigger, which has an adjustable over-travel stop. From the factory my test gun already had a smooth, creep-free 4-lb. trigger pull.

Instead of the typical barrel/bushing setup as found on the SR1911 .45 ACP version, the 10mm has a tapered, bushingless stainless bull barrel and a full-length guide rod. The barrel is also ramped for strength and ease of feeding and the ejection port is enlarged for positive ejection. The magazine release is extended for ease of operation and the magazine release is positive when the button is pushed. The firing pin is titanium. In short, this 10mm has everything I want in a 1911 and nothing I don’t. It comes with two 8-round stainless steel magazines.

I did make one addition though. The front strap is smooth and my shooting hand is not nearly so strong anymore, so I added rubber finger grooves from Pearce Grip Company. They fit over the frontstrap and have two thin rubber flaps that fit under the grip panels to hold everything in place. When shooting hundreds of rounds per session, they are greatly appreciated. So much so I’ll probably leave them in place for everyday use.

There may be more powerful autos than the 10mm SR1911, but none can match the time-proven “carryability” of Browning’s legendary platform.

A Lotta Loads

In test-firing over several days, I enlisted 19 factory loads and six favored handloads. Cor-Bon’s 150-gr. JHP proved to be the velocity champ at 1,400 fps and was also exceptionally accurate with a 1″ group for 5 shots at 20 yards. Their 180-gr. JHP also performed very well with a 1-1/4″ group and a velocity of 1,200 fps.

Federal’s excellent 180-gr. Trophy Bonded JHP at 1,300+ fps yielded a 1-3/8″ group; their 180-gr. Hydra-Shok 1,045 fps/1-1/4″, 180-gr. Personal Defense 1,025 fps/1-1/8″. But the accuracy champion of all loads was Federal’s 180-gr. JHP, producing a 3/4″ group at a mild 950 fps.

Hornady’s 200-gr. XTP-JHP shoots into a tight 1-1/8″ while clocking 1,100+ fps. The Black Hills 200-gr. JHP, SIG SAUER’s 180-gr. FMJ, and 180-gr. JHP V-Crown all gave 1-3/8″ groups with muzzle velocities of 1,020, 1,270, and 1,260 fps respectively.

More than 25 years ago I tested every 10mm available at the time and I settled on Winchester 231 as my powder of choice for cast bullets. With 5.5 grains of WW231 I use the Lyman #401043 (originally designed for the .38-40), Oregon Trail’s 175 SWC, and the RCBS #10-200. Velocities are all in the easy-shooting range, registering at 1,000, 1,075 and 1,035 fps respectively. They all shoot well enough to serve as everyday packin’ pistol loads.

The Ruger SR 1911 10mm is a welcome addition to my stable of Perfect Packin’ Pistols. The MSRP is just over $1,000 and as usual with Ruger, we get more than we pay for.

Although the recoil generated by the 10mm isn’t as severe as say, a .454 Casull or .44

Magnum, John appreciates the Super Redhawks’s rubberized GP-100 grip panels.

–

No shortage of sighting options! The Super Redhawk accepts integral Ruger scope mounts, or you can go with the fully adjustable rear and ramp front sight.

Sixgun Stablemate

The second 10mm offering from Ruger is the Super Redhawk. This big DA revolver first arrived more than 30 years ago and although it has a somewhat ungainly appearance, it has proven itself in the game fields. I’ve used a pair of Supers chambered in .44 Magnum and .454 Casull to take such varied critters as whitetail, exotic sheep, elk and bison.

One of the major changes in the Super Redhawk as compared to the Redhawk is the trigger pull. The Redhawk uses the same spring to operate both trigger and hammer; the Super Redhawk uses separate springs for the trigger and hammer, going back to the hammer spring and strut used in their single-action revolvers. This results in a much smoother from-the-box trigger pull.

Another change: In designing the Super Redhawk, the Redhawk grip frame was replaced by the GP-100 stud to accept the rubberized GP-100 grip panels to help tame felt recoil, so Ruger’s Super Redhawk is about as comfortable shooting a 10mm as you can find. Obviously it’s nowhere near as heavy-recoiling as a .454 or even a .44 Magnum, although some of the heavier 10mm factory loadings exhibit significant felt recoil in a semi-auto. With a 6-1/2″ barrel and a weight of 54 oz., Ruger’s Super Redhawk tames these loads significantly.

With the heavy 6-1/2″ barrel this Super Redhawk is an exceptionally good-looking sixgun without the ungainly appearance of longer barreled versions.

Sights are the interchangeable insert type Ruger uses, with other colors available from Ruger. They are matched up with the classic Ruger adjustable rear sight. The finish is satin stainless, grips are also the typical Ruger cushioned rubber with a hardwood insert on both grip panels.

–

Moon Clips and Crimps

The MSRP is $1,159 and it ships with three 6-shot full moon clips for ease of loading and extraction (extras are available from Ruger). These moon clips are the best to be had for ease of inserting cartridges, as they have a slit on each arm that allows the arm to flex and the cartridge to be inserted without pain to your fingers. For those of us who reload, the use of full moon clips allows a roll crimp instead of a taper crimp on 10mm cartridges. This not only aids powder combustion, but also prevents bullets with heavier loads from jumping the crimp as the gun is fired. The moon clip also allows the use of the shorter .40 S&W cartridges.

The add-on finger grooves from Pearce Grip Company contributed materially to his shooting comfort!

John’s SR1911 printed a premier group with Federal 180-gr. JHPs, but also did well with some of his pet handloads.

The scoped Super Redhawk was no slouch at 25 yards using heavy loads such as DoubleTap 230-gr. WFN and Buffalo Bore’s 200-gr. FMJ.

Mounts, Scopes

The sixgun accepts Ruger’s stainless steel scope rings, which are included. They mount solidly via one large screw each and semi-circular recesses on each side of the frame. For added strength, a lug on the bottom of each ring mates with a recess on top of the frame. This allows each ring to be anchored from side to side as well as front to back. The rings install easily, and once the scope is zeroed in will come back very close when the scope is removed and replaced again. For testing I installed a Leupold 4X Silver LER scope. I’ve been using Leupold scopes on sixguns for several decades and they’ve served me exceptionally well.

This easy on-again, off-again feature allows almost-instant use of scope or iron sights, and makes the Super Redhawk very popular as a double-duty sixgun for hunting with either sighting system. The scope is there for taking longer shots and can easily be removed for hunting such things as feral pigs up close. To remove and return the scope and rings of the Super Redhawk, all you need is something as unsophisticated as a 50-cent piece to loosen and tighten the ring screws.

I tested the Super Redhawk in the dead of winter. Now 50 years ago, I was “Mighty Casey at the Bench,” but now my fragility doesn’t mesh well with frigidity. I really prefer shooting in spring and summer.

My cold weather testing yielded excellent results. Both the Cor-Bon 180-gr. Bonded Core and the SIG 180-gr. JHP V-Crown yielded 1″ five-shot groups at 25 yards with velocities of 1,354 and 1,315 fps respectively. Some of Buffalo Bore’s Heavy loads I tried included their 200-gr. FMJ (1-1/2″, 1,238 fps) and 180-gr. JHP (1-3/4″, 1,451 fps). Other “high test” offerings I tried were Double-Tap’s 125-gr. Barnes (1-1/2″, 1,774 fps) and their 230-gr. WFN (1-3/8″, 1,151 fps).

Now, it seems, the “twin-tens” are actually triplets. Lipsey’s offers the stainless steel Blackhawk as a convertible with cylinders chambered in 10mm and .40 S&W.

Thanks to Ruger, shooters have a choice when it comes to selecting a 10mm — semi-auto, double-action or single-action sixgun. If the choice is too difficult, the obvious answer is “buy ’em all.”

Gun Test: Springfield Armory TRP 10mm RMR,"By Michelle Cerino, Women’s Outdoor News

I’ve shot many different Springfield Armory firearms and felt excited to get the opportunity to take the new 1911 TRP 10mm RMR [MSRP: $2,507] to the range. Sure, I ran quite a few rounds though one last fall at Springfield Armory’s Desert Duel writers’ event, but that was without the RMR. Now I had the time to try different ammunitions and see just what this 1911 can do.

Available in both 5- and 6-inch barrel lengths, the Tactical Response Pistol’s (TRP’s) forged steel frame and slide are precision fit to a Match Grade stainless steel barrel. A coating of Black-T, a corrosion-resistant finish on the slides and frames offers protection in heavy use and harsh conditions. A crisp 4.5 to 5 pound trigger pull from the Springfield Armory Gen 2 Speed Trigger offers a clean break.

–

For this version of the TRP 10mm, Springfield Armory partnered with Trijicon by adding its Integrated Night Sights and Ruggedized Miniature Reflex (RMR) sight to this specifically milled 1911. Crafted from 7075-T6 aluminum to mil-spec standards the rugged red-dot optic has a patented shape that absorbs impacts and diverts stresses away from the lens, increasing durability. This combination is great for hunting, which is perfect for this caliber ammunition.

Other features include the following:

Posi-Lock front strap and mainspring housing

Heavy frame and SA Magwell

2 — 8 round, stainless steel magazines with slam pads

TRP 5-inch 10mm RMR

TRP 5-inch 10mm RMR

GI style, 18.5 pound recoil spring

Weight — 44 oz.

Length — 8.6-inches

Green and black G10 grip

TRP 6-inch 10mm RMR

TRP 6-inch 10mm RMR

GI style, 16 pound recoil spring

Weight — 50 oz.

Length — 9.6-inches

Black G10 grip

On the range, I tested 5 brands of ammunition: Speer Gold Dot, Federal Premium’s Vital-Shok and Personal Defense and Hornady’s Critical Duty and Custom 180 gr XTP. I tested the pistol and ammo at 10 yards from a sandbag using the sights. The smallest group of 5 fell within 1.25 inches and the largest, at 2 inches. The overall average was 1.75 inches for the various brands of ammunition. Later I set up an 8-inch steel plate at 50-yards and shot the target 6 out of 6 times offhand using the Trijicon RMR. Honestly, I had a difficult time managing the recoil of the TRP. While shooting offhand, my first 3 shots were malfunctions. So, for the next 3 I held with a much firmer grip and had no more issues. Not too bad, the Springfield Armory TRP 10mm RMR was ready for a hunt.

–

Although I have yet to take the TRP hog hunting, my husband took it along on a recent trip to Texas. Yep, 2 hogs, weighing more than 400-pounds each went down.

Why I Joined the NRA After Writing Gun Control Articles,"Years back, I was a staunch gun control advocate. Last week, I joined the NRA and the Gun Owners of America, and I’m looking to join more Second Amendment advocacy groups. How did this evolution take place?

In 2014, I wrote articles for “The Huffington Post” titled “If ISIS Had Committed the 11 School Shootings Since Sandy Hook, Congress Would Have Declared War” and “What Gun Advocates Should Remember: You’ll Never Overthrow The Government and It Isn’t Scared of You.“

Rebuttals from numerous publications resulted from the latter piece, especially since it highlighted my disdain (at the time) for gun owners. “The American Conservative” published a 2017 piece by Grayson Quay titled “The Left Has the Stronger Case for Gun Ownership,” explaining my tunnel vision:

“The article, written by H. A. Goodman, contains some truly puzzling arguments about how the failure of the Whisky Rebellion proves the impossibility of a successful uprising … Since he never mentions it, I can only assume Mr. Goodman hasn’t heard of the successful American Revolution, which just a few years earlier had succeeded in throwing off British rule and establishing the very nation against which the Whisky rebels revolted.”

Interestingly, it took me until 2018 to realize that Mr. Quay was correct about the benefits of an armed populace.

After witnessing the union of the Democratic Party and former spy chiefs James Clapper, James Comey and John Brennan, I slowly realized my trust in the federal government had been naive. Of course, I’d never advocate an armed rebellion, but the fact 37 percent of American families own some type of firearm ensures that unelected officials think twice about the extent of their schemes.

If intelligence chiefs like Brennan and Clapper can lie under oath without perjury charges, or James Comey can overlook Clinton’s private server (storing SAP intelligence) because of “intent,” imagine the extent of their chicanery with a disarmed population.

The Second Amendment isn’t necessarily a call to arms — it’s an inconvenient reality for unelected officials who continually act with impunity and without government oversight.

As for mass shootings, the propaganda of the Left will not save lives.

Dianne Feinstein admitted that no legislation could have prevented the Vegas shooting. The FBI botched the Charleston massacre and according to The New York Times, “Dylann Roof, 21, was allowed to buy the .45-caliber handgun because of mistakes by F.B.I. agents.” The FBI knew about the recent Florida shooter before he killed 17 people. The FBI also knew about the Orlando Pulse shooter years before he murdered 49 human beings. As for the Virginia Tech shooter who killed 32 people, he roamed the university for 15 minutes using a .22 and a 9 millimeter; two smaller caliber handguns that have never been the targets of a ban by liberals.

Without an armed guard or officer protecting schools, in the manner armed security protects a synagogue in Los Angeles I’ve attended during Jewish holidays, active shooters don’t need powerful firearms. Adam Lanza used 11 minutes to murder 27 people, including 18 children and didn’t need an AR-15 style rifle. Eleven minutes is enough time to reload the same handguns used during the Virginia Tech shooting that killed 32 people. The NRA is correct; schools need armed guards, like the heroic resource officers in Illinois and Florida, who prevented massacres and stopped armed killers before they reached innocent lives.

I joined the NRA and Gun Owners of America because the groupthink that I once spewed hurts law-abiding citizens and does nothing to prevent the next deranged copycat criminal. I now have a firearms channel on YouTube promoting the Second Amendment safely and responsibly; something I never imagined in 2014.

Since a 2008 study showed that 80 percent of crimes are committed with illegally obtained guns, “gun control” is a euphemism that won’t stop deranged people intent on killing. It took me a while, but I realize now that murders aren’t stopped by controlling an inanimate object. They’re stopped by heroic people like Dixon Police Officer Mark Dallas and Deputy Jim Long, and the many others who prevented active shooters from reaching potential victims.

Gun Test: Browning’s X-Bolt Pro,"By Mike Dickerson, Gun Digest

Browning’s X-Bolt Pro gives hunters magnum firepower in an attractive, lightweight, go-anywhere package. It might just be Browning’s best turn-bolt hunting rifle yet.

How this Browning proves a backcountry pro:

The X-Bolt pro, regardless of caliber, comes in at below 7 pounds.

Much of the weight reduction is achieved from its fluted sporter-profile barrel.

Additionally, a spiral fluted three-lug bolt shaves an ounce or two.

Finally, a carbon-fiber stock keeps things light.

Opposed to using strips, the X-Bolt Pro’s stock is built by weave wrapping carbon fiber.

The gun comes outfitted with a muzzle brake and its bore is lapped.

The Browning Feather trigger breaks at 3.5 to 4 pounds.

The best group of the .300 Win. Mag. tested was .82 inch with Browning BXR 155-grain loads.

The MSRP of the X-Bolt Pro runs from $2,069 to $2,129 depending on caliber.

Unless you’ve spent the last decade or two in a gun-knowledge-free zone, such as the headquarters of the major American TV news networks, you’ve probably noticed that hunting rifles have been getting lighter. Just as there has been a race to the bottom — in regard to price — between the most economical bolt-action rifle models, there has been a corresponding race to produce guns that are light enough to blow away in anything more than a stiff breeze.

This is widely heralded as a great thing for those who hunt vertical country, and it is — to a point. As with most good intentions, things can get carried to extremes, and there’s a price to be paid for that. Some manufacturers offer lightweight factory rifles that sacrifice bullet velocity for modest weight savings by the simple expedient of using thin, chopped-off barrels, often paired with flimsy synthetic stocks and cheap components.

At the other end of the spectrum are custom ultralight rifles priced at $4,000 or more. These ultralight rifles can be a joy to carry, but they’re not necessarily a joy to shoot. Many people find ultralight rifles more difficult to shoot accurately due to increased recoil, and that challenge only increases with rifles chambered for the thumper magnums.

To my way of thinking, the nearly perfect go-anywhere, do-anything backcountry rifle occupies the “light-enough” category — meaning it’s light enough to carry all day but not so light that it kicks like a mule on steroids or requires me to modify my shooting technique to place bullets where I want them to go. It should have a barrel long enough to achieve optimal velocities for chosen cartridges, to include magnums, and it should have an excellent trigger to aid in making accurate long-range shots. It should also be nearly impervious to the elements.

The good news is that there’s an emerging class of rifles that check all these boxes, and more, by taking advantage of the latest gun-making technologies and materials while refusing to compromise on things that matter most. A great example is the new Browning X-Bolt Pro. It is, as its name implies, a seriously well-designed tool for serious hunters.

Semi-Custom Features

Weighing in at a svelte 6 pounds, 9 ounces, in the .300 Win. Mag. version I tested (rifles chambered in 6.5 Creedmoor shed an additional 8 ounces of weight), the X-Bolt Pro can be thought of as a semi-custom factory rifle. A lot of that has to do with the finishing touches and high-end design elements that elevate the rifle above the level of the already well-regarded basic X-Bolt platform, all while shedding unnecessary weight from the rifle.

With the Pro, a lot of that weight reduction has been accomplished by removing a fair amount of metal from the gun. The rifle has a lightweight sporter-profile fluted barrel, but it still measures a full 26 inches in length in guns chambered for .300 Win. Mag., 28 Nosler, 26 Nosler and 7mm Rem. Mag. It is, happily, adorned with an effective muzzle brake and comes with a thread protector. In another nod to custom guns, the 1:10 twist barrel has been given a proprietary lapping treatment, minimizing the need for break-in. While shooting up a considerable amount of ammo with the rifle, I was amazed at how little fouling accumulated in the barrel.

The three-lug bolt is spiral fluted, as is the bolt knob, cutting additional weight and adding to the rifle’s considerable aesthetic appeal. It proved to be a real head-turner at the range, judging by the number of people who felt compelled to interrupt my testing by inquiring about the rifle.

That’s partly due to the rifle’s distinctive, true carbon-fiber stock, which is constructed with the carbon-fiber weave wrapped 360 degrees around a sound-dampening foam core. This use of what Browning calls a “second generation” carbon-fiber weave, versus individual strips of carbon-fiber joined at seams, further reduces weight while significantly adding to the rigidity of the stock. It’s exceptionally difficult to make this stock bend. Trust me, I tried.

The rifle’s good looks — and resistance to inclement weather — are further enhanced with a well-executed Cerakote treatment of the stainless-steel barrel and action as well as the bolt and all exterior metal. This rifle shrugs off the elements as a result, and the “burnt bronze” color of the abrasion-resistant Cerakote finish complements the dark brown hues of the stock, which mute any potential game-spooking reflective glare.

Accuracy-enhancing measures include glass bedding of the action to the stock, and the barrel is free floated along its entire length. Fit and finish on this rifle is excellent, right down to the ubiquitous Buckmark logo on the bottom of the trigger guard and the gold-plated trigger blade. The Pro simply exudes quality from the moment you pick the rifle up, in a way that too few factory rifles do these days.

Beyond The Basics

The X-Bolt Pro retains all of the unique characteristics of a standard X-Bolt which, taken together, equate to a lot more than a run-of-the-mill bolt-action rifle. These features include a 60-degree bolt throw, a tang-mounted safety with a cocking indicator, the Browning Feather trigger, a bolt unlock button and the Inflex recoil pad. I especially like the X-Bolt’s signature X-Lock scope-base mounting system, which doubles the standard number of mounting screws from four to eight. It’s a rock-solid base-mounting system like few I’ve ever seen.

The excellent Browning Feather trigger is supposed to be pre-set at the factory to a pull weight of about 3½ to 4 pounds, and I measured the break on my test rifle at a consistent 3 pounds, 9 ounces. The trigger is adjustable within a range of 3 to 5 pounds, but I left it where it was because it broke so cleanly, with absolutely no take-up, no creep and minimal overtravel, that it felt lighter than it really was.

One distinctive feature of X-Bolt rifles is the unique bolt-unlock button, situated atop the portion of the bolt handle that mates into a recess in the action. Engaging the safety locks the bolt down, but you can use this button to unlock the bolt and cycle the action without disengaging the safety. The bolt itself cycles smoothly, with no binding, unlike some spiral-fluted bolts I’ve encountered.

Bottom metal is — wonder of wonders — actually made of metal, while the detachable magazine is a tough polymer design that sits flush with the bottom of the action. The rotary magazine drops freely into your hand when you trip the magazine release lever, which is protected within a recess in the bottom metal, and it feeds rounds straight in line with the chamber. Capacity is three rounds for magnum cartridges and four rounds for standard cartridges.

The rifle is actually made by Miroku, in Japan, but that matters little from a practical viewpoint. Miroku long ago established a very well-earned reputation for producing some excellent firearms, including Browning shotguns and some rifles licensed by Winchester Firearms.

Convincing Performance

Given the rather slender profile of the Pro’s barrel, I wasn’t really expecting tack-driving accuracy from the rifle at the range because groups typically open up as such barrels heat up — and heat up they do in my hands. It’s not that I’m impatient, mind you, but I do have to deal with such pesky things as deadlines, and I often want to see how well a gun shoots when it’s running a little hot and dirty. Of course, you would never run a barrel hot when hunting unless you’re doing something inordinately wrong. It’s the first shot or two that counts, rather than how a gun groups after a lot of ammo goes down the tube.

–

I found that groups did open up a bit as the barrel heated up, as anticipated, but I was pleased at how well the X-Bolt Pro performed at the range. Most tested loads produced average groups of around 1½ inches, which will convincingly accomplish just about any mission for which you might choose to employ a .300 Win. Mag. cartridge.

Interestingly, the rifle showed a bit of a preference for lighter bullets, with the best performance turned in with Browning’s BXR (rapid expansion) 155-grain load. This was also the hottest factory round tested, with the matrix-tip bullet stepping out at 3,257 fps, and it produced an average-group size of 1.12 inch and a best-group size of 0.82 inch.

The next-tightest groups were with 180- and 185-grain bullets, which did slightly better than bullets in the 190-200 weight class. Velocities for most of the tested loads exceeded or were quite close to factory-stated velocities, which are, in many cases, achieved with longer barrels.

I consider that excellent overall performance for such a light rifle, let alone one that punches with magnum persuasion. When you consider that it’s also designed to handle the harshest environmental conditions, the rifle’s price tag ($2,099 MSRP for the version tested) starts to look a lot less steep than the mountains you’ll be climbing with the Pro slung over your shoulder.

Gun Test: CZ-USA 805 Bren S1 Rifle,"By Aaron Carter, Shooting Illustrated

Takedown pins are stored in holes atop the buttpad when cleaning.

–

The Beginnings of the CZ 805 Bren S1

On May 14, 1955, seven European satellites—including Czechoslovakia—and the Soviet Union signed an accord for mutual protection: If one member state was attacked, all signers of the document were obliged to defend it. Known as the Warsaw Pact, the treaty also named the Soviet Union as overseer of the armed forces of its members. Naturally, Soviet influence permeated to small arms development. It asserted that the armed forces of the Warsaw Pact utilize standard ammunition, in this case the ubiquitous 7.62×39 mm (M43) cartridge.



(l.) While recoil absorption for 5.56 NATO isn’t necessary, the buttpad does keep the rifle positioned properly. (r.) Beveled to foster rapid reloads, the magazine well is stout, sturdy and precisely fit. –

This mandate affected Czechoslovakia more than any other Warsaw Pact member state. Only recently before—from 1951 to 1952—the country created the Samonabijeci puska vzor 52 (vz.52), which utilized its own proprietary (and more powerful) 7.62×45 mm cartridge. A number of existing vz.52 rifles were re-chambered for the Russian round, and all new-manufacture vz.52 rifles were renamed “vz.52/57” to reflect the chambering change, as well as other differences to include the magazine. Production of the vz.52/57 was short-lived, as the development of its replacement, the 7,62 mm samopal vzor 58 (vz.58), began in the mid-’50s. After several iterations, production of the vz.58 began in earnest in 1959 at the Ceska zbrjovka Uhersky Brod (CZ) factory.

While other treaty members had issue rifles based upon the AK-47, Czechoslovakia had considerable latitude in creating the vz.58. The vz.58 was (and still is) a better design. The vz.58 is a selective-fire, gas-operated rifle that employs a short-stroke piston for operation, which, because of the reduced heft of the moving parts and shorter piston movement, lessens vibration and gun movement. Other noteworthy differences include: a bolt-hold-open feature, a striker-fired mechanism, rotary bolt lockup, uncovered ejection port, lighter aluminum 30-round magazines that can be loaded via stripper clip while inserted, a milled-steel receiver and a superior lever-type mode/safety selector. Keep in mind that, although the vz.58 has an appearance similar to that of the AK, parts are not interchangeable.

Both front and rear sights are adjustable; the front with a standard AR-15 sight tool, the rear via click adjustments. The rear contains two apertures. –

The vz.58 faithfully served the Czechoslovakian military until the mid-1980s, when the 5.45×39 mm-chambered, AK-74-derived Lada was designed, tested, and, in 1989, approved for production. The timing couldn’t have been worse. The Revolutions of 1989 swept through Central and Eastern Europe and Czechoslovakia wasn’t immune; due to the “Velvet Revolution,” the Communist Party stepped down and the country was split into two nation states—the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Add to this the privatization of CZ and insufficient military funds, and it’s easy to see why the project wasn’t continued—at least at the time. It was resurrected as the CZ-2000, but never adopted.

CZ 805 Bren S1 Rifle Development

Despite the disappointment of the Lada/CZ-2000 not being adopted by the Czech army, the reality was it still sought a new rifle. Interestingly, author Leszek Erenfeicht wrote on Small Arms Journal’s website, “The CZ 2000 was only a name used for PR. For in-house use, the whole ‘Army Rifle Replacement’ program was dubbed Project 805, according to the new classification scheme, in which model numbers were assigned according to the nature of the product.” Commencement of a new modular design coined the S805 began in 2005, with CZ creating specifications for two models—“A” and “B.” Mid-range calibers, such as 5.56 NATO and 7.62×39 mm, were found in the former, while the larger rounds were chambered in the latter. Within each letter designation, there were three, mission-specific barrel lengths labeled “1,” “2,” and “3.” The premise was the two platforms could be quickly and easily adapted to mission profiles in the field. In 2009, the Czech army issued a tender for a new infantry rifle.

(l.) If you thought this was merely another AR knockoff, the unique grip proves otherwise. (r.) Accepting STANAG magazines, the 805 Bren S1 has a variety of options for feeding ammunition. –

But, CZ’s S805, which since had lost much of its modularity—only the “A” series was submitted—wasn’t the army’s only option; in fact, there were reportedly nearly 30 firearms submitted for testing. Eventually, the group was whittled down to the FN SCAR-L and CZ S805 (aka 805 Bren), which, as many gun enthusiasts are quick to point out, are quite similar aesthetically and functionally, with the SCAR-L predating the 805 Bren. But, domestic production gave CZ the edge and a sizable order of A1, A2, and G1 (grenade launcher-equipped rifles) guns with Meopta optics were purchased. Since then, the CZ 805 Bren has seen use in multiple conflicts.

A Closer Look at the CZ 805 Bren S1

As with the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 A1 and S1 models, there are several major differences between the 805 Bren A1 and S1. First, and most obvious, gone is the four-position—safe, single round, two-round burst and full automatic—selector switch. In its place is a bilateral, two-position safety that, although positive, makes a loud snap when thumbing the short-throw, wide-paddle lever from “safe” to “fire.” Next, the A1’s and A2’s 11- and 14-inch, cold-hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrels have been replaced with a 16.2-inch version. Featuring 6-groove, 1:7-inch RH-twist rifling, even the heaviest .224-inch-diameter bullets will be stabilized. Additionally, the barrel, which measures a scant .550 inch at its thinnest, ends with a multi-port muzzle brake. The use of 1⁄2x28 RH threads on the S1 facilitates changing brakes, sound suppressors, etc.

(l.) A sculpted section at the end of the handguard positions the support hand properly; don’t grip the 805 too close to the reciprocating charging handle. (r.) A generous accessory rail allows for lights, lasers and foregrips to be added easily. –

As for specifics, the CZ 805 Bren S1 is a gas-operated, semi-automatic carbine chambered in 5.56 NATO that utilizes a short-stroke piston—similar to that of its predecessor, the vz.58 and its once-direct competitor, the FN SCAR-L. Part of the system is a two-position, user-adjustable gas tube/regulator that enables the shooter to select how much gas enters the system (i.e. for suppressor use, cleanliness, etc.). Rotating the gas tube/regulator 180 degrees allows the gas system to be removed for cleaning and/or maintenance. A bayonet lug on its bottom rounds out the gas block.

The CZ 805 Bren S1 carbine is divided into upper and lower receivers, with the latter being subdivided. First, the one-piece upper is machined from a billet of forged, aircraft-grade aluminum—no doubt contributing heavily to the gun’s 8.02-pound weight. Spanning the entire 16.75-inch length of the receiver’s top is Mil-Spec M1913 rail, which affords the user nearly endless options for adding optics. From the factory, the 805 Bren is equipped with dual-metal (aluminum/steel) flip-up sights. The protected-post front sight is adjustable for elevation, while the dual-aperture rear can be tweaked for windage. Beneath the fore-end is another 6.63 inches of usable Picatinny rail space for adding accessories, such as a vertical grip or lights and laser-sighting devices. A side cover plate is affixed to each side of the fore-end.

(l.) Controls are mostly ambidextrous, with the exception of the small bolt-release button. (ctr.) Capable of being changed from right- to left-side use, the charging handle does reciprocate. (r.) CZ’s proprietary muzzle brake contains multiple ports that help keep the 805 on target. –

On the left side of the upper receiver is the petite, round, reciprocating charging handle. Since both sides have cocking slots, it can be quickly and easily be changed to the right side for left-handed shooters. Because of its reciprocating design, due caution is required to keep errant fingers out of its path. Whereas the changing handle can swap sides, the ejection port cannot. Fortunately, the polymer case deflector sends brass forward of the shooter so he or she isn’t hit, regardless of preferred shooting side. Sling-attachment points are found fore and aft of the receiver.

The lower receiver consists of two polymer units. Removing the disassembly pin forward of the magazine well allows the trigger mechanism unit—consisting of the hammer, fire controls, pistol grip and separate, but attached, magazine well—to be separated from the upper receiver. Because of the design, magazine wells for CZ’s proprietary HK-G36-like polymer magazine and that for the AR-15/M16 can be exchanged quickly. The CZ 805 Bren S1 ships with the latter, which is likely the best option for everyone reading this article. The design makes cleaning the trigger mechanism easy.

Located in the same place as on an AR-15, the 805’s selector has a much shorter throw and moves with quite audible clicks to confirm status. –

While the safety selector and magazine release are bilateral, the bolt-catch button isn’t. The two-stage trigger is among the best I’ve encountered on a stock semi-automatic rifle—the trigger on the model I tested broke at a smooth 4 pounds, 9.8 ounces, exhibited no overtravel and had a short reset for rapid follow-up shots. Per the Czech army’s requested upgrades, the ergonomic pistol grip has a changeable backstrap, but the stock backstrap/frontstrap combination is quite comfortable. To enhance purchase, there are a series of ridges and grooves on the pistol grip’s sides and backstrap. The integral trigger guard has sufficient size to accommodate a gloved finger.

Two positions on the gas block allow for adjustment. –

When the second disassembly pin—located aft of the safety—is withdrawn and the stock disassembly button pressed, the buttstock can be removed. After completing the aforementioned actions, the stock joint (and attached stock) slide downward, out of the T-groove and off the gun. The side-folding, telescoping polymer stock has four positions to accommodate varying lengths-of-pull as well as a raised cheekpiece for proper eye-to-optic alignment. From the factory, the cheekpiece is set for right-hand shooters, but reversing it for lefties is simple. Capping the buttstock is a .25-inch-thick rubber recoil pad with no tackiness.

Once the buttstock is removed, the recoil spring and buffer can be withdrawn, thereby permitting the charging handle to be removed (or swapped), and the steel bolt carrier to be removed. From here, it’s easy to access the six-lug bolt, the extractor and the plunger-type ejector. The owner’s manual cautions against the disassembly of the bolt carrier to remove the bolt. But, in humid conditions or after using the Bren in inclement weather, you will have to be able to do so. This simple task requires the removal of the firing-pin plug and the operation pin and takes about 30 seconds. It’s quite similar to stripping an AR’s bolt-carrier-group unit for maintenance.

In actuality, disassembly of the CZ 805 Bren S1 Carbine is foolproof, and that’s desirable for an arm originally intended for military use. Part of the gun’s simplicity is derived from its modularity, but, as of now, other calibers aren’t available, so much of that is a moot point. I was also unable to locate replacement magazine wells and backstraps during a quick search. Nonetheless, the ease-of-care modularity affords makes it a great addition.

Rather than painted, the rail-location markers are engraved into the full-length top rail. –

Range Time with the CZ 805 Bren S1

I tested the 805 Bren S1 with a Bushnell scope mounted. Of the loads I put through the rifle, Nosler’s 62-grain FBHP Varmageddon produced the single best five-shot group and average. It was also the slowest by a wide margin—meaning the propellant probably wasn’t optimal for the 805’s 16.2-inch barrel.

None of the groups, however, were less than 1 inch, and the overall average for 75 shots was larger than anticipated. I attribute this to the 805 Bren S1’s pencil-thin barrel, coupled with conditions during testing and the side-folding buttstock. First, with a heat index approaching the mid-90s—the actual temperature was 89 degrees—and no breeze or shade, the barrel heated quickly and never fully cooled between strings. In most cases, the first three shots clustered extremely tightly, only to be ruined by those following. Additionally, as I’ve encountered on other rifles with side-folding buttstocks, even when “locked” into position, there is some vertical movement of the buttstock that affects accuracy at longer distances. The stock of the test CZ 805 Bren S1 Carbine I received for testing had more than .19 inch of vertical movement.



At the push of a button, the stock folds for transport or storage. –

I traded the Bushnell for a Weaver Tactical 1.5-7×24 mm to conduct handling and function testing. For this, I loaded the provided AR-15/M16-style magazines, as well as Lancer AWM and Magpul PMag 30-round variants, with a hodgepodge of .223 Rem. and 5.56 NATO loads. These included handloads and American- and Russian-made factory options. The 805 fed, fired, extracted and ejected flawlessly, regardless of the order in which they were loaded. Given that the 805 Bren A1 has already seen service in Afghanistan and Mexico, among other places, that’s unsurprising.

Polymer construction and its two-piece nature differentiate the 805’s lower receiver. –

It’s when you’re off the bench, though, that the benefits of the 805’s design are especially apparent. The gun comes to shoulder quickly and has good balance. Due to the short-stroke piston, significant heft and excellent multi-port muzzle brake, recoil and muzzle rise are next to nil. The action of the 805 Bren S1 is as smooth as you’ll find.

Outside of the vertical “play” of the buttstock, there’s little I’d change on the 805 Bren S1. The Czech army, however, thought differently about the A1/A2. From their suggestions (or demands), the 806 Bren 2 was built with a lighter overall weight, a non-reciprocating charging handle, newly designed buttstock and a three-position gas system, among other things.

For the shooter looking to get a piston-driven, 5.56 NATO-chambered defensive rifle, the CZ 805 Bren S1 should be at the top of the list. It reminds me of the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1. Déjà vu, indeed.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2018/07/08/gun-test-cz-usa-805-bren-s1-rifle-2/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwin1tqe_7P9AhXoTTABHbYrBok4ZBAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw1K4R-5XIk-5OtgW3p143Dw,2018-07-08
Gun Test: Kimber Aegis Elite Pro In 9mm,"By Massad Ayoob, GUNS Magazine

Photos: Takashi Sato

The ageless 1911 marches on, even managing to stay on top of newly emerging trends as it goes. Case in point: The Kimber Aegis Elite Pro, coming direct from the factory with a “carry optic” sight.

We shouldn’t be surprised: the 1911 was among the first pistols to get red dot optics, first in the bull’s eye competition world, and then in NRA Action Pistol and thereafter in USPSA. These, however, were the big bulky tubes of old, unsuitable for daily holster carry. Today’s smaller carry optics are becoming a trend in the CCW world. Though seen mostly on modern polymer pistols, our test gun is evidence the concept translates smoothly to the 1911 platform.

The Aegis Elite Pro — an eyecatching 9mm 1911.

First Look

Our test gun comprised an all-steel 5″ Government Model 9mm with the round butt common on many carry guns today. The 24 LPI checkering on the grip-frame combined with handsome gray G10 grips allow for an extremely solid hold. Some other Aegis models have slim grips for small hands, but this one is robust enough to fill your palm. A grasping groove motif looking like a cluster of little islands is found fore and aft, and turn out to work very well, providing good traction to the shooter’s hand. Fit and finish are nicely executed, with a smooth and easy-running slide, inside of which is a full-length recoil spring guide.

The key feature of this particular model is the Vortex Venom optical sight. The red dot is 6 MOA in size, and most of us who shot with it found it hit the sweet spot. The dot was small enough to allow precision 25-yard hits, not just in the head of the target but in the center head box. At the same time it was big enough anyone accustomed to shooting a red dot sight on a handgun could acquire it quickly.

An excellent set of “suppressor height” iron sights came with the package. Loved ’em. Came very quickly to the eye and were the kind of big “geezer sights” shooters in my age bracket appreciate. Out of the box, the irons co-witnessed perfectly with the red dot of the Vortex Venom. These things speak to careful attention paid at the factory.

The final argument: Takedown for the Kimber Aegis Elite Pro is old hat to 1911 guys.

Accuracy, Ammo

I was happy to find the Kimber Aegis came out of the box sighted in, both iron and glass. The high-riding suppressor-type sights had big white dot inserts, and with center hold using the traditional post-in-notch sight alignment instead of “driving the dot,” the big Kimber tended to shoot exactly where it looked. Whoever mounted the Vortex Venom optic at the factory had centered the red dot right over the front post, bringing the bullets where the shooter wanted them.

Speaking of bullets, 147-gr. subsonic 9mm rounds have been popular in the US and Canada for about 30 years. Remington-UMC’s FMJ 147 delivered a 5-shot group measuring 1.40″ center to center, with the best three in a mere 0.60″. For most of the 9mm’s existence, 124 grains was generally the heaviest available bullet weight. Today the 124 is considered a middleweight for the caliber.

Speer’s +P Gold Dot in that weight is one of the most street-proven loads around, and from the Kimber it planted 5 hits in 1.65″, the best three in 0.45″. The lighter 115 grain is still popular too. Mag-Tech’s top of the line Guardian Gold 115 +P provided a 1.55″ 5-shot group, with a best three in 0.85″. The “best three” measurement when shooting hand-held from a solid bench rest comes very close to what all five are likely to do from a machine rest setup — but a bench rest is a lot easier for most shooters to compare their own gun/ammo choices.

Factory spec’d for a 4- to 5-lb. pull weight, our test sample serial number KF51991 went a bit over this at 5 lbs., 6.7 oz. averaged on a Lyman digital gauge from Brownells. Re-set was short as is usual with 1911s, and the break was clean with little palpable movement after sear release. All in all, a good “street trigger” for a defensive 1911, and as the targets showed, the trigger was certainly no impediment to accurate shooting.

The Vortex Venom optical sight is the kicker boosting the Kimber into the “something special” zone.

Optical Sight CCW

Rising as it does from the slide, an optical sight significantly increases the height of a concealed carry pistol. The rounded butt compensates for this to some extent, but not completely. If you carry one of these on the hip, you’re probably going to want a cover garment with a bit more drape than usual.

Some of this is going to depend on body shape. A heavy-set person will find hip carry of a carry optic-equipped pistol a little easier than a slender person. That said, though, anyone carrying this type of setup is going to find it tougher to conceal discreetly.

This may be one reason why a disproportionate number of my friends and students who have carry optics on their everyday carry handguns have gone to appendix holsters. Most folks are wider side to side than they are front to back. Carrying inside the waistband at centerline — or a bit to the strong hand side of centerline — tends to make a handgun with carry optics simply more concealable.

Another thing you run into when you install carry optics is a lot of holsters aren’t cut for them. Fortunately, holsters having a partial cutaway in the upper front so the muzzle can clear faster for a draw, are more amenable to carry optics because of this cutaway factor.

I carried the Aegis with its Vortex Venom in an OWB hip holster by Dave Elderton at KyTac. It hid well enough under a 5.11 vest.

Doing The Dot

Carry optics are a relatively new thing, and what I’m about to say here applies to the breed in general, and not just the Kimber Aegis Elite Pro. I wrote about them in this column in the October 2016 issue:

“Karl Rehn, Grandmaster shooter and trainer has done the most thorough research I know of comparing carry optics with other defensive handgun sighting systems. His study encompassed 119 participants from 19- to 76-year-old males and females, skill levels from novice to Grandmaster/instructor. Smith & Wesson M&P CORE 9mm pistols were the test guns, and they were variously shot with iron sights (solid black rear, fiber optic front), Streamlight TLR-2G light/laser and Trijicon RMR with 6.5 MOA red dot — shooters tried the latter both with and without the iron sights.

“I would have thought us geezers who participated might do our best with the red dots, but I would have been wrong. Karl found, ‘Older shooters did worse with all sights other than iron sights.’ He also determined most shooters were faster with the red dot optics if iron sights were in place, probably because eyes habituated to finding front sights can use such a visual reference to ‘find the dot’ faster. I’d concur with that. The Rehn study found hits were faster with iron sights than carry optics at 5 or 10 yards. Still, a preponderance of red dot shooters seem to find themselves much more accurate with the optic at longer distances than with irons.”

When you try carry optics, commit to several hundred rounds to acclimate to the system. It takes a while to find the dot. The big high irons on our test Kimber facilitated getting the dot quickly to the eye, showing Rehn was right about this.

–

The distinctive gray G10 grips are attractive and hand-fillling.

Bottom Line

Function-wise, the Kimber performed 100 percent with its own nine-round magazine, and with 10-rounders from Wilson Combat and Mec-Gar. Another part of the equation, the Vortex Venom had a tendency for its dot to go out unpredictably during shooting, and then turn itself back on. Disconcerting, but a reason to appreciate the backup irons. This product is getting rave reviews from users in the field, so I have to presume the one we had trouble with was an aberration of the norm. The GUNS staff are following up and we’ll report back, since deadline arrived before we had it sorted.

It wasn’t long ago when a shooter who wanted to try carry optics had to spend money and waiting time to have their slide milled for one. With the Aegis Elite Pro, available in 9mm like our test gun or in .45 ACP, you sign a credit card slip and a 4473 and get the whole package ready to go right now. Its MSRP of $1,415 appears to represent a good value.

Gun Test: SIG P365 9mm,"By Massad Ayoob, GUNS Magazine

Photos: Rob Jones/The Imagesmith, LLC

Introduced at the 2018 SHOT Show, the SIG P365 emerged as the Hot Item in the CCW niche. The goal was to create a pistol the size of a 7- or 8-shot super-slim pocket 9mm. Something in the S&W Shield, GLOCK 43 or Ruger LC9 category — but with the 11-shot capacity of, say, the GLOCK 26. SIG appears to have succeeded. The new design is generally credited to a team of brilliant SIG engineers, and to Pistol Product Manager Phil Strader.

Striker-fired with a polymer frame, the pistol’s reduced girth comes in part from steel as opposed to polymer magazine bodies (currently produced for SIG by Checkmate), and from an ingenious offset magazine release button riding the curve at the forward edge of the frame. Overall thickness is listed at 1″, length at 5.8″ with a 3.1″ barrel. The unloaded weight is 17.8 oz.

The P365 comes with two 10-round magazines, one flat-bottom for maximum concealment and the other with a flange on the floorplate to provide a resting place for your pinky finger. The slide has grasping grooves up front and, conventionally, in back, and there’s a rail for a small light or laser attachment in front of the triggerguard.

Accessories after the purchase: CRKT Batum folder, Comp-Tac OWB holster, Galco Dress Belt, Streamlight Protac 2L-X and Micro USB.

Early On

The first shipment of P365s to hit the street had some teething problems. SIG had received a bad batch of SIGLite night sights from a vendor, and there were also scattered reports of failure to go into battery. Phil Strader told us this:

“There were some issues with occasional failure to go into battery. We got guns back, and decided to change some spring weights. That fixed a problem attributed to weaker wrists or grasps. Of just over a thousand guns, less than 4 percent have been returned at this time. We decided to replace the SIGLite sights with our X-Ray3 sights. Anyone with a bad sight, or currently experiencing malfunctions with their early P365, can simply send it back to the factory. If your pistol has the X-Ray3 sights, it means it is later production and is not affected.”

–

Mas liked the sights of the P365. The rear is dovetailed for windage adjustment with the aid of a sight pusher.

Testing One, Two . . .

I was actually assigned two articles on this pistol, this one for GUNS of course, and one for FMG’s Concealed Carry Special Edition. The latter’s deadline came up first, encompassing a test team of half a dozen shooters in Florida including myself, and after the article was done I took our test pistol to Arizona and ran it by four more experienced pistol packers. Ten total testers made the math easy: 20 percent female, 20 percent left-handed, most already carrying high-quality 9mms at least part of the time as their every day carry gun.

All (as in 100 percent) gave the trigger pull high marks. It’s essentially two-stage with an easy take-up flowing into a short, smooth roll until the shot breaks. Pull weight on the Lyman digital gauge averaged just under 5.5 lbs. weighed at the toe (where a pivoting trigger like this offers weight-reducing leverage), and about 6.75 lbs. at the center (where we actually apply pressure to the darn thing).

Those X-Ray3 sights were liked by 90 percent of our shooters (one didn’t like the big, green ball of the tritium front sight was so much bigger than the smaller glowing dots at the rear). Most, however, appreciated the verdant circle came so quickly to the eye in the close, fast shooting for which the P365 was designed. Making this sighting arrangement standard was, in my opinion, a very smart move.

Recoil is about the same as a GLOCK 43. Pocket-pistol size equals pocket-pistol recoil with the same caliber. It’s naturally snappier with +P and +P+ ammo. While the P365 is officially rated to handle +P, no gunmaker I know of warrants for +P+, since the industry hasn’t set any real standards for this level. That said, Strader told me the P365 stood up to +P+ in factory testing, and I had no problems with it in that regard.

Dealer’s choice: A flat-bottom 10-round magazine, or a flange-toed one like this to rest your pinky.

The 3.1″ barrel sits above a full-length guide rod with what Mas feels is an unheralded feature — it allows the barrel/slide assembly to stay in battery when the muzzle is pressed straight in against resistance. A “hard contact” shot in last-ditch defensive situations can save your life.

Why Not 25?

One test of the P365 I’ve read had the gun rated for accuracy at 15 feet. Gunwriters can cut some slack in this respect for small pocket pistols; fate and reality, however, may not cooperate. So I still test at 25 yards, which is customary for full-size service pistols, where the standard seems to have evolved that “five shots in four inches at 25 yards equals ‘acceptable service pistol accuracy.’”

Given the vast number of police shootings evolve out of some perpetrator originally ravaging a helpless citizen, I kinda like the idea of the citizen being able to solve the problem before the police even get there. Another given: armed citizens carry guns to protect themselves from the same vicious criminals the police carry guns to protect them from. Therefore, it strikes me as a good idea to see how the carry gun of the real first responder (the intended victim) compares to the official first responder (the arriving officer).

I’ve made it a habit to test with the three most popular bullet weights in the given caliber, 9mm of course in this case. The 147-gr. subsonic kicked very softly in the P365, and two loads (SIG FMJ and Remington-UMC) both went just a bit over 4″ for all five shots at 25 yards from a Matrix rest on a concrete bench. This testing format will give you a good idea of what an experienced shooter can expect in perfect, stress-free conditions. I also measure the best three shots in each such group, because exhaustive testing has shown this roughly duplicates what that gun and that load is likely to do from a machine rest. The 147-gr. loads gave three-shot clusters of 1.55″ (Rem-UMC) and 1.60″ (SIG FMJ), which was way more reassuring.

However, in both tests 115- and 124-grain ammo shot tighter than the 147s. Two 115-gr. Federal products, cheap American Eagle FMJ training ammo and the hot 9BPLE +P+ JHP, were tested. The ball round ran pretty close to the 147s in accuracy, but the high speed JHP 115 put all five shots in 3.10″ and the best three in exactly half at 1.55″.

Real magic happened with the 124-gr. “middle weight.” One of the most street-proven 9mm rounds is Speer’s 124 gr. +P Gold Dot, known as “the New York load.” It passed the service pistol test in the tiny SIG P365 with 3.95″ for all five shots at 25 yards, the best three in 1.80″.

And topping the accuracy mark was SIG’s 124-gr. V-Crown JHP which put five shots into 1.5″ at 25 yards. A single .40 slug could have touched all of the best three in the group. For a gun this size, this is simply phenomenal.

The Reliability Factor

I lost exact count early on, but by the time we finished the second test run, we were coming right up on 1,000 rounds without cleaning or adding any lubrication to the gun as it came out of the box. There were no malfunctions of any kind in the first test cycle, and then only two in the second — failures to feed. Both occurred with out-of-spec Winchester “White Box” 115-gr. ball rounds that wouldn’t have fed in any other 9mm either. Hence, the 100 percent reliability rating.

One feature of the P365 — which I’m amazed SIG doesn’t advertise — is its full-length recoil spring guide rod allows the barrel/slide assembly to stay in battery when the muzzle is pressed straight in against resistance — the sometimes necessary “hard contact” shot in last-ditch defensive shooting. More subcompacts than not will go out of battery and fail in that kill-or-be-killed situation. The P365 will let you make this hard contact shot.

Ergonomics “At Speed”

The P365 would be a very good choice for IDPA BUG or even CCP competition. The International Defensive Pistol Association has divisions for subcompact Back-Up Guns like this one, and it’s shootable enough for the Concealed Carry Pistol division designed for 4″ barreled 15-shot 9mms and the like. I couldn’t find one of those matches that coordinated with the deadlines, so I shot the P365 over four sets of falling plate racks like the event at a GLOCK match.

I also ran an off-duty/backup gun police qualification course going from four to 15 yards on fixed times. The plate runs were in the ballpark with my last couple of GLOCK matches with my familiar G26 subcompact, and the qualifying score was 300 out of 300 possible. I was satisfied with the P365’s performance.

My only personal beefs with the gun are that it pointed low for me (which is of course subjective) and — as received — it shot to the right. We fixed it with a sight tool. Also (objectively) all of the right-handed shooters had difficulty with the mag release.

In moving it to keep the profile slim, the P365’s mag release button angle had to be altered. Imagine you’re having an out-of-body experience and are looking down at yourself from above as you shoot on the range, aiming due north. Normally, to press a release button you would apply pressure due east. On the P365 the pressure has to go inward and rearward, essentially southeast. Our RH shooters found their thumbs didn’t go in that direction. But our southpaws, using their trigger finger which can naturally curve in that direction, said “What’s the problem?”

Fortunately, you can easily swap the mag release button to the other side and shoot it in mirror image like a southpaw, which strikes me as a fine idea.

Field stripping is easy. The P365 comes with two magazines and a sturdy hard case. Not to mention a very reasonable sticker price.

With the profile of a slim seven-shot “Pocket 9” and the 10-plus-1 capacity of a full-size service pistol in one of the “magazine limit” jurisdictions, the SIG P365 essentially creates a new niche in defensive handguns. It’s a solid value at $599 MSRP, as evidenced by the fact 30 percent of our test team have already bought one after testing, and more have said enthusiastically they intend to do so.

Gun Test: Alpha Wolf .45 PCC Carbine,"By Dave Workman, GUNS Magazine

Featuring short stoke, gas piston operation, the Alpha Wolf PCC (for “Pistol Caliber Carbine”) from Lone Wolf Distributors is something you need to shoot…a lot if you have a steady supply of 9mm or .45 ACP ammunition, as there are models chambered for either cartridge.

The Alpha Wolf PCC is chambered for 9mm or .45 ACP, and with a 16-inch barrel, it’s ready to rock.

Author Workman ran the carbine through its paces in a short range session. He found it to be a very accurate rifle.

The receiver is made from 6061 T6 aluminum, and he discovered that it feeds 230-grain ball without fail.

It doesn’t like some JHPs, but stuff the magazine with 230-grain ball and this semi-auto rocks. I had a couple of failures to feed with Speer’s Gold Dot, but the hardball ammunition went in and out without a hitch. I also fired some loads with different JHP rounds that performed fine.

This is a “fun gun” that can certainly do double duty for home or business defense, predator control, competition and even small game hunting. The Alpha Wolf is built around a rotating, locking bolt system.

It accepts standard Glock pistol magazines, and the one sent with my test gun worked flawlessly, though it was kind of a thumb buster when it came to jamming in that last round. Take my advice; get hold of a device that helps in the loading of magazines. You will not be sorry.

–

The muzzle of the 16-inch barrel is threaded to accept accessories, and it comes with a thread protector.

–

Workman borrowed a set of sights — the Alpha Wolf does not come with sights — and he discovered that even with manual sights, this carbine can punch pretty tight groups.

The Alpha Wolf, I discovered during an all-too-brief range session, is pretty darned accurate even with add-on sights (my test gun came with no sights at all) that I borrow from my son. He’s an AR15 fan, and handed me a set with a tritium insert on the front post.

According to Lone Wolf literature, “The short stroke gas piston system eases recoil with the reciprocating mass resulting in quicker follow up shots, compared to a heavier, rearward force, blowback system.” I can say without fear of contradiction, that’s true. Felt recoil was almost non-existent, and as I cranked off rounds, I was delighted at the tight groups I was able to produce.

My guess is that if the Alpha Wolf is fitted with an optical sight, it will deliver accurate hits on any target within a hundred yards, which is not too shabby for a long gun launching a pistol-caliber cartridge.

The magazine release is a side-mounted lever that works with an easy press.

Lone Wolf Distributors designed this carbine with a telescoping stock.

The Alpha Wolf accepts standard 13-round Glock pistol magazines. One comes with each gun.

Takedown is a snap. Just pull the top pin and the receiver tips forward, essentially the same as an AR-type rifle.

This carbine comes standard with a 16-inch button cut barrel (a 10-incher is available) that is threaded at the muzzle for a suppressor, compensator or flash suppressor. It’s got a telescoping buttstock, the charging handle is on the left side of the receiver, and the proprietary handguard features an M-Lok rail system for accessories, including the aforementioned sights. Overall length of the standard model with the buttstock is 34 ½ inches. When the buttstock is depressed, the overall length is 32 inches.

At 6.4 pounds, the Alpha Wolf is an easy carry. It is designed with a proprietary receiver made from billet 6061T6 aluminum that seems to be pretty rugged. The carbine uses a standard AR/M4 fire control group, though the magazine release is a bit different from a standard AR platform.

Naturally, somebody will question why anyone might want a carbine chambered for a pistol cartridge. That’s a fair question, and one that I would quickly answer by saying that ammunition in either caliber is almost universally available. You’d have to look pretty hard to find a gun shop that doesn’t have a supply of 9mm or .45 ACP ammunition on the shelves.

The bolt comes out with ease for cleaning.

Those fire controls will look immediately familiar to anyone who has ever opened up a modern porting rifle.

Rear look at the opened receiver with the retaining pin.

Once Workman got the hang of it, he managed groups like this. The single flyer was deliberate.

Cleanup? That’s what aerosols are for, along with standard brushes in the appropriate caliber. Then swab the bore, which is not chrome lined, according to Lone Wolf literature and finish it off with a lightly-oiled patch.

The Alpha Wolf should be right at home as an emergency gun to have along in a truck, SUV or even light aircraft.

The Alpha Wolf PCC in .45 ACP has an MSRP of $1,174.95. It comes with a single magazine.

Gun Test: Remington Model 870 Tac-14,"Last year, Remington Arms Company rolled out a line of pump-action firearms featuring 14-inch barrels, no stocks, no pistol grips and measuring slightly longer than 26 inches. The line included a model 870 in 12 gauge, followed by its little brother, the 20-gauge Tac-14. How does a firearms manufacturer design and build these sorts of guns, with barrels less than the 18-inch length required to avoid taxation under the National Firearms Act (NFA) as short-barreled shotguns? Well, the ATF ruled these guns to be firearms under the Gun Control Act of 1968, but not within the meaning of the NFA. In other words, the way I see it the guns are legally firearms with overall lengths exceeding 26 inches, but they are not subject to the NFA tax stamp requirement because Remington didn’t design them to be fired from the shoulder and as such they are not shotguns.

This new 20-gauge model sports a 14-inch cylinder bore in, of course, a smaller barrel than the 12, yet touts a 4+1 capacity. Its forend is a Magpul 12 gauge, with a Remington-designed adapter. The Tac 14 in 20 is possible, thanks to a Mesa Tactical “Lucy” grip adapter for a 12-gauge shockwave that fits onto a 20-gauge receiver.

I shot samples of each of the Tac-14 models in this line last summer at a media event at Gunsite. I preferred the 20 gauge, mostly because of its reduced recoil when compared to the larger gauge.

Remington believes the personal defense market will love this line, especially for ease of traveling and storage; it also is much faster to wield than a standard shotgun. I think they’re right, and I also believe that the 20-gauge model is perfect in my world for vehicle carry, backpacking/hiking in high country and overall personal defense in the home.

Tac-14 On The Range

Is it hard to shoot? You don’t put this gun to your cheek. You push it out in front of your body, or if you want, you can try shooting it from the hip. I pushed mine out in front. It does have some stout recoil, but not nearly as noticeable as its compatriot in 12 gauge does.

The gun weighs about 5 pounds, which makes it easy to handle. I would heartily recommend dry firing it first, and cycling the action a few times through. Get used to the pump. Keep your support hand firmly forward and tight on the gun’s forend, so your hand doesn’t come back with it under recoil and execute a “short stroke.”

I admit it. At first, I had to work through flinching, but then once I got used to it I liked the way it handled, and … I liked the results I saw on paper with the Ultimate Defense Managed Recoil Buckshot loads that Remington sent me. I shot it at ranges from 3 yards to 7 yards. I used only this ammo because frankly, I prefer buckshot for my personal defense shotshell loads.

The Right Ammo

The ammunition side of the company has designed a new, special buckshot for this line, as well – the Ultimate Defense Managed Recoil Buckshot. These rounds have been created to deliver tight, effective short-range patterns and Remington says it reduces recoil up to 40%. The 20-gauge loads contain 17 pellets of #3 buckshot at a velocity of 1140 fps, and is sold in boxes of 5 for $5.26 per box.

I think this gun, combined with reduced recoil ammo, is a good fit for someone who wants a home defense gun or a gun to take along in a vehicle.

Starting at $443.05

Democrats Use Mass Shooting At Pittsburgh Synagogue To Demand Gun Control,"Congressional Democrats immediately pushed for gun control measures following the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday that left at least 10 people dead.

The suspect, identified as Robert Bowers, was reportedly armed with a rifle and several handguns. Bowers’ social media accounts were filled with anti-Semitic rhetoric and is said to have yelled “All Jews must die!” during the shooting.

It’s unclear at this point how Bowers acquired his weapons, whether he passed a background check and whether any proposed legislation could have prevented the shooting. Even so, prominent Democrats took to social media to advocate for more restrictive gun legislation in response to the mass murder.

“Congress is complicit—by its inaction—in this loathsome epidemic of gun violence,” Democratic Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.

“I don’t want to arm synagogues and churches and schools. I want to live in a society where nazism and white supremacy crawls back in a hole and we have universal background checks,” wrote Democratic Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz.

Democratic Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, currently in the midst of a competitive re-election race, slammed unnamed “opponents of common-sense gun safety” following Saturday’s mass murder.

“Every time this happens, we’re shocked – and say it mustn’t happen again. When will opponents of common-sense gun safety work with us?” asked Nelson. “We need to get assault weapons off the streets and out of the hands of those who would do us harm.”

“We need more than thoughts and prayers-we need action to stop these senseless deaths from gun violence,” wrote Democratic Delaware Sen. Chris Coons.

Democratic New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez called for “reasonable gun safety measures.” (RELATED: Democratic Congressman Says Bombing Suspect ‘Right Out Of Central Casting From A Trump Rally)

President Donald Trump took the opposite approach, and said he wished the synagogue had an armed guard.

“This would be a case for, if there was an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop him. Maybe there would’ve been nobody killed except for [the gunman]… [but] this is a world with a lot of problems and it has been for many, many years,” Trump said.

House Democrats Outline Gun Control Agenda For 116th Congress,"With anti-gun Democrats back in control of the House of Representatives come January, now is the time to prepare for a new onslaught on the Second Amendment. Emboldened by the mere thought of controlling the lower chamber, we are already seeing the warning signs of what will come for the next two years.

First, virtually all Democrat leadership positions are likely to be filled by long-time anti-gun zealots, such as former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). Similarly, key committees will surely be chaired by extremists with long histories of supporting any and all legislation designed to diminish the rights of law-abiding gun owners.

In other words, if you can imagine a new, draconian restriction on guns, gun owners, firearm parts and accessories, or ammunition, expect it to not only be introduced, but to be given a hearing. Also expect the anti-gun legacy media to openly fawn over these efforts. The same goes for any old proposals that have already been introduced and rejected, or even implemented and later repealed or abandoned after proving to be ineffective.

At the top of the list, of course, will be banning semi-automatic firearms. Extremists will try to ban America’s most popular rifle, the AR15, as well as any other semi-automatic rifle. The standard magazines that come with these rifles, as well as any that are sold separately that are deemed “too big,” will also be the target of bans. Most semi-automatic handguns and shotguns will also be swept into these bans.

“Universal” background checks are also a priority for anti-gun Democrats. In fact, Nancy Pelosi even promised to support criminalizing the private transfer of firearms if Democrats were given control of the House. Pelosi and her ilk will try to exploit all of the recent tragic shootings that have taken place in order to promote “universal” background check while ignoring the fact that none of them would have been impacted by such a scheme. The firearms in all of these horrific crimes were acquired through either the federally-mandated background check, or even more restrictive state systems.

There are many reasons to not trust Pelosi, but when it comes to her pledge to attack law-abiding gun owners, you can take that to the bank.

Democrats who have been chomping at the bit for years to push their anti-gun agenda in the House have made it very clear your rights are fair game, and they have said they will not waste any time once they seize the reins of control.

Along with semi-auto bans and “universal” background checks, expect to see attempts to tax firearms and ammunition out of the grasp of the average American. Through incompetence or malice, these legislative proposals will be so poorly drafted that it will be impossible for law-abiding gun owners to even attempt to comply with their byzantine provisions.

As an example, one need only look to the most recent gun control bill introduced in Congress. H.R. 7115, the so-called “3–D Firearms Prohibitions Act.” Attentive readers will probably notice that the bad drafting started with the title: we live in a three-dimensional world; so all firearms are necessarily “3-D.” Despite the title, the bill doesn’t seem to ban all firearms, however, it’s provisions are so poorly drafted and show such a incredible lack of understanding of firearms that it likely does ban nearly any part intended for use in a modern semi-automatic firearm. Even simple pins and springs seem to fall within the provisions of the bill.

While 7115 is unlikely to move in the current Congress, it will likely be on the agenda next year. But that’s just the start.

Ultimately, the Second Amendment will likely be under a more severe attack over the next two years than perhaps it has ever seen. With some sources showing that as many as one in five likely voters in Democrat primaries would like to see the Second Amendment repealed, it’s likely that some members of Congress will attempt to oblige.

Established in 1975, the Institute for Legislative Action (ILA) is the “lobbying” arm of the National Rifle Association of America. ILA is responsible for preserving the right of all law-abiding individuals in the legislative, political, and legal arenas, to purchase, possess and use firearms for legitimate purposes as guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2018/11/18/house-democrats-outline-gun-control-agenda-for-116th-congress/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjR3qad_7P9AhXmFlkFHU7nA444UBAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw30NFdgDPYO6efpecMsjwKd,2018-11-18
Gun Test: Kimber Micro 9,"By Jim House, Gun Digest

Micro 9mm handguns are popping up all over, and Kimber’s Micro 9 is no slouch.

3.15-inch barrel

15.6 ounces unloaded

1.06-inch width

Approximately 7-pound trigger pull

Locked barrel-slide design

No grip safety

Velocities within 100-125 fps of a full-sized 9mm

In one of the old books that I like to read, the author mentions that there are times when one cannot be burdened with a rifle, but the situation may be such that one does not want to be unarmed. Therein lies the virtue of the handgun. Most handguns are portable and provide a measure of protection. With the increase in concealed carry across the country, compact handguns are enormously popular — and the selection is truly bewildering.

The Kimber Micro 9 is a capable and attractive little pistol.

Small pocketable revolvers have been on the market since the late 1800s, and for well more than a century, the 1911-style has dominated the marketplace. Designed by John M. Browning, the Colt 1911 was the primary handgun of the U.S. military for 85 years. Chambered for the .45 Auto cartridge, the pistol utilizes a single-stack magazine and is fired in the single-action mode. The 1911 pistols incorporate both thumb and grip safeties, and many shooters take solace in the use of two very intuitive safeties.

Kimber’s Take On The 1911

Kimber offers a vast array of pistols of the 1911 pattern. These include full-size models in .45 Auto, 9mm Luger and 10mm Auto calibers. However, smaller models having 4-inch barrels (the so-called “Commander” size) are also produced in .45 and 9mm calibers, but for discrete carry, models having 3-inch barrels and shorter grips are available.

Newer in the Kimber line are the Micro versions, with the original model being chambered in .380 Auto. These pistols function as a 1911 except for the absence of a grip safety. With magazines that can hold either six or seven rounds, and with a 2.75-inch barrel, the Kimber Micro .380 pistols are easily concealable. However, even though many people want a compact pistol, they desire one with more power than that of the .380 Auto.

Kimber has already taken the next step to produce a more powerful — but yet very compact— pistol. Known as the Micro 9, it’s chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge and features a 3.15-inch barrel yet, unloaded, it weighs only 15.6 ounces. And because shooters like options, the Micro 9 is available in more than a dozen versions that differ in metal finishes, grip styles, sights and other details.

My choice was obvious as soon as I saw it: The version known as the “Two Tone” has a blued-steel slide and an aluminum alloy frame that resembles brushed stainless steel. This model may be considered as the “basic” version, but it comes with beautiful checkered rosewood grips and white-dot sights.

Overall dimensions for the Two-Tone are 6.1 inches long, 1.06 inches wide and 4.07 inches high. The sight radius is 4.3 inches, and the trigger pull is approximately 7 pounds — which is not what’s expected for a target pistol, but it’s not bad for the intended uses of a Micro 9. The Two Tone version of the Micro 9 has an MSRP of $654, so it’s not exactly inexpensive, but it certainly is reasonable.

Pistols chambered for the .380 Auto are generally based on a simple blow back action, but this Micro Kimber is no .380 Auto. For a pistol chambered for the more powerful 9mm Luger cartridge, a locked barrel-slide design is necessary. The Kimber Micro 9 features a locking mechanism that involves a large step on the rear of the barrel that mates with the cutout in the slide. Upon firing, the barrel and slide travel rearward for a short distance after which the toggle link pulls the barrel downward. That action moves the locking ridges on the barrel from the recesses in the slide after which the slide continues to the rear to complete the ejection and loading cycle. Unlike most other pistols of the 1911 pattern, there is no grip safety and the safety does not lock the slide.

The seven-round magazine furnished with the Micro 9 has a black extension that allows me to keep three fingers around the grip rather than two on the grip and the little finger below the butt. A good purchase is provided by the checkered rosewood grips, and the trigger is grooved and the backstrap sharply checkered. Altogether, the Micro 9 is comfortable in the hand, and the controls work properly.

Disassembly and reassembly of the Micro 9 is simple — but it is different from that of full-sized 1911 pistols.

Can This Micro Shoot?

With a barrel that measures only 3.15 inches in length, the Kimber is compact for easy carry — but one may ask how much of the performance of the 9mm Luger cartridge is lost with such a short barrel.

To answer that question, a few types of 9mm Luger ammunition were fired through the Micro 9 (3.15-inch barrel), a Sig P225 (3.6-inch barrel) and a Ruger SR1911 (4.25-inch barrel). The average velocities were measured at 10 feet from the muzzle for those three pistols. Actual muzzle velocities would be slightly higher than those measured at even 10 feet from the muzzle. The data obtained are shown in the accompanying table.

Even using the velocity measured at 10 feet from the muzzle, the little Micro 9 generates 290 fpe with a 115-grain bullet. When used with some of the defensive loads, muzzle energy would be around 300 fpe and that with bullets that give excellent performance. The Kimber Micro 9 may be small, but it’s potent.

As the data shown in the table reveal, the little Kimber Micro 9 will give velocities that are within 100-125 fps of those produced by full-size 9mm pistols. Velocity loss is expected because of the short barrel, but it’s not substantial. It’s a powerful little beast.

I’ve had a Kimber Micro in .380 Auto for some time and, even though it’s slightly smaller and lighter than the Micro 9, it’s not unpleasant to shoot. However, I had some concern that being chambered for the more powerful 9mm Luger cartridge, the Micro 9 might be a little unpleasant to shoot — that did not turn out to be the case at all. Although recoil is noticeable, firing the Micro 9 is not painful. The bark and jump are there, but not to an excessive degree.

Sights on the Micro 9 are excellent for the intended use of the pistol. The square-topped front mates very well with the square notch in the blade of the rear sight. In order to make the sights stand out in dim light, the three-dot system is used (white dots on either side of the rear notch and on the rear face of the front blade). This combination is both popular and effective. In fact, I find the dovetailed sights on the Micro 9 to be about as good as those on any of my other centerfire pistols that have fixed sights.

Trigger pull on the Kimber Micro 9 is advertised to be approximately 7 pounds. On my pistol, there’s a short take-up movement followed by a crisp let-off, but the trigger pull is indeed heavy. Over many years of shooting many types of firearms, I’ve found that it’s possible to get used to a trigger that has less than ideal characteristics. It took a while to get used to the trigger on the Micro 9, but with familiarity came acceptance — and with acceptance came improved skill.

A shooter who has a Kimber Micro 9 and practices on a regular basis will become accustomed to the trigger action. It will probably be most disconcerting to a relatively new shooter whose experience has been with handguns that are intended for different uses. As a safety issue, one would not want a hair trigger on such a small defensive pistol, but I would prefer let-off to occur with a pull that’s a couple of pounds lighter.

Tiny Reliability

Although the Kimber Micro 9 is not a target pistol, it was easy to get nice clusters of holes in a target placed at 7 yards. In testing several types of ammunition, the pistol fed, fired and ejected reliably with bullets of all types. In addition to several types of factory loads tested, I fired several different handloads and the Micro 9 functioned flawlessly with all loads tested. I have complete faith in the little pistol as long as my target is at short range.

The Kimber Micro 9 is available in a plethora of models that range in outward appearance from all stainless to vibrant colors, so there’s a version to satisfy the artistic taste of anyone who wants a compact 9mm that’s similar to the 1911 in operation. The pistols are attractive and fit most hands admirably. The Micro 9 is a surprisingly accurate and adequately powerful little pistol that makes a good piece of defensive ordnance.

House To Move Forward With Gun Control Proposals,"On Wednesday, gun owners got to see what a Nancy Pelosi controlled Congress looks like as the House Judiciary Committee held its first gun control hearing in nearly a decade. Things went as one would expect.

While the hearing was labeled “Preventing Gun Violence: A Call to Action,” it was intended to be the legislative launching pad for H.R. 8, the “universal” background check bill introduced by California Representative Mike Thompson (D). As we have pointed out, “universal” background checks will do nothing to prevent gun violence. H.R. 8 does, however, have the potential of ensnaring otherwise law-abiding gun owners unfamiliar with its proposed new restrictions on lawful activities that pose no threat to public safety.

From the beginning, it was clear how anti-gun members of the committee intended to steer the proceedings.

First, there was the panel, which consisted of two crime victims, two anti-gun representatives of law-enforcement, one trauma surgeon (who happens to sit on the Board of the anti-gun Brady Campaign), one constitutional scholar, and the Executive Director of the anti-gun Giffords Law Center. Out of the seven panelists, only two—one crime victim and constitutional scholar Joyce Lee Malcolm—spoke against H.R. 8 and other forms of gun control that were discussed.

Notably absent from the hearing was House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R). While the Louisiana Representative is a survivor of a well-known public shooting, and he asked to be given the opportunity to testify, his request was denied. He was likely denied for being unwilling to toe the gun control line, and anyone interested in seeing what he had to say on the matter can see his full statement here.

A tone that was clearly antagonistic towards the right to keep and bear arms was set early by Democrats on the committee. The panelists were each given five minutes to make an opening statement, and most used that time to make clearly emotional, political, and/or arguable points, which is expected in such a setting. But a courtesy normally extended to panelists allows them to make such statements unchallenged. If legislators wish to question something said during opening remarks, they are free to do so during their own allotted speaking time.

Anti-gun Florida Representative Ted Deutch (D) simply couldn’t wait his turn.

After Professor Joyce Lee Malcolm had made her opening remarks, Deutch decided he needed to make sure the anti-gun community knew where he stood. Abandoning common courtesy, he spoke up, misstating what Malcolm had said so that he could appear as if he was correcting her. The message was clear; support the Second Amendment in this committee hearing at your own peril.

It should come as no surprise that the committee didn’t focus on the actual effectiveness of H.R. 8 at reducing violent crime. Recent studies, even those produced by anti-gun research institutions, have found that “universal” background checks are ineffective at reducing crime.

Ultimately, the hearing went as anyone who pays attention to politics would expect. Anti-gun Democrats made sure they were able to promote anti-gun legislation, and they ignored facts, reason, and the concerns of crime victims that don’t support their agenda. What’s next for H.R. 8?

The bill will receive a “markup” as part of the committee process next Wednesday. That’s why it’s important for all gun owners to take action now to help stop this misguided and ineffective gun control from moving through Congress.

ILA is responsible for preserving the right of all law-abiding individuals in the legislative, political, and legal arenas, to purchase, possess and use firearms for legitimate purposes as guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2019/02/10/house-to-move-forward-with-gun-control-proposals/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiR_q6Z_7P9AhVCFlkFHTTaDjc4FBAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw0BoJb-tZh5nDISt81jNGzC,2019-02-10
HR 1112 Gives Feds Unfettered Power To Block Gun Sales,"H.R. 8, which would criminalize the private transfer of firearms, has received significant attention from the gun rights community. However, H.R. 1112, which purportedly targets the inappropriately-named “Charleston loophole,” is just as insidious an attack on gun owners. Both bills were passed out of the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.

H.R. 1112 would eliminate the 3-day safety-valve provision under the federal firearms background check system that prevents the government from enacting an indefinite delay of firearm purchases for law-abiding Americans. All Federal Firearms Licensees (gun dealers) are required to conduct a background check on prospective purchasers to determine if transferring the firearm would violate state or federal law. Under current law, if an FFL initiates a background check, but does not receive a determination from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System within three business days, the FFL may proceed with the firearms transfer. After the three-day window, FBI continues to research the matter that gave rise to an individual’s delay for 90 days after the check was initiated. If it is later determined that the person is prohibited from possessing firearms, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is notified and tasked with retrieving the firearm.

Under the proposed legislation, the 3-day safety valve would be eliminated and replaced with a procedure that provides gun buyers with no protection. If an FFL initiates a check and does not receive a response from NICS after 10 business days, the prospective purchaser may petition the FBI to permit the transfer to proceed. The FFL may not proceed with the transaction until an additional 10 business days have elapsed from the date of the petition.

Existing federal law limits the validity of a NICS background check to 30 calendar days from the date it is initiated. Because H.R. 1112 uses business days and the NICS validity provision is in calendar days, in practice, H.R. 1112 would have no default proceed available.

For example, if H.R. 1112 were to become law, gun buyers who are delayed on the busiest gun buying day of the year, Black Friday, would not be able to clear their delay under H.R. 1112’s provisions before their NICS check expired. Black Friday 2019 falls on November 29th, so the first day that the prospective purchaser could file a petition would be December 14th.

The additional 10-business day wait after the petition would make December 31st the first day that the FFL could transfer the firearm, but that would be prohibited because the NICS check expired on December 29th. The purchaser would have to begin the process again with another NICS check, with the likely result being another delay and the process beginning all over again.

The current three-day safety-valve provision is vital and protects gun owners in numerous ways. The safety-valve provision ensures that if there is a disruption to the NICS system or an overwhelming volume of background checks, lawful firearms transfer from dealers can still take place. Most importantly, the safety-valve provision ensures that the FBI carries out its background check duties in an expedient and responsible manner that recognizes the right to keep and bear arms as a constitutionally-protected individual right.

Absent this provision, the FBI would have less incentive to conduct NICS checks in a timely manner. Moreover, the agency would have free reign to indefinitely delay any transfers they deem undesirable, for whatever political or purported public policy purpose they could concoct. This would turn all firearms sales from dealers into something akin to may-issue licensing. Prospective gun buyers who are not prohibited from owning firearms by law could be denied by bureaucratic dictate through the form of an indefinite delay.

Providing FBI with this sort of discretion poses a danger to Second Amendment rights. This is clear, because the FBI already attempts to use assumed discretion to encumber certain lawful gun sales.

According to the Congressional Research Service it is standard FBI practice to delay firearms transactions to those on the government’s secret watchlists. A person’s placement on a secret government watchlist with secret and nebulous criteria is not sufficient to encumber their constitutional rights, therefore they are not prohibited from possessing firearms by virtue of their watchlist status. Aside from the constitutional matter, those on the secret federal watchlists are not statutorily prohibited from possessing firearms. However, the FBI has taken upon itself to delay all background checks for those suspected of being on its secret watchlist.

As the CRS report explained,

In the case of a possible watchlist match, NICS sends a delayed transfer (for up to three business days) response to the querying federally licensed gun dealer or state POC. During a delay, NICS staff contacts immediately the FBI Headquarters’ Counterterrorism Division and FBI Special Agents in the field, and a coordinated effort is made to research possibly unknown prohibiting factors. If no prohibiting factors are uncovered within this three-day period, firearms dealers may proceed with the transaction at their discretion. However, FBI counterterrorism officials continue to work the case for up to 90 days in case disposition information is returned that permits a final determination.

Even those who have little sympathy for those who currently find themselves on secret government watchlists should understand that FBI’s dubious and assumed discretionary authority in this instance is a grave threat to liberty and that this threat would be severely exacerbated without the safety-valve provision. What group might an emboldened federal government find deplorable enough to target next?

Legislation to remove the three-day safety valve provision has been marketed as an effort to close the so-called “Charleston loophole.” The term stems from the hate-fueled 2015 shooting of several parishioners at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. Proponents of the legislation claim that perpetrator of the attack could have been stopped but for the three-day safety-valve provision. This is false.

On April 11, 2015, the perpetrator of the Charleston attack attempted to buy the firearm he used in the shooting from an FFL and was delayed due to an arrest for drug possession. The firearm was transferred to him five days later, absent a direct proceed order from NICS. The attack did not occur until June 17. In the intervening time, the FBI had the opportunity to continue to investigate whether the perpetrator was prohibited from possessing firearms and could have referred the case to ATF for a firearm retrieval had they determined he was indeed prohibited.

Contrary to inaccurate statements made by the FBI, the perpetrator was not prohibited from possessing firearms. Under federal law, a person is prohibited from possessing firearms if they are an “unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance.” The FBI has contended that the perpetrator’s arrest would have prohibited him from possessing a firearm. In turn, this has prompted gun control supporters to claim that this instance proves the FBI should be given further time to conduct NICS checks, even though the FBI had more than two months to investigate the validity of the transfer in the case. To sustain a conviction for firearm possession by an “unlawful user” federal courts require the drug use to be “sufficiently consistent, prolonged, and close in time to [the] gun possession . . . .”1 A simple drug arrest does not meet this standard.

Therefore, for multiple reasons, the ploy by this bill’s proponents of connecting the three-day safety-valve provision to the Charleston attack is simply fraudulent.

Gun rights supporters have spent the last 30 years successfully working to remove may-issue licensing schemes that empower those in government to indulge their political biases and general prejudices to control the exercise of a constitutional right. Gun owners and civil liberties supporters across the political spectrum must recognize H.R. 1112 for what it is, a measure that would subject the exercise of a constitutional right to the unfettered discretion of federal bureaucrats.

Illinois Lawmakers Pushed Back-Door Gun Control 7 Times — In 16 Days,"The Illinois Legislature has only been in session for 16 days in 2019 — and already, the state has introduced seven measures designed to impose back-door gun control.

Senate Bill 337

SB 337 was passed in the previous legislative session but was placed under a procedural hold to avoid a possible veto from outgoing Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. It was signed into law by newly inaugurated Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker on January 17, 2019, in spite of study data that suggested such a move might not even make the state safer.

What SB 337 does:

Requires all federally-licensed firearms dealers in the state of Illinois to also obtain a state license

Creates an electronic transaction history that can act as a de facto registry

Requires all licensed firearms dealers to submit to inspections

Senate Bill 107

SB 107 was introduced on January 24, 2019, and seeks to restrict the sale of semi-automatic rifles, semi-automatic handguns and even some shotguns by designating them as “assault weapons.” The legislation, which has not yet made it through committee, also seeks to ban several components and accessories as well.

What SB 107 does:

Outlaws the possession of any firearm designated by the legislation as an “assault weapon” — including those already in circulation

Makes it a crime for anyone in possession of a newly-designated “assault weapon” to retain ownership of said firearm more than 300 days after the bill becomes law

Forces those who choose not to surrender legally-purchased “assault weapons” to file exemption forms with the IL State Police, thus creating a registry

Bans any semi-automatic rifle or handgun, with either a fixed or removable magazine, that can hold more than ten rounds at a time

Bans shotguns with a magazine capacity of greater than five rounds

House Bill 0888

HB 0888 was introduced on January 24, 2019, and amends the process by which Illinois residents must obtain Firearm Owner ID (FOID) cards. According to the text of the bill, all residents who wish to apply for a FOID card must surrender to the Illinois State Police a list of all social media accounts.

HB 0888 is scheduled to be heard by the committee on February 19.

House Bill 0889

HB 0889, also introduced January 24, requires State Police to revoke the FOID card of any resident who reports the loss or theft of a legally owned firearm three separate times in a period of two years or less. That revocation would last for a period of one year.

HB 0889 is also set to be heard by the committee on February 19.

House Bill 892

HB 892 was introduced on January 28, 2019, and appears to be an end-run around the possibility of firearms and/or their components being built by 3-D printers. According to the text, the bill seeks to ban firearms and firearm components that would not be “detectable” by traditional means. It that all components must be detectable either by a metal detector or a “traditional scanner” and that the item being scanned must “generate an image that accurately depicts the shape of the component.”

House Bill 1467

HB 1467 was introduced on January 29, 2019, and would create a registry for any Illinois residents engaging in the sale of ammunition — including sales between private individuals.

What HB 1467 does:

Requires any person or business who sells ammunition of any kind to maintain a record of that person’s full name, date of birth, address, date of sale and FOID card information

Requires the seller to maintain a record of the type, caliber, amount and serial number of the ammunition sold

Requires the seller to keep an inspectable record of all such sales on the premises at all times and to turn over the records of each individual sale to IL State Police within 7 days of the transaction

Requires the State Police to maintain a searchable database of these records

House Bill 2331

HB 2331 was introduced on February 11, 2019, and imposes a new tax on certain firearms and firearm components sold in the state of Illinois. According to the text, a 3.75-percent tax would be added to any firearm or firearm component purchase. The revenue raised from that tax would then be placed into the YouthBuild Assistance Fund, which is also created by HB 2331. Those funds would be used for “youth programming,” but the bill does not specify the type of program to which that refers.

The state of Illinois has long been viewed as unfriendly to legal gun owners — it was one of the last states to allow concealed carry (by permit only), and only did so because the 7th Circuit Court ruled that a total ban on concealed carry was unconstitutional.

Even so, the possibility of additional regulations could begin to drive businesses and sales out of a state that is already in the red and losing population.

Cory Garcia, a licensed firearms dealer and certified firearms instructor, told The Daily Caller that he has had enough: “[Democrat] majority in the House and Senate and an anti-gun governor? Say good-bye to your guns. I’m moving my FFL and business to Texas.”

Republicans And Democrats Debate Gun Registration Ahead Of House Gun Control Votes,"WASHINGTON, D.C.—House Republicans and Democrats traded gun control policy barbs Tuesday, in back-to-back press conferences on Capitol Hill.

The Bipartisan Background Checks bill (HR 8), largely Democrat legislation co-sponsored by just five House Republicans and 227 Democrats, is spearheaded by Democratic California Rep. Mike Thompson.

Despite its name, the five Republican co-sponsors—Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, Florida Rep. Brian Mast, Michigan Rep. Fred Upton, New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith and New York Rep. Peter King—did not appear at Tuesday’s press conference with their Democratic colleagues touting the merits of the legislation.

The Enhanced Background Checks Bill (HR 1112), introduced by South Carolina Democrat Rep. Jim Clyburn, would remove the three-day provision under the federal firearms background check system that prevents the government from authorizing an open-ended wait of legal firearm purchases.

Every Federal Firearms Licensed (FFL) dealer must conduct background checks on potential buyers to see if transferring the firearm would violate state or federal law. Presently, when an FFL does a background check but does not receive a response from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System within three business days, the FFL can transfer the firearm.

However, the FBI will continue to investigate the situation related to the delay for 90 days and should they find that someone is prohibited from possessing firearms after the transfer, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is notified and charged with retrieving the firearm.

House Republicans slammed both pieces of legislation, saying that neither will end gun violence.

“H.R. 8 is taking the fears and the concerns of a nation over gun violence and perpetrating a fraud upon them. They’re playing on the very victims that they’re wanting to supposedly help by putting a bill out there that will not help them, by constantly bringing up the mass violence incidences such as at schools and theaters and others. They’re saying this will help,” House Judiciary ranking committee member Doug Collins told reporters Tuesday.

Collins continued, “The reality is nothing in this bill would have stopped Parkland; none of the thinking in this bill would have stopped any of the other violence that we have seen coming forward. The problem with this bill, and now they just exposed it to themselves, is the Obama administration’s Department of Justice said if you’re going to at least try universal background checks you have to have a registry.” (RELATED: Democrats Express Openness To Federal Gun Registry)

Thompson rejected Republican claims that Democrats want to form a firearms registry, saying, “Poppycock! The bill (HR 8) specifies that nothing in the bill can be used to create a registry.”

House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney, however, disagreed that a registry could not be created later regardless of what HR 8 says about restrictions on the creation of firearm registries.

“What these bills would do, frankly, is create a situation where the exchange of weapons, being able to lend your weapon, private firearms sales, would not be allowed. And then you would see this as a first step towards the creation of some sort of a federal gun registry even though the bill says they won’t be doing that,” she said. “We would see these bills if they were to pass and become law—a situation where they couldn’t be enforced, ultimately, without a federal gun registry.”

Thompson, though, remains adamant. He claimed, “I know the politics of it. I know they put out the buzzwords. I know they say, if you do this you need a national registry trying to frighten the American people. It’s just malarkey. It’s just not gonna to work. We’re not here to create a new registry. We’re here to create a great first line of defense to ensure that people who shouldn’t have guns don’t get access to guns.”

Collins doubted this reassurance from Democrats and pointed to a witness at the Judiciary Committee hearing debate on the background check bill.

“The Gabby Giffords Foundation who had a witness at our hearing just a couple of weeks ago. On their websites all over, it said ‘you got to have a registry otherwise you can’t do it,’” Collins said. “In fact, when asked about it they said, ‘That is what we would like to see.’ And asked how this would actually work in practice could not answer the question.”

While the two gun control bills are expected to pass the Democratic led-House majority, the passage of the bills or even consideration in the GOP Senate is unlikely.

Gun Test: Springfield Armory XD(M) 5.25″ 10mm,"By Jeff Johnston, American Hunter

As I write this I’m sitting in a tree during Oklahoma’s late archery season, waiting for a whitetail buck or a wild hog. Hanging from a hook on my left is my bow; on my right hip hangs a sidearm. Whether I’m bowhunting at home or in the grizzly country of Wyoming—or driving to the quick-stop for chicken strips later—the sidearm remains constant. This one is a 16-round Springfield Armory XD(M) semi-automatic pistol chambered in 10mm Auto. And it makes me feel good.

Previously I had to make a choice when I chose a sidearm to go with my bow or rifle. Either I could opt for something powerful enough to hunt with like a .41 Rem. Mag. or a .454 Casull, or I could choose a gun purely for self-defense like a Glock 19 or one of umpteen other concealable pistols on the market. Trouble is, .41s, .454s and the like are most commonly steel revolvers, and these guns only hold five or six rounds and weigh 3-4 pounds. Lugging one on my hip all day is about as much fun as measles. Conversely, popular polymer, self-defense semi-autos are great for carry but most come in 9mm, a round that is decent for home defense at 3 yards but one that sucks for big game.

Springfield, however, now offers the more potent 10mm Auto in a 33-ounce, 16-round (15-plus-1) handgun that is easy to carry, is not impossible to conceal and offers serious firepower. Before we get to the gun, let’s look at the ballistics of the 10mm cartridge.

The 10mm Auto delivers a 180-grain slug at 1275 fps for 650 ft.-lbs. of muzzle energy from the XD(M)’s 5.25-inch barrel. (The gun is also available with a 4.5-inch barrel.) Compare this to a 9mm that delivers a 124-grain bullet at 1150 fps for 364 ft.-lbs. of muzzle energy. A .45 ACP with a 230-grain bullet produces about 400 ft.-lbs. of energy. A .44 Rem. Mag? Around 1,000 with a 240-grain bullet.

To be clear, the 10mm, like most other semi-auto handgun rounds, is no magic pill; for hunting at moderate distances it is marginal at best. Nonetheless, if quality bullets are chosen, ranges are kept close—preferably 25 yards and in—and shot placement is ideal, the 10mm can be used to good effect. (Just don’t expect dramatic results like those from your .308 rifle.) In the event of a charging bear, I’d much rather have it over a 9mm, just as I prefer its capacity advantage over a heavy revolver. The 10mm offers a great balance between the two. So now let’s get to the gun.

In its 17th year of production (and 20th if you count the HS2000 pistol before it was licensed and renamed by Springfield), I’d be surprised if you aren’t familiar with the wildly popular XD series of striker-fired, polymer pistols. Made in Croatia for the American firm, the XD and newer XD(M) have proven to be accurate, concealable, affordable and supremely reliable. They offer several features that other polymer pistols do not, such as a slightly more acute grip angle, a grip safety, great metal sights and copious included accessories. They’re also reasonably priced. Over the years, the XD and XD(M) have been offered in dozens of sizes, barrel lengths and chamberings. The latest is the XD(M) version in 10mm.

Like all the XD(M) models, this 33-ounce handgun features interchangeable backstrap grip panels to fit three sizes of hands. Let me tell you, when shooting a 10mm in such a light gun, the proper grip size is important for recoil mitigation. The 10mm in the XD(M) is snappy but not painful. The small grip frame allows me to find and press the magazine-release button without changing my grip as I must on other guns like the competing Glock 40.

The XD(M) is one of the safest handguns on the market with its 1911-style grip safety and lever-type trigger safety. The lever integral to the trigger (Springfield calls it the Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System), as well as the grip safety, must be depressed in order to fire the gun. While I’m still not sure if both are completely necessary, on a hunting gun that will be in and around brush and dogs and trucks and buddies, the combination is not a bad idea. It does not interfere with function or reliability in any way.

It took 30 years for shooters to quit comparing the triggers of striker-fired pistols to the single-action triggers of 1911s; most shooters have now accepted triggers with built-in safety levers and agree they are just fine. The one in this XD(M), in fact, with a measured pull weight of 6.4 pounds, is better than most.

The XD(M) also has a loaded-chamber indicator at the rear of the chamber that’s lifted by a chambered round. It can be seen and felt, and it does not lie. An indicator that protrudes through the back of the slide lets you know when the striker is cocked.

Sights consist of an adjustable rear notch and a front blade. Although I feel like the front sight’s enclosed fiber-optic tube is a bit for show, the sights are still wonderful. The rear sight’s elevation and windage adjustments feature audible, positive-feeling click-stops as well as a metered viewing index that helps you get the perfect zero.

While the slide has a cutout near the muzzle to reduce weight and assure optimal cycling, the one complaint I have is the lack of a rear cutout for an optic. Mini reflex sights are proving to be superior sights for speed and precision shooting, and I feel Springfield dropped the ball here. After all, hunters wouldn’t have to install the optic if they didn’t want it. Not having the benefit of an optic was certainly reflected in my groups, as I just shoot better with one. With the irons from sandbags I averaged 3.75-inch groups at 25 yards. Reliability was 100 percent.

After carrying it to a treestand, hunting with it and carrying it concealed, the XD(M) became part of me. It fit nicely under my jacket so it didn’t clank around when I was sitting in my stand. I love the fact that Springfield provides three 15-round magazines and a nice hard-plastic travel case with each gun. For hunters, 16 rounds of 10mm hanging unobtrusively near the right hand is a confidence-inspiring tool indeed. Now, if only a hog would walk on by.

A measure requiring anyone open-carrying a firearm to produce a permit if asked by police

A move to regulate “ghost guns” or 3-D printed firearms and components

Judge Blocks Gun Ban In Chicago Suburb,"A Lake County, IL Circuit Court judge blocked the village of Deerfield from enforcing its ban on assault weapons, striking a legal blow to gun control efforts at the local level.

According to The Chicago Tribune, Judge Luis Berrones issued a permanent injunction against the Chicago suburb, writing that the plaintiff firearm owners have “a clearly ascertainable right to not be subjected to a preempted and unenforceable ordinance” that bans them from having these firearms, mandates monetary fines for possessing them and enables law enforcement to seize these firearms. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Calls For Gun Ban)

In April 2018, Deerfield trustees voted to ban the possession of specific semi-automatic guns like the AR-15 and AK-47, as well as magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.

The ban came in the wake of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and violations of the ban carried a fine between $250 and $1,000 per day, The Chicago Tribune reported.

Gun rights groups immediately filed a legal challenge to the ban, citing 2013 Illinois state legislature action that gave a 10-day window to local municipalities to ban assault weapons, prior the new concealed carry law, which Deerfield did not take advantage of at the time.

“We are very gratified with the judge’s ruling and we are glad the court recognized the ordinances were unenforceable,” David Sigale, a lawyer for one of the plaintiffs told Tribune.

As with most cases related to the Second Amendment, it appears another legal round is already brewing. Deerfield officials told The Tribune they are studying the ruling and figuring out their next steps with their legal team which includes an appeal to the Illinois Appellate Court.

“The NRA is proud to have supported this challenge to Deerfield’s ban on commonly owned firearms and magazines,” said Chris W. Cox, executive director of NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action. “This ruling affirms that every law-abiding Deerfield resident has the right to protect themselves, their homes, and their loved ones with the firearm that best suits their needs.”

The court found that Deerfield’s attempt to amend an existing firearm ordinance was a violation of state law. The ordinance would have allowed local authorities to confiscate and destroy semi-automatic rifles and standard capacity magazines possessed within village limits.

The challenge was originally filed in 2018 by the Illinois State Rifle Association, Second Amendment Foundation, and Daniel Easterday.

“This unprecedented interpretation of state legislative action and intent make this case ripe for appeal,” village officials said in a statement.

“The NRA is proud to have supported this challenge to Deerfield’s ban on commonly owned firearms and magazines,” said Chris W. Cox, executive director of NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action. “This ruling affirms that every law-abiding Deerfield resident has the right to protect themselves, their homes, and their loved ones with the firearm that best suits their needs.”

The court found that Deerfield’s attempt to amend an existing firearm ordinance was a violation of state law. The ordinance would have allowed local authorities to confiscate and destroy semi-automatic rifles and standard capacity magazines possessed within village limits.

A similar firearms ban on the same type of semi-automatic rifles went into effect last January in Boulder, Colorado and gun rights groups reacted similarly to those in Deerfield, Illinois.

NRA Seeks To Stop Pittsburgh Gun Ban As Lawsuits Head To Court,"The National Rifle Association filed a motion Wednesday to stop the city of Pittsburgh from enforcing a set of gun regulations including a ban on semi-automatic magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.

The NRA joined two other organizations also seeking a preliminary injunction against the city, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review is reporting, while court cases about the new gun laws are pending.

Three groups filed lawsuits against the city April 9, the same day that Mayor Bill Peduto signed three new gun-control bills into law, according to the Tribune. The bills restrict the use of AR-15s, ban ‘large capacity’ gun magazines and establish a ‘red flag’ system within the Pittsburgh city limits.

“Violent criminals will not abide by Pittsburgh’s ban on loading standard-capacity magazines,” said Chris W. Cox, executive director of NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action. “The only people who this irrational ordinance would disarm are law-abiding Pittsburgh residents.”

The actions were filed in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court on behalf of four citizens joined with the NRA, a group called Firearm Owners Against Crime, and The Allegheny Sportsman’s League.

The groups claim the new laws violate the Second Amendment, as well as Pennsylvania state law against municipalities enacting their own firearms regulations.

“The Pennsylvania courts have already ruled that local ordinances like this one violate Pennsylvania law,” said David Thompson, one of the plaintiff attorneys. “The merits of this case are clear, and Pittsburgh residents should be allowed to continue to exercise their rights under Pennsylvania law while this case works its way through the court system.”

The new laws were proposed after the Tree Of Life Synagogue shooting October 2018 that killed 11 people. The city council voted 6-3 in favor of the laws April 2. City residents who currently own guns or equipment subject to the new laws will be grandfathered.

The anti-gun lobbying organization, “Everytown for Gun Safety,” financed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, announced it is providing legal defense for the city of Pittsburgh at no charge. (RELATED: Everytown Ignoring Bloomberg’s Findings)

The NRA did not immediately return The DCNF’s request for comment.

Gun Test: S&W M&P .380 SHIELD EZ,"By Roy Huntington, American Handgunner, Photos By Rob Jones/The Imagesmith, LLC

The call went something like this: “Hey Roy, can you break free for a quick two-dayer to S&W for a new gun launch?” — it was Matt Spafford, their media liaison guru. “We’re announcing something very cool and want to make sure Handgunner’s there to cover it!”

“Um … uh …,” I said, doing my best editor impression. “Promise me it’s not a polymer frame 9mm and I’ll come.”

“Ha! I’ve got you on that, so now you have to come. Looking forward to seeing you soon, bye.”

For some reason I kept thinking I’d just been had by a professional. I also leaned on Mike Humphries, the executive editor here, figuring if I had to suffer through it, so would he. And just so we’re clear — I don’t mind polymer autos, and I even own some. I’m just always wishing and hoping gun companies would do something new with the concept. We’d see, wouldn’t we?

The Big Day

I normally don’t talk about the whole “visit the factory” thing as it’s just the vehicle to get info to us. But this time was different. Oh, the arrangements were standard, the “Harrumph-Harrumph” handshakes normal, even the meeting room had a PowerPoint waiting breathlessly to get our attention. But it’s what happened over the next couple of hours that stands out.

Oh, and here’s the part where I say what an idiot I am, by the way.

After the smiles and a few new products were shown, there was a sort of hush, then Jan Mladek, general manager of Smith & Wesson and M&P brands, held the PowerPoint remote button up, pointed it at the computer — there was a collective bit of breath-holding — and he mashed the button.

A black polymer-framed semi-auto appeared magically on the screen.

The breaths were held for a micro-second longer, then a long, sad-sounding sigh escaped about 15 writers and editors.

But we were all wrong. And some, like me, were more-wronger than others.

Jan expected this I think. He smiled broadly and announced, “The new M&P .380 SHIELD EZ.”

A .380? But it was big. This wasn’t like the Bodyguard at all, or the two dozen pocket .380s currently offered “out there.” It was like a regular Shield, sorta’ (but it had a funny bump on the back of the grip) and might have even been a bit longer. But it was in .380 — begging the question hanging in the air in the room:

“But why?”

There were mutterings, muffled coughs as throats were cleared — and no small amount of shoulder shrugging going on. Including me.

“Mike,” I said, speaking behind my hand, “am I being stupid or is this a silly idea for a new gun?”

“I sure don’t get it,” whispered Mike. But he may have just been being kind to me since I’m technically his boss. Or he honestly didn’t get it. Which turned out to be the case. Just like me.

Changing Minds

We moved to the range area at the S&W Academy and, while we shot our way through a good-natured mini-competition with a cross-section of new guns, we got to know the EZ. The more I shot it, the more I liked it — and the more I understood what was going on. After about 200 rounds I understood exactly why this was, dare I say it — a brilliant idea. On the range, Mike eased up next to me, lifting his muffs, saying, “I get it now. Do you?”

Ta-da. We all were getting it.

Re-insert the line about me being an idiot here. But that was before — now I was an advocate.

Ask any gun store sales guy what does he do when a “Uh, we’d like to look at a home defense gun but we don’t know anything about guns” customer comes in. He points them at everything from .22 Autos and 4″ .38 revolvers to standard sized 9mm polymer guns. Some even show them small-framed revolvers and tiny .380s — shame on them, by the way. Factor in older people — even experienced older shooters — the infirm, many women, younger shooters, etc. and you realize exactly none of those guns are “just right” for them.

If you’d ask me before what I’d recommend I’d have gone down that same list. The thought, the very “idea” of what S&W introduced, had never entered into my sieve-like brain. Why not a bigger .380 with an easy to run slide, modest recoil and adequate stopping power? There were a rare few in years passed, but ammo at the time wasn’t up to snuff, so we basically ignored them. And they lacked some modern features. Add a light rail, external safety and even a grip safety and you have a defensive auto any beginner could manage.

I realized I was holding an answer to all those challenges.

The Specifics

I’ve been living with this particular SHIELD .380 EZ for about four months at the time of writing. I’ve put around 550 to 600 rounds of all sorts of ammo through it. I almost hesitate to say this fearing you won’t believe me, but it’s honestly never bobbled, even once. And in retrospect, I don’t recall any of the sample guns at S&W glitching either.

That’s essentially unheard of in the world of the .380 and I’m thinking it has to do with the longer slide and “bigger” format. Feeding any auto is all about timing, and being able to run a long slide likely means a slightly slower slide velocity translating to an easier trip into the chamber. Ditto for extraction and ejection. It’s why most 5″ 1911s run more reliably than the shorty ones.

The mechanics are simple and contribute to the success of the concept. It’s got an 18-degree grip angle, like a 1911, and the trigger on my gun measures around the 5-lb. range and isn’t bad for a polymer gun. It even has an over-travel stop built into the trigger guard. It also has a top-pivot trigger and no center “safety” flipper thingy. It’s a nice, wide, solid trigger. At 6.6″ long, the EZ’s a bit longer than a standard Shield but would conceal as easily.

The grip safety pivots on the bottom (like an old 1903 Colt pocket auto) and regardless of how I gripped the gun — including riding the external safety with my thumb — the web of my hand always depressed the grip safety just fine. There’s a bit of a beavertail built into the frame and it really promotes a high grip, which is good. There’s also small ledges built right into the very rear of the slide to help you get a grip when you run the slide. A marvelously clever touch, especially for older, weaker or arthritic fingers.

The magazine has little nubs on either side of the follower allowing you to pull the follower down as you load. Again, it makes the chore much easier. Honestly, why don’t all autos have those?

The gun is actually hammer-fired and not a striker gun, so it’s technically single action. You can get it without the external thumb safeties but you do need the grip safety so don’t think about pinning it down. The grip safety on the EZ won’t allow the gun to fire unless it’s depressed and the trigger is pulled fully to the rear. The designers know best on this one.

The sights are white, 3-dot and the rear is adjustable for windage using a supplied tool. Interestingly, you get to it under the sight, in the roof of the slide. A small hex screw is loosened, sight adjusted, then tightened again. The EZ comes with two, 8-round magazines and both actually hold eight rounds. They’re well-constructed, have bright orange followers and are clearly marked for round count. All of this goes toward the “keep it simple” concept.

But Wait, There’s More

That slide really is easy to run and it surprises me every time. There’s also a loaded chamber indicator you can feel as well as see. The grip texture is like a Shield’s but seems more modest in texture. I really like it, and it felt like very fine, slightly worn sandpaper.

The magazine release is reversible, but not ambi, so you can put it on the side you favor. Disassembly is easy too, and you don’t need to pull the trigger to get it started. Lock the slide back, rotate the take-down lever and the slide/barrel comes right off forward. Easy. Or is that EZ?

There’s the normal light rail, and I found mine fits all sorts of lights I had on-hand, so it won’t be an issue finding one fitting your budget easily. I actually recommended S&W offer a sort of “Home Defense Kit” to include a simple light. We’ll see.

The stainless slide and 3.67″ barrel are coated with something S&W calls Armornite — a “keep it from getting rusty” coating. Between that and the polymer frame, there’s no need to worry about the daily grind of concealed carry here. Toward this end, my sample gun weighs 18.2 oz. on my postal scale, with an empty magazine inserted. It’s light but not so feathery you can’t feel it in your hand. It’d be very easy to carry every day, and is a great nightstand gun for home defense for we “average” mortals with some time under our belts.

Shooting Surprises

Just before I wrote this I sat down to do some serious targeting. In previous months I’d kept the EZ on my desk and now and again I’d take it outside and bang away at a couple of plates I keep handy just to get rounds through it. I had fired it off-hand at targets and found it always seemed to hit a bit high and to the left, although it always ran fine regardless of the load. Careful targeting at 25 yards showed it does indeed shoot a bit high and to the left, but close enough “for government work” as my dad used to say. It’ll be easy to tweak the rear for windage once I settle on a load I like best.

The thing surprising me was how accurate the EZ actually is. It particularly liked Black Hills 60-gr. HoneyBadger (a solid copper, fluted load) and the SIG 90-gr. V-Crown load. The HoneyBadger averaged about 1,210 fps over my chrono while the SIG delivered around the 935 fps mark. The HoneyBadger’s best group (eight rounds) was about 2.25″ but if you take out the worse two, that group becomes 1.25″ which is likely what it’d do in a mechanical rest. The SIG load delivered about 3″ but included one I pulled. Take that out and we suddenly get a more realistic 1.5″.

This is stunning accuracy for a .380, and frankly top-tier accuracy for any production semi-auto in any form. And I did notice it was sheer pleasure to shoot the EZ and not be beat-up by recoil. It allows the shooter to really concentrate on trigger press. I think I’ve found my new “teaching” gun.

An interesting side note is the fact virtually all of the brass from my last shoot landed about six feet to my right, just forward of the gun, in a pattern about four feet wide. It looked like I had swept the brass into a loose pile. Amazingly consistent ejection, from both loads.

Final Thoughts?

Easy, actually. Holsters fitting the SHIELD series mostly fit the EZ if they’re open-bottomed, but there are also dedicated rigs for the EZ too. It’s light, highly functional, has adequate stopping power with modern ammo (no +P though, please), can handle a rail light and fits a wide section of hand sizes, including my own smallish hand. Since the parent M&P design has been around since 2006, the basics are proven in the field. No doubt companies like Apex Tactical will be introducing fancy triggers and such for the EZ in no time.

What would I change? Not a darn thing. I honestly couldn’t think of a single “bad” thing. At an MSRP of $399, this is a “buy it and put it to work right now” gun. Since it’s so accurate, I truthfully wish I had an adjustable sight on mine so I could dial it right in if I wanted to. Squirrel hunting with a .380 might be fun.

If I described you here, then you’re also looking at what just might be an answer to your dilemma. And — this is the best answer I’ve seen.

Queen Elizabeth Learned To Shoot At 14 With Churchill’s Tommy Gun,"Queen Elizabeth learned to shoot as a princess with Winston Churchill’s Tommy Gun, loaned to the royal family as they prepared for the Nazi invasion, a documentary revealed Sunday.

The show told the little-known story of how Elizabeth, 14 at the time, and her younger sister Margaret, 10, were taught to shoot in Buckingham Palace gardens in London as the royal family awaited invading German paratroopers during WWII, according to the Daily Mail’s review.

The story, as told by Professor Richard Aldrich from the University of Warwick, was that when George VI refused MI6’s request to evacuate the family to Canada, he said, “I want to get my German. I want to at least kill one of the invaders and we will all fight to the last.”

“Well, really you need to able to kill more than one German,” former Prime Minister Winston Churchill reportedly responded, and then sent over his Tommy Gun for protection.

The entire royal family learned to use the weapon, according to the documentary.

The Queen mother reportedly used rats found inside Buckingham Palace for target practice. (RELATED: Prince Harry To Skip Royal Pheasant Shoot Because of Meghan Markle)

“Queen Elizabeth did learn how to shoot a pistol in the gardens of Buckingham Palace,” Queen Elizabeth‘s cousin Margaret Rhodes told the BBC.

“I suppose quite rightly, she thought if parachutists came down and whisked them away somewhere, she could at least take a parachutist or two with her,” she added.

The documentary, which aired Sunday in the U.K. and isn’t available for viewing yet in the United States, also details King George VI’s active involvement in planning for the D-Day Landings, code-named “Operation Overlord,” which observes its 75th anniversary in 2019.

Gun Test: Remington 870 Tactical DM,"By Brent Wheat, GUNS Magazine – Photos By Robert Jones, The Imagesmith LLC

“BANG! Ouch! BANG! Wow-owwww! BANG! Jeez oh Pete …” This real-life quote from the shooting range highlights my recent willful violation of the first rule of gun writing: never volunteer to review tactical or deer hunting shotguns because 12-gauge slugs in quantity will hurt you — they hurt a lot.

But, as the new guy at GUNS, it was my duty to show, rather than tell, I can cut the proverbial mustard. Armed and on a mission, I figuratively hitched up my foundation garments and went to the shooting range to prove I’m a worthy Alpha Male among the other expert he-men writers here at America’s Greatest Gun Magazine. There I am, Boy Paladin, leading the thundering herd whilst slaying the grammar dragons with the stroke of a pen.

Unfortunately there wasn’t much bravado in evidence when I got home after putting the Remington 870 DM Hardwood shotgun through its paces. My whining about a sore shoulder, aching cheek and possibly dislocated snot-locker had my wife rolling her eyes clean out of her head. They landed on the floor and came to rest among the dust bunnies under the curio cabinet. “Well, Hotshot, what did you learn?” she said with sarcasm, stunning a passing housefly.

What I discovered is the Remington 870 DM combines the proven functional reliability of a classic scattergun platform with the speed-loading abilities of a magazine-fed gun. Is this important to you? Read on and you’ll understand why the term Your Mileage May Vary applies to this particular hotrod of a shotgun.

I know it’s completely “old school” and therefore not cool, but I dearly love shotguns for home defense and room clearing. Back in my former life as a street cop, I was the last guy to give up my 10″ Remington 870 when they started issuing patrol rifles. I’d never argue against the effectiveness of a carbine but I’ve seen what an ounce of .72 caliber lead does to flesh at bad-breath distances and it’s hard to argue you could do more damage with anything short of a crew-served weapon.

Yet, for all the positives of a pump shotgun as a defensive arm, one of the primary kicks against the gun is the supposed “slow” loading of a tube magazine. It’s hard to argue the act of stuffing one round at a time into the action is anything but plodding compared to slapping a box magazine into the bottom of the gun. This fact is why the Remington 870 DM exists.

New Or Old?

At this point in the playbook we’re supposed to sing the praises of a hot new gun, but in this case we’re talking about a platform surviving essentially unchanged for 60-plus years. The 870 traces its lineage to the turn of the 20th century when its grandpappy, the Browning-designed Model 17, was first sold in 1915. The 20-gauge-only bottom-ejecting M17 worked well and set the stage for the side-ejecting Model 31. The multi-gauge M31 was successful but lagged behind the Winchester Model 12 in sales and was also expensive to produce. The engineering team at Remington then took the M31 design elements and set out to produce a modern, reliable but less costly shotgun. The 870 was thus born in 1950.

The rugged, simple action of the 870 was popular with hunters but cops eventually made it “the” police shotgun in our country. While the Mossberg 500 was also widely used the 870 was truly — okay, I’ll say it, ubiquitous — with cops ranging from G-men to the local PD until the patrol rifle “craze” took hold. During the 870’s heyday, police officers of my own youthful age (feel free to insert your own eye roll here) were drilled on the manual of arms for the gun until our fingers were numb and we could perform a “select slug” drill in the dark, in the rain and with sadistic instructors screaming at you until your eardrums bled.

It’s possible to mess up with a pump shotgun, particularly if you get excited and “short-stroke” it, but with practice it’s nearly as bullet-proof as an anvil. More literally, it’s as reliable as any multi-shot system in existence. Even today I’m still most comfortable with an 870 in my hands when it comes to finger-trembling, gut-clenching circumstances. Fortunately, it doesn’t happen very often anymore but the emergency gun resting quietly beneath my side of the bed is still a fully-kitted 870.

Such familiarity is why very little education was necessary with 870 DM. The six-round magazines did inspire a little bit of fumbling at first but handling the big plastic ammo carriers becomes far more natural after a few loading cycles. The only malfunctions experienced were shooter-induced when I had the dreaded “Dammit!” of a magazine dropping free after firing one or two rounds. Though I believed my push-pull on the magazine had firmly locked it into the well, the friction generated by a large surface area impeded seating a little bit and gave a false sense of security. Recoil quickly pointed out the error of my ways.

Drop And Give Me 20

At least nobody was watching so I didn’t have to “push on the ground” to “ensure learning had occurred.” This highlights our only major concern about this gun. The magazine will fight you a little bit so make sure — then make sure again — the magazine is truly seated. I also have concerns the sheet-steel lips on the top of the magazine might suffer a reliability-harming bend if dropped on concrete. I didn’t want to test this particular theory on a gun I don’t own but my friends at Gunsite Academy, having much more experience with the 870 DM, said they haven’t seen this particular problem.

The magazine well is formed by an adapter strapped to the bottom of a standard 870 using the forward trigger plate pin and a new pin at the rear of where the existing tube magazine joins the receiver. This adapter includes a pair of rails covering the tube inlet hole, helping guide the shells toward the chamber. The magazine tube itself contains nothing except air and only serves as the running guide for the fore end. One personal, highly-subjective preference is the magazine release is mounted forward of the magazine well instead of the rear, where my brain thinks it belongs. On the other hand I’m sure just as many folks wouldn’t like it there, either.

One legitimate concern is the “select-slug” drill is challenging and nearly impractical on the 870 DM. In case you aren’t familiar, this technique is for those moments when your buckshot-stuffed scattergun now needs a slug to reach out and touch the target. With a regular 870 you simply lock the slide to the rear, roll a slug into the open loading port and ram it home with the fore end. In the 870 DM, you can manage the same drill but you must invert the gun first. Under stress, the move is clumsy and keeps the gun out of action for a longer period of time. The manipulation can be done with practice but realize beforehand a magazine change is far quicker.

The other factors of the gun — feeding reliability, workmanship, materials, ease of use, patterning — were pretty much standard for a traditional 870. Aside from the different distribution of weight and the slight awkwardness of the protruding magazine, the whole range experience was comfortable and, frankly, dull. There were no surprises, not much adaptation and little fumbling — but those are all positive things when you’re talking about a firearm whose primary purpose is to keep your own tender epidermis wholly intact.

Ultimately, the scattergun works just like it always does, aside from the addition of a magazine. But — and it’s a big but — we must ask: does adding a magazine on a proven top-shelf pump shotgun solve a latent problem?

Speed Loading For Social Security

If you have designated the pump as your street-sweeper of choice for lethal social entanglements and you’re worried about the speed of reloading during the heat of battle, the 870 DM will solve your problem. On the other hand, to many of us who have carried a scattergun into sketchy civilian circumstances, the whole ammo-capacity/reload question seems more like something for internet commandos to endlessly debate from their mom’s basement. But, as I said in the beginning, Your mileage may vary and such debates are what make messing around with guns so fascinating in the first place! Truth be told, if this was your “first” defensive shotgun and you had no experience with the old platform, all of what I said is pretty much moot. You’ll run it fine, without crashing into long-engrained muscle memory glitches.

The Remington 870 DM is built on a proven, reliable chassis and it’s now faster to reload thanks to the box-magazine modification. If this particular facet of operation is important to your own unique situation, I highly recommend checking out this old-but-new pump!

I just don’t recommend firing several boxes of slugs from it in one sitting!

Gun Test: TriStar Viper G2 Bronze .410 Shotgun,"TriStar has a long history with Turkish gunmakers and imports an excellent line of moderately priced shotguns that, most importantly, work well. Among the company’s premier lines, the Viper G2 Bronze is now being offered in .410 bore, and an example of TriStar’s newest sub-gauge is the subject of this review.

From muzzle to butt, the Turkish-made G2 is a very attractive shotgun with its highly polished, deep-blued barrel, glossy Turkish walnut stock and fore-end (with just a hint of figure in the wood), and bronze-finished Cerakote receiver. The butt has a soft, sporting-clay-style pad with a hard-plastic insert at the top to facilitate a smooth mount. Both the stock and fore-end have 20-l.p.i., sharp-pointed checkering that ensures a solid grip under any conditions. Stock dimensions are made for American shooters, with a length of pull of 14 3⁄8“, drop at comb of 1½” and drop at the heel of 2¼”. There is a hint of cast off at 1/4″. We found the combination to be highly satisfactory when shooting low-gun skeet targets. If the stock doesn’t fit straight from the box, the G2 comes with a set of shims that are easily changed to adjust the drop and cast for both right- and left-handed shooters.

Between its weather-resistant Cerakote-finished receiver and its Turkish walnut fore-end and buttstock, the TriStar Viper G2 Bronze .410 is a very handsome shotgun.



The cross-bolt safety is located behind a large trigger guard that would easily accommodate a gloved hand in cold weather. The trigger, although a bit on the heavy side with an average pull of 8 lbs., 8 ozs., is very crisp with absolutely no preliminary take-up, and it breaks as cleanly as on a fine double.

Moving forward, the bronze Cerakote-finished receiver will resist snow, rain and other corrosive elements, and the action is closed by means of a raised button on the right side of the receiver. It takes a bit of a push to close the action, but from a safety point of view that’s not all bad. The ejection port is large enough for fumble-free insertion of a shell, and the magazine port on the bottom of the action is wide enough to comfortably allow an adult-size thumb to push shells into the five-round tubular magazine.

The .410-bore version of the TriStar Viper G2 Bronze ships with three screw-in choke tubes that use Beretta Mobil Choke-style threads. The three-notch choke (shown)that came installed with the gun measured 0.016″ against the cylinder 0.410″ bore.

The deeply blued 28″ barrel is sufficiently long to encourage a smooth swing on moving targets. For ease of cleaning, durability and corrosion-resistance, the chamber and barrel interiors are chrome-plated. Topped with a 5 mm-wide ventilated rib that mates precisely with the matting atop the receiver, the sighting plane ends with a red fiber-optic front sight. The bore measured a precise 0.410″ and is topped with screw-in choke tubes that use Beretta Mobil Choke threads that facilitate the purchase of aftermarket tubes. The Viper came with a tube installed that was marked with three notches and measured 0.016″ against the cylinder 0.410″ bore. The other two tubes were a four-notched tube measuring 0.014″ and a third tube with one notch into which our digital bore micrometer would not fit. We used the installed 0.016″ tube in pattern testing and shooting, as there was so little difference between it and the four-notch tube.

We did find that with the G2’s excellent stocking, good balance and handling, our score on clays was quite good. It handled the lighter shells without a hitch, and the 3″ loads we shot cycled equally well. Patterns at 25 yds. showed high center density with Winchester 2½” Super X field loads that contained 115 No. 6 pellets at an average velocity of 1277 f.p.s. measured 4 ft. from the muzzle. Great Canadian skeet champion, B.C. “Barney” Hartman, once said his .410-bore pattern was about the size of a pie plate so, “I either hit them, or I miss them.”

If you’re looking for a fun shotgun for casual shooting, the .410-chambered TriStar Viper G2 semi-automatic is a good choice, just don’t forget that the .410 bore, with its small shot charge, is an expert’s shotgun. With its light recoil, the .410 is often thought of as a beginner’s first shotgun, but since early success spurs interest, new shooters are generally better off starting with either a 20 or 28 gauge.

At $794, the TriStar Viper G2 Bronze .410 isn’t inexpensive, but it’s a lot of shotgun for the money. In the hands of a seasoned shot, it would work well in the dove field—if shooting ranges are kept in check—for quail over dogs, cottontail rabbits and fun with clays.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2019/05/24/gun-test-tristar-viper-g2-bronze-410-shotgun/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjXv_ib_7P9AhXkFlkFHUDaBH04PBAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw1Kr21IjgEAm-4Il56TEKnu,2019-05-24
Gun Control Advocates Take Easy Way Out,"By Larry Keane

In a recent op-ed in Time Magazine, two of the top gun control activists in the U.S. Congress continued their tired drumbeat for laws that would have no impact on the safety of our communities. U.S. Senators Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Dianne Feinstein of California, both Democrats, once again took the easy path toward their long-standing anti-gun rhetoric. Instead of basing their arguments on evidence and facts, they take the emotional-low road.

Punish The Law-Abiding

Anyone reading their piece (assuming anyone does read op-eds in Time), would read the list of tragic shooting incidents that have happened over the past decades, and feel the pull of their emotions. Anger, frustration, sadness… no one wants these to occur. But then these elected officials pivot from tragedy to call for new laws. What they fail to do is to show that the laws would have prevented any of these tragedies. Why is that? Why do these senators with multiple offices full of staffers dedicated to conducting exactly this kind of research fail to make this connection between emotion and proposals? Well, the evidence simply does not exist. Law-abiding citizens qualified to own firearms follow the laws. Criminals and those mentally ill who seek to harm others do not. Enacting more laws will not change that.

Selling False Promises

Just last week we pointed out the flaws with their calls for a federal universal background check bill. But Sens. Feinstein and Murphy don’t stop there. They also want to ban modern sporting rifles and limit the capacity of magazines, following New Zealand’s example. What they don’t mention is that out of the estimated 1.2 million guns in New Zealand, a whopping 37 have been surrendered since the ban was enacted. This is likely because gun owners know that they are not the problem, and criminals do not abide by the law.

The ignorance of these senators goes further. According to the op-ed, “Guns like the AR-15 aren’t used for hunting and they’re not viable for home protection.” Again, false. Modern sporting rifles, including those on the AR platform, are among the most popular firearms being sold today. They are widely used for everything from sport shooting, to hunting, to home defense.

The firearms and ammunition industry shares the concern about the criminal misuse of firearms. That’s why we voluntarily run programs that target the real sources of crime and unauthorized access to firearms. They may not be as well covered in the media as the emotionally popular soundbites, but these programs are working to help make our communities safer.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2019/06/20/gun-control-advocates-take-easy-way-out/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwih08ya_7P9AhXDElkFHeBDDk44KBAWegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw31WidzxrGobT5xeD6ClGB9,2019-06-20
"Next Round Of New Zealand Gun Control Says Owning A Gun Is A Privilege, Not A Right","New Zealand plans to ban gun purchases from foreign visitors, establish a national gun registry and tighten gun licensing rules, according to a law proposed Monday.

The measures represent the second phase of gun control restrictions in response to the March Christchurch mosque shootings, the first being the ban of “military-style” firearms that was enacted just days after the shootings, The Associated Press reported. The shooting caused 51 fatalities. (RELATED: New Zealand Mosque Shootings Take At Least 49 Lives)

“We’re a society that I think has always drawn that very clear distinction,” said Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealanders’ practical needs versus their right to own a gun.

“I don’t think that extends to this view that every New Zealand citizen has the need and right to generally arm itself,” she added.

The law proposed would outlaw the sale of gun to overseas visitors, require gun licenses to be renewed every five years, create a national gun registry, and allow police to consider mental health factors when granting gun licenses.

Immediately after the shooting, New Zealand passed a ban on “military-style” weapons in April and instituted a buy-back program to reimburse people for turning in the newly banned weapons during the amnesty period, which lasts until Dec. 20.

About 3,200 weapons have been collected since the program officially began, according to the AP.

“The terror attack on March 15 highlighted the flaws in our licensing system,” Ardern said, adding that she hopes the next phase of gun reforms help frame gun ownership as a privilege, according to Reuters.

“The changes announced today have been decades in the making. It is now up to this parliament to deliver in the interests of public and personal safety,” she added.

The New Zealand government is looking to pass the proposed law by the end of 2019.

Gun Test: FAIR Iside Shotgun,"Isidoro Rizzini established Fabbrica Armi Isidoro Rizzini (FAIR) in Brescia, Italy, back in 1971, and today the maker offers a full line of over-under and side-by-side shotguns. The subject of this review, a 28-ga. Iside, is a fine example of the firm’s work that offers a lot of gun for the money.

The Iside is a side-by-side double-barrel shotgun of boxlock construction with an automatic safety. Each time the top lever is moved to the open position the tang-mounted sliding safety is applied. Should you prefer a manually applied safety, a good, qualified gunsmith can disable the automatic feature of the safety to render it manual or it can be ordered that way from the company.

The straight (English-style) buttstock and fore-end are of nicely figured European walnut. Checkering on the stock is a basket-weave design that is laser-cut. For some hands it may be a bit too finely spaced to afford a firm grip in wet and cold conditions, but it is attractive to the eye. The splinter-style fore-end’s checkering is also fine, with the basket-weave pattern present, but it seems to be a bit coarser there, affording a more positive grip. The butt is finished with a hard plastic plate.

The scaled action of the 28 gauge is chemically case colored rather than casehardened, but the colors are nice, and it is difficult to tell the difference with the naked eye. The back of the receiver is scalloped, with the wood only slightly proud of the metal. The barrels are highly polished and deeply blued, to the point of being nearly black, as are the trigger guard, top lever, triggers and fore-end iron.

As tradition would have it, the test gun has double triggers. Double-gun shooters pretty much agree that barrel selectors are not fast enough to use at the flush of a pheasant or a covey of bobwhites—they pretty much set it and forget it. The beauty of a double-trigger gun is the instant selection of choke; pull the front trigger and the right barrel fires, pull the rear trigger and the left barrel fires.

Thoughtfully, FAIR has manufactured the Iside to be compatible with interchangeable choke tubes, making the true application of double triggers a reality, and three (cylinder, improved cylinder and modified) ship with the gun. Measured with our Lyman Digital Trigger-Pull Gauge, the trigger pulls were very light, with the front trigger averaging 2 lbs., 14 ozs., and the rear measuring 2 lbs., 3 ozs. The 28-ga. version of the shotgun weighs just shy of 5 lbs., and those trigger pulls are commensurately light to go with the gun’s overall weight.

A double-trigger gun (ctr.)—with the front trigger firing the right barrel and the rear trigger firing the left—the Iside also has an Anson & Deeley-style rod (r.) for removal of the splinter-style fore-end and an automatic tang-mounted safety (l.). –

The 27 7⁄8” barrels, chambered to accept 3″ shells, are bored with FAIR’s X-Cones—lengthened forcing cones that provide more even and uniform patterns. Both barrels measured 0.553″ in diameter at a point 9″ from the mouth of the chamber. The rib is a typical game-style rib made of a composite material that contributes to the lightness of the gun. The barrels pivot using a traditional hook and hinge pin, and are locked into battery with a double Purdey-style underbolt.

The Iside is equipped with extractors that lift the shells from the mouth of the chamber for easy removal but do not eject them from the gun; for those who reload or do not wish to leave a trail of fired hulls across the landscape, it’s an ideal setup. We did find the automatic safety a bit stiff to move, especially for a young shooter—perhaps a bit of lubrication would help it along. The fore-end detaches with an Anson & Deeley-style rod that makes removal easy. When reassembling, it is necessary to hold the top lever over, as it does not automatically stay open except with the barrels mounted.

The 28 gauge is pretty much an ideal chambering for a beginner, as it throws enough shot to down a bird, rabbit, squirrel or clay target, yet has light recoil. For the older hunter, it’s just an excellent gauge that is appropriate for any game-farm bird—wild quail, partridge and even pheasants if the shots are not too long. In pattern testing, using Winchester Super X 1-oz. No. 7½ loads, on average, the improved cylinder tube provided 44 percent patterns and the modified choke produced 45 percent patterns. The difference between the two was that the modified choke patterns were slightly more center-dense. The average velocity across our Oehler chronograph was 1101 f.p.s. four feet from the muzzle.



In shooting the FAIR Iside, we took it first to the 16-yd. patterning plate and it shot dead-on. If you prefer to “float” the bird above the barrel, the addition of a comb-raising pad might be in order. We found the Iside to be user-friendly when shooting clays, although the barrels initially pivot quite stiffly upon opening. We ascribe this to the cocking stub of the barrels pushing the hammers back onto their sears for the next shots. The bar of the 28-ga. scaled action is fairly short, so the leverage exerted feels heavier.

All in all, it’s a very nice side-by-side made on a properly sized action that ought to provide a great deal of satisfaction in the field.

Gun Test: Dan Wesson Wraith 10mm,"By Jeff Johnston, American Hunter

I hate talking about morbid life experiences unless it might help someone avoid them. When I was about 15 years old I had to put down a disease-stricken cow. For some reason—probably because of Hollywood movies of the time—I chose a 9mm handgun. To make a horrible, drawn-out story short, the task ended with an empty 9mm magazine and me running to get my .30-30 Winchester that I should have chosen in the first place. I learned that the 9mm simply did not have the energy to penetrate adequately enough to kill quickly. Poor cow.

Over the years, I’ve shot plenty of game—mainly hogs—with handguns, and I’ve learned that if game animals weighing over about 150 pounds are not hit perfectly behind the shoulder in the lungs, they often require following up or go unrecovered. So now I always use enough gun. In my opinion, a 10mm is the minimum caliber for hunting or serious protection in bear country—and only if it’s loaded with premium, controlled-expansion bullets and shots are close. Dan Wesson’s Wraith is a supremely made 1911-pattern pistol chambered in 10mm Auto. I recently had the opportunity to evaluate it. What follows is my review.

Brief Company History

Dan Wesson Firearms was founded by Daniel Wesson who worked at Smith & Wesson from 1938 until 1963. When S&W sold, Dan set out on his own and incorporated Dan Wesson Arms in 1968. Ultimately, the spinoff firm went bankrupt before re-emerging as Dan Wesson Firearms in 1990—only to go bankrupt again due to poor sales. Its assets were purchased in 1995 and the company produced guns from its new Norwich, NY, facility. In 2005, CZ-USA of Kansas City, Kan., bought the firm, although production of its guns remained in Norwich, as they do today. Regardless of its turbulent past, one thing remains: Dan Wesson Firearms has always produced high-quality guns, and still does. The Wraith is one of its finest examples.

The Wraith 10mm

It has been said that the 1911 is the handgun upon which all other handguns should be judged, and the Wraith is right up there among the best factory 1911s made today. Make no mistake, Dan Wesson set out to make a premium-quality handgun in this model, and it spared few costs in doing so. The result is a custom-feeling 1911 that’s as good-looking, reliable, accurate and shooter-friendly as any out there—with a price tag to match. The gun is also chambered in 9mm and .45 ACP, but I strongly recommend the 10mm version for the following reasons:

In average loads, a 10mm fires a 180-grain bullet at roughly 1100 fps to produce around 500 ft.-lbs. of energy at the muzzle. Compare this to 350 ft.-lbs. of the 9mm and the 375 ft.-lbs. of the .45 ACP. But with hot loads like those from Cor-Bon, Buffalo Bore and others, you can eke more than 700 ft.-lbs. of energy from it. Of course, you can get 1100 ME or better from a hot .44 Rem. Mag., but the problem is, most .44 Mags are huge, bulky revolvers with only 5 to 6 shots, and I prefer a semi-auto for all but dedicated handgun hunting.

The Wraith 10mm features a 5.75-inch stainless steel barrel that’s threaded for a suppressor and comes capped by a thread protector. I love suppressed handguns because they save my ears, therefore I appreciate this feature.

The slide is forged from stainless steel bar stock and features a Clark-style, grooved rib along the sight plane that’s touted to reduce glare when aiming. I think it helps. Anticipating the use of a suppressor, the Wraith comes standard with steel AmeriGlo night sights that each contain a single Tritium capsule. The fixed, tall sights allow target acquisition even with a suppressor installed. The entire slide—like the entire frame—is colored in the company’s matte-gray “Distressed Duty” finish that reduces glare and looks superb to my eye.

The frame features a 1911-style side-mounted thumb safety, a beavertail grip safety and excellent 25 LPI machined checkering on the front strap and mainspring housing. This precision checkering really makes the gun feel solid in the hand, as does the uniquely cut, jagged grip pattern of the G10 grip scales. Overall, the grip and purchase of this 1911 is as good as any I’ve ever held. It absolutely helps in terms of accuracy and recoil mitigation.

The mag well is oversized and flared for quick indexing and intuitive reloading of the 8-round, singe-stack magazine. Finally, its single-action trigger breaks at 4 pounds, 5 ounces and is as crisp as a cracker with negligible creep. It is excellent and no doubt contributes to the gun’s stellar accuracy.

Field Testing

Like most premium 1911 handguns, the Wraith is easy to shoot well, thanks to its tacky grip, overall weight, relatively long sight plane and premium match-grade barrel. Even with hot 10mm Auto loads, recoil was absorbed nicely and allowed quick and accurate follow ups. At long range, however, the gun really shined. I consistently hit a paper-plate target at 35 yards from a combat stance without a rest. With a rest, keeping shots on the plate at 50 yards was not a problem. Make no mistake, however, this 2.6-pound handgun is not one you’re going to tuck away under a t-shirt and conceal. It is to be worn in a holster on the outside of the waist with a sturdy belt—but its size is also what makes it a pleasure to shoot and shoot well.

During the course of testing—even during the first couple 100-round break-in period wherein jams are most common among all guns—I experienced only one malfunction, a stovepipe that was quickly fixed. Its tolerances are very tight, yet it handled all the ammo I fed it.

As for negatives, there are only two and they pertain to the sights. While the tall AmeriGlo sights are robust, excellent and worked well for me, I don’t like the fact that they’re fixed. Hunting handguns, in my opinion, should have an adjustable rear sight so various loads and zero ranges can be optimized. However, the company could have avoided this—and the issue with having to make them tall for use with a suppressor—if it would have machined a cutout in the slide for the installation of a mini red-dot optic. I believe that optics are superior for aiming at ranges greater than combat distances. Plus, the extra bulk gained by an optic wouldn’t matter because, as I stated, this gun was never intended for concealed carry. However, there are aftermarket mounting options available if I’m dead-set on a red dot.

All in all, I was most impressed by every other facet of this Dan Wesson firearm—especially its accuracy and reliability. It’s not only a gun for the field, but one I’d be proud to show off to friends after dinner. No doubt, lovers of 1911s will appreciate the Wraith in 10mm Auto.

Gun Test: EAA MC312 Shotgun,"Benelli’s patent on the inertia operating system has run its course, and we are now seeing near clones of the Super Black Eagle on the market from a number of shotgun makers, including the Turkish-made Girsan MC312 reviewed here. Imported by the European American Armory Corp., this 12-ga. scattergun offers inertial operation at a fraction of the cost of its Italian forebear.

The inertia system is nothing new, as it was first developed by and used in Danish gunsmith Christer Sjörgren’s Normal shotgun in 1903, the same year John M. Browning’s Automatic 5 hit the market. In function it’s a highly simple system with very few parts. When the gun is fired it begins to move rearward; within the bolt is a strong spring that holds the rotating bolt head firmly in battery with the locking cuts at the barrel’s breech. By the time the spring’s tension is overcome, the ejecta (shot and wad) have exited the muzzle, and the bolt begins moving rearward, driven by the remaining recoil.

The bolt then extracts the fired shell, which is kicked out by the ejector nub, and if a fresh shell is present in the magazine, it triggers the bolt release reloading the gun. The bolt locks open when the last shell is fired. When empty, the two-piece carrier necessitates the tripping of the carrier latch, located on the right side of the forward portion of the trigger guard, allowing the bolt to be locked open.

Thanks to the simplicity of the interia-driven action, the MC312 is very easy to disassemble and clean. For sights, the shotgun uses a serrated, ventilated rib with a red fiber-optic pipe (l.). –

This style of action is very easy to clean, as there are few parts, and the MC312’s owner’s manual includes exploded drawings to provide sufficient guidance in the disassembly of the gun. With the barrel removed, the handle is pulled away from the bolt, allowing it to then slide out of the receiver. At the rear of the bolt is a cross pin that is drifted out while the firing pin is held in its forward position, and is then released slowly—as the tension provided by the spring can propel the firing pin across the room if you’re not careful. Following removal of the firing pin and spring, the bolt index pin is removed and the bolt head slides out. Clean it, lightly lube it and re-assemble in reverse order.

Employing an inertia-driven operating system, EAA’s MC312 is one of the least expensive shotguns of its type on the market. –

Drifting out a one-way pin releases the trigger group. The guard is of a composite material with metal working parts. The cross-bolt-style, trigger-block safety is located in the guard immediately behind the trigger. Of real interest is that the trigger of the test gun was amazingly crisp, breaking cleanly at an average of 5 lbs., 3 ozs., as measured with a Lyman Digital Trigger Pull Gauge, with absolutely no preliminary take-up.

The polymer stock and fore-end have molded checkering, and that on the fore-end is sufficiently coarse to enable a good grip—less so on the semi-pistol-grip stock. Also molded into the buttstock is a sling swivel that mates with another on the magazine cap for hands-free carrying. The ventilated rib mounts a luminescent bar-style front sight. Our test sample was the black model, however, a camouflaged version is also offered by EAA.

We took the MC312 to the range and first shot it at the 16-yd. fitting plate. We found this gun shot about 3″ high and 3″ to the left, indicating a correction of 3/16ths more cast off and perhaps an 1/8″ more drop. This gun does not include stock-adjusting shims, but add-on stock pads can be used to change the point of impact. We then shot patterns using Rio 1¼-oz. No. 6 lead game loads, a popular pheasant and rabbit shell. The MC312 comes with five choke tubes marked with both names and stars that also match notches at the muzzle for quick recognition. We measured them against the cylinder bore (0.724″) with a digital bore micro-meter: cylinder, 0.004″; improved cylinder, 0.011”; modified, 0.022″; improved modified, 0.031″; and full, 0.038″—all very close to standard specifications.

For pattern testing we used the modified tube, as it would best match hunting conditions. The patterns were quite uniform with center density. One could expect good results hunting with this combination. We also shot some clay targets, and compensating slightly for the higher pattern placement, scored very well. Although this is a 3½”-chambered semi-automatic, it bears mention that it functioned very well shooting clays with 2¾”, 7/8-oz. No. 8 Rio light target loads.

Capable of chambering 2 3/4″, 3″ and 3 1/2″ shells (above, r.), the MC312 comes with a set of five choke tubes and a case (above, l.) with which to store them. –

We did notice a good bit of recoil with the heavier loads due to the light weight of this aluminum-receiver gun, and the solid rubber recoil pad didn’t do a great deal to soften the recoil. One might consider adding one of the pre-fit high-performance pads, especially if one is foolhardy enough to shoot 3½” magnums in this or any gun.

For the low MSRP of $399 the EAA MC312 would be a good gun to take into rough elements or to keep in the truck’s tool box just in case you spot a pheasant in a brushy corner or geese coming into a field.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2019/11/07/gun-test-eaa-mc312-shotgun/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjR3qad_7P9AhXmFlkFHU7nA444UBAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw3--xgYI4nHgAJwKyAHhRxp,2019-11-07
Virginia Governor Northam Increases Corrections Budget In Anticipation Of Jailing Gun Owners,"As if Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam’s wholesale attack on law-abiding gun owners wasn’t enough, the disgraced public official and his Michael Bloomberg-bought allies in the General Assembly now want the state’s hard-working taxpayers to foot the bill for their unconstitutional schemes. The budget bill (HB30) includes an appropriation of a quarter million dollars to carry out a host of gun control measures that Northam and his anti-gun allies hope to enact.

The $250,000 is appropriated to the Corrections Special Reserve Fund in order to provide for the “increase in the operating cost of adult correctional facilities resulting from the enactment” of Northam’s gun control measures. Among the enumerated laws that this allocation is meant to fund is a ban on commonly-owned semi-automatic firearms, the criminalization of private firearms transfers, and gun confiscation orders issued without due process.

Aside from the insult of forcing law-abiding Virginia taxpayers to pay for the diminution of their rights, the gun control allocation is a severe waste of resources. Northam’s Bloomberg-backed gun control measures will not make Virginia safer.

In additional to being unconstitutional, a ban on commonly-owned semi-automatic firearms will not reduce violent crime.

Long guns of any description are rarely used in violent crime. FBI Uniform Crime Reporting data breaks down homicides by weapon type. In 2018, the FBI reported that there were five times as many individuals listed as killed with “knives or cutting instruments,” than with rifles of any kind. The data also showed that rifles were listed as being used in less homicides than “blunt objects (clubs, hammers, etc.)” or “personal weapons (hands, fists, feet, etc.).”

A 1997 Department of Justice-funded study of the 1994 federal “assault weapons” ban determined that “At best, the assault weapons ban can have only a limited effect on total gun murders, because the banned weapons and magazines were never involved in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders.” A 2004 follow-up Department of Justice-funded study came to a similar conclusion. The study determined that “AWs [assault weapons] and LCMs [large capacity magazines] were used in only a minority of gun crimes prior to the 1994 federal ban,” “relatively few attacks involve more than 10 shots fired,” and “the ban’s effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement.”

So-called “universal” background checks do not stop criminals from obtaining firearms.

Background checks don’t stop criminals from stealing firearms, getting them on the black market, or getting them from straw purchasers. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, 75 percent of criminals in state and federal state prison who had possessed a firearm during their offense acquired the firearm through theft, “Off the street/underground market,” or “from a family member or friend, or as a gift.” Less than one percent got firearms from dealers or non-dealers at gun shows. ATF has reported, “[t]he most frequent type of trafficking channel identified in ATF investigations is straw purchasing from federally licensed firearms dealers.”

This year, researchers at the Bloomberg School of Public Health and the UC Davis School of Medicine found that comprehensive background checks and prohibitions based on violent misdemeanors “were not associated with changes in firearm suicide or homicide.”

Aside from enabling the unacceptable deprivation of constitutional rights without due process, an Extreme Risk Protection Order (Red Flag) law is unnecessary in Virginia because the state already has strong and effective civil commitment laws.

Under Virginia law, a law enforcement officer may take an individual into emergency custody for a mental health evaluation without prior court approval. A person detained in this manner is then evaluated to determine whether they meet the criteria for a temporary detention. A person that was subject to a temporary detention order and subsequently agreed to voluntary admission to a mental health facility is prohibited from possessing firearms until their rights are restored by a court.

Tax-paying Virginians should not have to foot the bill for Northam and Bloomberg’s radical attack on their fundamental rights.

Established in 1975, the Institute for Legislative Action (ILA) is the “lobbying” arm of the National Rifle Association of America.

Gun Test: EAA/Girsan MC312 Gobbler,"By Jeff Johnston, American Hunter

The year 2012 was potentially huge for every semi-auto shotgun maker except that one named Benelli. You see, that’s the year Paoli Benelli’s patent on its inertia-operated action design expired, and with it its stranglehold on the market—one that Benelli created almost single-handedly, thanks to its wonderful guns that would accept shells of any length and go bang every time in the harshest of environments.

At the time, Benelli’s unrivaled inertia-action shotguns were viewed as the gold standard for waterfowlers and military operators alike, a position that allowed Benelli to charge a premium for its guns. In essence, if you wanted the best, you bought a Benelli, and you’d pay top dollar for it.

That was then, but this is now, when competitors have appeared from nearly every corner of the globe looking to take some of Benelli’s market share with copycat-designed, less expensive guns. One great example is the Model MC312 from the Girsan arms company that is currently imported by European American Armory (EAA). I recently tested its new turkey gun “Gobbler” model, with a real-world price tag of only around $550—complete with an included red-dot optic.

Out of the box the MC312 Gobbler is much more impressive than what I was expecting for a Turkish-made, sub-$600 shotgun. It comes packaged with five choke tubes and a mini reflex-style red-dot sight. Beyond the accessories, the shotgun looks impressive with its optional vertical pistol grip and bronze Cerakote metal finish. Its polymer stock is camo-dipped, even though it’s more of a waterfowl pattern than a spring turkey finish. (To this I’d argue that not a turkey in the world can tell the difference.) It’s got sling studs that turkey hunters want. Most notably, however, is the 312’s longish receiver that’s highlighted by two slots on top that form an integral Picatinny rail mount. This design appears quite ingenious, as it does away with the need for drilled and tapped holes on the receiver to which a Picatinny rail could be mounted. Certainly, the design is easier and less costly for the end consumer to use because it does away with buying and mounting scope mounts; moreover, it lowers the optic by about half an inch compared to a rail mounted on top of the receiver, and the value of this cannot be overstressed when shooting one of the heaviest recoiling rounds in the sporting world—the mighty 3.5-inch turkey load. It allows the shooter to obtain a much better cheek weld on the stock that in turn mitigates felt recoil and makes finding the red dot quicker when that gobbler’s coming in fast.

In essence, the MC312 Gobbler is an inertia-action, semi-auto shotgun owning a 24-inch ribbed barrel, dual brass-bead rear/fiber-optic front sight and a five-round tubular magazine. Overall it measures 50 inches and weighs a hair over 7 pounds. As such, this Gobbler gun built for the spring woods is fast pointing, and, along with its oversized bolt handle, pistol grip, choke tube options and reliable action, would make it a great shotgun for slug-gun hunting and home protection as well.

–

Its action is almost identical to Benelli’s vaunted second-generation Armi action that uses the gun’s recoil to compress a spring hidden within the bolt. As the gun recoils rearward around the bolt—thanks to the force of the fired shell—this spring compresses, then pushes forward thereby rotating the bolt head and unlocking it from the barrel extension. When this happens, the bolt flings backward violently, ejecting the empty shell from the chamber before being arrested by the bolt-return spring located in the buttstock. As it returns forward, it picks up another shell from the carrier and loads it into battery, completing the cycle.

The advantages of this system are threefold: First, it uses very few moving parts so it is quick and inherently reliable. Second, it is shell length-agnostic, so you can load 2¾-, 3- and 3½-inch shells in any order without adjustment. Third, because shell gases and powder grime are blown straight out of the barrel and not back into gas ports like in gas-action semi-automatics, the gun stays very clean, thereby increasing its reliability. Lastly, just like the Benelli, the MC312 features a magazine cutoff button located at the bottom of the receiver that holds the bolt open and allows the shell to be removed and replaced in the chamber without releasing a shell from the magazine tube. I’ve used this feature countless times, when perhaps a turkey that I’d anticipated coming in through the woods instead tiptoes across a field where a longer shot is expected. I can substitute a No. 6 shell for a No. 4 quickly if needed.

As for the action’s downside? Because the inertia and recoil springs must be stout enough to withstand the tremendous forces of recoil from 3½-inch shells, sometimes the lightest field loads—like 1⅛-ounce skeet loads—fail to cycle the action. But this is a turkey gun, and those light loads likely won’t be used. Secondly, while the inertia action mitigates recoil much better than a break-open action, it is not quite on par with gas-action guns of similar weight.

Like the pre-Benelli Super Black Eagle 3 designs that some hunters criticized for being capable of not locking fully into battery if the bolt was eased and not slammed home—therefore causing a misfire—the Girsan action is also capable of this flaw. If Benelli gets criticized for it (it’s now corrected in its top-end models), then so should the MC312. Hunters should just always make sure the action is fully in battery before hunting.

In real-world testing, this Girsan proved an awesome shotgun, and I was pleasantly surprised at its quality, performance and finish all-around. Using magnum loads, it was supremely reliable; it pointed fast and printed its pattern where I aimed its sights. Its full choke tube delivered deadly patterns out to 50 yards, and its dual sight beads provided a precise aiming point for those who choose not to use the included quick-detachable red-dot sight. (I tested the sight and it worked as intended; the dot was adjustable for brightness; its controls moved the dot to zero and kept it there; and its battery is still burning bright after one month of testing. Even if you don’t prefer a red-dot sight on your turkey setup, it’s a great value-add to this shotgun.)

I found the MC312 to be well balanced, even with its rubbery, easy-to-handle pistol grip that I don’t personally prefer. (Sure, the grip is great for a dedicated turkey gun, but if I were to buy one, I’d buy the non-pistol grip model so I could use the gun for waterfowl hunting, too.) I love the Cerakote finish that not only dulls it from glare but protects its metal from the elements.

The only two negatives I discovered are that its safety is a bit stiff and quite loud; secondly, the gun’s “recoil pad,” isn’t much of a pad at all, but rather a piece of hard rubber that should be softer. But for such a great, cushy feeling in my wallet after I buy a $550 shotgun loaded with these features, I’m willing to take a little more pain in my shoulder. In sum, the EAA/Girsan MC312 Gobbler is an incredible turkey gun on its own, and an exceptional one for the money.

"Despite Confiscation, New Zealand Sees Most Gun Crime In A Decade","On April 5, 2019, three days after New Zealand’s Arms Amendment Act 2019 advanced from its first reading in parliament, NRA-ILA noted that “[g]iven the abundant research on Australia’s similar gun confiscation efforts, New Zealand officials can expect that their gun control measures will do little more than trample the natural rights of gun owners​…” This week the first evidence vindicating this position came in when Radio New Zealand (RNZ) published figures it had obtained from the government showing that for last year crime involving firearms was the highest it had been since 2009.

According to an RNZ article titled, “Rates of gun crimes and killings using guns at highest levels in a decade in 2019,” last year “there were 3540 occasions where an offender was found with a gun​.” The report went on to note that “in both of the last two years, the rate of deadly incidents involving a firearm was the highest it had been since 2009” and that “[t]he number of guns seized by police is also on the rise, up almost 50 percent on five years earlier at 1263 last year.​” Making clear that the figures cited in the article were not skewed by the horrific shooting in Christchurch, the report noted that “[t]he 15 March terror attacks were listed as two separate firearms-related incidents.​”

On March 21, 2019, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern targeted New Zealand’s law-abiding gun owners by unilaterally halting the sale of semi-automatic centerfire firearms that utilize detachable magazines to normal gun owners. The Arms Amendment Act 2019 was passed into law on April 10 and received royal assent the following day. The key provision of the legislation outlawed possession of all semi-automatic centerfire rifles and their magazines.

In order to enforce the ban, the legislation provided for a firearm confiscation scheme. As with Australia’s 1996 national firearms “buyback” program,” law-abiding New Zealand gun owners were forced to turn their lawfully-acquired property over to the government for a set amount of compensation. The program ran from June 20-December 20, 2019. Compliant gun owners were treated to poor compensation and a breach of their personal data.

At the end of the confiscation program the government had collected roughly 56,000 firearms. A June 2019 report from consulting firm KPMG had estimated that there were as many as 173,000 newly-prohibited firearms in the country. New Zealand gun rights group, the Council of Licensed Firearms Owners estimated that 170,000 prohibited firearms were still in the hands of Kiwis after the confiscation program.

It should come as no surprise that New Zealand’s new gun control laws haven’t appeared to effect gun crime. After all, gang members told the government as much.

At the outset of the gun control push, the Waikato branch president of the Mongrel Mob street gang, Sonny Fatu, made clear to the press that his gang and others have no intention of obeying further gun laws. The gang leader stated, “Will gangs get rid of their weapons? No. Because of who we are, we can’t guarantee our own safety.”

Moreover, as noted in the April 5, 2019 NRA-ILA article, the research on Australia’s confiscation program is clear. In 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice’s National Institute of Justice reviewed the available research on Australia’s firearm confiscation program and issued a memorandum that concluded that the effort had no effect on crime generally. In coming to this determination, the memorandum cited work from University of Maryland Professor Peter Reuter and Jenny Mouzos, aptly titled, “Australia: A Massive Buyback of Low-Risk Guns.”The NIJ memo made clear that the researchers “found no effect on crime.”

With this new data it is tempting to call the New Zealand’s gun control efforts a failure. However, to do so one must assume that Ardern and her government’s goal was to reduce crime perpetrated with firearms rather than to attack the rights of law-abiding gun owners. Concerning the latter, Ardern’s gun control has proven an undeniable success.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2020/05/27/despite-confiscation-new-zealand-sees-most-gun-crime-in-a-decade/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwin1tqe_7P9AhXoTTABHbYrBok4ZBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw05YryV7RYXcQotJ4moJkFq,2020-05-27
Here Are The 10 Virginia Gun Laws That Took Effect Amid Nationwide Unrest,"Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam passed a slew of gun laws in April, despite opposition from pro-gun groups and Republicans, who hold a minority in the state.

The laws passed in April took effect Wednesday amid nationwide unrest an increase in firearm sales .

. The new regulations limit handgun purchases, create a red flag law and instill universal background checks, among other restrictions.

A host of gun control laws, passed months ago and spearheaded by Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, took effect on Wednesday in the commonwealth after months of fierce opposition from pro-firearm groups.

Northam signed the slew of gun restrictions in April after they passed the state’s General Assembly, where Democrats hold the majority, USA Today reported. The lawmakers faced dissent from over 20,000 angry citizens — many of whom were heavily armed — in the state’s capital in late January, according to Fox News.

Virginia Citizens Defense League, a Second Amendment group, gained thousands of members amid the gun-control deliberations in the assembly, and sued to block one of the regulations, which limited firearm purchasers to one handgun per month. A judge denied their request last week, the Daily Press reported.

????BREAKING????

A judge has DENIED the gun lobby’s attempt to block the one-handgun-a-month law. A huge win for public safety. Proud we could successfully defend this commonsense law to reduce gun trafficking and keep Virginians safe. — Mark Herring (@MarkHerringVA) June 25, 2020

“We lose too many Virginians to gun violence, and it is past time we took bold, meaningful action to make our communities safer,” Northam said in a press release in April. “I was proud to work with legislators and advocates on these measures, and I am proud to sign them into law. These commonsense laws will save lives.”

These regulations come amid nationwide unrest following the death of George Floyd, who died after a police officer knelt on his neck for over eight mutes, video showed. Gun sales have skyrocketed to record levels, following mass violence from demonstrators, according to PBS News.

Here are the new laws passed by Northam:

1. Virginians are only allowed one handgun purchase a month.

This is not a new law, but a reinstatement of an old ordinance, which ran 1993 to 2012. The aim is to disallow the stockpiling of pistols and dissuade gun trafficking, according to a press release.

2. Gun owners are subject to a red flag law.

The Extreme Risk Protective Order allows the state to “temporarily separate a person from their firearms when they represent a danger to themselves or others” before seeing a judge in court, according to the press release.

3. Background checks are mandated on all firearm sales and transfers (also known as universal background checks).

All firearm sellers, including private transactions at gun shows, must run background checks, the release said.

4. Gun owners have 48 hours to report a lost or stolen firearm.

Gun owners whose firearms were misplaced or stolen can face civil penalties if they don’t report the matter to authorities within two days, the release said.

5. Guns in households with children must be securely stored.

Gun owners will face a harsher penalty if they “recklessly” keep firearms in a home with children under the age of 14, according to the press release. The offense was increased to a class 1 misdemeanor, which carries jail time as a possible penalty.

The law previously was a class 3 misdemeanor with a $500 fine.

6. One piece of signed legislation banned “trigger activators.”

Northam’s law bans “trigger activators,” which enable “more than one shot with the pull of the trigger,” according to the legislation.

Binary triggers fire a single projectile when the trigger is pulled in addition to another round when a shooter releases their finger from the trigger. These have been legal to own as they simulate automatic fire and don’t make a semi-automatic firearm fully automatic, according to Gun Mag Warehouse.

The Gun Owners of America, a pro-Second Amendment group said “The new law DOES NOT prohibit binary triggers,” according to a statement on their webpage. (RELATED: Rep. Matt Gaetz: ATF Secretly Looking Into Restricting Certain Pistol Braces)

7. Child care facilities must lock down firearms.

Family day homes, care facilities for children that aren’t blood related, must lock and secure all firearms during daily operations, according to Virginia legal text.

8. Some gun safes are exempt from sales tax.

Gun safes bought for a price less than $1,500 will not incur sales tax, one bill specified.

9. Those under the scrutiny of protective orders are required to promptly surrender their firearms.

Gun owners served with protective orders must turn their weapons over to the state within 24 hours of receiving the notice, another bill detailed. Protective orders refer to those who the state deems to be unfit to possess firearms or a concealed weapons permit.

10. Cities and counties have leeway in regulating firearms.

Different localities can impose their own regulations on where firearms can be carried. Public parks, event spaces, government buildings, and others locations are places that are fair game for banning carry, according to the Daily Press.

Gun Test: Nighthawk Custom Fire Hawk 9mm,"By Bob Boyd, Shooting Illustrated

It’s been said that with age comes wisdom, but perhaps that’s only for the lucky ones. Birthdays come with age and for most, the culmination of becoming another year older is often celebrated with the receipt of gifts. And, once you reach a certain age (often 65), you can begin to collect social security as well as begin to take advantage of discount programs that offer monetary savings for things like meals, hotel stays, movie tickets and health care, just to name a few. But there’s another side to that coin.

For shooters—and especially concealed-carry licensees—birthdays bring an assortment of unsolicited ailments/deficits such as arthritis, less hand strength, a reduction in motor skills and a subsequent growing sensitivity to recoil. Afflictions like these are enough to convince some to stop shooting/carrying concealed. For others, however, the realization can cause shooters and concealed-carry licensees to begin searching for a worthy compromise—another handgun chambered in a softer-recoiling cartridge, but one still capable of delivering terminal performance—on par with—or similar to their original cartridge of choice.

A recent review of the Smith & Wesson Model 610 by friend and fellow gunscribe, Dick Williams, revealed that such challenges are more common than I originally perceived. He writes, “Big-bore revolvers and I have had a passionate love affair my whole life. However, their recoil can be demanding for both beginning shooters and more-mature shooters alike. Luckily, Smith & Wesson’s Model 610 revolver makes it a little easier for everyone to enjoy a larger-caliber revolver.”

In addition to taking solace in knowing I wasn’t alone, the notion suggested if he could find a solution where he wasn’t forced to abandon big-bore wheelguns, there had to be a similar solution where I could continue shooting my favored semi-auto pistol of choice: The 1911.

While it’s true fans of the 1911 platform need not look too far to find myriad offerings chambered in calibers other than .45 ACP, such a selection becomes a bit more challenging when viewed through the prism of one that is designed for optimal recoil control. One possible solution that came to mind is a pistol featuring a factory-ported compensator that is integral to the barrel. A cursory search of the Internet revealed a handful of manufacturers offering such an old-school yet innovative solution. (I’m not the only one looking for solutions dealing with the effects of recoil.) The pistol that appealed to me the most is Nighthawk Custom’s Fire Hawk.

Since its doors first opened in 2003, Nighthawk Custom has work diligently to become a source for superbly crafted and highly customized 1911s of uncompromising quality and exquisite attention to detail. Despite its long history of building 1911s for personal protection, the company is no stranger to pushing the envelope. One look at the Fire Hawk—especially its muzzle—is enough to suggest its cues came from elsewhere: Competitive shooting. That’s not to say however, that the company is getting into building raceguns. To understand the reasoning behind the Fire Hawk, a history lesson (along with a closer examination) is required.

In addition to venting recoil-generating gases, the Fire Hawk’s full-contour compensator and the bull barrel strategically provides welcome mass where it is most needed to counter muzzle flip. A 24-karat gold bead is quick to acquire in myriad lighting conditions.

–

Back in late 1970s, after years of independent efforts around the country, the landscape of competitive shooting underwent an evolution to move from quick-draw “leather-slap” matches to a more practical style of shooting that built upon handgun skills and self-defense-oriented training, which resulted in organizations such as the International Practical Shooting Confederation (IPSC) and its national-governing body, the United States Practical Shooting Association (USPSA).

During this timeframe, custom gunsmiths and early IPSC competitive shooters engaged in various creative ways to lessen the effects of felt recoil and muzzle flip with such things as longer slides and adding more weight in front of the pistol with dual-purpose devices, such as compensators and/or muzzle brakes. Some folks got really creative by shortening slides and added compensators—bringing the guns back to full size. Enter the Fire Hawk: A Commander-length slide paired with a compensated barrel to duplicate the length of a Government Model atop a standard-size frame. However, while the Fire Hawk may share the dimensions of America’s Old Warhorse, that’s where the similarities end.

While only the second 1911 I’ve reviewed by this manufacturer, it’s my experience that Nighthawk-brand pistols are far from run-of-the-mill. One main distinction is the company’s construction is rock-solid—suggesting that only a single chunk of steel is used in the pistol’s composition. While impossible, however, their tolerances are tight enough to generate a superb fit, with no play, rattle, wobble, or excessive movement of its components.

Measuring the same length as a Government Model 1911, the Fire Hawk’s handling characteristics are far from typical. Taking the pistol in hand, its heft is immediately apparent, but not unpleasantly so. The pistol tips the scales at slightly more than 43 ounces, which is a mere 2.5 ounces heavier than a standard Government model of the same chambering. The additional mass is located forward of the frame and the slide. However, the Fire Hawk’s shortened slide actually weighs slightly 2 ounces less than an OEM slide. This means, unlike many semi-automatics where most of the weight resides in the portion of the pistol you hold, a portion of the Fire Hawk’s mass is located in the pistol’s business end, namely around the muzzle.

More than an aesthetic whim, the top of the Fire Hawk is adorned with a hole that, at first glance, appears to be integral to the slide. Upon closer inspection, the pistol’s 5-inch, National Match barrel is capped with a single-port compensator that has been expertly blended into the slide. Despite adding a noticeable muzzle-heavy heft to the pistol, both components virtually appear to be one. The addition of an attractive French border serves to aesthetically unite the compensator and slide. While not as seamless as some examples I have seen, it does add an element of class.

Locking the slide rearward, which cycled silky-smooth—as though gliding across ball bearings—reveals a bull contour to the barrel. In addition to serving another means of recoil-dampening mass, the tapered contour also eliminates the need for a barrel bushing. A call to the firm’s expert technicians revealed that slide reciprocation is powered by a 9-pound recoil spring that is captured on a guide rod and capped with a reverse plug. The barrel is match-grade and sports an integral feedramp for flawless feeding.

The Fire Hawk’s compensator is blended almost seamlessly to the slide. A French border adds a touch of elegance.

–

While the Fire Hawk may sport features with origins in competitive shooting, those same features make it ideally suited as a defensive guardian. How so? The compensator contributes in multiple ways.

First, when a shot is fired, propellant gases are vented upward through it, which applies a downward pressure to the muzzle. Second, consider the compensator’s shape: Being the same width (i.e. full contour) as the slide, all that extra steel equates to strategically placed mass directly below the barrel.

The combination of the porting and the added weight helps the shooter to not only shoot quicker, the mass aids in faster sight recovery and quicker follow-up shots. In a nutshell, the compensator promotes greater controllability of the pistol. In other words, if you’re looking for a pistol designed to hammer targets, this is it. But that’s not the only thing it has going for it.

Unlike conventional semi-auto pistols, the Fire Hawk’s front sight is mounted in a dovetail located directly behind the port on the compensator instead of on the slide. In addition to creating a longer sight radius for greater accuracy potential, anchoring the sight directly to the compensator works to minimize movement, while simultaneously enhancing overall sight clarity and reacquisition.

The front post is topped with an actual 24-karat gold bead, capable of quickly drawing the eye in a variety of lighting conditions. At the opposite end of the slide, is a fixed Heinie solid-black Slant Pro rear aperture. The notch area is recessed in a pocket, providing a crisp, protected sight picture that aids in rapid alignment under stress. This sight also sports dual setscrews to provide an uncompromising interface capable of shrugging off abuse.

The absence of dots or other reference points is quite refreshing and makes for a nice, welcome and clean addition, in that the lack of extraneous dots makes for a simple, intuitive and above all, ultra-fast sight picture. The gold bead seems to be coming back into EDC gun fashion as a practical alternative to tritium, as it is sufficiently visible in ambient light (be it urban or suburban environments) and, users avoid the hassle of having to replace radioactive lamps that will eventually lose their glow over the years. As an added bonus, the addition of a flat surface on the rear assembly aids in one-handed malfunction clearance.

In keeping with the Fire Hawk’s concealed-carry design, its beavertail grip safety has a raised palm swell on the rear to aid in quick deactivation, while the tang portion promotes comfort while reducing the likelihood of snagging on clothing during the draw. An Ultra Hi-Cut frontstrap promotes a purchase-enhancing grip and furthers overall controllability by bringing the hand closer to the bore, which ultimately translates to less felt recoil.

Perfectly executed 25-LPI checkering on the frontstrap and the backstrap paired with black G10 grips with Nighthawk medallions offer a comfortable non-slip tactile surface without the skin-abrading bite. The dished-out area on the right panel aids in reaching the pistol’s slightly extended, checkered magazine release. The bottom of the pistol features a one-piece mag well/mainspring housing.

Purchase-enhancing features such as a checkered magazine release, a generous slide stop and serrations along the face of the trigger promote positive actuation.

–

The Fire Hawk is fitted with a skeletonized hammer and medium-length solid trigger, which promotes easy access even with gloved hands and broke at crisply at slightly more than 4 pounds. To accommodate my southpaw affliction, a sublimely contoured ambidextrous thumb safety was fitted the pistol. (A single-sided variant is normally included.) Its narrow ledges foster easy deactivation while providing just enough real estate for my thumb to comfortably reside while shooting. In testing, the cavernous hole of the one-piece mag well facilitated effortless reloads—a huge plus given my fused wrist and limited fine-motor skills due to my cerebral palsy—and although it extends the grip by slightly less than a quarter inch, I find it a practical addition, especially to a carry pistol.

Prior to heading to the range, I fieldstripped the pistol to add a touch of lube as suggested by our Skills Check editor Ed Head. Despite the test sample’s tight tolerances (which contribute to and are needed for the pistol’s superb accuracy), a hole in the guide-rod allowed the recoil spring to be easily compressed with aid of the included takedown tool. I was surprised at just how easy it was to disassemble and put back together with minimal elbow grease required—quite often, 1911s with tight tolerances can be difficult to take apart and reassemble. It required little to no jostling, shifting or shaking of parts. The simple, but essential process ushered an epiphany: This superlative engineering, dear reader, is exactly what consumers pay for when purchasing a Nighthawk Custom pistol.

Prior to evaluating the Fire Hawk, the experimentation I did regarding recoil mitigation involved reviewing assorted aftermarket so-called 1911 “recoil-reducing systems,” which do work, but they consistently revealed lackluster results. A conversation with fellow gunwriter Tom Marx, who possesses a sage-like knowledge of engineering helped to explain their shortcomings.

“Such systems often contain a stiffer-than-stock spring (or multiple springs) that work in a linear manner or direction to slow the speed of slide reciprocation before everything momentarily stops on the rebound portion of the reciprocation process in an attempt to lessen the ramming together of a number of surfaces contained within the frame. Rather than `reducing’ felt recoil however, such devices serve to merely `absorb’ and/or `mask’ the abuse and how it is felt/perceived by the shooter—similarly as how a vehicle’s suspension functions when driving over a speed bump.”

So, how does the Fire Hawk stack up by comparison? Only a trip to the range would provide answers.

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly delayed my completion of her review, as all local shooting ranges were forced to close for several months. It wasn’t until August when I was able to put the Fire Hark through its paces. To borrow a phrase from Shooting Illustrated’s Managing Editor, Jay Grazio, my trigger time with the Fire Hawk, was “boringly predictable.”

While that is hardly surprising for a 1911 of this quality, there’s something to be said for consistency—especially when it concerns a pistol designated for personal defense. As expected, the pistol ran flawlessly. The surprise was in the recoil—or the lack thereof. Thanks to the ported compensator, recoil was a gentle push and felt more like a mild .38 Spl. wadcutter rather than the typical snappiness associated with a 9 mm. However, when discussing something subject like felt recoil words alone fall short. The following video illustrates just how effective that the pistol’s ported compensator truly is.

WATCH:

The footage offers a visual recoil comparison between a Nighthawk Custom Thunder Ranch Combat Special and the Fire Hawk—both Government length and both chambered in 9 mm. Consisting of three scenes shot by a remote camera, the first is of five shots of SIG Sauer 147-grain Elite Ball FNJ being shot through the Thunder Ranch Combat Special, followed by a brief two-round recap in slow motion. Next, four rounds are fired through the Fire Hawk, followed by a two-round recap in slow motion.

Finally, beginning at 50 seconds both pistols are shot simultaneously, with one ghosted over the other, and at 54 seconds you can clearly see the Combat Special is still in full recoil when the Fire Hawk has already recoiled and already back on target. The same thing can be seen at 59 seconds. Similarly, the video does a great job showing the Fire Hawk had a much more shallow recoil arc compared to the Combat Special.

In the accuracy department, the Fire Hawk delivered quite well across a wide range of bullet weights. All three loads tested performed more than adequate for self-defense purposes, the best of which was a minuscule 1.29 inch achieved with Colt NM Doubletap 124-grain FMJ at 15 yards. Equally surprising was that the porting had little effect on velocity. (Chronograph readings only varied 20 to 60 fps respectively, compared to the published data printed on the ammo boxes) a negligible difference that also had little to no affect on the pistol’s overall accuracy.

Night Hawk Custom’s Fire Hawk blends modern-day craftsmanship with time-proven recoil compensation features that effectively tames America’s war horse.

"EXCLUSIVE: NY Post’s ‘Smoking Gun’ Hunter Biden Email 100% Authentic, Forensic Analysis Concludes","An email Hunter Biden received in April 2015 from a Burisma executive discussing an introduction to then-Vice President Joe Biden, which lies at the heart of a New York Post investigation, is unquestionably authentic, a cybersecurity expert told the Daily Caller News Foundation on Thursday.

The DCNF obtained a full copy of Hunter Biden’s alleged laptop from former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday. The DCNF provided Robert Graham, the founder of the cybersecurity firm Errata Security, with a copy of the email and its metadata for forensic analysis.

Graham, who has been cited as a cybersecurity expert in The Washington Post, the Associated Press, Wired, Engadget and other news and technology outlets, told the DCNF that he used a cryptographic signature found in the email’s metadata to validate that an account used by Vadym Pozharsky, an advisor to Burisma’s board of directors, emailed Hunter Biden on April 17, 2015.

In the email, Pozharsky thanked Hunter Biden for “inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together.”

The New York Post first reported the email in October, describing it as a “smoking-gun” showing that Hunter Biden had introduced his father to the Burisma executive in 2015.

The email was sent less than a year before Joe Biden pressured former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire a prosecutor who was reportedly investigating the gas company in return for a $1 billion loan guarantee.

Graham previously told the DCNF that emails sent from Gmail, such as Pozharski’s message to Hunter Biden, can be “absolutely verified beyond a shadow of a doubt” by testing its contents against the unique DKIM signature found in its metadata.

Graham used the DKIM signature within the email to verify with a private key on Google’s servers that the sender, recipient, subject, date and body of the message that the DCNF obtained from Giuliani were unchanged from when the email was originally sent in April 2015. (RELATED: Hunter Biden Emails Could Be ‘Absolutely Verified’ If Rudy Giuliani Released The Metadata, Expert Says)

Graham said the only way the email could have been faked is if someone hacked into Google’s servers, found the private key and used it to reverse engineer the email’s DKIM signature.

Email metadata on its own does not provide any indication of whether hacking had anything to with the email’s release, Graham noted.

“Of course, committing criminal hacking doesn’t make true information any less true, so no matter how illegitimately they gathered emails, the contents are provably legitimate,” Graham said.

Joe Biden’s presidential campaign said in a statement that his schedule indicates that no such meeting as alleged in the email took place. However, the campaign later told Politico that they could not rule out the possibility he had a cursory encounter with the Burisma executive.

The email came from a computer that Hunter Biden reportedly dropped off at a Delaware-based computer repair shop in April 2019. The repair shop owner provided Giuliani a copy of the hard drive after it went unclaimed.

Hunter Biden has not denied giving his laptop to the Delaware repair shop. (RELATED: Hunter Biden Isn’t Denying He Gave His Laptop To A Delaware Repair Shop)

Giuliani had initially refused to provide the Daily Caller with a copy of the hard drive in mid-October, saying that questions surrounding the veracity of its contents were “pettifogging nonsense” pushed by the “liberal press.”

The Biden campaign did not immediately return a request for comment.

Gun Test: Henry Side Gate Lever Action Rifle,"In the spring of 2019, Henry Repeating Arms introduced the new Side Gate Lever Action rifle in a number of chamberings. Developed to answer consumer demand, and designed to offer the shooter the best of both worlds, the lever gun’s tubular magazine can be loaded either from the front, in typical Henry fashion, or at the receiver via a gate on the right side.

This marks a major evolution for the company; since resurrecting the Henry name back in 1997, this is the first lever-action produced by the manufacturer that offers a traditional side-loading gate. The new Side Gates are being offered in .30-30 Win., .35 Rem., .38-55 Win. (already approved for use in Single Action Shooting Society competitions) and .45-70 Gov’t. Our test sample for the following review was chambered in the very popular .30-30 Win. cartridge.

Initial inspection revealed the Side Gate to be of heirloom quality, with its highly polished two-piece brass receiver and beautiful walnut furniture. A closer look at the brass parts revealed them to be expertly polished without scratches or casting marks. In addition to the receiver, Henry also makes the barrel band and buttplate from brass, and they provide a pleasing contrast to the high-polish blued parts, including the gun’s bolt, lever and barrel. Henry takes great pride in building its guns exclusively from American-made parts and components.

The wood on our sample was equally impressive. Both the buttstock and fore-end were tightly grained, and Henry laser-cut them with checkering. The wrist of the buttstock and fore-end possesses a delicate floral scroll inside the checkering pattern that is both beautiful and functional. An oval on each side of the fore-end has “Henry” cut into it. Wood-to-metal fit was exemplary.

In order to front-load the Henry, rotate the inner magazine tube to disengage it from the exterior of the under-barrel magazine, and pull it out far enough that the follower clears the cutout in the bottom of the magazine. Cartridges can then be loaded into the tube, and the operation is completed by pushing the inner magazine tube back down into position and turning it to lock it in place.

To top-off or load the gun using the side gate, simply push the cartridges into the port as you would any other lever gun. Unlike most side-gate lever-actions, unloading the gun is quick and easy, as the shooter can simply remove the internal magazine tube and allow the cartridges to slide free of the rifle without the need to cycle each cartridge through the action.

The Side Gate can be loaded via a cutout in the magazine tube or, for the first time on a Henry, through a side-loading gate on the receiver’s right. The brass-frame gun has blued steel for its lever, bolt, barrel, magazine tube, hammer and trigger. It takes down much like a Marlin Model 336. –

Unlike other brands of traditional lever guns, the Side Gate’s hammer does not have a half-cock position, however, it can be safely carried with a round in the chamber and the hammer down. Henry uses its patented transfer bar safety in this gun, and it prevents the rifle from firing unless the hammer is cocked and the trigger pulled. If, during the course of firing the user wishes to stop shooting, he or she simply needs to use a thumb to carefully ease the hammer forward while pulling the rifle’s trigger.

All current Henry Side Gate models employ 20″ barrels, and our .30-30 test gun’s tube was cut with 1:12″ right-hand-twist rifling. The rifle’s semi-buckhorn rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation, and the ramped front sight is equipped with a 0.062″ ivory bead. Another selling point of the rifle’s flat-top design is that its receiver top is drilled and tapped for scope use.

For our evaluation, Henry sent us a Picatinny rail mount that attaches to the top of the receiver with three screws. We used medium-height scope rings to attach a Leupold VX-2, 2-7X 28 mm Ultralight scope, but once we had the scope mounted, we discovered its ocular bell was resting on the rear sight blade, even after we removed its elevator.

Fortunately, it was an easy matter to remove the rear sight’s screw and drive it from its dovetail. Taller rings would have been another solution if we’d had a set handy. We fired all groups from a seated position using a DOA Tactical portable shooting bench and a Caldwell rifle rest with our targets set out at 100 yds. Our evaluators were careful to rest the fore-end of the rifle, and not the magazine tube, on the rest while shooting so as not to cause a change in point of impact on the targets.

The trigger on our test sample was pretty good; it broke on average at 5 lbs., 12 ozs., with just a hint of creep and not much overtravel. Our single best five-shot group measured under an inch (0.92″) and was recorded with Winchester’s 170-gr. Silvertips. This load also averaged about 1.5″ groups for the five groups we fired with it. Overall, the gun exhibited fine accuracy with the average extreme spread for the three loads tested coming in at 1.83″.

Throughout our shooting sessions the Side Gate performed admirably. As one shooter noted, the frame and side gate itself are nicely polished with the sharp edges removed for pain-free loading. The action is smooth and did not bind, and is therefore capable of very rapid manipulation.

Henry recommends cleaning the rifle from the breech end, but oddly enough, does not detail the removal of the gun’s bolt in the owner’s manual. If you’re familiar with the Marlin Model 336, the procedure is very similar. After ensuring the chamber and magazine are empty, rotate the lever to its fully forward position. Now remove the screw that connects the lever to the receiver. Once accomplished, remove the lever from the gun. Now remove the bolt through the rear of the receiver.

Pay close attention to the position of the ejector, as it will most likely fall free from the gun when the bolt is withdrawn. When re-assembling the rifle, the ejector must be in its proper position, as the bolt has a groove for it. The bolt will capture the ejector, but leave the bolt in its open position—as if a round had just been ejected. Replace the lever in this open position and re-install the lever screw. Cycle the lever several times to ensure the gun is correctly assembled.

Customers wanted a Henry capable of side loading, and the Side Gate Lever Action delivers. It’s a solid, accurate and reliable shooter, and its beautiful cosmetics should make it a rifle that can be proudly passed down from generation to generation.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2020/11/05/gun-test-henry-side-gate-lever-action-rifle/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiPs9uY_7P9AhVTF1kFHWylB6Q4ChAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw2wo-WEgZ4HZptk1UX4VAlo,2020-11-05
Gun Test: Wilson Combat Southpaw Protector Series AR In .300 HAM’R,"By Kelly Young, American Rifleman

Here at American Rifleman, as the lone lefty presently on staff, all assignments to cover new left-handed guns inevitably end up on my desk, which is perfectly fine with me, as I am a proud advocate for the southpaw minority, and any new firearm options for me and my kind are always a cause for celebration.

So, when I heard that Wilson Combat had introduced a left-hand version of its Protector Series AR, and that I would have the opportunity to venture to Bill Wilson’s private ranch for a field test of a .300 HAM’R-chambered variant of the new carbine on some of Texas’ many feral hogs, I was excited fourfold. Not only that Wilson Combat was joining Rock River, Stag and a few boutique shops on the lonely left-hand AR market, but also that I would have my first exposure to both one of the company’s AR-platform rifles and its newest cartridge (something I had been curious about since the .300 HAM’R’s 2018 launch). Not to mention that I would get to do so while popping some pigs—which I view as one of the most enjoyable civic duties available to mankind.

They say that no single gun is the perfect fit for every scenario, and that, as a result, every firearm is an exercise in compromise to some degree or another. This is, of course, correct—my ideal concealed carry choice would no doubt make for a tragically poor safari gun. And given the fact that “they” were almost certainly right-handed, “they” don’t know the half of it, as compromise goes double for us lefties. Like all left-handed shooters, 99 percent of my experience with firearms has been spent making do with guns configured for right-handed use, and for every one model that is at least mostly southpaw-friendly (a remarkable few manage to get it 100 percent correct), there are a dozen with a right-hand-centric manual of arms that puts me at a real disadvantage—whether on the hunt or in the fight.

Bill Wilson is a no-compromise kind of guy. Originally a watchmaker by trade, he only entered the custom firearm business in 1977 after sending some of his own competition guns to well-known gunsmiths of the ’70s and not being overly impressed by the results. He similarly helped found the Int’l Defensive Pistol Ass’n after seeking out a shooting sport that effectively combined competition with a realistic course of fire that tested street-level defensive gun skills and determined the existing options to be lacking. In both cases, he knew he could do better himself.

In light of this, his company’s decision to expand into left-hand models makes perfect sense; southpaw shooters using northpaw guns face an unnecessary obstacle, so why not make it easier for them by removing an aspect of compromise from the equation? Yes, lefties can use right-hand ARs—in point of fact, they’re a good bit more workable for southpaws than are wrong-hand turnbolts—but why would I choose to settle for someone else’s gun when options designed specifically for me exist? Here’s a quick look at the left-hand Protector Series AR and the .300 HAM’R separately, before we see how the combo fared together at the range and against sizeable East Texas swine.

In order to facilitate left-handed use, Wilson Combat’s southpaw Protector Series AR features a reversed upper receiver, with the forward assist and brass deflector moved to the left side of the rifle (l.), and a left-ejecting bolt carrier group (r.).

–

The Rifle

Wilson Combat’s handguns are known for their exacting attention to detail and gorgeous presentations, so I was curious to gauge how much of that meticulousness had been injected into the manufacturer’s rifle production as well. The company introduced AR-pattern rifles to its lineup back in the late 1990s, but the Protector Series is the first to also offer a left-hand SKU. An AR-15-size platform, the Protector is available chambered in .223 Rem./5.56×45 mm NATO and .300 Blackout in addition to .300 HAM’R.

Unlike the rest of the company’s rifle line, which are built on receivers machined from bar stock, the Protector makes use of forged 7075-T6 aluminum receivers, allowing it to be Wilson Combat’s most modestly priced rifle model at a base MSRP of $1,999 (the southpaw version costs a bit more at $2,225). Both receivers are finished with Armor-Tuff—a non-reflective coating that adds lubricity and increases resistance to wear and corrosion—in either black or coyote tan.

Producing a left-hand AR required Wilson Combat to re-design the typical right-hand upper to be a near mirror image of itself in order to facilitate ejection to the left side of the gun. I say “near” because, apart from its reversed nature, the only thing that is truly different about a southpaw upper is that the dustcover flips upward out of the way rather than downward. Internally, left-handed operation also requires the fabrication of a left-hand bolt carrier and a left-ejecting bolt.

(l.) Adjustable to six length-of-pull settings, the Protector Series AR’s Rogers Super-Stoc buttstock features an integral sling loop and a QD sling mount, and it can be locked at the desired setting with a cam lever. (r.) Wilson Combat’s distinctive starburst pattern is molded into the carbine’s pistol grip with moderately coarse texturing to help provide rock-solid purchase on the gun while firing.

–

Southpaws attempting to hunt with right-hand ARs learn quickly to hate that dang forward assist, as it makes slinged carry of the gun so uncomfortable as to be practically impossible. Sure, ejecting cases no longer whizzing by my face is a nice perk, but moving the protruding forward assist and brass deflector to the other side of the receiver so they don’t dig furrows a little deeper into my spine with every step is one of the largest benefits to a left-hand AR that I’ve come across.

The leftie Protector is built on a standard, right-hand lower receiver, with the right-side magazine release button and left-side bolt release levers in their customary locations. While it would have been nice to see Wilson Combat go the full mile by also utilizing a dedicated left-hand lower on this rifle—which are rare but do exist—to be honest, this is the control scheme that the majority of left-handed AR shooters will be most familiar with anyway. Functionality for southpaws is added by way of bilateral, 90-degree safety selectors on the lower to go with the upper’s Bullet Proof Ambidextrous Charging Handle. I install Magpul B.A.D. Levers on all of my ARs, regardless of which direction their ejection ports are pointed—to give me easy access to the bolt release without the need to abandon my shooting grip—so I’d personally just throw one of those onto the Protector and consider it optimized.

Although a pistol version of the direct-impingement Protector is also offered, the gun I shot on my hog hunt (and the sample used in subsequent testing) was a carbine with a 16.25″ stainless steel barrel and a mid-length gas system. Attached to the muzzle via 5/8×24 TPI threading is a Wilson Combat Q-Comp muzzle brake. The aluminum free-floating handguard is a 12.6″-long octagonal unit with a full-length Picatinny rail at the 12-o’clock position and at least five M-Lok-compatible slots on each of the seven remaining sides; standard with the Protector are a 4″ accessory rail and a QD sling mount for use with the handguard.

Completing the gun’s furniture are a Rogers Super-Stoc buttstock, attached to the lower by way of a carbine-length receiver extension, and a BCM pistol grip bearing Wilson Combat’s distinctive starburst pattern. The former is capable of being adjusted to six length-of-pull settings, with a cam lever that can be used to secure the stock in place once the desired length has been reached, as well as an integral sling loop and QD sling mount. The latter’s sunbeams each bear moderately coarse texturing that very effectively serves to anchor the rifle in the hand during use, without being at all painful, and a water-resistant storage compartment is housed within the grip’s toe.

The trigger included with the Protector carbine is the company’s M2 Tactical Trigger Unit, a two-stage trigger advertised to have a crisp break at between 4 lbs. and 4 lbs., 8 ozs. of pressure, and our sample tested at exactly the outside limit of that range. And I have to admit, the break is the kind of glass-rod crisp that shooters dream about, on par with aftermarket drop-in triggers that can cost up to $300 on their own. One 30-round magazine from D&H Tactical shipped with the gun, and although it was marked for use with .300 Blackout, it ran the .300 HAM’R without any objection.

Overall build quality of the rifle was superb; no tooling marks were apparent, and the Armor-Tuff finish appeared to have been evenly applied. The components used on this gun all fulfilled their functions admirably, but, in my opinion, the trigger and charging handle are worthy of special praise. I evaluate a lot of ARs, and I don’t recall ever working with a finer trigger in a straight-from-the-box rifle. And, as a lefty, the Bullet Proof charging handle is among the better ones that I’ve encountered—sized right to be easy to actuate with either hand while remaining unobtrusive. In all, I was not at all disappointed by the Protector Series AR—even in light of its premium price tag—and as you’ll see below in a moment, there’s no compromise offered by its performance in the field or on the range either.

The Cartridge

Bill Wilson has been cooking up the .300 HAM’R for a long time—even long before he really became aware of it. As a consummate hunter who just so happened to also own his own AR-manufacturing company, he has harvested countless animals with the rifles, and maximizing the compact AR-15 platform’s ballistic potential in particular—against both beast and man—has always been a personal quest of his.

Much of his early AR hunting was conducted with the 6.8 mm SPC cartridge, but Bill has always been a “bigger bullets are better” kind of guy, and he quickly moved up to the .30 caliber for the heavier projectile weights it provides. He then dabbled briefly in the available options, the .300 Blackouts and .30 Rem. ARs of the world, before ultimately deciding to develop his own cartridge—one that would match the terminal performance of the legendary .30-30 Win. while retaining the .223 Rem./5.56 mm NATO AR-15’s standard bolt and the ample capacity made possible by its slender profile.

Wilson Combat offers 18 loads in .300 HAM’R, including (l. to r.): a 125-gr. Sierra Pro-Hunter; a 130-gr. Speer HAM’R Hot-Cor; and a 150-gr. Hornady SST. –

Wilson Combat had introduced the Kurt Buchert-designed 7.62×40 mm WT—a .30-cal. cartridge similarly designed for compatibility with .223 AR parts—back in 2011, and Bill’s project (tentatively dubbed “.30-30AR”) began there. The 7.62×40 mm WT is a .223 Rem. necked-up to use 0.308″ bullets that maintains a Cartridge Overall Length (C.O.L.) that permitted its use within AR-15-size magazines and actions, and while Bill liked much that it had to offer, he wanted his cartridge to boast a greater powder capacity and correspondingly faster velocities.

He accomplished this by lengthening the throat—and the case in general—slightly, decreasing the rate of the case’s taper and adjusting the angle of the neck to 30 degrees, changes that not only increased case volume, but also lowered operating pressures. The resulting cartridge bears a maximum C.O.L. of 2.26″ and a case head measuring 0.378″ in diameter, figures that are both identical to those of the .223 Rem., with a maximum average pressure of 57,500 p.s.i.—relatively close to .223’s 55,000 p.s.i. specification. And the case’s narrow diameter, measuring 0.3759″ at its widest point (just forward of the extractor groove), allows .300 HAM’R cartridges to stagger comfortably within a typical double-stack AR-15 magazine with no decrease in capacity relative to .223 Rem. Compatible with standard .223 AR parts after a simple barrel change? Check.

Rigorous testing using numerous propellants and barrel twist rates determined that the best velocity and accuracy results were produced by Hodgdon’s Cfe Blk powder and a 1:15″ twist rate, respectively. Wilson Combat asserts that the end result not only reaches .30-30 Win. performance but eclipses it—a claim we will put to the test shortly. The .30-30AR moniker was eventually dropped when Bill’s son Ryan recommended the use of “.300 HAM’R,” as Wilson Combat had already previously introduced the .458 HAM’R, and had trademarked the suffix at that time.

The cartridge launched in 2018, and is now an option in any of Wilson Combat’s AR-15-size models. In 2019, SIG Sauer sponsored .300 HAM’R for induction into the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers’ Institute—the organization that creates industry standards to ensure the safety, reliability and interchangeability of firearms, ammunition and components—and in early 2020 the cartridge was officially accepted and its specifications were published.

Bill’s original .300 HAM’R load used a 125-gr. Sierra projectile, but the Wilson Combat website presently lists 20 ammunition options (18 loaded by the company itself and two by HSM) topped with bullets ranging from 95 to 150 grs. in weight—a number of the lighter of which could make for potent manstoppers, in addition to the heavier hunting options. Velocities obviously vary greatly depending on the weight of the projectile, but according to the figures provided by Wilson Combat, the muzzle energy of the various loads hovers between 1,650 and 1,820 ft.-lbs. through an 18″ barrel. According to Bill, 18″ is probably optimal for .300 HAM’R, but a 16″-barreled gun still provides plenty of performance out to several hundred yards for the taking of game up to the size of bull elk and the largest plains game that Africa has to offer.

Using a southpaw Protector Series AR and Wilson Combat’s 150-gr. Hornady SST-topped .300 HAM’R load, the author dropped this 224-lb. hog dead in its tracks from about 50 yds.

The Results

Bill Wilson is more than willing to trot the globe in search of exotic quarry; since completion of .300 HAM’R, he has used the cartridge to down everything from whitetail deer and elk to oryx, hyena and kudu. But he has a special love for hunting hogs—and he doesn’t even have to leave his own property in order to do so. Having completed the heavy lifting of building a company from the ground up and founding the IDPA decades ago, he now works mostly from the confines of his ranch in rural northeast Texas, stepping outside to hunt whenever the mood strikes him—which is frequently. In his own words, he “only hunts hogs on days that end in ‘y,’” and while that might be a slight exaggeration, I can assure you, it’s not by much.

Whenever possible, I try to complete function and accuracy testing of a gun prior to its use in the field, but that’s not always feasible, and so it was that I found myself in early March taking my first shots through the .300 HAM’R Protector during some familiarization firing prior to that night’s hunt. For the following three days and nights, two other hunters and I crisscrossed Bill’s property countless times in search of pigs, our magazines filled with Wilson Combat’s 150-gr. Hornady SST-topped load, and our rifles equipped with the company’s .30-cal. Whisper suppressor. Examples from both Pulsar’s Trail and Thermion lines of thermal-imaging riflescopes were employed once the sun went down.

In all, the group shot nine large boars, and I personally accounted for three—two at night and one during the day—taking more than 650 lbs. of Texas’ hog problem out of commission. The largest of mine was a disgusting 224-lb. bruiser so flea-ridden that even the other pigs wanted nothing to do with him. Shots ranged from about 30 to 150 yds. in mostly thickly forested terrain, and while we didn’t take the time to retrieve any bullets, the cartridge proved to be more than up to the task of quickly anchoring the hearty beasts. No animals were lost, the majority were one-shot kills, and .300 HAM’R dropped more than one in its tracks. We also shot the carbines on Bill’s private long-range course, and even out at 500 yds. the HAM’R was still whacking the steel with authority, the guns consistently putting accurate shots on target.

Back home on the range, shooting three Wilson Combat loads (including the one used to great effect on the pigs), the .300 HAM’R-chambered Protector proved itself to be highly accurate and 100 percent reliable. In the field we hunted with our scopes set on 6X, so this was the magnification I used during testing as well—in order to get a true sense of its practical accuracy. Using five-shot groups, the 130-gr. Speer HAM’R Hot-Cor produced the best five-group average at 100 yds. (1.14″), while the 125-gr. Sierra Pro-Hunter turned in the single tightest group of the day, a 0.38″ beaut of a one-hole cluster. These results are far better than would be required in either a defensive or a short-to-medium-range hunting role.

Chronographing the three loads revealed that they lost very little velocity (roughly 40 f.p.s.) through a 16.25″ barrel relative to the 18″ numbers posted on their boxes, and still averaged about 1,735 ft.-lbs. of energy 15 ft. from the muzzle. That is an exemplary amount of firepower for the AR-15 platform—even more so from a handy carbine—surpassed only by big-bore “Thumper” cartridges capable of far lower capacities than is the .300 HAM’R. But does it rise to the level of the good ole’ .30-30 Win., as was the project’s goal?

People get real ornery when you compare something new and unknown with something old and cherished, and a lot of people shot their first deer with a .30-30 Win., so the cartridge has no shortage of nostalgic devotees. Sorry guys, prepare to be vexed—because through barrels of equal length, the .300 HAM’R did, indeed, produce higher energies than did two of the three .30-30 loads that I chronographed. Using a Marlin 336 Dark, Hornady’s 160-gr. LEVERevolution ammunition did best the .300 HAM’R with an average result of 1,795 ft.-lbs. of energy at 15 ft. from the muzzle, but both Federal’s 150-gr. Power-Shoks and Winchester’s 170-gr. Power-Points generated considerably less energy (1,670 ft.-lbs. and 1,552 ft.-lbs., respectively) at that distance. And, of course, the AR platform’s use of a detachable box magazine allows the .300 HAM’R to take safe advantage of spitzer-point projectiles with higher ballistic coefficients and flatter trajectories than nearly any .30-30 loads can muster.

On the range, recoil of the .300 HAM’R is ever so slightly more than that of a .300 Blackout, and is probably most comparable to 350 Legend. It nowhere near approaches a level where it might impair your ability to get off a clean shot. In the field, benefiting from the recoil-attenuating attributes of a suppressor, recoil was inconsequential and off-hand follow-up shots were immediate.

No single gun may be the ne plus ultra for all scenarios, but the Wilson Combat Protector Series AR carbine chambered in .300 HAM’R is a fine choice for a great many of them—from home defense to the taking of all North American game. And that goes for left-handed shooters too, as while the AR pattern in its stock, mil-spec configuration may not be set up particularly well for lefties, the southpaw Protector puts everything where it needs to be.

The only restricting factor to this setup is that, up to this point, Wilson Combat has essentially been the only source for .300 HAM’R ammunition and rifle components, a reality that has greatly limited their availability—but it looks like those days are over. Shaw Barrels recently announced that it has begun offering barrels, complete uppers and finished rifles chambered for the cartridge, and I know of at least one of the major ammunition makers that is currently working up loads. Here’s hoping its recent adoption by SAAMI helps the cartridge continue to gather momentum with manufacturers and consumers alike, because it’s an impressive chambering that—between its formidable terminal performance and ample capacity—comes as close to maximizing the AR-15’s total onboard firepower as anything developed to date.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/02/10/gun-test-wilson-combat-southpaw-protector-series-ar-in-300-hamr/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjXv_ib_7P9AhXkFlkFHUDaBH04PBAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw0RvG6b4-0rEk0H0ezcbjbD,2021-02-10
Gun Test: FN 509 LS Edge Pistol,"By Jay Grazio, Shooting Illustrated

What’s the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the name of the company FN America? Well, for some, it’s the FN FAL. Others might think of the M249 SAW. Perhaps you’re a science-fiction fan and the futuristic P90 is what jumps out at you, with its top-mounted, sideways-loading magazine. For handguns, purists will point out that Fabrique Nationale is engraved on the slides of countless Hi Powers, but for the bulk of folks, that will indelibly be linked to Browning, for obvious, albeit not entirely correct reasons. Point is, when it comes to handguns, FN is probably not the first company that comes to mind.

FN’s 509 LS Edge offers something for pretty much everyone in the shooting community.

And that’s a shame, because the company makes a number of really excellent handguns. The FN 509 series, reviewed by our Handgun Editor, Tamara Keel, when it debuted in 2017 after consideration in the U.S. Army’s XM17 Modular Handgun System solicitation, was lauded for its thoughtful upgrades from the already-pretty-excellent FNS series of handguns. Walking back even further, the FNX line offered a polymer-frame, hammer-fired pistol in either 9 mm or .45 ACP. A relative newcomer to the line is the FN 503, a super-small, subcompact, single-stack 9 mm clearly aimed directly at the concealed-carry market rather than military or law enforcement, a decidedly new venue for FN. And, there’s the Five-seveN in, of course, 5.7×28 mm, which until recently had been overlooked owing to the scarcity of ammunition, but was enjoying a renaissance of sorts thanks to firearms in that caliber offered by CMMG and Ruger. Of course, 5.7 ammo, like all ammo, is scarce these days, but I digress.

A quick glance at the FN website page for pistols clearly shows which line the company is investing its R&D dollars in, however. A lone FN 503 exists. Two Five-seveNs are there, but they’re identical save for the color of the polymer. Four FNX variants can be found, three of which are in .45 ACP. And then, there’s the FN 509 series. Counting different frame-color variants, there are 14 different flavors of FN 509 including the new LS Edge. Everything from subcompact to long-slide sizes are available, covering diverse uses from concealed carry to duty, and now competitive shooting. With more and more manufacturers introducing striker-fired, optics-ready pistols geared for the competitive-shooting market, it’s a pretty savvy move for FN to be offering the 509 LS Edge at this time.

Whether racing against the clock or a competitor, the FN 509 LS Edge gives any shooter a serious advantage • Flared for rapid reloading duties, the magazine well is positively cavernous • Dramatic as well as functional, slide cuts speed up cycling and reduce overall weight • MMA fighter and U.S. Army Ranger Tim Kennedy worked with FN to develop the LS Edge for competitive shooting duties • Magazines are custom-built and require the extended magazine well to seat properly, so standard 509 mags won’t work • A plethora of red-dot options is possible with FN’s MRD system for mounting an optic.

–

I’ll admit something here. Aside from friendly bowling-pin shoots, club-level steel challenge shoots and intermittent writer-based events, I’ve not had a lot of chances to shoot competitively. Part of this stems from, well, my handgun shooting, which ranges from mediocre on a good day to what has been described as “minute-of-berm” on a bad one. Mostly, though, it’s been a time-and-resources thing—it takes a lot of both to truly excel in competitive shooting. Now, I’m friends with a number of people who actually do compete, some rather seriously, and from what I’ve seen and heard, there are some universal components for a competitive pistol. FN’s 509 LS Edge hits a great many of these points, and offers something for near-everyone in the shooting world.

Starting at the muzzle, the first indication this isn’t a standard duty gun is the 5-inch barrel. Sure, Government model 1911s have had a 5-inch barrel for more than a century, but in the realm of polymer-frame, striker fired guns, even full-size offerings don’t run that long. The Glock G17 has a 4.5-inch barrel, the Smith & Wesson M&P is 4.25 inches and SIG Sauer’s P320 comes in at 4.7 inches. However, all three of these manufacturers offer a specialty version intended for competitive shooting—all of which have barrel lengths at or in excess of 5 inches. Lightening cuts? Oh, the FN 509 LS Edge has those aplenty, with dramatic angled cuts that showcase the target-crowned barrel.

When asked about the challenges that needed to be overcome in designing a competitive pistol, with a longer barrel, FN’s pistol product manager, Tom Victa, had this to say: “Everything is a balance in handgun design. We wanted to make a gun that still had the reliability and durability of the 509s but with the longer length and better visual ‘counter appeal.’ The slide, barrel and recoil spring had to be balanced in weight and geometry to optimize for the naturally longer, and thus heavier, barrel so we could still get great performance through all duty and training ammo.”

On the frame, FN has opted for a multi-textured grip surface for best purchase in a wide variety of conditions. Fine texturing on the sides is aggressive, while the frontstrap and backstrap wear geometric designs engineered to anchor the pistol firmly, reducing split times and limiting shot-to-shot variability. Controls are generously sized, with the slide-stop ambidextrous and the takedown lever on the left side only (sorry, southpaws, the FN509 LS Edge is decidedly right-handed), and the magazine well is flared to facilitate rapid reloading. The magazine-release button is oversize and darn near impossible to miss, and while it protrudes a fair amount from the grip, it requires a good deal of pressure to drop the magazine. Now, that doesn’t mean it’s difficult, just that you’ll need to press with authority rather than a brushing glance. Lastly, there’s plenty of real estate for both mitts with room to spare, and enough room so you don’t find yourself inadvertently activating things.

Two backstraps help fit the FN 509 LS Edge to the shooter’s hand • The rear sight is a black notch with a serrated face, while up front sits a suppressor-height, green-fiber-optic pipe • Excellent ergonomics help anchor the LS Edge in the hand, making for rapid presentation, solid shot placement and fast follow-up shots • Should you wish to change red-dot sights, a wide variety of options are possible with FN’s comprehensive MRD optics-mounting system.

Onto the trigger, which is a radical departure for both the 509 series and FN in general. Like the new FN 503, it’s a bladed-safety design rather than the traditional hinged trigger we’ve seen so far on the 509 series, but unlike the 503, the trigger on the FN 509 LS Edge is flat-faced, breaking at 90 degrees. There’s a slight—3/8 inch, I measured—take-up, then a clear stop at which the trigger breaks cleanly. I measured 6 pounds, 5 ounces on the Lyman trigger-pull gauge we have in the office, but I would have sworn it was lighter. The trigger guard is generous and followed by the obligatory section of rail as we head toward the muzzle, ideal for mounting a light or laser should this be a home-defense choice.

On top of the slide is FN’s MRD optics setup, which appears complicated at first, but is ingenious once you get into it. Four plates and three inserts offer fits for a wide variety of red-dot sights, with a quick-reference guide to help sort things out. FN also provides the appropriate screws for sights, which is super convenient if you’ve ever gone to mount an optic and found that screws were provided…separately. Screw types are even shown actual size on the printed guide, so you can compare to be certain you’re using the correct set. Knowing you have the right screw with the right thread pitch and correct depth is a huge plus when mounting an optic—all you need to do is properly torque the screws (proper spec is even included on the handy reference chart) and you’re off and running.

Red-dot sights are now commonly found on pistols for competition and defense • Flat-faced and with a bladed safety, the trigger proved consistent and crisp • Check the manual for the correct assortment of plates and inserts.

All of this is great if you’re a competitive shooter. The FN 509 LS Edge is designed to shoot fast and accurately, and that’s the cornerstone of a winning platform. The longer barrel wrings more velocity out of your ammo, the lightened slide helps cycle quickly, the trigger is consistent and easily managed; all of these factors reward the accomplished competitive shooter. However, what does it mean for the non-competitive shooter? Why would someone who doesn’t compete consider the FN 509 LS Edge? Excellent questions, of course, and ones we’ve covered previously with other firearms that have competitive-shooting origins. In a nutshell, pretty much every upgrade in the LS Edge that makes it a solid choice for competition makes it a good choice for self-defense, too. Run any number of defensive drills, and you’ll find that the ability to get back on target faster will help. Ditto a consistent trigger.

Even if the LS Edge does prove to be just a little too large to carry, it’s still an exceptional option as a home-defense pistol. The ample accessory rail allows a light, laser or both to be attached, and a wide variety of red-dot options can serve well for easier aiming. Don’t automatically assume you can’t carry the LS Edge, though; FN is working with several high-quality holster manufacturers to have models available for competition, duty and concealed carry. Holsters designed specifically for the FN 509 LS Edge are already available from ANR Holsters through FN on the latter company’s website.

On the range, though, is where the LS Edge really shines, as you’d expect. Accuracy was excellent, befitting a pistol with a match-grade barrel and a tuned trigger. However, that’s not even the biggest story here. Because the LS Edge is designed to compete, I ran a handful of drills after performing the standard accuracy and velocity readings, and quite frankly, it was eye-opening. Running Richard Mann’s 45 Drill (five rounds in a 5-inch target in 5 seconds from 5 yards), I routinely cleaned each drill, and shaved nearly a full second off my time by the end of my range session (down to a blistering 3.06 seconds, if I may brag for a moment). Switching things up to the FAST (see our “Handguns” column on page 32), I managed to complete it in slightly less than 7 seconds—although I have to admit to “cheating” per our Handgun Editor because I was running it from low ready rather than concealment (because I don’t yet have a holster for it). The bottom line here, plain and simple, is that if a rank amateur like me can run these drills clean with a new-to-him firearm, it’s spot-on.



Also, and this is a pretty significant note, I ran about 300 rounds through the FN 509 LS Edge in the span of roughly 90 minutes. As I put the LS Edge back into its case, I had a strange realization: My hands felt fine. My trigger finger wasn’t aching. My strong-hand thumb wasn’t rubbed raw. Running the LS Edge hard was easy, and didn’t require gloves, grip tape or any supplemental enhancements. There has clearly been a ton of work into the ergonomics of the LS Edge, and it shows.

So, what’s the final verdict on the new FN 509 LS Edge? If you compete in a discipline that allows striker-fired, red-dot-capable handguns, it is definitely worth checking out. If you’re searching for a home-defense handgun you can practice with frequently, it’ll do that with aplomb, too. Looking for a concealed-carry pistol with which you can regularly train? Yep, you got it, the LS Edge is certainly capable here. What if you want to do all three? Well, as you’ve probably guessed, yes, the new FN 509 LS Edge can excel in competition, home-defense and concealed-carry duties.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/04/07/gun-test-fn-509-ls-edge-pistol/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiC6P2d_7P9AhWERTABHb9vCFU4WhAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw1k37o8iqVIjdYmA5Q9BSAv,2021-04-07
Gun Test: IWI Tavor TS12,"Utilizing a bullpup configuration, a magazine that consists of a trio of rotating tubes nestled under the barrel and the extensive use of polymer in its construction, the TS12 is a paragon of outside-the-box thinking in a firearm segment that usually trends toward the traditional. But don’t let the TS12’s unorthodox aesthetics fool you; this is a serious shotgun that offers several advantages compared to conventional designs.

Thanks to the orientation of the TS12’s tri-tube magazine design, and loading ports on each side of the receiver, those tubes not aligned with the barrel can be easily topped-off by the shooter. –

The IWI TS12 is a semi-automatic 12-ga. shotgun with a 3″ chamber that operates via a short-stroke gas piston. The piston has two settings that control the amount of gas that is siphoned off each shot to operate the action: “L” for light shotgun loads and “H” for heavier ones. Holes on either side of the receiver allow the gas piston to be adjusted in only seconds.

Bullpups are firearms configured with the action located behind the trigger group in the space normally reserved solely for the buttstock. Relative to a standard design, this setup produces a much shorter gun overall while allowing for a conventional barrel length. As such, the TS12 takes advantage of an 18.5″ barrel, yet in a package that measures just 28″ in total length—7″ to 10″ shorter than most tactical shotguns. The unloaded weight is a reasonable 9 lbs., 2 ozs., and the gun possesses a very butt-heavy balance.

Another advantage of the TS12 is in the amount of ammunition it carries—a frequent criticism levied at shotguns—as the IWI feeds from three five-round (2¾”) magazine tubes for a total topped-off capacity of 16 shells. Switching from tube to tube is easy thanks to a large activation paddle set forward of the trigger within the trigger guard that unlocks the magazine assembly so that it can rotate.

The textured tubes can be moved in either direction around the longitudinal axis of the shotgun, and a loading port on each side of the receiver allows the two magazines not currently in use to be filled back to capacity. For right-handed users, our advice is to rotate the cylinder counterclockwise so as to expose an empty tube to the left side of the shotgun for more convenient recharging with the off hand (clockwise for southpaws).

The TS12 comes from IWI configured for right-side ejection with a left-side charging handle (l.), but it can be converted for left-handed use by the factory. The gun’s two-setting gas piston (r.) can be quickly adjusted via a slot on either side of the fore-end. –

In its standard configuration, the TS12 ejects through a right-side port and makes use of a left-side charging handle. The shotgun can be converted for left-side ejection, however, the company recommends that the firearm be shipped back to IWI US for conversion. The TS12 features a 13″ Picatinny rail screwed to the top of its receiver, and the shotgun is set up ergonomically to utilize AR-height optics atop this rail. No sights come with the shotgun, and it would have been nice to at least have a set of basic pop-up irons ship with the gun so that it is ready to go straight out of the box.

IWI has incorporated a shell-release button into each side of the receiver, just to the rear of the loading ports, which allows the user to manually eject a shell from the corresponding magazine. Tactically speaking, this would allow for a specific type of ammunition to be loaded, and its placement at the rear of the tube ensures that it is the next shell to chamber once the proper tube is rotated back into position. These buttons also allow the shotgun to be emptied without the need to manually cycle the action up to 15 times.

The TS12’s safety is a crossbolt design easily manipulated with the trigger finger, and a bolt-release button is located just below the ejection port on the right side of the receiver. Additional features include M-Lok-compatible slots on each side of the fore-end, four QD sling cups (two at the shotgun’s butt and two just to the rear of the charging handle) and internal muzzle threads compatible with Beretta/Benelli MobilChoke-style tubes—improved cylinder and modified chokes come with the gun.

Bullpups in general are notorious for poor triggers because of the long linkage required between the trigger proper and the sear. And while the trigger on our test TS12 wasn’t great, we’ve also encountered far worse. After about 1/8″ of take-up, and a moderate amount of creep, the trigger broke on average at 11 lbs., 9 ozs., of pressure. While this would be unacceptable in a precision firearm, we found it to be quite passable on a tactical scattergun.

Early reports seemed to indicate that the TS12 was finicky with lighter 12-ga. loads, but that was not evident in the sample we received for this evaluation. A total of 400 rounds were sent downrange—a mix of birdshot, 2¾” buckshot, slugs and 3″ magnum buckshot—and the shotgun experienced no stoppages regardless of load. The TS12’s gas operation and well-designed ergonomics, including a wide rubber recoil pad, did help to manage its kick a bit, but 12-ga. recoil is stout nonetheless, and anyone suggesting otherwise should be scrutinized. For pattern testing, Remington’s 21-pellet Ultimate Defense No. 4 buckshot was used, and at 25 yds., the shotgun’s cylinder-bore barrel generated tight, well-centered patterns that averaged between 10″ to 12″ in diameter—results pretty much perfect for close-quarters defensive use.

Bullpup-style firearms have always generated strong opinions both for and against, but traditionalists shouldn’t let the IWI Tavor TS12’s unorthodox appearance dissuade them from considering what our testing has revealed to be a reliable and potent short-range tool. The shotgun makes good use of the inherent advantages of the bullpup layout, and—thanks to its rotating magazine design—offers far greater capacity than its compact size would imply.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/04/15/gun-test-iwi-tavor-ts12/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiR_q6Z_7P9AhVCFlkFHTTaDjc4FBAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw3Jsi2KHnDxziohIMLPPpWR,2021-04-15
Worse Gun Control Than The European Union Here In The USA? Yes According To David Chipman,"It was no secret President Joe Biden’s nominee to direct the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, David Chipman, supports a ban on commonly-owned semiautomatic firearms like the AR-15 and wants to force current “assault weapons” owners to register their firearms with the federal government through the National Firearms Act or forfeit their guns. After all, Chipman has worked as a paid gun control advocate for both Giffords (formerly Americans for Responsible Solutions and Legal Community Against Violence) and civilian disarmament financier Michael Bloomberg’s Mayors Against Illegal Guns. However, an exchange during the anti-gun fanatic’s May 26 Senate confirmation hearing broke new ground for American anti-gun extremism by revealing the outrageous range of rifles Chipman would ban.

At the hearing, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) asked the nominee, “Mr. Chipman you have called for an assault weapon ban. I have a simple question for you. What is an assault weapon?” After some evasion from Chipman, Sen. Cotton reiterated his question, which resulted in the following exchange.

Sen. Cotton: What is an assault weapon? How would you define it if you were the chair, the head of the ATF, how have you defined it over the last several years in your role as a gun control advocate?

Chipman: Senator, um if I’m confirmed as ATF director um you know my recollection is the only um process by which ATF has weighed in is I know there’s a demand letter three program which requires multiple reports, multiple sale reports on the southwestern border. ATF in that program has ATF in that program has defined an assault rifle as any semi-automatic rifle capable of accepting a detachable magazine above the caliber of .22…

For decades, gun control advocates have endorsed a feature test to determine what firearms are to be defined as “assault weapons.” Under this rubric, a semi-automatic firearm must be capable of accepting a detachable magazine and be equipped with one or more prohibited features in order to qualify as an “assault weapon.” Under the 1994 Clinton “assault weapons” ban, these features included items such as a pistol grip, bayonet mount, and adjustable stock.

Chipman’s answer endorses a wildly broader definition of “assault weapon” that would include any semiautomatic rifle above .22 caliber capable of accepting a detachable magazine, regardless of the rifle’s configuration.

Noting the nominee’s shocking answer, Sen. Cotton remarked, “I’m amazed that might be the definition of assault weapon that would basically cover every single modern sporting rifle in America today.”

Chipman’s favored definition and gun ban is more extreme than that proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). Under her latest “assault weapons” bill, a semiautomatic rifle would fall under the ban if it has the capability to accept a detachable magazine and one item from of a list of enumerated features. Such features include a pistol grip, telescoping stock, threaded barrel, or barrel shroud.

The nominee’s position is also more radical than the policies found in America’s most anti-gun jurisdictions.

New York City defines “assault weapon” to include “Any semiautomatic centerfire or rimfire rifle… which has one or more of the following features: 1. folding or telescoping stock or no stock; 2. pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon; 3. bayonet mount; 4. flash suppressor or threaded barrel designed to accommodate a flash suppressor; 5. barrel shroud; 6. grenade launcher…”

New Jersey defines “assault firearm” by listing specific models of firearms and including “Any firearm manufactured under any designation which is substantially identical to any of the firearms listed…”

California’s definition incorporates a list of firearms similar to that of New Jersey. The state code further defines “assault weapon” as “A semiautomatic, centerfire rifle that does not have a fixed magazine but has any one” of a list of enumerated features.

Chipman’s preferred definition of “assault weapon” and ban is even more extreme than the European Union’s.

The European Union sets the minimum gun control measures that its member states must adopt in what is called the European Firearms Directive. Following the November 13, 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, the EU expedited plans for new gun restrictions. The changes altered the minimum gun control threshold, with a ban on certain semi-automatic firearms.

Under the pre-2017 European regime, automatic firearms were considered “Category A – Prohibited firearms,” which civilians were generally prohibited from possessing. Whereas, semi-automatic firearms were considered “Category B – Firearms subject to authorization,” which civilians were permitted to possess subject to government permission.

The final version of the revised European Firearms Directive moved certain semi-automatic firearms into Category A. These firearms included,

(b) long firearms which allow the firing of more than 11 rounds without reloading, if:

(i) a loading device with a capacity exceeding 10 rounds is part of that firearm; or

(ii) a detachable loading device with a capacity exceeding 10 rounds is inserted into it.

Under this new regime, an individual is still permitted to have a semi-automatic firearm like the AR-15, as long as it is not equipped with a magazine with a capacity greater than 10 rounds. Chipman’s proposed definition and ban would target such firearms.

Even honest gun control advocates would blush if they stopped to consider some of the hunting rifles that would fall under a Chipman ban:

Benelli R1

Browning BAR Mark II

Browning BAR Mark III

FNAR Competition

Remington 740/742/7400/Model Four/750

Ruger Mini-14 Ranch Rifle

Sauer 303

Winchester Model 100

Given his outrageous history of working to ban firearms and undermine the Second Amendment, any senator expecting the support of the gun owning community must vote “no” on David Chipman’s nomination to lead ATF.

Gun Test: CZ 557 Eclipse,"Hunting rifles don’t have to be expensive in order to be effective, and CZ’s new 557 Eclipse is a great example of this. The company revamped its esteemed Model 557 by eliminating unnecessary frills to create a no-nonsense tool for the hunter that desires a high-end firearm but who, at the same time, wants to have money left over for taxidermy.

The Eclipse’s receiver starts life as a solid steel billet that is then CNC-machined into shape. This includes two integral 19 mm dovetails atop the rifle that allow CZ-style scope rings to be mounted directly to the receiver. Once finished, the action is mated to a 20.5″-long, cold-hammer-forged, chrome-moly steel barrel.

At launch, the Eclipse is available chambered in three cartridges: 6.5 mm Creedmoor, .308 Win. and .30-’06 Sprg. The muzzles on the .30-cal. guns are cut with a recessed crown, while the Creedmoor comes threaded 5/8×24 TPI for a muzzle device. As the barrel is lapped at the factory there is no need to break it in, saving the user the labor and associated ammunition costs. The barreled action is finished with a deep matte bluing that protects it from the elements and safe rash in-between seasons.

Despite CZ’s no-frills approach to the 557 Eclipse’s construction, it offers several thoughtful features—an adjustable trigger (inset), two sling swivel studs on the fore-end and a protected bolt release—that belie the more-than-reasonable suggested retail price. –

The rifle employs a rather simplistic push-feed mechanism, and this is a big reason for its overall affordability. The bolt is a two-lug design that offers a 90-degree throw, and it is plenty sturdy for the three chamberings offered. Rounds are fed from an internal five-round magazine that features a hinged floorplate to speed up the unloading process—just don’t forget about the one in the chamber. The floorplate is released via a push button that is unobtrusively located just forward of the trigger guard.

Although this rifle is designed to be economical, CZ did not skimp on the trigger. The Eclipse’s trigger is user-adjustable, and our test rifle had a pull-weight range of between 1 lb., 13 ozs. and 3 lbs., 12 ozs.—with accuracy testing for this review conducted at the lightest setting. In addition, it can be adjusted for pre-travel as well as overtravel. Other features include an American-style black synthetic stock with soft-touch texturing, unique polygonal checkering on the grip and fore-end areas, and an over-size rubber buttpad. As for functionality, the rifle includes a total of three sling studs—two fore and one aft—allowing both a two-point sling and a bipod to be employed simultaneously.

The CZ’s two-position safety rocks forward to the fire position, exposing a red dot on the bolt shroud (l.). Its receiver is CNC-machined with integral 19 mm dovetail bases for which a variety of factory and aftermarket rings are available (ctr.). A recessed muzzle crown on .30-cal. models serves to protect the rifling on the 557 Eclipse’s blued, chrome-moly steel barrel. (r.) –

Before hitting the range, we mounted a Riton X3 Primal riflescope using a pair of Warne Maxima rings. As the optic offers a 3-15X magnification range we felt it would be a good choice atop a .308 Win.-chambered Eclipse, as 15X is quite appropriate for accuracy testing, while 3X is realistic for many hunting scenarios inside of 200 yds. Ironically, the open upper hemisphere of the scope’s reticle gives it a distinctly European feel, while the European rifle itself feels perfectly American through its stock design and push-to-fire safety. For ammunition we selected loads with bullets weighing 150, 168 and 175 grs.

Our range day mimicked typical hunting conditions of the northeast with its 33° F ambient temperature. As we fired our formal accuracy test, we paid attention to any feeding issues that the gun experienced. The only time we seemed to have a problem was when we failed to seat the rounds as far back in the magazine as possible before pressing them down. Aside from that, the gun was a dream to shoot. The bolt cycled exceedingly smoothly, and recoil was more than manageable, even with the heavier bullets. We fired many near-minute-of-angle groups with all three types of ammunition—as well as one just inside of one m.o.a. with the Winchester USA Ready load. Aside from the rifle’s consistency, we found it to be superbly balanced when fired in the standing position, and it also lent itself well to both seated and prone shooting.

Disassembly of the CZ 557 Eclipse is about as simple as with any bolt-action, once you find the bolt release. In this case, it is covered by the bolt and can’t be accessed until it is retracted. We found this design to be exceptionally well thought out, as tucking it away protects it from getting snagged on other gear or brush. Once removed, full access to the bore is granted and no further disassembly is needed for a typical cleaning. If the rifle was exposed to excessive moisture the stock can be removed just by loosening the two action screws that hold everything together. Reassembly of the rifle is as simple as reversing these steps and torquing the screws down to 64 in.-lbs., which is slightly less than other 557 models due to this rifle’s plastic “bottom metal.”

We found our time with the CZ Eclipse 557 to be very enjoyable. The company’s goal with this gun was to offer a 557 at a lower price point, and we appreciated that it successfully did so without sacrificing quality or any important features.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/06/24/gun-test-cz-557-eclipse/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiC6P2d_7P9AhWERTABHb9vCFU4WhAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw3H-GQw7WdU-NxitK8xUCG5,2021-06-24
Gun Test: Smith & Wesson M&P 12,"By Daniel T. McElrath

When Smith & Wesson decided to build its first shotgun in 50 years, I’m guessing it took a hard look at the scattergun market, scouting for opportunity. Remington, the manufacturer of the vaunted 870 pump shotgun, was having trouble unrelated to that model, so that must’ve seemed auspicious. Even so, the really hot, burgeoning market niche seemed to be not mere pumps, but bullpup-configured pumps. They were innovative, they were exciting and they were offered by only a few small players in the U.S. gun business. It’s not unusual for a larger gun company to recognize the promise of a new design, then change it enough to overcome both problems and patents (if necessary), and introduce its own model backed by considerable marketing power. The Kel-Tec P-3AT leading to the Ruger LCP springs immediately to mind. (Kel-Tec didn’t patent the nested recoil springs crucial to the design, allegedly because Seecamp came up with them earlier.)

Not only can a large-scale manufacturer unveil a new firearm with great fanfare, the expected sales volume often allows it to introduce the gun at a consumer-friendly price point. In addition to being offered only by smaller manufacturers, some of which might even be labeled “boutique” gun- makers, some of the bullpups on or en route to the market were quite pricey.

New Tricks For An Old Dog

Before going into the nuts and bolts of Smith & Wesson’s offering, it might be good to explore exactly what is a bullpup long gun. A buttstock, whether on a rifle or shotgun, serves two very simple, basic functions: It provides a bridge between the receiver and shoulder against which to brace the gun, and offers a comb upon which the shooter rests his or her face. That accomplished, much of the buttstock was, for a time, wasted real estate (if you didn’t consider it a last-ditch impact weapon). Soon, though, some were drilled out to create onboard storage space for maintenance items and small spare parts. Successful designs ranging from the Spencer carbine of the Civil War era to the Remington Nylon 66 of 1959 through the 1980s, routed the magazine through the buttstock. Competitive shooters sometimes inserted a wedge of lead in the stock to add weight to the gun and dampen felt recoil. Still, other builders recognized that with the two aforementioned functions satisfied, there was no reason for the rest of the buttstock and so skeletonized them. The bullpup design came about 150 or so years ago when someone realized you could move the very action itself back into the buttstock (or, at least the wrist), thereby shortening the gun without having to shorten the barrel.

And, that is the major advantage of the design: compactness. The disadvantage of the design is that detonation of the cartridge/shotshell takes place right next to the shooter’s face. Though it really isn’t an issue with modern steel and safety-forward design, it can still be a little unnerving. Some would add aesthetics (or the lack thereof) as a disadvantage, too, but the graceful lines of the commercially successful Steyr AUG largely put that to rest—at least for rifles.

Mossberg made the most notable early, large-scale foray into bullpup shotguns in the 1980s, with bullpup variants of its Models 500 and 590. Some of today’s models, though, offer a second selling point: high firepower.

In addition to being bullpup designs, a few of the new shotguns on the market feature two magazine tubes, thereby doubling the firepower of single-magazine shotguns, whether of bullpup or conventional design. Competition shotguns today often have ungainly, extended magazine tubes and even they can’t match the capacity of a shotgun like the Smith & Wesson M&P 12. Springfield, MA’s (well, until the company moves to Tennessee in 2023) new scattergun has a magazine capacity of 14, 23⁄4-inch shotshells, or 12, 3-inch magnum shotshells, or 20, 13⁄4-inch mini-shotshells. In all instances, you can also chamber an additional round to add even more capacity while keeping the tubes full.

The loading port is beneath the buttstock and the gun is much simpler to load than reputed • Incorporated into the front of the trigger guard, the slide release is easy to locate and actuate • A slim loaded-chamber indicator emerges from the topstrap, giving visual and tactile indication of the gun’s readiness • The vertical foregrip is detachable and the M&P 12 functions fine without it • Threaded for the RemChoke system, the barrel will accept a variety of choke tubes • Loading-assist buttons aid in both loading and unloading the new shotgun.

Feature Rich

A bullpup configuration and enhanced capacity are but two of the attributes the M&P 12 brings to the table. Coming late to the game provided Smith & Wesson a view of the field. In addition to its brand appeal and marketing resources, it possessed the R&D capital to incorporate feature after feature to overwhelm the competition with a matchless, comprehensive host of useful design elements.

The M&P 12 comes with a foam-lined, plastic hard case. It’s not great (the latches tend to pop off), but way better than a cardboard box. Besides, one doesn’t perform an oral inspection of the freely given equine.

The initial visual impression made by the shotgun is admittedly mixed. It looks “plasticky.” The fore-end, vertical fore-grip, pistol grip and the lower receiver are polymer, and that does dominate one’s first impression. Also, the inherent play in the fore-end of a pump makes the gun seem loose. Adding to the aesthetic challenges presented by the M&P 12 is the unavoidable fact that, as a bullpup shotgun, it’s just odd looking. Bullpup shotguns, despite designers’ best efforts, simply lack a certain visual grace.

Hefting the gun doesn’t help matters. That much plastic saves weight, right? Guess again. The steel receiver and barrel, as well as the metallic barrel shroud, loading port and comb make for a heavy gun—compact, yes, but heavy.

First impressions around the office were consistent: People either scowled or winced at the appearance, yet nodded approvingly as the various features were identified. As they are many, let’s begin at the muzzle and go through them.

The M&P 12 has a threaded muzzle and is compatible with RemChoke tubes. It comes with both Cylinder Bore and Improved Cylinder tubes. It’s good to have options.

The fore-end itself has a scalloped, wave-like pattern that, in addition to offering excellent purchase as you rack the slide, is likely the prettiest part of the gun. Attached to it is the removable, vertical fore-grip.

There’s a barrel shroud with M-Lok slots for affixing accessories. Atop that is a Picatinny rail. The shotgun comes without sights but, given the rail, readily accepts irons or a red dot of the end-user’s choosing.

Four different palm-swell backstrap inserts allow you to custom fit the pistol grip to your hand • The dual-position safety selector is positioned and operates like that on an AR-15.

–

A crossbolt magazine selector button lets you choose which magazine to feed from. It’s large, and functions positively (for the most part).

Incorporated into the front of the trigger guard is the slide-release latch. Press down on the ledge of the latch with your trigger finger or the side or forefinger of your support hand and you are free to cycle the action without pulling the trigger.

The M&P pistol grip, in addition to being ergonomic and well-textured, has three additional palm-swell inserts so you can customize the fit to your hand.

Just as the pistol grip offers familiarity in this radically different-looking gun, the ambidextrous safety selector, similar to that of the AR-15, lends instant comfort and competence to anyone used to operating “America’s rifle.”

Above and behind the pistol grip, on either side of the action, are two loading-assist levers, one for each magazine. Partially compress one, and its respective magazine becomes easier to load. Fully compress it, though, and the magazine promptly disgorges its contents.

Atop the rear of the receiver a protrusion emerges from a slot when a round is chambered, serving as both a visual and tactile loaded-chamber indicator. The buttstock also includes a base for a QD sling.

M-Lok slots in the barrel shroud allow installation of accessories • A crossbolt magazine selector button is easy to locate under stress • While the buttpad stays on the shoulder, it does little to dissipate recoil • The top rail offers plenty of space for mounting any type of sighting device.

Shooting And Handling Impressions

I mounted an EOTech holographic sight on the M&P 12. It made a nice combination and, by sheer luck, was centered just as I installed it, no adjustments needed.

I have heard several people complain about the difficulty loading the gun. They had to be kidding. I figured it out in about 40 seconds. Don’t hold it upside down; turn it over, then rotate it so it’s almost on its side. The shotshells fit in a little tray in the sidewalls of the loading port, not the top. Simply lay each shell on this tray and shove it forward with your thumb. I didn’t even need the loading-assist levers.

Shouldering the gun and cycling the action using the vertical foregrip makes you feel like the world’s most dangerous trombone player.

The feel of the gun in your hands, however, is “meh.” Short-but-heavy and brick-like, its weight is centered between your hands. You can swing it adequately, but there is a good deal of inertia to overcome for a gun this short.

I shot it with Federal Premium Force X2 Personal Defense 2 3⁄4-inch 00 buck, Remington 2 3⁄4-inch 00 buck, Winchester Double X 3-inch 00 buck and Aguila 12 Minishell 1 3⁄4-inch buckshot. Despite the weight, felt recoil was not as diminished as I’d have hoped. The butt of the gun is quite hard and the comb, surrounding and reinforcing the loading port as it does, is made of metal and not particularly comfortable. The vertical foregrip, though, can be used to minimize muzzle rise. The 2 3⁄4-inch loads were easily tolerable while the 3-inch shells weren’t (for long), but the Minishells were downright fun.

A lot of people have speculated that the dual magazines could allow the user to keep two different loads in the gun and select the appropriate one for the circumstances. For example, you could put less-lethal projectiles (bean bags?) on the left and standard buckshot on the right. Or you could put buckshot on one side for two-legged threats and 3-inch slugs on the other if you’re in big bear country. One advantage I haven’t heard pointed out is the usefulness of two magazines for couples or family members of disparate strength or skill levels. A petite woman (or smaller or older man) could select minishells for defense, yet with the press of a button, a larger, stronger individual could dial up the 2 3⁄4-inch 00 buck.

I’m one for aggressively handling firearms in general and pump shotguns in particular. When instructing new shooters, I stress they not fear the gun nor let in control them. In fact, I urge them to dominate the gun, holding it tightly and really leaning into it. This is particularly true with pump shotguns, where the potential to short-shuck exists. I work the slide like it owes me money and that approach worked well with the M&P 12.

There were no failures to feed or fire with the full-size shells and only one hang-up with the last round out of a magazine with the minishells. It was easily cleared. When one tube ran dry, you had only to look for the prominent magazine selector and push it to the other side, then rack the gun in order to resume firing. I was initially afraid the manual-of-arms would be confusing, but the secondary controls of the M&P are well-sized and readily apparent. You under-stand how to do everything you need to with just a few minutes of practice. One caveat, though: When you lay the M&P 12 on its side and that side happens to be the one the magazine-selector button is pressed for, the weight of the gun will collapse the button, pushing it up and to the other side. The gun will thus be set to operate from the other magazine. Oops.

Findings?

There is a considerable number of innovative features here, and most of them work just fine. Though it represents a radical departure for both manufacturer and customer base, the Smith & Wesson marque should go a long way to easing buyers’ doubts. Whether you’re a fan of bullpup shotguns or not, the configuration has an indisputable virtue in its compactness and the M&P 12 adds to that its eye-opening firepower. As long as a gun functions the way it’s supposed to and is safe to operate, it’s difficult to speak ill of it, and the M&P 12 is a strong case in point. Fifteen rounds of 12-gauge shotshells available to be quickly delivered from a compact and reliable platform? How can that be a bad thing?

Editor’s Note

As we were going to print with this issue, Smith & Wesson issued a recall on all M&P 12 shotguns manufactured prior to Oct. 15, 2021. An extremely rare, but potentially dangerous barrel failure prompted the decision. All M&P 12s manufactured after that date will sport newly designed barrels and won’t have this unlikely, but real safety concern. We did not run into any safety issues in our testing, and because of the lateness of the recall relative to our schedule, we elected to run the review with this note.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/12/03/gun-test-smith-wesson-mp-12/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiPs9uY_7P9AhVTF1kFHWylB6Q4ChAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw2tYsTCLVK5yiPH_mUTA7q5,2021-12-03
Gun Test: The NitroFire/FireStick System,"By John Zent, American Rifleman

Compared to other categories, technical advancement within the realm of muzzleloading is fairly modest, and when something noteworthy comes along, it is bound to create controversy within this small but ardent shooting sport. Critics will invariably pronounce anything too new or too different, “not a muzzleloader.”

In the case of the bold new Traditions NitroFire/Federal FireStick joint venture, there’s a semantic justification, at least, because the NitroFire rifle is designed with an open breech. That opening, sans breechplug, allows for insertion of the FireStick, a pre-charged, sealed capsule resembling a shotshell and containing Hodgdon’s Triple Eight blackpowder substitute. The bullet, however, true to age-old practice, is loaded from the front with a ramrod.

Oddly enough, that’s the same argument traditionalists raised when Tony Knight ushered in “modern muzzleloading” with his MK-85 rifle 36 years ago. We heard as much from one former American Hunter muzzleloader correspondent who, despite surging interest in Tony’s inline design, refused to write about the guns because they didn’t conform to his notion of what “blackpowder shooting is all about.”

Certainly everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but at the risk of missing the boat. Unlike our writer, a keen student of firearm history, a new breed was swiftly emerging, hunters whose desire for more time afield via special blackpowder seasons for deer, elk and other game involved little or no interest in reliving history. They just wanted reliable hunting rifles. What we learned then is that free-market demand shapes technical development—including what constitutes a muzzleloader in the 21st century.

The NitroFire/FireStick system makes muzzleloading as simple as (l. to r.): loading a saboted bullet into the barrel by way of the muzzle, loading the desired charge value of FireStick into the breech and then inserting a 209 shotgun primer.

A Hybrid Loader

The NitroFire rifle design springs from Traditions’ highly regarded Pursuit series. Imported from Spain, it is from the hinged/break-open, manual-hammer-cocking school that has dominated contemporary muzzleloading for two decades because there are fewer parts to clean or malfunction and because breech access, for priming and cleaning, is a snap. The Traditions’ hinge release is a handy button at the front of the trigger guard, its large size and location providing leverage to ease the opening of the action.

Breaking open the NitroFire muzzleloader is as easy as pressing the button at the front of its trigger guard. Note also that the exposed-hammer gun has a crossbolt safety. –

The NitroFire offers twin safeties, consisting of a cross-block trigger safety and an internal hammer-block safety, plus the proprietary Elite XT Trigger system, which incorporates a rebounding hammer and a captive half-cock that allows the action to be opened with the cross-bolt safety still engaged. Made in .50-cal. only, it comes with a 26″, 1:28″-twist, chrome-moly steel barrel that’s tapered and fluted for weight savings. An aluminum, T-handle ramrod is part of the package. All in, the rifle tips the scales at a trim 6 lbs., 9 ozs. With the lines of a modern hunting rifle, the NitroFire’s two-piece stock is offered in several camouflage treatments, as well as in basic black, all of which are complemented by a durable Cerakote Gray metal finish. Kit models with a factory-installed 3-9X 40 mm Traditions scope are also offered. For more NitroFire details and observations, see the hunting sidebar below.

The Federal-produced FireSticks are available in three color-coded charge levels—each featuring Hodgdon propellant—in packages of 15 each. The addition of a commonly available 209 shotgun primer readies the capsules for firing in Traditions’ NitroFire rifle. –

Propellant

Like shotshells, FireSticks are color-coded for instant recognition. Initial offerings, loaded exclusively with Hodgdon’s Triple Eight propellant and sold with 15 shots per package, were 100-grain orange and 120-grain maroon versions, and added recently was an 80-grain load in yellow. According to Federal, the molded hulls—2.89″ long by 0.59″ in diameter—were carefully designed to not fit or be fired in existing centerfire guns. They slip easily, but with a snug fit, into the NitroFire’s open breech. FireSticks bear their own headstamp and come with a modified roll crimp that secures a black plastic overwad. A pocket for 209 primers is molded into the base. Interestingly, there’s no flashhole, and apparently none is needed. As such, it’s a sealed container that is all but impervious to moisture.

In this system, the front-loaded bullet does not actually seat firmly on the powder charge. The NitroFire bore features a small annular shelf on which the bullet’s base (sabot) seats, a stop that uniformly positions the bullet shot after shot. The FireStick’s crimp seats on the opposite side of the ring, preventing actual contact. Though that slight gap contravenes traditional loading technique, Federal product developers assured us it was for good reason:

In the NitroFire/FireStick system, a small air gap separates the muzzleloaded projectile from the breech-loaded propellant capsule.

–

“Extensive testing was done on compressed loads versus slightly loose powder, and no difference was seen in the consistency of the ballistic response with this propellant. This lack of compression is by design, to balance manufacturability with reliability. Loose powder has a tendency to settle over time, which is why the black (end) disk is not sitting directly on the propellant. If it were, the disk would settle with the propellant over time (in transit, handling, etc.) and create an air gap between the crimp and disk, impacting the ability to seal out moisture. Instead, the disk sits on an internal shelf within the FireStick hull, which captures it securely between that and the crimp. This always ensures a tight seal. The flexibility to slightly vary the propellant charge gives us the ability to compensate if there is ever variation from one lot of propellant to the next.” Here’s what American Rifleman Managing Editor Christopher Olsen and I found during the course of testing the hybrid system on the range and on a deer hunt.

The NitroFire comes in several kit packages with a factory-installed 3-9X 40 mm Traditions riflescope set in rings attached to a section of mounting rail. Note the attached bilateral side hammer extension. –

Safety & Performance

Hunters will immediately note the safety advantage of the FireStick/NitroFire pairing. The propellant can be instantly and securely loaded—without tools, in the dark, in rain and wind, up in a treestand—and just as neatly unloaded without firing a bore-clearing shot and free from the effort, waste and mess of dumping one’s load in the woods or where you parked. You can now quit driving back to camp or home with powder and ball confined in the bore of the rifle behind your seat. While doing so is legal so long as the primer or cap is absent, and while that practice has not resulted in a spate of unintended discharges, many of us still find it cringeworthy. What’s more, the system eliminates accidental double-charges, and, if the user is ever in doubt, a visual check of the bore is simple.

Federal emphasizes the precision built into the FireSticks. Loaded in the same plant on the same machinery as the company’s vaunted cartridge ammunition, the inherent charge-volume consistency is an accuracy-control factor. We checked the contents of five each of the 100- and 120-grain charges and found that the company’s mass-production powder-charging operation can put some of us handloaders to shame. The extreme spread of the 100-grain charges was a paltry 0.05 of a grain and for the 120s, it was 0.1 of a grain. Indeed, a few errant particles may have been the only bar to perfection. When actually weighed on a scale, a sampling of 100-grain FireSticks averaged 59.9 grains of Triple Eight, while the 120-grain charges averaged 70.8 grains. Please note that disparities between volume and actual weight are common for substitute powders because the volume standard is based on original blackpowder.

Volumetric inspection proved to be tricky, since Triple Eight is formulated in granules that look like mini soda straws and which don’t compress as neatly as “flake” powders. The charges settle, though not evenly. But all that’s moot, since FireSticks spare users the chore of measuring or weighing their charges. We haven’t seen burning-rate data on the “soda-straw” propellants (the popular Blackhorn 209 is similar), but we know they produce higher velocities per volume than other loose-powder substitutes, and pelletized powders are even less efficient.

Chronograph testing proved the point, and muzzle velocities were even faster than we anticipated. Pushing Traditions’ 250-grain Smackdown Carnivore Ridgeback, a tipped projectile in a ridged sabot, the system averaged 2,013 f.p.s. with 100-grain FireSticks, and 2,230 f.p.s. with the 120-grain loadings. By comparison, pelletized 100-grain charges behind similar bullets typically generate 1,600 to 1,700 f.p.s., and a ballistics table at traditions.com shows the Carnivore 250 hitting 2,120 f.p.s. with 120 grains of Blackhorn 209. The result of the faster FireStick/Triple Eight loads is increased energy and flatter trajectory, though the latter is limited somewhat by the bullet’s relatively low ballistic coefficient.

In addition to testing the 270-grain Federal Trophy Copper with the 120-grain FireStick, we also tested Traditions’ 250-grain Smackdown Carnivore and PowerBelt’s 245-grain Copper Aerotip with the 100-grain FireStick charge. The accuracy results for each are tabulated nearby. Across the board, velocity data remained consistent, with relatively low standard deviation between shots. The sampled loads provided practical accuracy out of the NitroFire sufficient for big-game hunting, even at distance.

To test efficacy at distance with the Traditions Smackdown Carnivore and sabot, backed by a 120-grain FireStick charge and Federal Premium primers, we fired two five-shot groups on target. The first group, at the target’s top, was placed on target at a distance of 100 yards. We then moved the same target to the 200-yard mark for another string of fire. Five shots printed on the target roughly 8.5″ below the 100-yard point of impact, proving the gun’s effective point-blank range. It is important to note that one extreme flier was captured at 200 yards and discounted from the measured group due to shooter error. Interestingly, we cross referenced the sampled ballistic data with Hornady’s free online ballistic calculator and found that the provided digital results were within a tenth of an inch of our real-world sampling.

Cleaning

The makers’ claims for easy cleanup proved spot-on during our range sessions. After firing 10-shot strings, we found just five pre-soaked patches were needed to remove all signs of powder fouling. That’s as good as it gets. Though the patches did show lingering signs of what we think is plastic fouling, that is common wherever sabots are in use.

Rather surprising to us, the breech area wasn’t as heavily coated with gunk as is typically seen in breechplug rifles. We’re unsure if that’s solely because Triple Eight burns so cleanly, or if reduced back-pressure somehow contributes, perhaps allowing a different dispersal pattern. One thing is certain—NitroFire owners shouldn’t get bogged down on maintenance. Even so, it’s a chore that can’t be ignored, because, while improved, Triple Eight is still a blackpowder substitute and still corrosive. Be advised, Federal says FireStick cleanup requires solvent and that water-based swabbing won’t cut it.

Legal Status

Because of its breechloading aspect, BATFE classified the NitroFire as a modern firearm. As such, purchasers must go through FFL dealers and submit a Form 4473 for the FBI background check. Subsequent changes in ownership and other transfers are regulated the same as with other modern guns. However, like blackpowder and other substitutes, Triple Eight is classified as an explosive, not as ammunition. As such, and unlike loaded modern cartridges, it cannot be transported aboard commercial airliners.

According to Traditions, as of this writing, 18 states have approved the FireStick/NitroFire system for use in dedicated muzzleloader seasons, and another 18 states have indicated it is under consideration. We’re reminded that, early-on, then-new inline muzzleloaders were similarly slow-walked through state approval processes. Tony Knight traveled extensively, lobbying legislators and wildlife managers, and while it took years, nearly all states with special seasons eventually permitted inlines in some fashion. We expect the FireStick/NitroFire admittance to muzzleloader seasons will spread but will also take time.

The legal status will certainly have an effect on how well the FireStick system catches on. But the shooting public’s interest in the FireStick, along with the chance other gunmakers will adopt it, will likewise influence the regulatory folks. Given its inherent safety and convenience, we think serious pushes will come in several states. Hunters in states where it is eligible for special seasons are already expressing great interest. And beyond that, it’s a great way to teach beginners not just about muzzleloading but about gun safety and how guns work.

NitroFire On The Hunt

s an avid bowhunter, I look forward to trading out the archery tackle each year in favor of blackpowder, lead bullets and muzzleloading rifles. These guns afford the primitive-oriented hunter extended range and lethality to ethically harvest game at distances beyond the capability of a bow. In addition, specialized hunting seasons for guns that load through the muzzle give the outdoorsman an extra weekend or two a year to hunt, and I love more time in the field.

For evaluation, Traditions sent a NitroFire kit gun with an included 3-9X 40 mm riflescope and, after a quick boresighting, it took just a few shots to get the NitroFire dialed in. Prior to an Oklahoma whitetail hunt during the state’s dedicated Primitive Arms season, I tested the system, finding it to be accurate both on the range and in the field. While the optic included with the NitroFire was fine, I’m certain that premium glass with increased magnification would improve results considerably.

Late October is a special time of the year to hunt whitetails—antler bucks have left summertime bachelor groups, and spring-born fawns and does alike begin to seek out highly palatable, high-protein food to fill their stomachs for the winter. Antlered males begin to move more frequently, often abandoning their defensive instincts in favor of a chance to breed. For these reasons, muzzleloader season can provide some of the best hunting to be had all year.

I was greeted by an unprecedented storm once I arrived in Oklahoma City. Mind you, this is an area that typically doesn’t receive much ice and snow accumulation like the northern parts of the country. Having hunted in snow and ice much of my life, I knew this meant that upset deer would traverse the newly frozen environment within 24 hours in search of buried food and much-needed warmth. The forecast after the storm also didn’t look too promising—80 degree days capped with clear, full-moon nights. So I knew that I needed to put in as many hours in the field as possible while the wintry blanket remained.

First and foremost, before heading to the blind after traveling halfway across the country, it was imperative to confirm that the scope’s zero had not shifted. This did not take long to do, but it was where I experienced a hiccup with the system. The FireStick hull is sealed and opens from the front once ignited, leaving a plastic circular ring that was later found stuck to my breech brush. This explained to me why the action suddenly became stiff to close. I first thought it was a fluke, but then encountered it with several more FireStick hulls during testing.

The next morning, I found that a light mist throughout the night had frozen onto every exterior surface. My stomach fluttered with excitement for what was about to unfold. With the NitroFire slung snug on my shoulder, my favorite Alpz backpack filled with a morning’s worth of rations and supplies and binos strapped to my chest, I headed for the blind. As was expected, the blind was completely encrusted with a thick layer of dense ice.

By the time I settled inside the plastic shanty, my hands were soaked and halfway numb. Cold and wet hands are not conducive to loading most muzzleloaders, but I found that this was not the case with the NitroFire. A 250-grain Carnivore slipped down the bore with minimal effort. I then pointed the barrel out of the blind’s flip-up front window to ready my position for the morning’s hunt. This is the moment the distraction began.

Does filtered from the draw to my right down toward the game feeder that was placed in front of me. I spotted more movement and found that a small buck had just made his way to the feeder. Then a shot-worthy buck appeared. From across the field of interspersed sage brush, I could see his dark, wet antlers attempting to stab the sky above him. He presented a rigid posture and seemed to be staggering toward me, but I knew that his focus was actually on the immature buck.

The closer he stamped, the bigger he appeared. His character was dominant and his antlers were interesting—with two abnormal tines jutting outward off of each G2 tine—he was a double-kicker buck, with dark antlers highlighted by ivory-like tips. I got the shakes, and it was only after pulling the trigger that I realized that I had forgotten to charge the NitroFire.

I fumbled through my pocket and withdrew a primed FireStick. I was certain that the buck would bolt when I unhinged the action, inserted the charge and closed the action, but he was too distracted by the other deer to notice me. He was quartered toward me at roughly a 45-degree angle as I took aim and fell over shortly after I fired. I quickly prepared a second shot but didn’t need it. The 250-grain tipped bullet had proven effective, and just like that, I had a beautiful Oklahoma specimen to write home about.

The simplicity of the system helped me when I was in a pinch; had I forgotten to add powder to a conventional inline before bullet seating, a call to the lodge for tools would have been needed, and I’ve never carried a bullet puller in the field while hunting either.

Gun Test: Ruger’s Marlin Model 1895 SBL,"By Kelly Young, American Rifleman

Broad bodies shining white against the muted reds, greens and ochres of their adoptive home, you’d think that scimitar-horned oryx would be easy pickings for West Texas hunters, but that is very much not the case. On the sprawling, 295,000-acre 02 Ranch for the purpose of helping perform the initial field testing of a Ruger-made Marlin lever-action, I quickly learned just how incredibly wary these beasts can be and how surprisingly well their curved headgear blends into the thorny ocotillo and yucca plants that dominate that landscape. The specific Marlin in hand was the newly re-released Model 1895 SBL, chambered in .45-70 Gov’t, a hard-hitting but short-range cartridge, necessitating that I close the distance with an animal in order to take a clean shot—something that the free-ranging oryx seemed dead set against.

Adding 11/16×24 TPI threads to the end of the barrel allows for the installation of suppressors—such as the Silencer Central Banish 46 shown—or other muzzle devices, while an extended optics rail permits the use of either conventional or long-eye-relief scopes, or even a red-dot.

Numerous stalks had already failed, and the current one was on the verge. Guide Dave Callaway, with Backcountry Hunts, and I had been chasing a quartet of antelope for more than two hours when we noticed a single large male up on the hill about 900 yards ahead of us. As we continued following the group, it eventually became apparent that they were onto us and were heading full-steam to the next county, but the loner was still blissfully oblivious to our presence and was now only about 300 yards out.

We slowly scrambled to within about 150 yards and watched for a long while from the concealment of a tall Spanish dagger. Now agonizingly close but with only his head visible above the brush, we chanced moving in closer for a clearer shot at the bull, which finally came at right around 100 yards. Loaded up with Hornady’s 325-grain LEVERevolution ammunition, the first shot from the sticks knocked the bull to the ground, where he stayed for close to 30 seconds before surprising us by springing up and running for the hills, and a second hit grounded the hearty creature for good. The 1895’s action had been so smooth in readying that important follow-up shot that I hadn’t even been consciously aware of it until the excitement was over and the oryx was down.

While my successful hunt had already proven that Ruger’s Marlin was accurate enough for its intended application as a short-range hunting rifle, the process of dialing-in the Leupold scope had also hinted at an accuracy potential that was far more than just adequate. And, even at a glance, it was apparent that Ruger had made a few changes to the 1895 SBL that hadn’t been present on late-model Remington Marlins, so I was quite enthused to get a production gun sent in for a full evaluation.

Unlike Remington-era Marlins, Ruger is nickel-plating and spiral-fluting the 1895 SBL’s bolt—changes that both add functionality and a touch of flair.

–

On a foundational level, Ruger hasn’t done anything to alter the operation of the Marlin 1895; the company has merely sanded down a few rough edges—in some cases literally—and made a few tweaks. It is still a centerfire lever-action rifle with a solid-top receiver and an under-barrel tubular magazine, and cartridges are fed into the six-round magazine via a port on the right side of the receiver. As SBLs in particular—models always intended to be the most garishly dressed guns at the otherwise stolid lever-action party—my test samples also featured polished stainless-steel receivers, extended optics rails, eye-catching black-and-gray laminate furniture and big-loop levers.

Instead of a separate grip cap, the new rifle bears a Marlin logo laser-etched directly into the wood.

–

Actuating the lever downward drops the locking block and pulls the bolt rearward, simultaneously extracting and ejecting the spent case, cocking the hammer and releasing a fresh round from the magazine onto the carrier. During the upstroke, the carrier levers upward, positioning the cartridge such that it can be guided into the chamber by the returning bolt.

Ruger has slimmed down the 1895 SBL’s wood-laminate fore-end (above) considerably, making it a better fit for most hand sizes. A new finish also gives the furniture’s checkered areas a much darker appearance.



–

The most obvious changes to the Ruger-made 1895 SBL are naturally the external ones. These include the addition of 11/16×24 TPI muzzle threads to the 19″ hammer-forged barrel and a noticeably slimmer fore-end. Also, rather than a discrete black pistol grip cap, the new gun instead bears Marlin’s horse-and-rider logo laser-etched directly into the wood, and the previous XS ghost-ring sights have been replaced by a HIVIZ set. Ruger is also nickel-plating the bolt, the rear 3.5″ of which now bears spiraling flutes; this is mostly for the sake of aesthetics, but it should help reduce drag a little bit as well.

But unseen inside the Ruger-made Marlin are also a host of small refinements that together add up to a far better fitted and finished final product than had been produced by Marlin in the past decade. Just a few of these include: improved thread timing of the barrel with the receiver, ensuring properly aligned front and rear sights; more precisely cut hammer notches, resulting in more consistent engagement with the sear and a cleaner trigger pull; and an improved chamber requiring fewer operations to machine.

Ruger has also placed particular emphasis on tight tolerances and effective part stack-ups: at each step in the process parts are gauged to ensure proper fitment—and, on stainless guns like the 1895 SBL, the metal is heat-treated prior to machining to avoid warping. All parts that interact with another part are tumbled to remove burrs, and edges throughout the gun, from the trigger to the lever to the loading port, have been softened for added comfort and a more refined presentation.

As can be seen in the nearby results table, the accuracy of the Ruger-made Marlin wasn’t just good for a lever-action—it shot well for a rifle of any kind—particularly given what a thumper the .45-70 is. The trigger’s single-action break had zero take-up, zero overtravel and was extraordinarily consistent; 10 trigger pulls averaged a 5-lb., 5-oz., release, with seven of those readings registering as either 5 lbs., 5 ozs., or 5 lbs., 6 ozs., on the gauge.

The Marlin name has taken something of a shellacking during the past 15 years or so, and yet, in spite of this, the brand remains much beloved among lever-gun fans. As a result, if Ruger gets this re-launch right, it stands to win a lot of brownie points with a lot of shooters, and the two 1895 SBLs that I’ve handled extensively thus far certainly seem to indicate that a resuscitation of Marlin’s reputation is already well underway. Whereas “Remlin” became an unflattering pejorative over time, if these rifles are indicative of what the factory is producing in general—and I have no reason to doubt it—then “Mayodan, NC” on the side of a Marlin barrel may well come to be seen as a hallmark of quality.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/01/20/gun-test-rugers-marlin-model-1895-sbl/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiR_q6Z_7P9AhVCFlkFHTTaDjc4FBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw1R8P3s3bgt9TV42nyZCkg0,2022-01-20
Record Gun Sales Fueled By 5.4 Million First Time Buyers,"Gun sales surged to a record high in 2021, fueled by first-time gun owners, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF).

At least 5.4 million people purchased firearms for the first time in 2021, with roughly 30% of all gun purchases going to first-time buyers, according to the NSSF. The figure is a 10% decrease from 2020, when approximately 8.4 million people purchased firearms for the first time. (RELATED: Anti-Gunners Wrongly Try To Blame Gun Sales For Rise In Homicide Rates)

“We welcome these new gun owners to the greater community of law-abiding Americans who choose to own a firearm for lawful purposes, including self-defense, recreational target shooting and hunting,” Joe Bartozzi, NSSF president and chief executive, said.

“The surveys revealed that new gun owners are continuing to embrace their Second Amendment rights and nearly half of them are seeking out professional training,” Bartozzi said. “These trends show that not only is there still a strong interest in gun ownership but also that these new gun owners are interested in learning more about the safe and responsible handling, use and storage of firearms.”

Meanwhile, the survey found a 58% increase in black Americans purchasing guns in 2020 compared to 2019 and a 49% increase in gun purchases by the Hispanic community.

‘Second Amendment Is Not Absolute’: Biden Demands More Gun Control,"President Joe Biden called for stricter gun control legislation during his Wednesday address, claiming the Second Amendment allows for limitations on firearm ownership.

The president made the remarks alongside Vice President Kamala Harris in the aftermath of the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas, which killed 19 children and 2 teachers. He announced his future visit to Texas alongside First Lady Jill Biden.

“As a nation, we must all be there for them. Everyone. And we must ask when in God’s name will we do what needs to be done to if not completely stop, fundamentally change the amount of the carnage that goes on in this country,” Biden said. “I’m sick and tired. I’m just sick and tired of what’s going on and continues to go on.”

He touted his push to pass “common sense gun reforms” while serving as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and as vice president, urging for these gun control laws to pass in order to have “a significant impact” on the number of tragedies occurring throughout the country.

“While they clearly will not prevent every tragedy, we know certain ones will have significant impact and have no negative impact on the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment is not absolute. When it was passed you couldn’t own a cannon, you couldn’t own certain kinds of weapons. There’s always been limitations. These actions we’ve taken before, they save lives and they can do it again. The idea that an 18-year-old can walk into a store and buy weapons of war designed and marketed to kill is I think just wrong. It just violates common sense.” (RELATED: Psaki: ‘No One Is Talking About Overturning Or Changing The Second Amendment’)

Biden has repeated the false claim that a cannon could not be legally purchased when the Second Amendment was ratified. He made the claim last month when he announced his administration’s new regulation that requires background checks and serial numbers for so-called “ghost guns,” which refer to firearms that are unregulated and untraceable.

He made the same claim during his 2020 presidential campaign in a push to require background checks on all gun sales and impose a ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. The Washington Post gave his claim four Pinocchios, confirming that private citizens owned cannons at the time of the nation’s founding and that there was no federal law restricting the types of guns citizens could own.

He then moved the claim to apply to 20 years after the Revolutionary War, which is incorrect, according to the Washington Post. Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11 of the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war and “grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal,” meaning that private citizens could be granted special waivers to own warships and obtain cannons during a battle.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/05/25/second-amendment-biden-gun-control/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiC6P2d_7P9AhWERTABHb9vCFU4WhAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw2xYggiTfS7v866b-1NabVP,2022-05-25
Bill Burr Suggests Getting A Gun Should Be Like Getting A Pilot’s License,"Comedian Bill Burr had a very interesting suggestion for gun laws in America.

Following the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, people have been throwing out different suggestions around the clock for how to make America safer. Some think we should ban guns (terrible idea), and others have suggested hardening up potential targets. (RELATED: David Hookstead Is The True King In The North When It Comes To College Football)

The famous comedian thinks he has a plan that could please people on both sides. He wants to treat getting a gun like getting a pilot’s license, and once you’re cleared, you can own a bazooka if it makes you happy.

Burr said the following about guns on a recent episode of his podcast, according to UPROXX:

Why don’t you just do it like a pilot’s license? Like when you get a gun, like when you get like a pilot’s license, you’re flying a Cessna or whatever, you can’t just go f**king fly an American Airlines jet—you gotta work your way up. You gotta get rated. You know, I don’t think if you get like a f**king gun license, I think the first thing you should get regardless of your f**king age is you get a little six shooter. That’s all they give you. Or maybe one of those little Saturday night specials. You get a little one shot thing. That’s all the f**k you get, right? Then as you work your way up to more and more powerful guns that could potentially do way more f**king damage, you have to pass major, major psychological evaluations. If you do, the world is your oyster and you can have whatever f**king weapon you want. How about that? Does that work out for everybody?

He also added that “the left is f**king stupid” for just “yelling” at conservatives after shootings, and suggested that if you’re “not f**king crazy,” you should be able to get your hands on a bazooka.

Now, do I think we should treat getting a gun in America like getting a pilot’s license? Absolutely not. I do not believe you should have to gradually earn your rights like you’re climbing a ladder.

If you’re a good American who hasn’t done anything to lose your rights, you should 100% be able to buy a weapon that you feel comfortable with and prepared to properly train on.

However, the idea that the market could be flooded with bazookas under Burr’s plan is certainly an entertaining one. I wonder how many people would be willing to make that trade.

In return for stricter background checks and a tiered system of ownership, you could literally own any gun in existence. If I could walk into a store and buy a .50 caliber machine gun and mount it to my roof for a potential “Red Dawn” scenario, I’d definitely look into it. That much I can guarantee you.

Even if criminals gave up all their guns, I still wouldn’t give up mine. If the bad guy has a knife, baseball bat, hammer or any other weapon, you better believe I want a gun. — David Hookstead (@dhookstead) June 3, 2022

Still, I definitely don’t think guns should be treated like planes at all, but at least Burr found a way to make it funny and interesting.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/06/03/bill-burr-control-license-bazooka/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiClf6Z_7P9AhVTElkFHUzOA1k4HhAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw1bufqfTBgqrBb6cBSQEMpq,2022-06-03
"REPORT: California AG Leaks Names, Addresses Of Gun Owners In The State","The California Attorney General’s Office leaked the named and addresses of thousands of gun owners across the state, The Reload reported Tuesday.

"‘Orwellian’: New Gun Sales Tracker Opens The Door To ‘Privatized Government Surveillance,’ Experts Say","A newly approved code intended to track purchases at firearms stores could lead to a situation akin to “privatized government surveillance” of Americans, experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) makes global standards for business transactions and approved the creation of a new merchant code for gun stores to use when processing credit and debit card transactions, Reuters reported Friday.

“If governments or credit card companies start to require certain purchase patterns at gun stores be reported to police, that could put a lot of innocent people under suspicion depending on how broad the criteria are,” said Stephen Gutowski, a gun expert who founded The Reload, a firearms news outlet.

A newly approved code for the financial services industry to track gun store purchases could open the door to “privatized government surveillance,” experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) approved the creation of a new merchant code for firearms stores to use when processing credit and debit card transactions, Reuters reported Friday. However, the code could lead to innocent Americans being surveilled should companies coordinate with the government to probe sales, experts say. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: The FBI Secretly Pressured Americans To Waive Away Their Gun Rights)

“If you go into a gun store, presumably, particularly with larger purchases, they’re going to at least try to infer that it is probable you bought a firearm,” John Harris, a lawyer who heads the Tennessee Firearms Association, told the DCNF. “It could expand the trend we see where certain banks or credit card companies may say ‘we’re not going to allow a company with a particular ISO code to use our services.'”

ISO was founded in 1947 and votes on global standards for business transactions. Credit card companies are not required to implement the codes. There are 167 countries, including the U.S., that are members of the Swiss-based non-governmental organization (NGO).

Banks assign merchants four-digit sales codes that classify them based on the goods and services they provide. ISO’s approved changes will now let banks use a gun store-specific code — which diverges from the current system of banks lumping firearm retailers in with other industries and labeling them as either “5999: Miscellaneous retail stores” or “5941: Sporting Goods Stores.”

Congressional Democrats have argued a gun store code will help law enforcement thwart so-called “domestic terrorism,” as well as mass shootings, and urged American Express, Visa and Mastercard Sept. 1 to begin tracking gun and ammunition purchases. But critics, including the National Rifle Association (NRA), say the code will not stop threats and impedes on the gun rights of Americans.

“If governments or credit card companies start to require certain purchase patterns at gun stores be reported to police, that could put a lot of innocent people under suspicion depending on how broad the criteria are,” said Stephen Gutowski, a gun expert who founded The Reload, a firearms policy outlet.

The New York-based Amalgamated Bank requested ISO create the gun store code in June after its July 2021 request was denied, according to documents reviewed by CBS News. ISO told the bank in February a gun code would “burden” small business and not be able to account for “the sales at sporting goods stores,” the outlet reported. Sporting goods stores sell firearms but have restricted stock in recent years amid pressure from gun-control activists.

Amalgamated Bank, which is the largest union-owned bank, bills itself as a “socially responsible” lender and investor supporting “progressive causes” and “social justice.” Its political action committee (PAC) has donated more than $496,000 to Democratic candidates and causes since 2003, federal records show.

The bank is also a vendor for major Democratic PACs and committees, which issued $2.3 million in vendor payments in the 2022 election cycle through its system, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets. Joe Biden’s presidential campaign committees Biden Victory Fund and Biden for President issued roughly $227,500 in payments through Amalgamated Bank in 2020, according to OpenSecrets data.

Amalgamated Bank has argued a gun store code would “stop gun violence” and applauded ISO’s decision as a “historic outcome.” However, the code it pushed for could lead to a “crude method of tracking gun sales under private or public policies,” said Gutowski.

“It could lead to a kind of public-private surveillance system akin to how banks track and flag purchases potentially fraudulent transactions for law enforcement,” said Gutowski, explaining that such surveillance may occur if federal or state governments make the ISO code a requirement.

Visa, American Express and Mastercard said they will adopt the code following ISO’s decision, CNN reported Sunday. American Express and Mastercard did not respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.

“Following ISO’s decision to establish a new merchant category code, Visa will proceed with next steps, while ensuring we protect all legal commerce on the Visa network in accordance with our long-standing rules,” a Visa spokesman told the DCNF.

A spokesman for the largest firearms trade group in the U.S. told the DCNF the new code is “Orwellian by any definition.”

“The ultimate goal of those championing the application of these codes is to deny firearm and ammunition purchases through the use of credit cards,” said Mark Oliva of the National Shooting Sports Foundation.

Amalgamated Bank did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Sen. Josh Hawley Blasts Credit Card Companies For ‘Targeting’ Gun Owners,"Missouri Senator Josh Hawley sent a letter Tuesday to the CEOs of Visa, Mastercard and American Express, voicing his concern with the companies for implementing steps to track gun sale purchases via a special code applied to such transactions.

A subcommittee of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) approved a special code Friday which would monitor transactions via credit card at gun retailers. The move came after Elizabeth Warren and several other lawmakers sent a letter to American Express seeking answers to “reports that the company has obstructed efforts” to create a category under which gun sales would be monitored. (RELATED: ‘The FBI Showed Up’: DCNF Reporter Details How Feds Pressured Americans Into Signing Away Gun Rights)

“I write to express serious concern with your decision to separately categorize gun-related purchases from other retail transactions made with your payment cards so that firearm purchases can be more easily tracked,” Hawley wrote in the letter. “This move has been described by multiple media outlets as ‘a major win for gun control advocates,’ and they are not wrong,” he continued.

Hawley claimed the move would unfairly allow big technology (Big Tech) companies to target American gun owners.

“This new system is ripe for abuse and brings to mind similar policies of Big Tech companies and payment processors that have targeted law-abiding Americans for engaging in constitutionally protected activities. I urge you to immediately reverse course,” Hawley wrote in the letter.

Hawley in the letter also pointed to other instances in which, he claimed, “companies have abused their market power to target the constitutional rights of conservatives and others with minority viewpoints.” One example Hawley pointed to was when GoFundMe, the crowdfunding site, in February removed a fundraiser made on behalf of truckers protesting Canada’s vaccine mandates, and initially refused to redistribute the donations.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/09/13/senator-josh-hawley-credit-card-companies-gun-owners-purchases/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwih08ya_7P9AhXDElkFHeBDDk44KBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw0Y5AeOK0LxoazXgJIOwec8,2022-09-13
"‘Weapons Of War’: Washington State’s Dem Gov, Attorney General Propose Major Gun Control Measures","Democratic Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced three new measures to curb gun violence in Washington on Monday.

The measures would work to ban assault style weapons, hold manufacturers and retailers accountable for gun sales and implement a permit-to-purchase requirement for all gun buyers

Republican state Rep. Jim Walsh criticized the announcement, saying it is a waste of taxpayer time and money, as the recent Supreme Court decision in the Bruen case will render the measures unconstitutional.

Democratic Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Attorney General Bob Ferguson held a press conference Monday to announce three new measures for the upcoming 2023 legislative session that aims to curb gun violence in the state.

The measures would ban assault style weapons, hold manufacturers and retailers accountable for gun sales and implement a permit-to-purchase requirement for all gun buyers, according to a press conference. Inslee cited an increase in gun violence as the reason for the new legislation, and believes the laws, along with mental health assistance, will curb gun violence in Washington. (RELATED: Oregon Voters Narrowly Pass Highly Restrictive Gun Control Measure That Creates ‘Database’ Of Gun Owners)

“We know we can act. We know we should act. And we know we will act in this session of the legislature. And the reason is, Washingtonians demand assertive, effective and protective gun safety laws. We intend in this session of the legislature to give Washingtonians assertive, effective and protective laws to protect them and their children against this epidemic of gun violence,” Inslee said.

“You need to get a license to drive a car in the state of Washington. You need to get a license to go fishing. It’s time you get a license to make sure you have safety training to purchase a gun in the state of Washington, and it’s high time that we pass a bill to make sure you get a permit before you get a firearm,” Inslee said.

Last year, over 800 Washington residents were killed as the result of gun violence, and 23 residents were killed just last month, according to Inslee.

Seattle, Washington, recorded 53 homicides in 2020, a 25-year record, and numbers only slightly dropped to 42 homicides in 2021. This year, as of November, 27 homicides were recorded in Seattle.

In King County, 256 people had survived gunshot wounds as of September, and 70 people had died, according to The Seattle Times. Of the deaths, 27 were between July and September.

The first measure would ban the sale, manufacture and import of so-called assault weapons in Washington, but will not affect those who already own assault weapons, law enforcement and military, according to the press conference. Inslee referred to assault weapons as “weapons of war,” saying, “there are no legitimate reasons for them in our society.”

The assault weapon ban measure is sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Patty Kuderer and state Rep. Strom Peterson.

The second measure would address weapons manufacturers, allowing them to be held liable if they fail to responsibly control the manufacture, sale, distribution and marketing of firearms, according to the press conference. The legislation would also allow victims to seek justice when manufacturers fail to keep firearms away from “dangerous individuals.”

“There is nothing normal about the violence that we are accepting in our society, in our communities and in our schools. We have a responsibility to act, and we are going to continue to act this session. I am proud to be working with the governor’s office and the attorney general’s office on the liability bill that will say gun manufacturers and retailers have to accept responsibility for these dangerous products that they sell,” Democratic state Sen. Jamie Pedersen said during the press conference.

Following the press conference, Republican state Rep. Jim Walsh criticized the announcement, saying it is a waste of taxpayer time and money.

“The biggest problem with the governor and state attorney general’s proposals is that they are a waste of taxpayers’ time and money. The U.S. Supreme Court, in its recent Bruen decision, has clearly ruled that state gun-control schemes like these are unconstitutional — and unlawful. They will eventually be overturned by federal courts,” Walsh said in a release.

Inslee, Ferguson, Pedersen and Hackney did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Black Gun Owners Slam New Jersey’s Concealed Carry Law,"Black gun owners in New Jersey have pushed back against a recent concealed carry law, with one firearms instructor saying the law, like many other gun laws, targets and criminalizes minority communities, according to PBS affiliate WHYY.

The instructor, Douglas Worthen, argued that the recent legislation, which heightens requirements for gun ownership, will block black residents from defending themselves, while one of the law’s changes, an increase in fees, will further deter marginalized community members from seeking a permit, according to WHYY. The bill would require gun owners who seek a concealed carry permit to purchase liability insurance and take training courses, while also increasing permit fees and restricting guns in “sensitive places” like schools, public parks, courthouses and bars, according to the legislation.

Worthen believes the “sensitive places” restriction will block people from defending themselves outside of their homes, according to WHYY. “Black ancestors … at one point couldn’t even possess any firearms at all. The infringement on people of color in this country has been around for a very, very long time. It still exists present-day, but just has a different form.” (RELATED: ‘Profoundly Discriminatory’: LGBTQ Oregonians Fear New Gun Law Could Leave Them Vulnerable)

The New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center reported in 2022 that black and Hispanic gun owners are more likely to carry a gun outside of their home, and the new law will not only limit that ability, but also increase the cost, according to WHYY. “When [people] see these fees, they get discouraged and are like ‘you know what, I’m not paying that,’” Worthen said.

Gun purchases by black Americans have jumped over the last two years, according to a survey by the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Leon Grauer, a Newark-based licensed attorney and organizer of the New Jersey Black Gun Owners Association, believes the increase is purchases is a response to the murder of George Floyd and a an understanding that there is a need to fend off crime in underserved neighborhoods, according to WHYY.

“A lot of people within the Black community perceive incidents, such as the killing of George Floyd, and other incidents highlighting their need for personal protection,” Grauer said. “Also, in cities that have high crime rates, particularly high violent crime rates, just as in the white community people feel empowered to defend themselves, many people in the Black community feel empowered to have a firearm to defend themselves.”

Grauer asserted that there are many gun owners in his community who value safety and regulations, further saying that the belief that those who come from marginalized communities are against guns is a misconception, according to WHYY.

“Historically, ever since slavery, firearms have been a means of self-defense and self-preservation for Black people in America. There is a perception that perhaps during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and ‘60s, Black people in America, en masse, put down their guns and live by a non-violent strategy, but it’s far from the truth,” Grauer said.

The state Senate voted along party lines, 21-16, to approve the legislation, which received the minimum number of votes required to clear the house. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy intends to “swiftly” sign the bill into law.

Murphy did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

"After The Supreme Court’s Major Gun Decision, These States Passed Restrictive New Laws In 2022","Gun laws in many states were introduced in 2022, and the majority focused on banning “assault” style weapons, enacting tighter restraints on magazine capacities, limiting authorized carry locations or creating permitting processes for gun ownership.

The laws received scrutiny from legislators and activists, as many said they were unconstitutional, often referencing precedent set by the Supreme Court’s New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen ruling.

Following the ruling, dozens of states began to readdress their concealed carry laws.

Many states updated or passed new gun laws in 2022, a process that accelerated after the Supreme Court ruled in June that New York’s concealed carry restrictions were unconstitutional.

Gun laws in New York, California, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington were all introduced in 2022, and the majority focused on banning “assault” style weapons, enacting tighter restraints on magazine capacities, limiting authorized carry locations or creating permitting processes for gun ownership. The laws received scrutiny from legislators and activists, as many said they were unconstitutional, often referencing precedent set by the Supreme Court’s New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen ruling.

The Supreme Court ruled that New York’s concealed carry law, which allowed applicants to be denied a permit if they did not have a “special need,” was unconstitutional, creating a precedent that has been used to change laws and influence gun debates across the country. Following the ruling, dozens of states began to readdress their concealed carry laws, according to The Trace.

In Washington, Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee and Attorney General Bob Ferguson are working on new measures that aim to curb gun violence in the state. The measures would ban assault-style weapons, hold manufacturers and retailers accountable for gun sales and implement a permit-to-purchase requirement for all gun buyers.

Republican state Rep. Jim Walsh criticized the announcement, saying the Bruen case sets precedent against the proposed measures.

“The biggest problem with the governor and state attorney general’s proposals is that they are a waste of taxpayers’ time and money. The U.S. Supreme Court, in its recent Bruen decision, has clearly ruled that state gun-control schemes like these are unconstitutional — and unlawful. They will eventually be overturned by federal courts,” Walsh said in a release.

66% for making gun laws more strict, rather than keeping them the same (25%) or less strict (8%).

In December, the New Jersey state Senate narrowly passed a new concealed carry gun control legislation that will place new restrictions on gun owners. The bill will require gun owners who seek a concealed carry permit to purchase liability insurance and take training courses, while also increasing permit fees and restricting guns in “sensitive places” like schools, public parks, courthouses, bars and private property, according to the legislation.

The bill received bipartisan criticism, with Republican state Sen. Michael Testa calling the bill “absolutely wrong” and Democratic state Sen. Nicholas Sacco saying it is unconstitutional and will face legal challenges.

Following the Bruen decision, New York updated its concealed carry laws, but many legislators still feel the new law is restrictive, as it limits where a gun can be carried. After the law’s implementation, a federal judge ruled that the state’s ban on concealed carry weapons in churches is unconstitutional.

The December ruling was the third of its kind and asserted that the law violates worshipers’ gun rights and hinders the free exercise of religious beliefs.

Following the midterm elections, Oregon narrowly passed a restrictive gun law that heightened the requirements and process for owning a gun. The law, Ballot Measure 114, is currently not active due to multiple lawsuits and lower court holds, but if enacted, will require background checks, firearm training, fingerprint collection and a permit to purchase any firearm.

In July, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed laws that prohibit the gun industry from marketing firearm-related products to minors and further restricted ghost guns and the parts used to build them, according to CNN. Newsom also signed laws that prevent the 3D printing of guns, while also allowing citizens to bring lawsuits against weapons manufacturers.

Following the passing of the law that allowed residues to bring lawsuits against gun manufacturers, SB 1327, U.S. District Court Judge Roger Benitez blocked the law, saying it made it impossible for targets of the lawsuit to defend themselves, according to CalMatters.

“This court concludes that the purpose and effect of (SB 1327) is to trench on a citizen’s right of access to the courts and to discourage the peaceful vindication of an enumerated constitutional right,” he wrote. “Because the state fee-shifting statute undermines a citizen’s constitutional rights, it is this court’s role to declare its invalidity and enjoin its threat.”

After the Bruen decision, California Attorney General Rob Bonta informed permitting agencies that they must stop requiring applicants to prove “good cause” before receiving their concealed carry permits.

Alongside the precedent for concealed carry permits set in the Bruen case, the ruling addressed magazine capacity limits, resulting in the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) directing officers to stop enforcing California’s high capacity magazine ban. While the case continues to be discussed, officers will not “investigate, detain, or arrest” anyone suspected of having high-capacity magazines, the LAPD confirmed to The Trace.

Judge Completely Blocks Oregon’s Restrictive Gun Law,"A judge on Tuesday placed a hold on a portion of Oregon’s recent gun law that enhances background check requirements for firearm purchases, leaving the legislation completely blocked.

The ruling is another setback for the law, Ballot Measure 114, which is now entirely paused as legal challenges to various portions of the law make their way through Oregon’s court system. The judge determined that the law’s heightened background check requirement could not be implemented while the court continues to debate the other portions of the law, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting, as plaintiffs argue the law violates the state’s constitution.

Oregon had hoped to implement the background check requirement based on language in the measure that says if any “articles, sections, subsections, sentences or clauses” are blocked or found to be unconstitutional, the remaining portions could still be implemented. Harney County Circuit Judge Robert Raschio ruled that the background check could not be implemented because the language in the measure ties background checks to the “permit-to-purchase” requirement, according to OPB.

“The court declines to remove the background check provisions from the [temporary restraining order] as the provisions are intertwined with the permit-to-purchase program and the court has made no final determination on constitutionality of the program,” Raschio wrote in his order. (RELATED: ‘Pack’ The Pews: Federal Judge Says New York’s Ban On Guns In Churches Is Unconstitutional)

A Harney County judge heard arguments today on whether or not to allow the background provisions in Ballot Measure 114 to go into effect. He’ll issue his ruling by Jan. 3, he said. — J Levinson (@_jlevinson) December 23, 2022

Following the law’s passing, gun restrictions led to a massive uptick in attempted firearms purchases in Oregon. Background checks skyrocketed from 850 per day, prior to the midterms, to 4,000 per day after the law’s passing, and the Oregon state police reported more than 18,000 transactions during election week.

In December, 36,000 Oregon residents were waitlisted in the background check process, Karl Durkheimer, owner of Oregon’s Northwest Armory gun store, said on Fox News.

“Two things are happening. There’s fear they won’t be able to get a gun, but there’s the actual logistics that they won’t be able to do the background check. It’s going to take a year before an Oregonian has a permit,” Durkheimer said.

Illinois Gov Signs Sweeping Gun Bill Into Law,"Illinois passed legislation Tuesday that will enact a statewide ban on so-called “assault weapons” and place limits on magazine capacities.

Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the legislation late Tuesday night after the Illinois House of Representatives voted on revisions passed by the state Senate.

The bill, HB 5471, will outlaw assault weapons, assault weapon attachments and .50 caliber cartridges, while also limiting magazine capacity to 10 rounds for long guns and 15 rounds for handguns.

Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed legislation Tuesday night that will enact a statewide ban on so-called “assault weapons” and place a limit on magazine capacities, according to CBS Chicago.

The bill, HB 5471, will outlaw the sale, manufacture, possession and purchase of “assault-style” weapons, assault weapon attachments and .50 caliber cartridges, while also limiting magazine capacity to 10 rounds for long guns and 15 rounds for handguns, according to the legislation. Pritzker signed the legislation late Tuesday night after the Illinois House of Representatives voted on revisions passed by the state Senate. (RELATED: Federal Judge Rules That Parts Of New Jersey Gun Law Are Unconstitutional)

“For a long time now, I and many other leaders in the Illinois General Assembly have prioritized getting the most dangerous weapons off our state’s streets. Today, honoring the commitment we made, we passed one of the strongest assault weapons bans in the nation, one I will be proud to sign.” Pritzker said in a press release before signing the bill.

“No Illinoisan, no matter their zip code, should have to go through life fearing their loved one could be the next in an ever-growing list of victims of mass shootings,” he continued.

The House voted 68-41 to approve the ban Tuesday afternoon, according to CBS Chicago. The bill passed 34-20 in the Illinois Senate on Monday.

Illinois residents who own guns that are now restricted under the law all be able to keep them, but will be required to register the firearms with the state police, according to the legislation. Magazines owned before the new capacity requirements take effect can also be kept, but the now illegal magazines and firearms must be used on private property.

Republican representatives urged Democratic lawmakers to vote against the bill, which was approved during the last day of the lame duck session, saying the law will penalize legal gun owners, according to speeches given during the state House’s session Tuesday.

Some Republican lawmakers suggested waiting until Illinois’s 2023 legislative session starts Wednesday.

All communities deserve to live free from gun violence. Banning assault weapons upholds our commitment to building true public safety for all, and will undoubtedly reduce the ways dangerous people can obtain weapons of war.

Republican state Sen. Chapin Rose said that the state already has gun legislation that mitigates gun violence, and the new law would penalize citizens who are already following the law, according to The State-Journal Register.

“Enforce the laws that already exist. We’re going to make felons out of taxpayers. Put the bad guys behind the bars, not the good guys,” he said, according to the outlet.

State Sens. Darren Bailey and Neil Anderson said the bill was an “affront” to the Second Amendment, and Bailey predicts that the Illinois Supreme Court will rule the new law to be in violation of the Constitution, according to the The State-Journal Register.

“You’ve got to know the actions that you are taking are tyrannous. You also must know that I and millions of other gun owners in this state will not comply,” Bailey said, the outlet reported.

Anderson called the bill “hypocritical,” saying Democratic lawmakers believe they are banning “weapons of war,” but fail to mention weapons used in war such as the M1 Garand and 1911 handgun, according to the The State-Journal Register.

“The hypocrisy that we are trying to ban so-called ‘weapons of war,’ but yet the weapons of war that you actually speak of are not weapons of war,” he said, later suggesting that those who are in favor of the bill should resign, according to The State-Journal Register.

Democratic Illinois Senate President Don Harmon countered Anderson, saying that the M1 Garand and 1911 were not included because they have small magazine capacities, according to The State-Journal Register. “The weapons on this list are designed to do one thing and one thing only: kill people in a horribly brutal, vicious way,” he said.

Pritzker did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

SCOTUS Declines To Block Gun Control Bill In Blow To NY Firearms Dealers,"New York gun dealers suffered yet another setback on Wednesday when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to stop new gun regulations from going into effect.

Gun sellers applied for emergency relief in early January to block a series of new gun laws that would require background checks for private gun and ammunition sales and ban firearms in “sensitive” locations such as stadiums, places of worship and museums, among other provisions.

The court rejected the application to grant relief Wednesday, with no explanation or dissents.

“We are disappointed that not one of the nine justices saw fit to grant the plaintiffs some stay of enforcement of the new laws against them,” Paloma Capanna, the lead attorney for the gun retailers, told Fox News. (RELATED: ‘Blatantly Unconstitutional’: Another Lawsuit Filed Against Oregon Officials For Restrictive Gun Measure)

“We are challenging the ability of the state of New York to target dealers in firearms in the lawful stream of commerce, to put them out of business, which is what the new laws will do,” she added. “So it really was unfortunate to see that we couldn’t get any emergency temporary injunction against those laws.”

The new restrictions are part of the Concealed Carry Improvement Act, which was passed after the Supreme Court struck down an earlier New York gun law in June 2022, ruling that the Second and Fourteenth Amendment permit individuals to carry a handgun outside of the home.

On Jan. 11, the Supreme Court rejected a request from gun owners to block the Concealed Carry Improvement Act, though Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas signaled at the time that they would be interested in taking up their case once it makes its way through the lower courts.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/19/scotus-new-york-gun-dealers-concealed-carry-improvement-act/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwin1tqe_7P9AhXoTTABHbYrBok4ZBAWegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw1uoNbruRhUtf-DI5JQCBpG,2023-01-19
EXCLUSIVE EXCERPT: Here Are The Stats Gun Grabbers Ignore On Defensive Firearms Use,"The following is an excerpt from Larry Correia’s “In Defense of the Second Amendment.” It can be purchased here.

It doesn’t really make sense to ban guns, because in reality what that means is that you are actually trying to ban effective self-defense. Despite the constant hammering by a news media with an agenda, guns are used in America far more often to stop crime than to cause crime.

I’ve seen several different sets of numbers about how many times guns are used in self-defense every year. The problem with keeping track of this stat is that the vast majority of the time, when a gun is used in a legal self-defense situation, no shots are fired. The mere presence of the gun is enough to cause the criminal to stop. Notable firearms instructor Clint Smith had a saying: “If you look like food, you will be eaten.” Regular criminals are looking for prey. They want easy victims. If they wanted to work hard for a living, they’d get a job.

When you pull a gun, you are no longer prey, you are work, so they’re usually going to go find somebody easier to pick on.

Many defensive gun uses (DGUs) never get tracked as such. From personal experience, I have pulled a gun on another human being one time in my entire life. I was legally justified, and the aggressor stopped, lowered his gun, and left. My one defensive gun use was never recorded as a stat anywhere as far as I know, because no shots were fired.

My wife has used a firearm in self-defense twice in her life. Once on somebody who was acting very rapey, who suddenly found a better place to be when she stuck a pistol in his face, and again years later on a German Shepherd that was attacking my one-year-old son. No police report at all on the second one, and I don’t believe the first one ever turned up as any sort of defensive use statistic because no shots were fired.

So how often are guns used in self-defense?

One of the most commonly cited studies estimates that there are around 2.5 million defensive gun uses a year, which is orders of magnitude higher than our number of murders.

America’s murder rate had been trending steadily downward over the last two decades, until in 2020 it skyrocketed to the highest number it’s been in twenty-five years, with over 21,000 murders. Keep in mind not all of those murders were done with firearms. Twenty nineteen is the last year I could find a detailed breakdown from the FBI, which is showing 13,927 murders, with approximately 74 percent (10,258) of those being done with guns.

Why was there such an astoundingly massive increase in homicides in 2020? What current events could have possibly influenced that number? This was the year of “fiery but mostly peaceful” protests, and people chanting “All Cops Are Bastards,” while cities let hoodlums start up their own “autonomous zones.” Big city DAs decided to quit sending violent criminals to jail. Grifters changed Black Lives Matter to Buy Large Mansions, and the very people they were supposedly helping had their neighborhoods engulfed in violence and chaos for it. It’s almost like letting criminals do whatever they want, unimpeded by the law, Mad Max–dystopia-style has negative consequences or something.

Regardless, that still puts defensive gun uses about 119 times higher than even our crappiest murder year of recent times.

But to really drive this home, let’s not go with the high estimate. Let’s go with some smaller ones instead. Since everybody who takes a crack at this sets different parameters for their studies, results vary wildly, with papers citing numbers between 500,000 and 3 million defensive gun uses a year.

Let’s use that far more conservative 500,000 number. That still absolutely dominates that homicide number. In fact, the absolute lowest estimated number I could find anywhere was 100,000, which is kind of absurd once you hear that the average result of seventeen other surveys was 2 million.

The only kind of people dishonest enough to try and sell that 100K number are the vultures. Yet even given that ludicrously low estimate, the good guys still win by a rather substantial margin. So even if you use the worst number provided by people who are just as biased as I am, but in the opposite direction, defensive gun use is a huge net positive. Or to put it another way, anti-gun zealots hate your owning guns so much that they are totally cool with the population of a fairly large city getting assaulted, raped, and murdered every year as collateral damage in order to get what they want.

The thing to remember about vulture statistics is that they’re always twisted for emotional impact. Mark Twain talked about lies, damned lies, and statistics, but our modern anti-gun zealots would have blown his mind. Their goal is to toss out something that sounds lurid and ghastly, truth be damned, and by the time it is debunked it doesn’t matter, because liars and useful idiots will just regurgitate it forever. Like the infamous a gun in the home is forty-three times more likely to kill you or a loved one than an intruder. That one is straight up nonsense, created with embarrassingly flawed methods, from a tiny sample, that even the author has since revised down to a tiny fraction of that (and he’s still grasping at straws to get there), yet they’ve been unabashedly repeating this thoroughly debunked lie since 1986. I was in sixth grade. Original Top Gun was in theaters. They’ve got no shame!

Back to comparing the social costs, I’ve been talking about homicides versus DGUs, but what about criminals using firearms in crimes that don’t result in homicides? That’s an even harder number to pin down. What are the parameters used to define that? Like they actually shot at somebody? Or they had one on them while performing some other kind of crime? In searching for this, I found a lot fewer options to choose from. One of the few estimates I could find was from the National Crime Victimization Study, at 480,000.

Comparing that to the average estimate, DGU’s win handily; compared to the really low estimate, they come out about even—and I doubt anybody who has read this far is gullible enough to buy NPR’s goofy partisan number.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/21/good-guy-with-gun-defensive-gun-control-larry-correia/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwim1tWc_7P9AhXYFlkFHaUWAPg4RhAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw2IoHF9ewhAz0bSJJsPTSyJ,2023-01-21
‘I Was Skewered’: ‘The View’ Co-Hosts Spar Over Gun Laws,"“The View” co-hosts sparred over gun legislation and red flag laws Thursday following the surge of mass shootings in 2023.

The panel entered a heated debate over whether stricter gun laws should be implemented in the U.S. after a six-year-old boy shot his teacher at Richneck Elementary School in Virginia. Co-host Sunny Hostin accused her fellow co-hosts of ridiculing her after she previously argued that solely passing red flags is not the solution to mitigating the number of shootings in the nation.

“When I said that red flag laws are not enough, I was skewered at this table, I was skewered across America. There’s a red flag law in Virginia,” Hostin said.

“Skewered?” co-host Whoopi Goldberg said.

“I support red flag laws,” co-host Sara Haines said.

“But they don’t work!” Hostin said.

“No, they’re not being implemented properly,” Haines continued.

“And that’s what I said, they’re not being implemented properly!” Hostin interjected.

“But that doesn’t mean you give up on it,” Haines said.

Red flag laws allow for a state court to temporarily confiscate the firearms of an individual convicted of a violent crime. Nineteen U.S. states, including Massachusetts and Florida, have implemented such laws.

Co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin quickly changed the subject by commending the shot teacher, Abigail Zwerner, for ushering her students out of the classroom after sustaining a gunshot wound. Sparks flew when Griffin then argued most gun owners do not commit crimes with their firearms and thus mental illness is tied to the growing number of shootings. (RELATED: ‘Middle Finger To New York’: ‘The View’ Laments SCOTUS Decision On NY Concealed Carry Law)

“Gun homicide rate is 23 times higher in this country than the entire European Union,” co-host Joy Behar said, appearing to read from a statistic. “They have mentally ill people in the European Union, don’t they? So, the one thing they don’t have is access to guns. So this whole mental health idea is baloney. Baloney.”

“I don’t think it’s baloney though, because again, I can own a gun my whole life and never use it to commit a crime,” Griffin argued. “You can’t separate the criminal from the weapon … There’s 400 million guns…”

“People with mental illness are more likely to be victims of a crime than attacking other people,” Hostin said.

“You also can’t separate the pornography and video games … and the lack of empathy and the racism, you name it all, it is layered beyond belief and it’s not as simple as ‘We have tons of guns, get rid of them,'” Haines interjected. “Some people have them illegally, some people have them legally.”

In the following segment, Behar issued a correction for saying that the mass shootings in the U.S. are comparable to Venezuela or Brazil. In fact, the U.S. is between those countries in the number of gun deaths, not mass shootings. Suicide accounted for more than half of gun-related deaths in the U.S. in 2020 and 2021, according to a Pew Research study and U.S. News.

A study conducted by the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit examined 63 active shooters and found one-quarter of them had been diagnosed with a mental illness, according to the Metrowest Health Foundation. Additional studies found active shooters act out of grievances, anger or depression rather than “impulse,” the foundation continued.

Federal Court Strikes Down Decades-Old Gun Law Targeting Domestic Violence,"A federal appeals court struck down a decades-old gun law Thursday that blocked people under domestic violence protection orders from possessing firearms, saying the law is unconstitutional after a new precedent for gun laws was set in a landmark Supreme Court decision.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth District ruled that the federal criminal statute did not fit “within our Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation,” a requirement for all gun laws set forth in the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen (NYSRPA v. Bruen) case in June, according to the ruling. The law, established in 1994, blocked the transfer of a firearm to anyone who was placed under a court protective order for “harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or child of such intimate partner,” further saying that the aforementioned individual cannot possess a firearm or ammunition.

“The question presented in this case is not whether prohibiting the possession of firearms by someone subject to a domestic violence restraining order is a laudable policy goal. The question is whether 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8), a specific statute that does so, is constitutional under the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution. In the light of N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n, Inc. v. Bruen, 142 S. Ct. 2111 (2022), it is not,” U.S. District Judge Cory Wilson wrote in the ruling.

The court’s decision came after an appeal was submitted in the United States of America v. Zackey Rahimi case, where Rahimi was charged for possessing a firearm while being under a domestic violence protective order, according to the ruling. Rahimi’s appeal claimed that his charges were unconstitutional in light of the precedent set by the NYSRPA v. Bruen case.

“We conclude that Bruen requires us to re-evaluate our Second Amendment jurisprudence and that under Bruen, § 922(g)(8) fails to pass constitutional muster. We therefore reverse the district court’s ruling to the contrary and vacate Rahimi’s conviction,” Wilson wrote in the ruling.

“In sum, our Founders envisioned a nation in which both citizen and sovereign alike play important roles in protecting the innocent against violent criminals. Our decision today is consistent with that vision. I concur,” Wilson wrote in the ruling.

Details On MSU Shooter Crush The Gun-Grabbing Narrative,"New details about the Michigan State University (MSU) shooter appear very inconvenient to the gun-grabbing narrative, according to a Wednesday report from the New York Post.

The shooter had a prior felony gun charge that was dropped by a left-wing district attorney. The shooter would have been barred from owning a gun if he had been convicted.

Politicians such as Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Joe Biden are calling for gun control action in light of this shooting.

Uhh… your gun control measures didn’t work because leftists didn’t enforce them. We can only assume the rules were not enforced because the shooter’s skin color didn’t align with social justice priorities.

I went to MSU, attended classes and studied in the halls where those shootings took place. The doors to those buildings don’t require a key card, or at least they didn’t when I was there in 2019. Anyone could just walk in without an MSU ID. Maybe we should start by fixing that?

Blue State Democrats Unveil Proposal To Block Gun Purchases For Residents Under 21,"Colorado Democrats announced a new bill Tuesday that will block anyone under the age of 21 from purchasing any form of firearm, according to The Denver Post.

The proposed legislation would ban the purchase and possession of any firearm, including long guns and handguns, for adults who are younger than 21, saying they hope the legislation will help stop gun violence in the state, according to the Denver Post. The proposed legislation, announced by the bill’s sponsors Tuesday during an interview with the Denver Post, will likely be submitted as a Senate bill this week. (RELATED: West Virginia Passes Bill That Allows Concealed Carry On Campus)

The bill will have exceptions in place to protect hunters, military members and sports shooters, while also including provisions for supervised possession, according to the Denver Post.

“We know that there’s a disproportionately high rate of violence perpetrated by young people using firearms,” Democratic Colorado state Sen. Jessie Danielson told the Denver Post.

Danielson, and other democratic sponsors of the bill, cited a 61% increase in suicides between 2011 and 2020 in the 18 to 20 year old demographic as a key reason for the bill, according to the Denver Post. The sponsors also referenced how the 18 to 20 year old demographic is 4% of the population but is responsible for 17% of homicide offenses.

The lawmakers referenced gun violence data from The Giffords Law Center, a gun control advocacy group, according to the Denver Post.

“I’m not saying that [the bill] is going to fix everything, but it sure as hell is an important, huge step in recognizing and acknowledging that we need to do something here in Colorado,” Democratic Rep. Monica Duran, a con-sponsor of the bill, told the Denver Post.

In August, U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman ruled in the Firearms Policy Coalition v. McCraw case that preventing 18-to-21 year olds from carrying handguns in public is unconstitutional. The ruling, decided in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, was decided in light of a landmark SCOTUS case.

“Young adults have the same constitutionally protected right to bear arms as all other adults” Firearm Policy Coalition Senior Attorney for Constitutional Litigation Cody Wisniewski said after an appeal to the decision was struck down in the Texas Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in December.

The sponsors of the Colorado bill noted that either they or immediate family members owned firearms, and argued that they were not attacking gun rights — rather advocating for responsible gun ownership, according to the Denver Post. The bill will be the first in a “slate” of gun control bills, according to Democratic Colorado state Sen. Kyle Mullica.

“It’s common sense,” Mullica told the Denver Post. “When we’re out talking to people in our communities, it’s bills like this that they’re asking for.”

Colorado Democrats are debating a bill that will ban so-called “assault weapons,” but it has not been introduced as the gun violence caucus continues to discuss gun violence in the state, according to the Denver Post.

"Dems, Unions Spar Over Gun Laws While Deciding Location For 2024 Democratic Convention","Democrats are arguing amongst themselves over the location of the 2024 Democratic Convention, citing concerns that Georgia’s gun laws will fail to protect attendees, according to the New York Times.

Lawmakers in Chicago, Illinois, and Atlanta, Georgia, are deep in debate over the 2024 national convention, with Illinois lawmakers concerned that Georgia gun laws will fail to protect attendees, and Georgia Democrats saying that gun laws have “no particular impact” on the decision, according to the NYT. Alongside Georgia and Illinois, union leaders are arguing that the convention should be held in Chicago, as the city aligns with President Joe Biden’s stance on unions, saying he is the “most pro-union president in history.”

“It just creates a tense environment,” Charles H. Ramsey, who works in security consulting, told the NYT about Georgia’s gun laws. “To me it’s an issue.” (RELATED: Half Of The US No Longer Requires A Permit For Concealed Carry)

Many Democrats are worried that Georgia’s open-carry laws could pose a problem for security, but also seek a union-friendly city, according to the NYT. Union officials are pushing the Biden administration to support Chicago for the convention, as the city has more than 30 unionized hotels – Atlanta only has two.

“Joe Biden is the most pro-union president in history, and having it in a pro-union town reinforces that record and sends a message,” political and legislative Director of the International Association of Iron Workers Ross Templeton told the NYT.

Atlanta City Council President Doug Shipman told the NYT that Atlanta has successfully hosted several large events since it passed its open-carry law, saying the city has a good security relationship with federal, state and local law enforcement, according to the NYT.

“Atlanta offers an enormous amount of historical and current symbolism. It’s obviously the home of the civil rights movement but also more recently the home of, you know, wins by Senators Ossoff and Warnock,” Shipman said. “I think there are a lot of different factors that go into that calculus. I’m not sure that the gun laws are going to have any particular impact on the decision.” Georgia Gun Laws Weigh on Atlanta’s Bid to Host 2024 Democratic Convention – The Latest York Timeshttps://t.co/IXLjoBdpY5 — instaBreakingNews (@instaBreaking) February 23, 2023 In April 2022, Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed Georgia’s concealed-carry law into effect and repealed the law that required residents to obtain a license and undergo a fingerprint background check. “SB 319 makes sure that law abiding Georgians – including our daughters and your family, too – can protect themselves without having to ask permission from state government,” Kemp said in a statement about the law. “Passing this essential legislation has been a priority for the NRA for many years, and we’re thrilled to celebrate this huge success,” Jason Ouimet, executive director of NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, said following Georgia’s decision to pass the law. New York is the third choice for the convention, according to the NYT. Biden, Kemp and The Democratic National Convention did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Pentagon Wants To Crack Down On Gun Ownership On Military Bases To Prevent Suicide,"The Pentagon’s independent suicide review body suggested ways to control firearm access on military bases to prevent suicide in a report released Friday.

The Suicide Prevention and Response Independent Review Committee (SPRIRC) found that military suicide rates continue to climb.

“They are not strategies for gun control, but they are strategies for enhancing safety,” Dr. Craig Bryan, a member of the working group, told reporters.

The Pentagon’s independent suicide prevention review body has a plan to reduce suicides in the military that involves restricting gun access on military bases, according to a report released Friday.

A majority of suicides in the military involve firearm use, while problems with alcohol abuse and finances were also leading indicators, the Suicide Prevention and Response Independent Review Committee (SPRIRC) report found. The report offered recommendations to reduce the accessibility of guns on military bases while preserving servicemembers’ rights to carry, including repealing a provision in Congress’ 2013 defense bill that blocked commanders from inquiring about off-base firearms.

The policies are intended to “slow down access to firearms so that people can in excess survive periods of high risk,” Dr. Craig Bryan, a member of the working group, told reporters.

“Many of us are tired of our friends dying and realize that we have to take on this issue,” he added, saying the military would be largely on board with the recommendations. (RELATED: Pentagon Suicide Report Shows How Deep The Army’s Problems Go)

Suicide in the military has increased over a 15-year period despite the Department of Defense’s ongoing efforts to root out and address causes, the group found.

The DOD’s separate Defense Suicide Prevention Office found in its latest annual report that active-duty suicides continue to trend upward. In particular, the Army reported 176 suicides in 2021, the latest year for which data is available, up from 174 in 2020 and just 145 the year before.

Two-thirds of suicides among the active-duty population used firearms to take their own lives; that number was 72% for members of the Reserve and 78% for National Guardsmen, according to SPRIRC. In the general public, roughly half of suicides were committed using guns.

Often commanders discovered a servicemember had obtained a firearm on base only after the member had used it to commit suicide, Bryan said.



Research has shown that people who have access to guns are more likely to reach for them when under periods of intense distress, the commission found.

The 2013 National Defense Authorization Act prohibited military leaders from maintaining records of which servicemembers lawfully acquired or used firearms, a law intended to safeguard military members’ Second Amendment rights. However, the commission found that many commanders felt “handcuffed” from “being able to know who was at elevated risk and to properly assess the safety of their subordinates and personnel,” Bryan said.

Repealing the provision would allow officers to provide “targeted” assistance to a servicemember known to be experiencing a crisis, he added.

Along with striking out the NDAA provision, SPRIRC recommended raising the minimum age for purchasing firearms and ammunition on military bases to 25 years. The commission found that the age of 25 appeared to be an “inflection point;” firearm use increases after the age of 21, while most suicides occur in members below the age of 25, Bryan said.

Other recommendations included building firearm storage facilities outside of barracks.

“They are not strategies for gun control, but they are strategies for enhancing safety,” said Bryan.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin established SPRIRC in March 2022, a response to a Congressional directive to conduct a comprehensive review of DOD efforts to address suicide.

In conducting interviews and visits to U.S. installations across the world, researchers found that suicide prevention training was often poorly administered and on-base psychologists felt overworked, a problem exacerbated by slow hiring.

The department’s hierarchical structure can prevent the right people from entering the right positions to administer to servicemembers who show increased risk of suicide, according to the report. Inflexible policies can hamper implementation of some suicide prevention strategies and administrators’ ability to tailor strategies to the needs of individual members.

“The lack of a comprehensive DoD-wide suicide prevention strategy in combination with existing military structure has resulted in a ‘check the block’ approach that does not effectively prevent suicide,” the report said.

‘Zero Tolerance’: The Biden Admin Is Allegedly Shutting Down Gun Stores For Minor Clerical Errors,"In 2022, Federal Firearm License (FFL) revocations hit a 16-year high after the Biden administration implemented a “zero tolerance” policy for gun dealers.

The increase in license revocations, 92 in 2022 alone, is due to the new policy and the updated procedure that the ATF follows, as they no longer always go through a multi-step process, often opting to pull licenses for a multitude of “willful” violations.

“That’s not how regulatory agencies are supposed to work in the sector that they’re supposed to regulate. They are supposed to help the companies, they’re supposed to ensure compliance but they’re not supposed to punish and destroy an entire industry based on just political opposition or political distaste,” Gun Owners of America Director of Federal Affairs Aidan Johnston told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Gun stores are closing at rapid rates after the Biden administration implemented a “zero tolerance” policy for gun dealers and added updated language to define what can be classified as a “willful” violation, leaving Federal Firearm License (FFL) revocations at a 16-year high, according to Second Amendment advocacy group Gun Owners of America (GOA).

The increase in FFL revocations is due, in part, to language and administrative changes within the ATF, as the prior guidance said that the ATF “may” revoke FFls while the new “zero tolerance” policy says that the ATF “will” revoke FFLs for initial violations. The increase in license revocations, 92 in 2022 alone, is also due to the updated procedure that the ATF follows, as they no longer always go through a multi-step process, often opting to pull licenses for a multitude of “willful” violations, according to a GOA fact sheet and leaked documents on the updated policy. (RELATED: The ATF’s Pistol Brace Final Rule Sets The Stage To Classify Legal Gun Owners As Criminals)

“Back in the day there was a process that they would go through when they discover a mistake or an incorrect record, and it starts with a warning letter. They work with the FFL, and then on second inspection, if they find more mistakes, they’ll do a work conference and actually talk to the FFL. Then, if they still are uncompliant, after that they would do a license revocation hearing,” GOA Director of Federal Affairs Aidan Johnston told the DCNF.

Under the Biden administration’s new policy, the warning letter and conference safeguards are often circumvented, leaving the ATF to pull licenses on the first go-around, Johnston told the DCNF.

“That’s not how regulatory agencies are supposed to work in the sector that they’re supposed to regulate. They are supposed to help the companies, they’re supposed to ensure compliance but they’re not supposed to punish and destroy an entire industry based on just political opposition or political distaste,” Johnston continued.

The 2022 revocations were the highest since 2008, tripled 2021’s revocations and exceeded revocations from years when twice as many gun stores were inspected, according to the fact sheet. The ATF also issued another 136 warning conferences, the steepest penalty inspectors can recommend without revocation.

“The real problem is that under Biden the ATF can’t be trusted to not use the so-called zero tolerance policy to shut down legitimate gun stores. Biden is already illegally using the ATF to redefine what a firearm is without the authorization of Congress to implement his attack on the rights of gun owners,” gun rights advocacy group Second Amendment Foundation founder and Executive Vice President Alan Gottlieb told the DCNF.

One store owner, J.C. Harrison, from Johnson City, Tennessee, received a letter from the ATF in April of 2022 notifying him that they had revoked his license, according to NBC affiliate WCYB 5. Harrison appealed the decision, but was denied, saying the action was an “attack on the Second Amendment through the back door.”

Harrison claims that his “violations” were simply clerical errors, including failing to record when weapons were returned after being worked on, according to WCYB 5.

“You’re supposed to do a background check if it exceeds 30 days. It came back good, but it came back 30 days and then the 31st day the customer came to pick the gun up,” Harrison said. The license revocation was “huge” for Harrison, as he was financially dependent on the license.

“My wife and I, this was our sole income, and it’s not anymore,” he said.

“ATF cannot revoke a federal firearms license for ‘clerical errors.’ A federal firearms license can only be revoked for willful violations of the Gun Control Act. The GCA does not define ‘willful,'” ATF Public Affairs Division Deputy Chief Erik Longnecker told the DCNF. “The federal courts, however, have held that a willful violation of the GCA’s regulations occurs when the federal firearms licensee commits the violation with an intentional disregard of a known legal duty or with plain indifference to their legal obligations.”

Alongside an updated policy, the ATF also updated their guidelines as to what constitutes a “willful” violation in 2022, according to a leaked internal ATF guidance. The original guidelines designated “willful” mistakes as a continued pattern of mistakes left unaddressed, but the new guidelines are more open-ended for inspectors.

“If you have a clear record, if you don’t make any mistakes for a long period of time, and then you make a first one, that first one is evidence that it was a willful violation, because you knew how to follow the law before and you must have chosen to not follow on that first occasion,” Johnston told the DCNF.

The updated guidance shows that the “ATF must establish willfulness to proceed with revocation,” but the agency “does not have to establish a history of prior violations to determine willfulness,” according to the leaked document.

“While relatively few licensees engage in such conduct, the negative effect that willful violations have on public safety can be immense. Consequently, the courts have also held that a single willful violation of a GCA regulation is a sufficient basis for ATF to revoke a federal firearms license,” Longnecker told the DCNF.

The number of revocations jumped in 2022, but in the initial months of the “zero tolerance” policy, the ATF also began to revisit closed cases and retroactively revoke licenses, Johnston said.

“After a gun store receives a warning conference, and you rectify your mistake, then you should be good. But the ATF, once the Biden administration announced zero tolerance, they went back and pulled all the people who received warning conferences, and then started reopening those cases and investigating them to punish them with zero tolerance,” Johnston told the DCNF.

Amidst concerns in the gun community that the ATF’s “zero tolerance” policy was being abused, a coalition of Republican lawmakers sent a letter demanding the DOJ and the ATF turn over communications about how the legal definition of “willful” is being used to revoke FFLs from gun dealers.

“The Biden-Harris Administration claims this policy will increase public safety and reduce crime. But revoking a FFL over minor paperwork issues turns a teachable moment into the end of a dealer’s livelihood. This new policy runs counter to the close working relationship firearm dealers have had with ATF for decades,” the letter says.

(DAILY CALLER OBTAINED) — … by Henry Rodgers

The Biden administration has until March 1 to turn over the appropriate information, according to the letter.

“If you go back prior to the election we warned that both vice president Harris and Biden were going to use the ATF as a sledgehammer against the industry to do this. They promised they would do this, and they’re doing it. So none of this is a surprise to us. It is exactly what they said they would do and they’re doing it,” The Firearm Industry Trade Association (NSSF) Managing Director of Public Affairs Mark Oliva told the DCNF.

“We’ve been calling to the attention of lawmakers that this is an overzealous use of a law enforcement function to run out this industry. It’s actually harmful and denigrates the ability for them to go after true criminals who are perpetrating crimes in the community,” Oliva continued.

The DOJ did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.
