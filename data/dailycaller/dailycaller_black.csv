Black Lives Matter Set To Face Off With White Nationalists In Charlottesville,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA — Black Lives Matter (BLM) protesters joined church groups early Saturday morning as they prepare to face off with white nationalists and anti-Semites in Charlottesville, Va.

Hundreds of white nationalists marched on the University of Virginia campus Friday evening, where they clashed with counter-protesters. Shouting “White Lives Matter,” and “Jews will not replace us,” the white nationalists held tiki torches and rallied under a statue of former President Thomas Jefferson, the founder of UVA.

Thousands of demonstrators and counter-protesters are expected to rally Saturday afternoon at Emancipation Park, formerly Lee Park, where several white nationalist groups are hosting a “Unite the Right” rally.

BLM joins dozens of other groups to protest the rally, saying that they plan to out number the rally-goers.

“Men and women from state and local agencies will be in Charlottesville [on Saturday] to keep the public safe,” McAuliffe said in a statement, “and their job will be made easier if Virginians, no matter how well-meaning, elect to stay away from the areas where this rally will take place.”

Herman Cain: ‘It’s okay to call me black … Obama is not the president of black people’ [VIDEO],"Potential Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain doesn’t want whites to beat around the bush when addressing his race, according to a video interview he did with Accuracy in Media reporter Benjamin Johnson.

“African-American Republican presidential nominees … never did they get such media fanfare,” Johnson said to Cain. “Can you comment on this? Is this telling about the media or is this telling about the party system?”

“I think it’s more about the individual,” Cain said. “By the way, it’s okay to call me black, see, I am, I am an American Black Conservative, an ABC, it’s okay, it’s okay, I’m not hyphenated!”

After a moment of laughter, Cain said, “This is what America is all about! Why can’t we just get along?”

“Since he [President Barack Obama] has not served the people of this country very well, he has not served the African-American community very well, and secondly he wasn’t supposed to be the president of black people, he was supposed to be the president of the entire country, so I don’t look so much at how he has served the black community of this country, I am evaluating the lack of effectiveness of his policies across the board,” Cain said. “It’s not about what color he is, it’s about the lack of leadership.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2011/04/04/herman-cain-its-okay-to-call-me-black-obama-is-not-the-president-of-black-people-video/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjr68OMgLT9AhWmKlkFHY1eC9g4HhAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw3KjSRUw2L0LCXZe_jRc7dA,2011-04-04
Catholic is the new black,"Conservative critics should stop complaining about the lack of media coverage of the Catholic protest of the government’s HHS mandate, which commands Catholic institutions to pay for health coverage of procedures that the Church finds evil. Traditional Catholics need to just accept the fact that to the liberal media, we have become a secondary, second-class group. We’ve become like blacks in 1950s America.

While the left freaks out over the analogy, let me emphasize that the comparison I make is a limited one. Catholics in 2012 are not forced to use segregated facilities and we have not been jailed for our beliefs — yet. But we do live in a subculture that is increasingly cut off from the mainstream. Like blacks during the years of segregation, Catholics have their own book publishers, newspapers and magazines, television shows, even celebrities. And whereas there was once some crossover between the “Catholic ghetto” and the rest of America — Bishop Fulton Sheen once had one of the highest-rated television shows in America — these days traditional Catholics are almost completely shut out by the country’s elites.

The most obvious example, of course, is the HHS mandate and the resulting protests. Forty-three Church-affiliated institutions are suing the government over the mandate, a remarkable development that will deal with questions that go to the very heart of what the First Amendment means. Yet as the Media Research Center and others have shown, the story has been ignored by the liberal media. Conservatives are outraged by this, but to me it’s not even worth getting angry about anymore. Like blacks before the Civil Rights Act, we need to just focus on creating and sustaining our own culture. Rachel Maddow, CBS, ABC and The New York Times are not going to give our concerns about religious freedom and government coercion (to say nothing of abortion) any more consideration than Bull Connor gave black protesters in Birmingham in 1963. To them, we are every bit the freaks that Connor thought blacks were.

Today’s anti-Catholic elites are as ignorant as Bull Connor was. On May 25th, the gang on “Morning Joe” were discussing recent polls showing Americans are now majority pro-life. For years and years I have been reading about this shift; Catholic magazines, TV shows, speakers and books have been hammering how the science has changed things. We now have 3D ultrasounds that show new parents that their baby is in fact not just a collection of cells. Indeed, the role of the ultrasound in the pro-life movement now constitutes old news.

When the topic came up on “Morning Joe,” guest and babbling liberal Donny Deutsch was stunned by the news. “Has anyone written about this?” he marveled. Pat Robertson knows more about hip-hop than Deutsch knows about the pro-life movement. Has Maureen Dowd or Chris Matthews ever read a book or article by Pope Benedict? Of course not.

I was born in Washington, D.C., where my family’s history goes back to 1915. But I grew up in the suburbs and it wasn’t until later in life that I learned about black D.C. — the place that historian Constance Green called “the secret city.” D.C. has been at least one-quarter to one-third black since its inception in 1791, and the city’s free blacks established churches and schools before the Emancipation Proclamation. According to historian Kathryn S. Smith, after the Civil War “the black intelligentsia of the nation congregated in Washington.” Howard University, which had been founded in 1867 by the Freedman’s Bureau as the first biracial university south of the Mason-Dixon line, was only one of a handful of colleges in the country that offered opportunities for blacks. “Howard University drew exceptionally able students in law, medicine, and sociology,” Green noted in “The Secret City: A History of Race Relations in Washington, D.C.”



By 1920 Washington was a financial, spiritual and cultural stronghold of black America. The first black bank, the Industrial Savings Bank, was born here. Unlike New York’s Harlem, whose black population inherited many of its buildings from previous white owners, many of the institutions in Shaw were paid for by black businessmen and built by black hands: the True Reformers Building, the Laborers’ Building and Loan Association, the Whitelaw Hotel, the 12th Street YMCA and the Prince Hall Lodge. The writer Albert Murray summed up the town’s pedigree nicely in a piece in The Nation magazine: “The Washington of [the 1920s] … was not provincial in matters of entertainment and the arts. It was not as cosmopolitan as New York, to be sure, but even so, it reflected much of the New Yorker’s taste, perhaps comparable to a suburb of Manhattan.”

Conservative Catholics in America in 2012 are basically living in another secret city. Liberals like Maureen Dowd, Chris Matthews and the staffs of the news networks and The Washington Post do not read the books we read, watch the shows (“Mother Angelica”) we watch, or know the priests we know. Yet like the racist whites of an earlier day, they feel morally superior to us, and have no hesitation about lecturing us about how atavistic our faith is — without, of course, knowing anything about it. What is Bill Maher but a modern-day George Wallace?

In the 1920s, modernism hit America. Young Americans set out to shake free of Victorian restrictions, much to the shock of the Victorians themselves. The hot jazz being played in places like Harlem — and by a young Duke Ellington in Washington — was renounced by alarmed authorities as nothing more than “jungle music” suitable only for reverting man to primitivism. Dancing became more erotic, and books by James Joyce, D.H. Lawrence, F. Scott Fitzgerald and black writers like Langston Hughes, George Schuyler and Washingtonian Rudolph Fisher depicted street life and human desires as well as what was considered open sexuality in blunt, frank language.

This rift in the white world over modernism was reflected in black Washington. In an August 1928 issue of the NAACP magazine The Crisis, psychologist, author and Washingtonian Allison Davis took aim at the modernists: “For nearly ten years, our Negro [artists] have been ‘confessing’ the distinctive sordidness and triviality of Negro life, and making an exhibition of their own unhealthy imagination, in the name of frankness and sincerity. Frankness is no virtue in itself, however, as any father will tell his son, nor is sincerity. A dog or savage is ‘sincere’ about his bestialities, but he is not therefore raised above them. … It is a question, then, of the purpose for which one is being sincere. It is quite evident that the sincerity of Milton, of Fielding, and of Dr. Johnson is different in kind from the sincerity of Mr. DH Lawrence and Mr. James Joyce. If sincerity is to justify one in exploiting the lowest traits of human nature; and in ignoring that sense in man which Cicero says differentiates him from other animals — his sense of what is decent — then sincerity is to pander to a torpid animalism.”

Black Washington, like modern Catholic orthodoxy, was a conservative subculture that was shunned and mocked by a bigoted elite. And if Obama and the left have their way, it won’t be long before they turn the hoses on us.

Limbaugh blasts Holder’s plea to black leaders against voter IDs [VIDEO],"On his Wednesday program, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh called voter identification comments Attorney General Eric Holder made to black leaders “irresponsible” and “reprehensible.”

According to Holder, voter ID laws passed in a myriad of states will block access to the voting booth for minorities and young voters across the United States. That allegation, according to Limbaugh, was dishonest and motivated by politics.

“This is irresponsible,” Limbaugh said. “It’s worse than irresponsible. This is — it’s reprehensible what Holder is doing here … This is why Holder is having meetings with the black churches, the ministers. And he’s going to bring the IRS along, he’s going to bring the Congressional Black Caucus along, the ACLU along. And we’ve got two sound bites. Now keep in mind, this is the attorney general of the United States. This is not some rabid pundit on the left, on MSNBC.”

According to Limbaugh, politics is supposed to be ignored when it comes to law enforcement, but Holder’s statement was anything but “non-partisan.”

“This is not some say-anything-to-get-noticed rabble-rousing media person. It’s not some kooky left-wing Communist member of Congress,” Limbaugh said. “This is the attorney general of the United States, who is supposed to look at this country in a non-partisan way, and enforce the laws of this country. The No. 1 law enforcement officer of this country. And his job is to protect and guarantee freedom, along with everyone else who takes an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution.”

Later, Limbaugh condemned Holder and other black leaders for using these tactics to scare the black community.

“This really is irresponsible,” he added. “It’s absurd and it’s a classic illustration of the disservice done to the black community by black leaders: Lying to them, scaring them, keeping them huddled in fear in the corners of their homes with imaginary monsters and threats who are going to do imaginary, monstrous things to them. If I didn’t know better, I would say they’re setting up an excuse for Obama losing here.”

But Limbaugh dismissed that as a possibility this far away from Election Day.

“If I didn’t know better, I would say they were already scared Obama’s going to lose, the black vote’s not going to turn out, and this is all the setup an excuse for it,” he continued. “But I reject that because it’s way too early for anybody to be thinking that way.”

Artur Davis latest African-American Republican slammed by black caucus,"More than a dozen members of the Congressional Black Caucus denounced former Alabama Rep. Artur Davis ahead of his speech at the Republican National Convention Tuesday, continuing a tradition of conflict between the Democratic-dominated CBC and black Republicans.

“We are writing to express our disdain over several recent comments you have made about the important issues facing voters in November, your total distortion of President Barack Obama’s record, and your complete flip-flop on certain core principles you once held dear,” the 14 CBC members, all Democrats, wrote.

The signatories blasted Davis’ switch to the GOP and support for Mitt Romney as “transparent opportunism” in the wake of his failure to win the 2010 Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Alabama rather than “real policy or political disagreements” with Democrats. (RELATED: Leaders with Ginni Thomas: Former Rep. Artur Davis)

But real policy and political disagreements have also triggered tension within the CBC ranks. In 1993, the caucus sharply curtailed the role of its only Republican member after he disagreed with the policy of using the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to maximize the number of majority-minority congressional districts.

“I do not believe it is healthy for Americans to go around looking for blacks to put in a congressional district,” Connecticut Republican Rep. Gary Franks said in testimony that elicited sharp criticism from fellow CBC members. The group passed a motion to limit Franks’ participation.

“The motion, passed without dissent among a majority of the Black Caucus’ 40 members, would let Franks attend weekly luncheon meetings for only the first half-hour, when members typically eat and talk informally,” the Washington Post reported at the time. “The rest of the meetings would be deemed a caucus of black Democratic lawmakers.”

Nearly twenty years later, luncheons with Republican members remain a source of discomfort within the CBC. The group’s Democrats protested when Florida Rep. Allen West, their only Republican member, ordered Chick-fil-A when it was his turn to provide the caucus lunch.

“That was an ‘in your face,'” Florida Democratic Rep. Alcee Hastings complained to Huffington Post. “Every member of the Congressional Black Caucus that was there was offended.”

South Carolina Rep. Tim Scott, the other black Republican currently serving in Congress, declined to join the CBC. Former Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts, who was the only other black Republican in the House during Franks’ tenure before leaving Capitol Hill in 2003, also took a pass.

In 1991, the CBC voted 19-1 in favor of a symbolic motion opposing the confirmation of Clarence Thomas, the second African-American justice of the Supreme Court. Franks was the only dissenter.

Caucus chairman Emmanuel Cleaver signed the letter criticizing Davis, as did Michigan Rep. John Conyers and Georgia Rep. John Lewis. Davis spoke in support of Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.

Historically black colleges and universities flunk Obama’s College Scorecard,"In his State of the Union Address, President Barack Obama said the Department of Education’s newly released College Scorecard would help parents and students “compare schools based on a simple criteria: where you can get the most bang for your educational buck.”

According to the latest statistics, America’s historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) consistently fail to meet that “criteria.”

A Wall Street Journal analysis of the Scorecard puts HBCUs next to for-profit art schools when it comes to leaving students with high amounts of debt and degrees written in “red ink.”

The free-market American Enterprise Institute’s Frederick Hess told The Daily Caller HBCUs are a “dangerous” topic of conversation in education circles.

“The subject’s racially charged,” he said. “If we were to apply the gainful-employment method the federal government applies to for-profit schools to HBCUs, their students would no longer receive federal financial aid.”

In 2012, the Department of Education described 218 post-secondary schools that could lose federal student aid if their students continue to exhibit three-year default rates over 30 percent. Fourteen were HBCUs. That means, of approximately 6,900 accredited schools nationwide, 3.2 percent could lose federal support, while 13.3 percent of HBCUs face that risk.

Morehouse College in Atlanta — Martin Luther King, Jr.’s alma mater and one of the most famous HBCUs — is not in as much trouble as those 218 yet, but its numbers reflect the troubling trend. In 2011-2012, only 36 percent of Morehouse students had graduated in four years, and only 55 percent had graduated in six years, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics. And whether they graduated or not, 76 percent owed loans averaging over $40,000 to cover annual tuition of $23,234, a number the College Scorecard terms “high.” In addition, 27 percent of Morehouse students defaulted on loan payments.

Jeanna Robinson of the Pope Center for Higher Education Policy called the Morehouse default rate “appalling.” The student loan default rate is 13.8 percent nationally, while at for-profit institutions — a diverse group ranging from University of Phoenix to cosmetology schools — the average rate is 22.7 percent.

Nationally, the average student debt is $27,253. At all-male Morehouse, it’s nearly $10,000 higher. Only The Creative Center, the Manhattan School of Music and the Southern California Institute of Architecture — three for-profit art schools — show higher student debt, according to the Journal’s findings.

At Morehouse’s sister school, Spelman College in Atlanta, students graduate at a higher rate, with an average of $4,000 less in loan debt than their Morehouse counterparts. Spelman students also default on their loans at a lower rate than students at Morehouse. Most students at HBCUs, however, fare significantly worse than Morehouse students.

Just 41 percent of students at Clark Atlanta University graduate in six years, leaving campus with an average $24,653 of debt. Payscale.com, estimates Clark Atlanta students receive a 30-year return on their investment of negative $109,000.

The online job compensation calculator estimates students at Shaw University in North Carolina receive a return of negative $112,000. A negative “ROI” means students at these two schools do worse financially over a 30-year period than if they had never attended.



Hess says the reason for such poor scores could be many HBCU students often come from low-income backgrounds and are first-generation college attendees. But because “nobody looks,” he said, there is too little research on the topic to know for sure.

“It’s politically incorrect to talk about,” the Center for College Affordability’s Anthony Vedder told TheDC. Vedder said when he tried to raise the issue with black educators, “I almost got chased out of the room.”

Students want to attend HBCU’s because of their historical prestige, said Robert Morse, the data director of U.S. News and World Report’s annual college rankings. Because many black students want only the HBCU experience, and the schools receive special federal designation and support, Morse explained, his magazine ranks them separately from mainstream colleges and universities.

Robert McCluskey, an education and child policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, pointed out that unlike other institutions of higher learning, HBCUs receive direct federal funding to cover their basic operating costs. In fact, HBCUs are a line item in the federal budget.

The Higher Education Act of 1965 guaranteed support for HBCUs, most of which were established in the decades following the Civil War. Intended to educate freed slaves, they are products of the Jim Crow South, when former slave states created segregated post-secondary public schools rather than integrate white ones. Church organizations were founding nominally private all-black schools, like Morehouse and Spelman, at the same time.

The Department of Education reports that in 2008, five federal agencies and departments awarded more than 10 percent of their higher education spending to HBCUs. The Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and Housing and Urban Development each contributed more than 30 percent of their higher education spending. HBCUs received 33 percent of all federal support for facilities, and 14 percent for un-categorized “other” support that year.

The next year, 2009, the most recent one for which figures are available, HBCUs also received a disproportionate amount of federal support, though 105 of them made up just one percent of America’s total number of accredited institutions of higher learning. Justice awarded 72 percent of its funds budgeted to higher education initiatives to HBCUs in 2009.

As HBCUs continue to lose tuition money, due to stricter federal student lending rules, grants from federal agencies have become a stopgap measure to continue funding them. Yet the grants present a new problem. In 2011, Morehouse paid $1.2 million to settle a Justice Department investigation of the college’s misuse of NASA funds.

Then in 2012, the Department of Education awarded $227.9 million to HBCUs around the country to “help these important institutions continue to provide their students with the quality education they need to compete in the global economy.” Morehouse received $2.3 million.

"Eric Holder, IRS officials coached tax-exempt black ministers on how to engage in political activity","Attorney General Eric Holder and IRS officials advised black ministers on how to engage in political activity during the 2012 election without violating their tax-exempt status.

Holder, then-IRS commissioner Douglas Shulman, and Peter Lorenzetti, a senior official in the scandal-plagued agency’s exempt organizations division, participated in a May 2012 training session for black ministers from the Conference of National Black Churches at the U.S. Capitol hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC). Holder spoke at the event.

“We’re going to, first of all, equip them with the information they need to know about what they can say and what they cannot say in the church that would violate their 501(c)(3) status with the IRS,” said then-CBC chairman Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat from Missouri. “In fact, we’re going to have the IRS administrator there. We’re going to have Attorney General Eric Holder there…the ACLU.”

Cleaver’s session advised black ministers on “draconian laws” including voter ID laws. Cleaver was a sharp critic during the 2012 campaign of Republican Mitt Romney’s policies.

As The Daily Caller has extensively reported, the IRS harassed conservative and tea party groups during the 2012 election cycle with improper reviews of their 501(c)(3) tax-exempt applications.

“[The CBC] had the IRS members there specifically to advise them on how far to go campaigning without violating their tax-exempt status,” George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told The Daily Caller.

“I viewed the meeting as highly problematic. Eric Holder heads the agency that prosecutes organizations who give false information to the government. The Justice Department coordinates with the IRS on actions taken against not-for-profits. These ministries are given not-for-profit status on the basis that they are not engaging in any political activities. Here, the Obama administration was clearly encouraging them to maximize their efforts by showing them where the lines were drawn in federal case law,” Turley said.

“It is a fundamental precept that cabinet members should not engage in political activities. The most important of those cabinet members would be the attorney general of the United States. To have the attorney general actively advising political allies of the president showed remarkably poor judgment on his part,” Turley told TheDC.

“I believe this session undermined the integrity of the justice department, signaled to other Justice Department officials that the attorney general wants to support these black ministries as much as possible,” Turley said.

Obama won 93 percent of the black vote in 2012, according to exit polling.

“This event was open to all faiths, denominations, colors, creeds, and political affiliations,” Rep. Cleaver told TheDC in a statement. “We were pleased to have leaders from our government provide information on compliance with the law and participation in our electoral system.”

The IRS and DOJ did not return requests for comment.

ACORN’s former chief calls for more immigration to boost black power,"ACORN’s former CEO Bertha Lewis urged Africans-Americans to support increased immigration as a strategy to gain political power.

“We got some Latino cousins, we got some Asian cousins, we got some Native-American cousins, we got all kind of cousins,” said Lewis, who spoke Thursday at the annual political conference of the Congressional Black Caucus.

“Cousins need to get together because if we’re going to be [part of the non-white] majority, it makes sense for black people in this country to get down with immigration reform,” said Lewis, whose ACORN group was formally disbanded in 2010 after a series of scandals.

Lewis did not mention solidarity with whites, or with people who define themselves as Americans, in her appeal for power.

“Everyone, even all white folks in this country, acknowledge that in a minute, [the] United States of America will be a new majority, will be majority minority, a brand-new thing,” she said.

In 2012, “for the first time ever in history, African-Americans outvoted white Americans. Oooh. That’s the fear of the white man. That could change everything. That’s why [immigration] should matter to us,” she declared.

Lewis got only modest applause from the room of 300 attendees, nearly all of whom were black.

But her appeal for non-white solidarity was backed up by New York Democratic Rep. Yvette Clarke.

“What will happen with comprehensive immigration reform will be a new landscape of humanity in the United States of America,” Clarke told the attendees.

“America is a shape-shifter, and based on who’s here, in what numbers and at what time, determines the political outcomes,” she said. Blacks should cooperate with Latinos, she said, adding “we all have skin in the game, literally.”

The racial appeal was echoed by William Spriggs, chief economist at the AFL-CIO. “If we are going to be the new majority, we’re going to have to start acting like the new majority and start setting the new rules,” he said.

Once Congress approves an immigration increase, minorities should demand more, said Chicago Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez, a leading advocate of the pending Senate bill,

“The next day after we pass it, you know we’re not going to be satisfied, we’re going to come back,” he said. “We’re going to have a civil rights act, we’re going to have a voting rights act… Nobody is leaving this fight once we conclude this first chapter,” he said.

“Hopefully, in 30 years, [we] can bring immigrants… from all over the world,” Gutierrez said.

The call for solidarity among non-whites was commingled with some non-racial calls for solidarity of working-class Americans.

African-Americans should not object to gains by immigrants, said Spriggs, who became a union economist after leaving an assistant secretary job at the Obama Department of Labor.

“Somebody else winning doesn’t mean you’re losing,” the economist explained. “We can’t let one set of workers be pushed aside and think we’re going to make it.”

Other attendees complained about immigrants’ refusal to hire African-Americans or to accept civil-rights laws, and the commonplace stealing of Social Security Numbers.

Currently, the formal unemployment rate among African-Americans is 13 percent. However, the formal number understates the level of unemployment. For example, fewer than half of black men aged between 18 and 30 have full-time jobs.

Last June, President Barack Obama bypassed Congress’ opposition to an amnesty for younger illegal immigrants, and has awarded work-permits to almost 500,000 young illegal immigrants.

This July, with support from Obama, the Senate passed an immigration bill that would provide work permits to roughly 33 million immigrants and create a pool of roughly 2 million blue-collar and university-trained guest-workers, over the next decade.

Advocates say increased immigration will spur the economy and fund a bigger government.

But studies of increased immigration suggest the economic gains will go to immigrants and company owners. Some attendees said the caucus should focus more clearly on issues of concern to black Americans.

“We are the last hired and have the last opportunities, yet amnesty supporters would have you think that adding millions more workers at this time is good,” said Leah Durant, founder of the Black American Leadership Alliance. “When so many Americans of all races are out of work, that is ridiculous,” Durant told TheDaily Caller.

“Blacks as well as other low-skilled workers have made their greatest advances when we have low levels of immigration,” she said. “It is time for black leaders to stand up for blacks.”

A June poll by NumbersUSA, a group which want to shrink immigration, reported that only 15 percent of blacks and 44 percent of Hispanics back the Senate bill’s offer of amnesty to 11 million illegal-immigrants. A July poll conducted for advocates of increased immigration reported that 59 percent of registered Latino voters support a goal of “stopping 90 percent of the undocumented immigration in the future.”

Yet most members of the Congressional Black Caucus have agreed to back the Senate immigration bill.

ACORN’s Lewis mocked the mainstream concerns.

“You had some black folks talk about ‘Those people took my job… [and] I used to be in a big house, but now I ain’t,’” she sneered. Those complaints were “madness,” said Lewis, who works as a political activist with other pro-immigration activists, donors and foundations.

In response, Durant condemned black leaders’ rush for increased immigration, saying “They see political advantage in it for themselves, and they’re selling out the blank community.”

Gutierrez urged African-American and Latino legislators to hide their disagreements from the public.

“We have tough conversations when we lock the room — but we are smart enough to lock the room,” he told the audience. “We keep our arguments to ourselves.”

Closing Speech At Sharpton Rally Calls For Return Of ‘Black Jesus’ [VIDEO],"WASHINGTON — The event was billed as one of solidarity, thousands of people unified in their demand for “justice for all” and an end to alleged police brutality against “unarmed black men.” Led by MSNBC host Al Sharpton, the march was organized and promoted by his National Action Network.

The final speaker, Reverend Jamal Bryant of Empowerment Temple in Maryland, gave a speech and closing prayer laden with political anger and racial overtones.

“How in the world are we gonna get victory? We don’t have the money of the Koch brothers, we don’t have the backing of the Republican Party. How in the world are we going to find triumphant victory,” he asked. “Why is it that we’re working but Congress is on vacation? How in the world are gonna get justice when families are crying, but it looks like the Senate is just laughing? But we believe the only way that we’re going to prevail is our secret weapon – God has never failed us. And he’s never forsaken us.”

But Bryant didn’t end there.

Bryant declared Sunday “Black Solidarity Sunday” and urged the crowd to “go to church wearing black.”

After that, he said, “I don’t want you to just go to church wearing black. When you leave church still be black. And because Hollywood didn’t get the memo, Jesus is black.”

As the crowd cheered, Bryant started his prayer:",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2014/12/13/closing-prayer-at-sharpton-rally-calls-for-return-of-black-jesus-video/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj_nZONgLT9AhU5MlkFHfUZAQU4KBAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw2PLDIrfhgGYViF8zRb9b09,2014-12-13
High School Principal Excludes White Students From ‘Black Lives Matter’ Event,"An Illinois high school principal is defending his decision to exclude white students from a “Black Lives Matter” event held at his school.

On February 27th, Oak Park and River Forest High School principal, Nathaniel Rouse, hosted a “Black Lives Matter” event exclusively for black students. The assembly was intended to culminate Black History Month with a discussion on race relations. Approximately 350 black individuals attended the event. When white students attempted to attend the assembly, however, they were denied entry.

Parents who were upset over the school’s decision to exclude non-black students from the event voiced their opinion to the Chicago Tribune. Rouse responded to the concerns of the parents by stating, “First and foremost, this is not meant to give a connotation that we were trying to be exclusive.”

In a statement on the Oak Park and River Forest High School website, the school addressed the controversy: “[S]ome students and parents expressed confusion and concern about the event being for Black students only. Information about the event lacked clarity about this aspect of the conversation, and the high school is committed to improving communications in the future. Further conversations among and across other racial affinity groups shall take place at the high school in the coming months and into next year.”

Rouse defended his decision to keep non-black students from the assembly by referring to the concept of “affinity groups.” According to the school’s statement, “Racial affinity groups are often used in learning communities to help facilitate positive identity exploration and provide people with similar experiences a space in which to pose questions and process topics.”

“According to Principal Rouse, the conversation was an opportunity for students who identify as Black to speak openly, honestly, and productively.”

Rouse told the Chicago Tribune affinity groups are helpful to discussions on race, as he “found it has been far easier for me to talk about my experiences with racism with individuals that look like me.” He added, “I still struggle myself with talking about my experiences with people who don’t look like me.” (RELATED: Berkeley Radicals Protest Professor For Mentioning BLACK-ON-BLACK CRIME)

Rouse hopes to host similar racial affinity group discussions in the future with different races, saying he believes “the affinity group is the safe way for us to move forward in a safe environment.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2015/03/07/high-school-principal-excludes-white-students-from-black-lives-matter-event/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjRjJeRgLT9AhVKEFkFHZclAtY4ZBAWegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw15AiHMU1CAUxNWyEZzximD,2015-03-07
CNN Guest: Black Men In America ‘Hunted Down Like Deer And Like Dogs’ [VIDEO],"Malik Shabazz, president of Black Lawyers for America and former chairman of the New Black Panther Party, said on “CNN Newsroom” reacted to the Walter Scott shooting by saying that black men in America are “killed and hunted down” like animals. (VIDEO: Democratic Rep: There’s An ‘Open Season On Black Men In America’)

“The community here is in pain,” he said. “And the community here and all over the country is outraged that black men are being killed and hunted down like deer and like dogs. And there’s outrage here and outrage throughout America because no black man and almost no black person can say they will make it through the day or through the week without seeing another black man unarmed shot and killed.”

Give host Carol Costello some credit — she actually pressed Shabazz on whether or not the Scott family even wanted him there in the first place. “Has the Scott family invited you in?” she asked.

He hesitated. “The community here has invited me in. And from what I am understanding, they are under a tremendous amount of pressure right now…”

“I understand that, sir,” Costello pressed. “I was just wondering if the Scott family is behind you in your efforts.” (VIDEO: CNN Host Asks If Shooting Of Black Suspect By Black Cop Was Racially Motivated)

“I am sure they are, ma’am.” Shabazz said.

“So you are not going to meet with them today?”

“It’s likely that I may,” he responded.

"Black Lives Matter Protesters Chant: ‘Pigs In A Blanket, Fry ‘Em Like Bacon’ [VIDEO]","Black Lives Matter protesters marching on the Minnesota state fair on Saturday spewed violent anti-cop rhetoric just hours after a Harris County, Tex. sheriff’s deputy was ambushed and executed at a Houston-area gas station.

“Pigs in a blanket, fry ’em like bacon,” activists with the St. Paul, Minn. branch of Black Lives Matter chanted while marching behind a group of police officers down a highway just south of the state fair grounds.

Carrying signs reading “End White Supremacy” and “Black Lives Matter,” the protesters railed against racial inequality, the criminal justice system and policing. Besides issuing the chant calling cops by the pejorative “pig,” the protesters repeated the names of several blacks who have been killed by police in recent years.

The activists sang out the violent chorus chant just hours after a lone gunman shot 47-year-old Harris County sheriff’s deputy Darren Goforth while he was getting gas. The suspect approached the 10-year veteran from behind at around 8:30 p.m. Friday and shot him in the back of the head. He then shot Goforth several more times as he lay on the ground.

Goforth leaves behind a wife and two children.

During a press conference on Saturday — before protesters in St. Paul called for cops’ deaths — Harris County sheriff Ron Hickman condemned what he characterized as “some of the very dangerous national rhetoric that’s out there today.”

“So any point where the rhetoric ramps up to the point that calculated, cold-blooded, assassination of police officers happen, this rhetoric has gotten out of control,” he added.

“We’ve heard ‘black lives matter,’ ‘all lives matter’ — well, cops’ lives matter too. So why don’t we just drop the qualifier and say ‘lives matter,’ and take that to the bank.” (RELATED: Following Execution Of Deputy, Officials Condemn ‘Open Warfare’ On Cops)

Black Sheriff Responds To ‘Uncle Tom’ Taunt By New York Daily News Columnist And Black Lives Matter Activist,"Milwaukee County sheriff David Clarke says he’s been called worse than a “sellout” and an “Uncle Tom,” two racially-charged terms that a New York Daily News columnist and Black Lives Matter activist used to describe the black Democrat on Tuesday.

“That crap doesn’t bother me,” Clarke told The Daily Caller in response to columnist Shaun King’s diatribe taking him to task for denying the existence of policy brutality and police racism during a Fox News segment on Monday.

“It’s designed to get me off message,” Clarke said during a phone interview.

King, who the Daily News recently hired to cover racial justice issues, was angry with Clarke, an outspoken critic of the Black Lives Matter movement, for saying “there is no police brutality in America” and that “there is no racism in the hearts of police officers.”

“As if his declaration that there is no police brutality wasn’t awful enough, Sheriff David Clarke then took it to a level that truly warrants me saying what I would rarely say about another Black man,” King wrote. “This man is an Uncle Tom, a sellout. It is tragic, actually, to see him say what no white sheriff, or any person of reason for that matter, would dare say.”

It is not uncommon for black conservatives to be accused of being overly subservient to whites — of being so-called “Uncle Toms.” Black conservatives like Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas are routinely smeared, but usually by liberals on the political margins. It is rare, in the present day, to see the pejorative printed by a mainstream publication.

In addition to crossing that line, King also called for Clarke to be fired, though the sheriff holds an elected position.

King is no stranger to controversy. TheDC reported in July that details of a story he has repeatedly told of being attacked by racist white classmates while a high school student in Kentucky in 1995 was not backed up by witness statements, a police report from the incident, and the detective who investigated it. (RELATED: Leading Ferguson Activist’s Hate Crime Claim Disputed By Police Report, Detective)

A former pastor and former blogger at the left-wing website Daily Kos, King has been heavily criticized for providing false information about various police-involved incidents. He began focusing on social justice and policing issues in the aftermath of the Aug. 9, 2014 police-involved shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.

He was one of the main activists who used social media to push the “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” narrative that prevailed during that case. But the claim that Brown was surrendering with his hands in the air before being shot by officer Darren Wilson was disputed by numerous witnesses.

“Consider the source,” Clarke said of King on Tuesday. He also provided more explanation for his choice of words during the Fox interview.

“Do you know what the definition of ‘brutality’ is?” Clarke asked, answering his own question. “Savage, physical violence.”

“That definition might apply to ISIS, but it does not apply to the institution of American policing. I find that to be insulting,” he said.

Clarke acknowledged that there are some incidents of police excessive use of force, but “they’re anomalies.”

He cited the case of Walter Scott, a 50-year-old black man who was fatally shot multiple times in the back by North Charleston, S.C. police officer Michael Slager in April, as one such example.

“That was horrible. I was shocked by what I saw,” Clarke said of the shooting, which was captured on video.

But Clarke’s focus now is on defending the integrity of cops, which he says is under assault by “cop-hating anarchists.”

“They redefine words. They’ve taken ‘police brutality’ as a substitute for the police use of force,” he said, adding that “I’ve had it with this continuous drum-beat by these cop-hating anarchists and their use of inflammatory rhetoric and hyperbole about the character and integrity of the American police officer.”

BLM Organizer: ‘The Myth Of Black-On-Black Crime Is Just That — A Myth’ [VIDEO],"Aaron Goggans — the core organizer of Black Lives Matter, DC — told CNN’s Carol Costello Thursday that black-on-black crime is a myth.

Goggans was responding to a video former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis posted earlier in the week in which he called for removing guns from the streets as a key part of solving the problem of black-on-black crime. (VIDEO: Ray Lewis Calls For 25 Year Mandatory Prison Sentence For Illegal Firearm Possession)

“It’s important to talk about the myth of black-on-black crime as just that — a myth,” Goggans explained. “Any Google search of the term comes up with a lot of different articles.”

“So, Ray Lewis is wrong?” interjected Costello.

Goggans responded that “Ray Lewis is talking about a lot of myths and preconceptions about what the [Black Lives Matter] movement is.”

“Intercommunity crime happens in all communities across the country, and it is a problem that the movement of Black Lives is focusing on,” he added. “The movement of black lives is also focusing on state sanctioned violence. It’s a different thing.”

“It’s not just a few white cops killing a few unarmed black men. It’s actually the state systematically creating up systems that are killing black people, both black women, black children, black queer, black men, black trans and black gender non-conforming folks.”

Clinton Chooses Black Lives Matter Over Law Enforcement Support,"Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton pursued the endorsement of Black Lives Matter activists but blew off the largest police union in the United States.

After almost a year of meeting with Black Lives Matter representatives, Clinton failed to garner the support of the movement’s co-founder Alicia Garza, but she managed to receive the endorsement of mothers championed by the Black Lives Matter movement.

Garza recently slammed Clinton, saying the former secretary of state only “uses black people for votes” and “photo ops,” but doesn’t “do anything for black communities” after getting elected.

Nevertheless the Clinton-Kaine campaign touts the support she received during the Democratic National Convention from mothers of the Black Lives Matter movement.

The mothers of Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner stood on stage in Philadelphia praising Clinton.

“Hillary Clinton has the compassion and understanding to support grieving mothers,” Sybrina Fulton, mother of Martin, said. “She has the courage to lead the fight for commonsense gun legislation. She has a plan to divide that so often exists between law enforcement and the communities they serve.”

On the other hand, the Clinton campaign appeared to string the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) on for a period of time until staff told the union Clinton would not seek its endorsement, The Hill reported.

Chuck Canterbury, president of FOP spoke to The Hill after he and others union members went to Trump Towers Friday, to discuss Trump’s positions on law enforcement.

The union will not be meeting with Clinton, however, because according to Canterbury, the campaign did not want to fill out the questionnaire required for the police union’s endorsement.

“We were talking to the highest levels of the campaign, and we had all indications that she was going to return the questionnaire,” Canterbury said. “And on the deadline date we were advised that they declined.”

According To Canterbury, the union was only snubbed once before by a presidential candidate—John Kerry in 2004. The last time FOP endorsed a Democrat was in 1996, when the union endorsed Clinton’s husband, Bill.

The Clinton camp refused to say why they vigorously sought out the support of Black Lives Matter over Law Enforcement. However, Clinton Campaign spokesman Jesse Ferguson told The Hill, “Throughout her career, Hillary Clinton has been committed to our law enforcement officers.”

Kaepernick’s Support Of Black Lives Matter Began After Dating Activist DJ,"Colin Kaepernick’s Muslim girlfriend Nessa Diab reportedly influenced the quarterback to sit during the national anthem in protest for “people that are being oppressed.”

A Fox News article revealed some more evidence that reflects Kaepernick’s “conversion to social activism” occurred once he began dating activist DJ Nessa Diab, “who has frequently spoken about perceived racial injustices and ‘Islamaphobia’ in the U.S.”

The San Francisco quarterback and MTV DJ began dating in July 2015, according to Fox News Sports. Shortly after that time, Kaepernick’s social media activity has become increasingly reflective of the “Black Lives Matter and Muslim activism of Diab,” Fox News reports.

“History!” Kaepernick captioned the photo, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the formation of the Black Panther Party last October. (RELATED: Kaepernick’s Communist-Sympathizing Muslim Girlfriend Believed To Be Behind Protest)

Before beginning his relationship with Diab, Kaepernick’s Instagram mostly consisted of photos of him playing football or hanging with friends — about 128 of Kaepernick’s 170 posts, according to Fox News. Since dating Diab, Kaepernick’s social media focus has shifted toward black nationalist and Black Lives Matter-related messages.

“31 of his last 42 posts have strong social justice connotations, often featuring quotes from radical Nation of Islam leader Malcolm X, Black Panthers founder Huey Newton and cop killer Assata Shakur,” according to Fox News.

A photo posted by colin kaepernick (@kaepernick7) on Feb 21, 2016 at 10:34pm PST

After the reaction to Kaepernick’s refusal to stand for the national anthem, Kaepernick attended a news conference in a “balack hat with a large, white ‘X’ and a t-shirt that featured photos of Cuban despot Fidel Castro and Malcolm X.”

Diab’s social media includes a lot of content related to her job as an MTV DJ, but also reflects her views as a black rights activist and Islam defender. She recently defended her boyfriend in a tweet saying “I’m always proud of him and always will be @Kaepernick7. Please take the time to UNDERSTAND what he is saying,” Diab tweeted with a link to a transcript of his news conference following his protest.

I’m always proud of him and always will be @Kaepernick7 . Please take the time to UNDERSTAND what he is saying https://t.co/9813ly7guS — NESSA (@nessnitty) August 28, 2016

Diab also “frequently retweets Black Lives Matter supporter and newspaper columnist Shaun King on race-related issues,” Fox News added.

The 49ers quarterback says that he plans to continue sitting. Kaepernick stated he won’t stand until “there’s significant change and I feel like that flag represents what it’s supposed to represent.” If this country begins “representing people the way that it’s supposed to, I’ll stand.”

Here are some of the San Francisco quarterback’s other Instagram posts:

Activist Leaves Black Lives Matter Because It Was ‘Hijacked’,"The leader of Black Lives Matter St. Paul announced he was leaving the movement because BLM has been “hijacked.”

Rashad Turner, who previously ran for a Minnesota state representative position, left Black Lives Matter because of its call for a temporary ban on charter schools, reports the 74 Million.

“For me, it was a question of integrity,” Turner said, according to the 74 Million. “Being that I am all for charter schools and ed reform, and as someone who is seeking educational justice for students and families, I could no longer be under that banner of Black Lives Matter.”

The Movement for Black Lives, a larger group that includes Black Lives Matter, issued a platform that spoke out against charter schools.

Turner, who reportedly fights for “educational justice,” said that he could not continue to work in education and stay affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement.

“Stepping outside of that banner personally meant that I needed to step down from a leadership role and any affiliation with Black Lives Matter if I’m going to do a great job in education and fighting for educational justice,” Turned said.

Turner is also known for leading the charge to get St. Paul high school teacher Theo Olson fired. Olson complained about the lack of discipline at his school over Facebook, which infuriated BLM activists. (RELATED: Teacher May Lose Job For Offending Black Lives Matter Activists)

Olson reached an agreement with the school and retired in August after being suspended without pay for two weeks.

Turner also organized a Black Lives Matter protest where demonstrators chanted “pigs in blanket, fry ’em like bacon.” Turner claimed that officers who disagreed with the chant were “cherry-picking” an otherwise peaceful protest.

Black Scholar: Glad I Was Educated Before It Was ‘Fashionable For White People To Like Black People’,"African-American students are getting a raw deal because — in the name of diversity — the system is superficially propping up those students who are doing poorly, according to economist and conservative columnist Walter E. Williams.

“I am glad that I got all of my education — I received all of my education before it become fashionable for white people to like black people,” Williams said in an interview Wednesday on Tallahassee’s Morning Show with Preston Scott. He was recalling a comment about his education that he offered in the documentary “Suffer No Fools.”

Williams, who is 80 years old, explained, “when I got an ‘A’ it was an honest to God ‘A’ and when I got a ‘C’ it was an honest to God ‘C.’ They didn’t give a damn about my self-esteem.”

According to Williams, many colleges, in seeking to advance “diversity,” are recruiting African-American students to their campuses who are unprepared for the college curriculum. And, when those students arrive, they are not provided the right tools to survive in the real world.

He added that this is not just a problem for African-Americans, but for recent high school graduates in general. Williams said about 50 percent of newly arrived college students are unprepared, as, according to Williams, most colleges are finding many incoming freshmen need remedial English or Math classes.

“So what that’s saying is that high schools are issuing fraudulent diplomas. That is [the schools] are saying these kids are college-ready, but they really are not college-ready at all. But for black students it’s even worse. That is a large percentage of black students — maybe 60 percent of black students — are just unprepared for college,” he said, adding the percentage could be larger.

Williams argued that it is “cruel” for college administrators to admit students who are unprepared, unable to keep up, and as such, likely to feel out-of-place and alienated from their classmates.

“What many black college students now are demanding segregated housing on college campuses, segregated spaces so that they can feel more comfortable among themselves. And I think this is utter cruelty to these students,” he said.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2016/10/12/walter-e-williams-glad-i-was-educated-before-fashionable-for-white-people-to-like-black-people/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi8mLeOgLT9AhVlD1kFHQsBC5A4PBAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw1aHPR2umml-ZHCtHI0Pnyk,2016-10-12
Passenger Kicked Off Flight Over Black Lives Matter Button,"A passenger flying on Spirit Airlines got kicked off his flight after confronting a flight attendant over her Black Lives Matter pin.

Robert Coyle, upset about the “Black Lives Matter, White Supremacy Kill” pin a flight attendant wore, told her that “All Lives Matter,” reports Fox 13.

“I said to her, ‘All lives matter.’ And she said, ‘I disagree with you, I disagree with you on so many levels.’ And then she went into some sort of memorized, ‘I really can’t speak politically while I am in uniform,'” Coyle said.

The flight attendant asked the pilot to take the plane back to the gate after Coyle took a picture of her wearing the pin. He told her he would delete the photo after she maintained that taking her photo violated airlines rules.

Coyle was still kicked off his flight, but was able to recover the photo.

“No company should allow that to happen unless they are willing to accept the consequences for that happening,” Coyle maintained.

Spirit released a statement on the matter, saying that the pin broke their uniform policy.

“While we appreciate that Spirit employees have a wide range of personal views, the expression of those views should not interfere with their ability to provide a positive customer experience when in uniform and on duty,” their statement said.

Spirit has since rectified the situation, giving Coyle an unreleased compensation and disciplining the flight attendant.

A flight attendant with American Airlines came under fire for a Black Lives Matter pin in September. Maggie Dietrich shared a photo of the male attendant wearing the pin with the caption “Disgraceful” to American Airlines’ Facebook page.

Some defended the attendant, declaring that American Airlines should stand by an employee that rejects “the murder of black people by police” while others vowed to boycott the company for supporting a “hate group.”

“The button in question in the photo is not a company-sanctioned item, and we have let our flight attendant colleague, who continues to be employed with us, know this so he can remain compliant with our uniform guidelines while continuing to care for our customers,” American Airlines said in a statement.

"Black Man Burned African-American Church, Painted ‘Vote Trump’ On The Walls","A black man has been arrested and charged with burning an African-American church in Greenville, Miss. last month and defacing its outer walls with “Vote Trump” graffiti.

The Mississippi state police arrested Andrew McClinton, 45, on Wednesday and charged him with first-degree arson of a place of worship, Warren Strain, a spokesman with the Mississippi Department of Public Safety told The Daily Caller.

McClinton allegedly set fire to Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church, where he is a member, on Nov. 1, a week before the election. The fire destroyed 80 percent of the church. A GoFundMe account raised more than $240,000 to repair the facility.

“We do not believe it was politically motivated. There may have been some efforts to make it appear politically motivated,” Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney, who also serves as the state fire marshal, told The Associated Press.

Clarence Green, a bishop at Hopewell, told the AP that McClinton is a member of the church.

The attack, which was investigated by local and state authorities as well as the FBI, was widely attributed by media outlets to Trump supporters. The Atlantic, to cite one example, published an article entitled “A Black Church Burned in the Name of Trump.”

Mississippi U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, whose district encompasses Greenville, said last month that the arson and vandalism was an act of “domestic terrorism.”

“If there is something like the Ku Klux Klan or the Aryan Nation…we look at that as domestic terrorism,” he told the AP at the time.

The case appears to be yet another hoax targeting Trump supporters. Several Muslim women who have claimed since the election that they were targeted by Trump fans because they wore hijabs have been charged with making false reports.

Philly Teachers Plan A Full Week Of Black Lives Matter Lessons,"A Philadelphia teachers’ organization urged educators to instruct students about Black Lives Matter (BLM) in the classroom.

The Caucus of Working Educators, a branch of a teachers union, wants educators to wear Black Lives Matter gear in the classroom and teach lessons based on the movement, reports ABC News.

The organization has already written lesson plans for the week of Jan 23-Jan 28, many of which are based on BLM’s calls for diversity and globalism.

“The vast majority of students that we serve are black, and it’s important to affirm the lives of our students,” Charlie McGeehan, a co-organizer, said.

The themes for the lessons vary day to day. Jan. 23’s lessons are supposed to cover ideas of “restorative justice, empathy and loving engagement,” while Jan. 24 will deal with diversity and globalism.

One teacher, Amy Roat, said that the point of the lessons is to teach students about current events.

“We are a school that is very inclusive and we talk about a lot of good, juicy stuff.Black Lives Matter functions with 13 principles that I think are good and healthy for kids to learn about,” Roat said, who teaches mostly Latin, Arab and Asian students.

Black Lives Matter’s 13 principles cover ideas such as globalism, transgenderism, and diversity. The movement strives to be “queer affirming” and “transgender affirming, according to its website.

“We are committed to fostering a queer-affirming network. When we gather, we do so with the intention of freeing ourselves from the tight grip of hetero-normative thinking or rather, the belief that all in the world are heterosexual unless s/he or they disclose otherwise,” the website declares under the topic “Queer Affirming.”

The school district would not offer a direct comment on the plans, other than saying the district usually offers different ways for students to learn and engage.

Black Lives Matter Protesters Block Education Sec. DeVos From Entering DC Public School [VIDEO],"Black Lives Matter protesters blocked Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos from entering a Washington, D.C. public school Friday.

According to WJLA, DeVos attempted to enter the Jefferson Academy but Black Lives Matter protesters, organized by the Washington Teacher’s Union blocked the entry way while heckling her, she turned around and returned to her car. D

One protester shouted, “Shame, shame, shame,” at her.

DeVos attempted to enter early Friday morning after the gathering was organized by the Washington teacher’s Union.

One of the protesters can be seen holding a “Black Lives Matter” sign while yelling at DeVos. The Education Secretary and her aides eventually made their way into the school through another entrance.

Washington’s ABC 7 captured video of the new secretary of education whose contentious confirmation required Vice President Pence to cast a tie-breaking vote in her favor, a first ever for a cabinet level nomination.

The Alliance For Educational Justice claimed, “Today, families, residents and community leaders joined to block U.S. Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos from disrupting learning at Jefferson Academy.”

“Betsy DeVos has a track record of privatizing and undermining public schools that serve Black students for financial gain,” said Makia Green, an organizer with the Washington, DC chapter of Black Youth Project 100. “Today’s action made it clear: our community will do everything in our power to resist DeVos‘ destructive policies and her attacks on an entire generation of Black students.”

DeVos responded in a statement following the incident saying, ” I respect peaceful protest, and I will not be deterred in executing the mission of the Department of Education. No school door in America will be blocked from those seeking to help our nation’s school children.”

“Focusing on their students and families is at the heart of Jefferson Academy’s approach and that’s exactly what I believe is at the heart of providing an exceptional education,” she said in the statement.” I was honored to speak with Jefferson’s team about our shared commitment to strengthening public education.”

Teachers union opponents to the DeVos nomination, the American Federation of Teachers called it a “sad day,” when DeVos was confirmed Tuesday. Gov. Jeb Bush, tweeted out a congratulatory message saying President Trump made an “excellent choice” to head the Department.

DeVos gave remarks to her staff at the Education Department Wednesday, her first day at the agency, saying, “Let’s acknowledge: We’ve just come through one of the most bruising, divisive elections in modern times. And that’s OK. Our republic is resilient. We as a people are resilient.”

“Often, the morning and evening news cycles make it hard to imagine what might unite our nation,” she continued. “The rhetoric and the words can get hot and heated, and the animosity often seems unending. And that’s okay, too. People are passionate and moved by deeply held views. We are a pluralistic culture and we must celebrate our differences. But all of us here can help bring unity by personally committing to being more open to, and patient toward, views different than our own.”

Lawyer: Racist Note Given To Black Waitress In Virginia Is A Fake,"A black waitress who received thousands of dollars in donations after she claimed she received a racist note and no tip from a patron last month fabricated the incident, the customer claims.

Kelly Carter, a waitress at Anita’s New Mexico Cafe in Ashburn, Va., claimed that a white man stiffed her on his $30.52 restaurant bill and wrote “Great service, don’t tip black people” at the bottom of his receipt.

But the note was forged, says Daniel Hebda, a lawyer for the customer.

Hebda said in a statement Friday that his client did leave Carter a small tip — one penny — because her service was poor, not because she is black.

“Our client did not nor would he ever write anything about refusing to tip African Americans because of their race,” Hebda said, according to WTOP.

“Our client has no ill feelings towards African Americans. Our client did not leave a $0.00 tip. Our client tipped $0.01 out of his own conviction against tipping well for poor service.”

Hebda said that his client did write on the receipt, but only the message “terrible service.”

Websites like the Huffington Post, Raw Story, the Daily Mail, the New York Daily News and others posted the story as an example of racism in America. The Loudon County NAACP became involved, and a Virginia man opened up an online fundraiser that brought in more than $3,600 for Carter.

Carter’s boss, Tommy Tellez, said last month, after Carter reported the receipt, that customers were showing up to the restaurant and just “dropping cash off” for the waitress.

“I was appalled, though it’s kind of in line with the political landscape,” Tellez said at the time.

Though Carter’s story went viral, there were some early indications that her claim did not quite add up. For one, the receipt she posted online was printed several hours after Anita’s New Mexico Cafe closed. The receipt also bore markings showing that it was a reprint of an original receipt.

Hebda says he has reached out to Anita’s “and demanded that they set the story straight and find out who is responsible.”

It is unclear what will happen to the funds donated to Carter.

According to WTOP, the Loudon County NAACP says it is standing behind the waitress.

“It’s sad any way it goes,” Philip Thompson told the TV station.

"Black HuffPo Contributor Finds Out She’s Actually Pretty White, Feels Instant ‘Shame’","A Huffington Post contributor claimed to feel “shame” and “disorientation” after learning that she has European in her heritage.

Christine Michael Carter, a black contributor, decided to go through an ancestry report as part of Black History Month. She wrote that the results of the report shocked and dismayed her.

According to the data from 23andMe, Carter is 67.2% Sub-Saharan African, 31.5 % European (white), .6% East Asian/ Native American and and .6% unassigned.

“Huh? Of all the emotions which materialized from the results, the two strongest were disorient and shame,” Carter wrote of her realization that she was almost one third white.

Carter went through a long process of trying to reconcile her job as a black marketing expert, with the fact that she was also part white.

“…But as someone who has become a Black millennial marketing expert… this s*** matters. It’s as if I’ve obscured the one thing which has guided me since I was nine years old… my heritage,” Carter went on. “As inappropriate (but honest) as it sounds, I’d discovered I had the so-called “superior” race running through my veins, and never before had I felt so inferior.”

It is well known that black people usually have white blood as well. According to a genetic study, the “African American” genome is usually 73.2 % African, 24% European and .8 percent Native American.

Carter, despite knowing this, still wrestled with her whiteness.

“While I’m no Rachel Dolezal, I must accept the fact I do have White ancestors. It’s nothing to be ashamed of, but quite honestly, the road to acceptance will not be an easy one for me to travel,” she wrote.

Black Lives Matter Philly Bans White People From Its Meetings,"Black Lives Matter Philly banned white people from an upcoming event, claiming it is a “black only space.”

The April 15 meeting plans to discuss projects and initiatives for the upcoming year and act as a place for people to “meet, strategize and organize.” While children are invited to attend, white people are explicitly banned from the meeting, according to the Facebook event page.

When people began questioning the ban on whites over Twitter, Black Lives Matter Philly stayed by their ban, explaining that their meetings are “black centered.”

Anyone who identifies as “African disapora” is allowed to attend, the group explained over Twitter.

“If you identify as a person of the African Diaspora You can attend our meetings and become a member. If not you can support us in other ways,” Philly BLM said in a tweet. “African Disapora” usually refers to people who were taken out of Africa during the Transatlantic Slave Trades.

One Twitter user pointed out that Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. worked side by side with whites to accomplish his goals. Philly Black Lives Matter responded by saying that was King’s decision.

The group also referred to Malcolm X, saying he too had banned whites from his meetings on race.

Black Lives Matter Throws ‘Exclusively Black’ Memorial Day Weekend Party,"The New York City chapter of Black Lives Matter hosted an “exclusively black” party over Memorial Day weekend.

Black Lives Matter NYC, the Black Youth Project 100 and the Black Alliance for Just Immigration joined together to throw “The People’s Turn-up,” or what they called an “unapologetically black” party.

“Clear your calendar – It’s a lituation! You’re invited to take part in the UNAPOLOGETICALLY Black festivities. Bring yourself, bring Bae (or come find Bae), whatever you like. We got you. We got us,” the event’s Facebook page read.

Only for those 21 and older, event organizers also made it clear that the party was only for black people. If a person did not identify as black, then they were asked to not attend the party.

“When we say ‘The People’ we mean Black People. Being intentional around being around Black People is an act of resistance.This is an exclusively Black Space. So if you do not identify as Black and want to come because you love Black People, please respect the space and do not come,” an event organizer noted on the event’s discussion board.

Organizers also said the party was an “intentional space” where violence, fatphobia, sexism, toxic masculinity and transphobia were not permitted.

Black Lives Matter routinely hosts “black only” meetings and events. The Philadelphia chapter of Black Lives Matter banned white people from attending a meeting in April. Only people who identified as a part of the “African Diaspora” were invited to attend. (RELATED:Black Lives Matter Philly Bans White People From Its Meetings)

“If you identify as a person of the African Diaspora You can attend our meetings and become a member. If not you can support us in other ways,” Philly BLM said in a tweet.

Black Gun Groups Gear Up To Educate Black Community In Light Of Castile Verdict,"Black pro-gun groups are working hard to educate black people about gun rights as the community grapples with the Philando Castile verdict.

A jury of 12 cleared Minnesota police officer Jeronimo Yanez of his fatal shooting of Castile, a black gun owner. (RELATED: Cop Found Not Guilty In Death Of Philando Castile)

Now, Black Guns Matter and the National African-American Gun Association (NAAGA), two prominent black gun organizations, are working to teach their communities about gun rights and gun safety.

Black Guns Matter head Maj Toure is hosting a firearms and safety training course in Minneapolis, the city of Castile’s shooting, to address Second Amendment rights and Minnesota gun laws June 26.

Toure will also focus on how to interact with law enforcement officers as a legal gun owner, planning to teach participants the phrase “How do you want me to proceed?” to ask police officers.

“We’re going to concentrate heavy on how to interact with law enforcement officers at traffic stops. We’re going to be very serious about that,” Toure told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “Always ask: ‘How would you like to proceed?’ Because that may be the different between what happened to Castile, and whether you’re going home or going in a box.”

NAAGA is also reaching out to their members to remind them about necessary gun laws in various states and what their rights are, Philip Smith, the organization’s leader, told TheDCNF. The group is trying to reach out to spread information to people who might not already be a member of the group.

Both leaders disagreed with the verdict. “It’s bullshit,” Toure said to TheDCNF, adding “Castile didn’t do anything wrong. He should be standing beside me now.”

Smith pointed out that the shooting was troubling from both a personal and legal view.

“It is alarming that a person who had everything he needed, from a legal perspective: he had his license, his carry license, insurance, and wasn’t doing anything crazy,” Smith told TheDCNF. “I’m not saying the officer was a bad person, he just did a bad thing. I think he should have been punished severely.”

Regardless, Smith doesn’t think that the verdict will sway the black community from owning guns legally.

“I think this make a lot of people very angry. They’re already shooting us without guns,” Smith told TheDCNF. “We might as well have guns….we’re not going to stop carrying, we’re not going to stop exercising our Second Amendment rights. Our forefathers died for that.”

Cop Shot In Face By Unarmed Black Man,"On Tuesday, June 27, 2017, a Sacramento County Sheriff’s Deputy was shot in the face by an “unarmed black man,” or at least that is exactly how the media would have described him had the deputy shot him instead. Don’t believe me? Need I mention the name Michael Brown?

You see folks, something that all cops understand, but the media and cop hating groups like Black Lives Matter intentionally ignore, is that every time a cop is involved in a physical altercation, at least one gun is present. Furthermore, unlike TV or organized sporting events, there are no fair fights and real fights do not have referees. The slightest use of force can look ugly, but a full on fight is very ugly, and it can wind up with someone dead or seriously injured, which is exactly what happened on Tuesday. Thankfully, by the grace of God, the deputy survived and doctors say he will fully recover.

The unarmed suspect in Tuesday’s shooting, like most violent criminals encountered by law enforcement, was no stranger to the “justice system.” Nicory Marquis Spann is a 27 year old man who has been in and out of jails and prison for much of his adult life. Not only is he a convicted felon, but he was also on active probation at the time of the shooting and had only recently been released from jail. His criminal history includes multiple arrests for battery, criminal threats, brandishing weapons, resisting arrest, and a minor little thing such as being involved in a double murder, for which he went to prison.

According to the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department via a Facebook post:

“The initial investigation shows the deputy made contact with Spann on the lower platform of the Regional Transit station. Unprovoked, Spann violently attacked the deputy and began fighting with him. At some point during the fight, Spann was able to get the deputy’s gun and fired two shots. One of the shots struck the deputy in the face.”

With hindsight being 20/20, and looking at Spann’s criminal history, his actions in this incident are not remotely surprising, but in the real world, cops are not omniscient. We do not know who everyone is, what their background is or what their intentions might be. We have no idea if the person we are talking to is the nicest person on the planet, or as in the case of Spann, a violent criminal willing to shoot a cop in the face over nothing.

“Unarmed” Does Not Mean “Not Dangerous”

We (law enforcement) have said that a million times, but the media and cop hating groups refuse to acknowledge that. Every year, according to FBI statistics, an average of 700 murders occur where the weapon used was “Personal weapons (hands, fists, feet, etc.).” Those numbers do not include incidents where the unarmed suspect managed to take a weapon from the victim and use it on them.

So, at the risk of becoming a broken record, let me again say unarmed does not mean not dangerous!

Stop Letting Criminals Off Lightly

The whole misconception that an unarmed person is not a threat is only half of the problem. The other half, which is especially pronounced here is California is that the media, the cop hating groups, and sadly a good portion of the voting population have begun to view criminals as some sort of group victimized by the cops and the criminal justice system. If you look at the legislation that has been passed here recently, both by the legislature and by the voters (Ab-109, Prop 47 and Prop 57), there is a very disturbing trend of decriminalizing crime. Convicted felons are being let out of prison early, felonies are being turned into misdemeanors or eliminated as crimes altogether, the parole system has been neutered, the probation system has been overwhelmed, and as a result, tens of thousands of violent criminals are wandering the streets instead of being locked in a cage where they belong.

It is a long established, well-known (to those who pay attention) fact that the vast majority of violent crimes are committed by repeat offenders, many with very long criminal backgrounds. Despite the tired mantra repeated by the media and criminal apologists everywhere, including one Barack Obama, one does not go to prison for simple possession of a joint (a marijuana cigarette).

“Please note that the majority of crime in America is not reported and the majority of reported crime does not result in an arrest and in many jurisdictions, a significant minority of crimes are not prosecuted. Thus if you reach the stage where the criminal justice system is prosecuting you for a felony, either you have done something very wrong or the system is tired of seeing you back in court.”

In addition to the fact that prison sentences are being reduced and crimes are being decriminalized, another serious problem faced in this country is the over-used pattern of plea bargaining by the district attorneys (state’s attorney, prosecutors, etc. – term varies by jurisdiction) in order to avoid costs involved with jury trials. This issue has gotten so bad that people arrested for very serious charges, such as being a conspirator in a double murder (like Spann), are being allowed to plea bargain down to far less serious charges which puts them back on the street after only a few years.

It does not take much effort to find numerous recent events where persons actively on probation or parole have killed cops (these stories are far easier to find compared to murders of citizens). In fact, in the last years, a few noteworthy events come to mind.

In Whittier, CA on February 20 th , a known gang member and active parolee killed his cousin first, and shortly thereafter killed a cop, Officer Keith Boyer, who responded to a car crash that the piece of worthless crap gang member was involved in (while driving his dead cousin’s stolen car).

, a known gang member and active parolee killed his cousin first, and shortly thereafter killed a cop, Officer Keith Boyer, who responded to a car crash that the piece of worthless crap gang member was involved in (while driving his dead cousin’s stolen car). In Palm Springs, CA in October of 2016, another gang member with many serious prior convictions, who was on active probation, shot and killed two Palm Springs cops, Officers Jose Gilbert “Gil” Vega and Lesley Zerebny, who responded to his home for a “family disturbance.” The suspect was laying in wait and murdered them in cold blood.

In May of 2015, in Omaha, NE, Officer Kerrie Orozco was shot and killed by a 26 year old shooting suspect who had prior convictions for multiple felonies including drug dealing and attempted murder, yet instead of being in prison was on the streets. That felon’s girlfriend supplied him with the gun he used, and in a total miscarriage of justice, that girlfriend received a whopping one year of probation for her crime that directly lead to the death of a cop.

Those are just a small sample of the incidents where people who very obviously should have been rotting in a small box were instead on the streets, thanks to our ridiculously lenient “criminal justice system” and as a result, a cop is no longer living. As I previously said, these incidents are only those involving cops as the victim, not private citizens. Examples of private citizens being the victim of a person who should have been in prison/jail at the time of the crime are far too plentiful to list, and sadly they rarely even garner much media attention.

We know who is committing these crimes, and we know what we can do to prevent them, but sadly our society currently lacks the intestinal fortitude to take those steps. Hell, seeming at least half of our society, thanks to the media and groups like Black Lives Matter, instantly sides with the criminals. Long gone are the times when cops were given the benefit of the doubt.

The criminal justice system is broken, folks, and the current state of it puts all of us in danger. Ironically enough, if you were to search the internet for the phrase “broken criminal justice system” you would find hundreds of articles claiming the exact opposite of what I am saying here. I guess I just have no sympathy for people who find themselves in prison.

Sadly, until we as a society once again decide that criminals need to actually be punished for their crimes, we can look forward to many more instances of people being killed by a suspect who should have been dead or in jail.

EXCLUSIVE VIDEO: White Supremacists Brutally Attack Black Teen Next To Charlottesville Police HQ,"A disturbing video shows a group of white supremacists brutally attacking a young black man Saturday in Charlottesville, Va.

The footage, recorded by The Daily Caller News Foundation, captures at least five individuals beating up on a young black man with heavy objects, including large wooden planks and sticks.

The incident took place in the early afternoon, shortly after police cleared out Emancipation Park (formerly Lee Park). A skirmish broke out inside a parking garage, right next door to the Charlottesville Police Department.

At least one of the men appeared to be holding a shield with the logo of American Vanguard, a fringe white nationalist group.

Jason Charter, a Washington, D.C.-based activist, said he was present outside the parking garage.

“When I arrived, I saw multiple members of a white supremacist group beating senselessly an African American man while the police stood there and watched,” Charter said.

It is unknown if the attack was provoked by a specific incident, or if the attack was simply due to the young man’s skin color. Violent outbursts by both white supremacists and counter-protesters throughout the day left many injured.

Violence in Charlottesville left three dead, and scores injured as members of the white supremacist movement faced massive counter-protests during a scheduled rally Saturday.

FBI Warns Of More Violence From ‘Black Identity Extremist’ Groups,"The FBI Counterterrorism Division warned about the potential violence that could come from members of “Black Identity Extremists” (BIE), according to a document obtained by Foreign Policy.

The Aug. 3 document warns of the potential violence that members of the BIE movement could possibly perform against American law enforcement officers, Foreign Policy reported Friday.

“The FBI assesses it is very likely Black Identity Extremist (BIE) perceptions of police brutality against African Americans spurred an increase in premeditated, retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement and will very likely serve as justification for such violence,” the document read. Foreign Policy notes that the document was marked for official use.

The FBI report points to the 2014 Ferguson shooting of Michael Brown as the start of the anger and violence on the part of the BIE movement. Police brutality only helped fuel the anger, the FBI noted in the report.

“The FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement,” the report read.

The Bureau cited examples like Micah Johnson, the black man who opened fired on Dallas Police officers last July. Johnson reportedly expressed a desire to kill “white police officers” out of anger over police brutality against black Americans. The FBI believes that Johnson’s actions were influenced over anger from the BIE movement, the report said.

“The FBI further assesses it is very likely additional controversial police shootings of African Americans and the associated legal proceedings will continue to serve as drivers for violence against law enforcement,” the report noted.

It remains unclear if this means that the FBI has declared BIE as a domestic terrorist threat. The Daily Caller News Foundation reached out to the FBI for additional comment, but received none in time for publication.

The FBI also warned its agents about potential threats from black separatist movements a few years ago, handing out pamphlets on how to look out for members of the group, according to documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union.

Black Liberation Group Releases New Project For ‘Electoral Justice’ For Black People,"A new justice project aimed at creating different electoral strategies for those in the black community is set to launch, organizers announced Monday.

The Movement for Black Lives, a group that encompasses black organizations such as Black Lives Matter, will launch the Electoral Justice Project, a two-step initiative to help black people gain more power in their local communities.

“And in this political time, we also believe that it is our duty to answer two critical questions: Is it possible to bring the clarity and radical vision that many of us have brought to the protest lines to electoral justice and civic engagement? Can we interrupt a political system that has taken advantage of our voices and fallen short to transform our communities?” Jessica Byrd, an organizer, said during a Monday night conference call.

The Electoral Justice Project will consist of two parts. Project organizers plan to hire black organizers called the Electoral Justice League to focus on local strategies and champion certain issues facing the black community. The second part entails a national help desk to reach out and help black organizations with electoral strategies.

“This is really historic. This global movement of black-led organizations all across the country is going to have a help desk that is going to work with them to build capacity and technical support for all of our electoral visioning up and down the ballot,” Byrd said. “We will also build a cohort of 15 black organizers who will work on localized strategies in partnership with those organizations.”

The first big initiative of the project will be a series of 50 black-led town-halls in 50 cities across the country during the weekend of Nov. 5.

“We’re asking you to invite members of your community to your favorite place for a dialogue,” St. Louis activist Kayla Reed told those on the conference call. “We’ll help with the rest. It can be a kitchen table, a coffee shop, a union hall, a church, a school. This is a place where all types of black people can have a safe dialogue about the future of our community as these town halls will be the beginning of leading our culture towards political change.”

The Movement for Black Lives is an umbrella group for over sixty groups that fight for black liberation. The organization released a policy platform last year, calling for an end to the war on black people and free access to high school for all black Americans.

Here’s How Young Black Conservative Women Are Changing The Face Of The GOP,"It’s pretty easy to name a couple of black women working in progressive circles and organizations, but it’s a lot harder to name the ones working within the conservative movement.

There’s a substantial national conversation about progressive black women like Tamika D. Mallory, an organizer of the Women’s March or Alicia Garza, a queer black woman who founded Black Lives Matter, which brought police brutality to the forefront of America or Tarana Burke who first created the #MeToo campaign that launched a conversation about the sexual harassment women face daily.

What’s less discussed are the young conservative, black women who are working every day to change and influence the Republican Party.

These women want to bring home a message of empowerment, not only to black women across the country, but also to the black community at large. Women such as Antonia Okafor, the founder of gun rights advocacy organization EmPOWERed, Ayshia Connors, a senior policy adviser to a Pennsylvania congressman and president of the Black Republican Congressional Staff Association and Candace Owens, the director of Urban Engagement for Turning Point USA, all work tirelessly in advocating for their community and to make black conservative voices heard.

“Essentially, I believe in this day and age, for whatever reason, there is a largely ignored, growing group of voices which is essentially black conservatives. We’ve been largely dismissed and de-legitimized in the media as something that is not allowed to exist,” Owens, who labels herself an independent thinker, told The Daily Caller News Foundation.

Owens is currently working on creating the first black leadership summit for Turning Point USA with the intent to bring young black conservatives from across the country to hear from other black leaders on how to become trailblazers and entrepreneurs within their community. Owens especially wants these young black conservatives to hear from fellow black leaders who don’t carry with them the same message the mainstream media does.

Okafor and Connors are also trying to make big strides within the conservative movement.

“I’m spreading the message of female empowerment through gun ownership, one that transcends all races” Okafor said of her focus on her EmPOWERed college tour.

Connors, as the president of the Black Republican Congressional Staff Association, has not only doubled the number of members since she entered, but is also intent on using the organization to help young black Republicans and conservatives find jobs on Capitol Hill. Before joining as Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick’s senior policy adviser, Connors also worked with the Republican National Committee during the 2016 election.

Okafor is currently on her EmPOWERed tour, visiting college campuses to talk about female empowerment through gun ownership, a message not only for black women, but women of all races. Her tour includes stops at historically black colleges such as Howard University and Spelman College, where she hopes the face-to-face interaction with students will open their eyes.

“I think that what I hope to gain is that they see I am a person, a human being and I’m like them,” Okafor told TheDCNF. “I’m doing it because I want to empower the black community. I came out of being a closeted conservative and I’m vocal because when other people can see that there is someone else who looks like them and believes like them,unlike what society tells them to be like, it gives them courage.”

What many people don’t know is American history is a rich history with black women being unashamed of having conservative values.

There was Mildred Fay Jefferson, a pro-life activist, who was the first black woman to graduate from Harvard Medical School, as well as Constance Berry Newman, a former Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs under the former President George W. Bush’s administration. There was also Ida B. Wells, a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People who fought against the lynching of black people in America.

There’s still a lot more work that needs to be done, according to the women TheDCNF spoke to. They noted the GOP should work on messaging and how the party conveys their values to the black community should they wish to be successful with minorities in the future.

“A lot of the times when they have good ideas, they have trouble communicating them in a way that seems attainable,” Owens, also a vlogger, told TheDCNF, adding that the GOP should develop a sense of humor. “I think they just need a lot more personality.”

Connors also agreed that the Republican Party needs to work on messaging, but also how they explain those ideas to the black community. Most black Americans are naturally conservative and receptive to a message that centers around education leading to upward mobility. Criminal justice reform, often advocated by GOP Sens. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky, also needs to pushed to the forefront, Connors said to TheDCNF.

Connors suggested making access for young people who want to serve on Capitol Hill, but may not have the resources to do so is crucial.

“You see a lot people who aren’t able to come and intern on Capitol Hill because of financial hardship. Normally, it’s unpaid internships and a lot of people aren’t able to come and get that experience on Capitol Hill, which is why I don’t think you see a lot of minorities,” Connors told TheDCNF.

Okafor emphasized face-to-face interactions with people, saying the only way there can be a huge shift is if people talk one-on one. She pointed to Paul’s actions when he visited Howard University in 2015. Too often Republicans only enter the black community during an election cycle. Paul entered a black space and spoke to them about his conservative values, but focused on issues that resonated with the black community, Okafor told TheDCNF.

“He talked about criminal justice reform, he talked about economic empowerment zones, he talked about school choice,” Okafor said. “Those are thing that African-Americans have been wanting as a percentage to do something about but they only go to progressive policies because we haven’t done much to bring the message home that our conservative values actually do empower them in those problems.”

The GOP is often quick to dismiss diversity efforts and it shows in numbers — seven percent of the black community identifies as Republican and recent GOP presidential candidates have received between eight to nine percent of the black vote in recent elections. This leads to the question: Should the GOP focus on diversity?

Connors gave an emphatic yes, but also pointed out the GOP often doesn’t get enough credit for their efforts with minority outreach. Owens doesn’t care about the color of someone’s skin, but said she’s more concerned with the results they achieve for the black community.

“But I definitely think that we can do more and that’s kind of what the Black Republican Congressional Staff Association is doing on the public sector side,” Connors told TheDCNF. “They do a lot with trying to bring in diversity and trying to create space for people to be involved with the party, whether that is employment or deploying people out for campaigns or getting people involved in policy discussions.”

The Republican National Committee did not return The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment in time for publication.

Al Sharpton’s Group And Black Lives Matter Team Up For Pro-Farrakhan Protest,"Black Lives Matter, the New Black Panther Party, and Rev. Al Sharpton’s National Action Network are organizing a protest in defense of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan

Farrakhan is a notorious racist and anti-Semite with close ties to Democratic politicians and activists

The black activist groups are lobbying against a GOP resolution formally condemning Farrakhan for his anti-Semitism

Several black activist groups are holding a protest on Monday in defense of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a notorious anti-Semite and racist revealed to have close ties to prominent Democratic politicians and activists.

Black Lives Matter, the New Black Panther Party and the National Action Network are among the groups spearheading the protest, the organizers said in a press release.

The groups are protesting a House resolution, introduced by Republican Indiana Rep. Todd Rokita, that formally condemns Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism. The activists instead want lawmakers to pass a resolution condemning President Donald Trump. (RELATED: Seven Louis Farrakhan Quotes On Jews, Gays And White People)

Rev. Al Sharpton has been NAN’s president since he founded the group in 1991. Sharpton is also a contributor on MSNBC and hosts “PoliticsNation,” a one-hour weekly show on the network. The NAN and MSNBC did not return requests for comment.

More than 100 organizers “will go office-to-office to deal with the GOP representatives that are leading this campaign, in specific Congressman Todd Rokita,” according to the press release.

“The lobbyist [sic] will visit members of the Congressional Black Caucus who are under pressure to condemn Minister Farrakhan though the Congressional Black Caucus has yet to muster enough strength to introduce a resolution condemning that he repeated, vile and foul bigoted and reckless comments by President Donald Trump.”

“The coalition will be lobbying key members of Congress-the GOP in particular-to condemn President Donald J. Trump and to leave Louis Farrakhan alone. Please do not try to stop us because we will not turn back. We will represent professionally and politically vigorously,” the press release said.

“We cannot allow a politically hypocritical political situation to exist whereas an openly racist president, Donald Trump is given a free pass and to spew racist venom and racist policies by a confederate based GOP; and then they have the gall to issue an official legislative condemnation of a private citizen and Black leader who is dearly beloved by the masses,” said Black Lawyers for Justice president Malik Zulu Shabazz, one of the protest organizers.

Shabazz, a former leader of the New Black Panthers, has a long history of anti-Semitism and once shouted at a protest: “Kill every goddamn Zionist in Israel! Goddamn little babies, goddamn old ladies! Blow up Zionist supermarkets!” That’s according to the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights organization which has tracked Shabazz’s anti-Semitism for years. The press release lists Shabazz as the point of contact for the protest. He did not return an email seeking comment.

Farrakhan has re-emerged as a politically divisive figure among Democrats due to three recent developments.

First, a Nation of Islam photographer revealed a 13-year-old photo of then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama smiling with Farrakhan at a Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) meeting in 2005.

The CBC asked him to suppress the photo’s publication in order to protect Obama’s presidential aspirations, the photographer said. Twenty-one current House Democrats were in the CBC when Farrakhan had his meeting with the caucus. (RELATED: Maxine Waters Attended Nation Of Islam Convention Where Farrakhan Defended Suicide Bombers)

Second, Women’s March leader Tamika Mallory attended Farrakhan’s annual Saviour’s Day speech in February, where he railed against Jews and white people. Mallory has repeatedly defended Farrakhan and Women’s March has declined to denounce him, alienating some progressives both within the organization and outside of it.

Third, several House Democrats have been revealed to have closer relationships with Farrakhan than previously known.

That includes DNC deputy chair Keith Ellison, who claimed to have cut ties with Farrakhan before running for Congress in 2006, when actually he attended multiple meetings with the hate group leader during his time in Congress.

Ellison penned a blog post on Sunday confirming he crossed paths with Farrakhan twice in 2013 but denying Farrakhan’s claim that he and Indiana Rep. Andre Carson visited Farrakhan in a hotel room in 2015. Carson has confirmed he attended the Farrakhan meeting that Ellison says didn’t happen.

Democratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis has a personal relationship with Farrakhan, he said in three interviews with this reporter. He emphasized in the third interview that he personally does not think that white people are “devils” and that Jewish people are “satanic.”

Some House Democrats, including Ellison, have condemned Farrakhan while others, including Davis, have distanced themselves from Farrakhan’s racism and anti-Semitism but have declined to condemn him.

South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, the third-highest ranking Democrat in the House, shared a stage with Farrakhan in 2011 and has since declined to condemn him.

Democratic California Rep. Maxine Waters, who attended a Nation of Islam convention where Farrakhan defended suicide bombers, has similarly remained silent on Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism, despite repeated media inquiries.

Black Gun Owner Slams Gov’t: Why Do You Want To Take Away My Rights? [VIDEO],"A black gun owner slammed those who would want to restrict guns from law-abiding citizens during a Tuesday city council meeting on how to combat gun violence.

“You want to restrict my right to buy a firearm and protect myself from some of the very people you are talking about in here tonight,” Mark Robinson, a Greensboro, N.C., resident said. “The law-abiding citizens of this community, of other communities we are the first ones taxed and the last ones considered.”

WATCH:

Robinson spoke out a city council meeting held to address how the community should handle gun violence and whether it should cancel an upcoming “Gun and Knife Show.” The Greensboro gun owner argued it was far past time for the government to listen to the “majority” in America: law-abiding citizens who might want to buy guns.

“I’m the majority. I’m a law-abiding citizen who has never shot anybody,” Robinson said. “Never committed a serious crime. Never committed a felony. I’ve never done anything like that. It seems like every time we have one of these shootings, nobody wants to put the blame where it goes, which is at the shooter’s feet. You want to put it at my feet. You want to turn around and restrict my rights.”

‘Nobody Says Anything’: Pastor Goes Off On Black-On-Black Crime At Aretha Franklin’s Funeral,"Pastor Jasper Williams launched a scathing criticism of black-on-black violence on Friday at Aretha Franklin’s funeral, where he delivered the eulogy.

“It amazes me how it is when the police kills one of us, we are ready to protest, march destroy innocent property. We’re ready to loot, steal, whatever we want. But when we kill 100 of us, nobody says anything. Nobody does anything,” Williams said.

“Black on black crime, we’re all doing time. We are locked up in our minds. There’s got to be a better way. We must stop this today. Think down, look down, walk down, talk down, act down — most times we are low down. Where is your soul?” the pastor continued. (RELATED: Look Who Showed Up In The Front Row At Aretha Franklin’s Funeral)

“If you choose to ask me today, do black lives matter? Let me answer like this: no, black lives do not matter; black lives will not matter; black lives ought not matter; black lives should not matter; black lives must not matter until black people start respecting black lives and stop killing ourselves — black lives can never matter.”

WATCH:



Williams, whom Franklin reportedly personally chose to give her eulogy, also lamented that absent fathers force too many black women to raise their children by themselves.

The pastor described absent parents as a form of “abortion after birth” that is damaging to children who experience it.

"In His First Day On The Job, Kavanaugh Hired As Many Black Law Clerks As RBG Has In Her Entire Tenure","Justice Brett Kavanaugh has hired a black law clerk for his new chambers at the U.S. Supreme Court, matching Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s record of African-American clerkship hiring during her tenure on the nation’s highest judicial tribunal.

With his first clerkship hires, Kavanaugh also set a gender composition record, an apparent attempt to buck the high court’s hiring patterns, which tend to favor white, male graduates of elite law schools.

Since joining the high court in 1993, Ginsburg has hired over 100 law clerks, just one of whom is black.

Ginsburg’s hiring practices have been criticized for decades. During her 1993 confirmation hearings, GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah asked Ginsburg if a court might reasonably conclude that a small business in a majority black city that hired 57 white employees and zero black employees over a period of years was discriminatory. Ginsburg dodged, before Hatch pointed out that was in fact her own record of clerkship hiring in her 13 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

“I will try harder, and if you confirm me for this job my attractiveness to black candidates is going to improve,” Ginsburg replied, to much laughter throughout the hearing chamber. (RELATED: Confirmed: Brett Kavanaugh Is Now A Supreme Court Justice)

Kavanaugh’s new clerks are Shannon Grammel, Megan Lacy, Sara Nommensen and Kim Jackson. These hires set a record in a second respect: Kavanaugh is the first Supreme Court justice to hire an all female class of clerks.

A 2017 study published in the National Law Journal found that 85 percent of all Supreme Court clerks between 2005 and 2017 were white, and approximately two-thirds were male.

Just hours after the Senate narrowly confirmed the new justice, Kavanaugh was sworn in Saturday by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy in a private, intimate ceremony at the court. He quietly began work on Sunday, taking over a suite of offices formerly occupied by Justice Samuel Alito.

Ebony Magazine Leaves All 6 Republicans Out Of Profile Of Black Candidates,"Ebony Magazine profiled 18 black women running for Congress in early October but did not include any of the six black Republican women, including one sitting congresswoman, running.

Ebony suggested that their profile, which was published on October 11, was the definitive list of all of the black women running for Congress, titling the piece, “Meet the 18 Black Women Running for a Seat in Congress.”

“This midterm election is one to watch with all 435 seats in the U.S. House up for grabs. Meet the 18 black women vying for a congressional seat,” Ebony writer Sarafina Wright said.

The piece, however, does not mention any of the black Republican women running for Congress.

The following black Republican women are running for Congress:

Congresswoman Mia Love is running for reelection in Utah’s 4th Congressional District

"Armed With Assault Rifles, Black Panthers March For Stacey Abrams","Members of the Black Panther Party marched through the city of Atlanta, strapped with assault rifles and brandishing Stacey Abrams campaign signs.

In a video posted on the group’s Facebook page on Saturday, members of the Black Panther Party are seen marching through the West End neighborhood of Atlanta in support of Stacey Abrams gubernatorial campaign. As they marched, the Black Panthers carried assault rifles and continually shouted slogans such as “black power” and “power to the people.”

Abrams, a former Democratic state representative, is running in a tight election against Republican Brian Kemp, Georgia’s current Secretary of State. The Real Clear Politics average of recent polls shows Kemp up by 1.1 percentage points, well within the margin of error.

The video shows the panthers marching for nearly 30 minutes through the city of Atlanta until they enter a local radio station.

When reached for comment by The Daily Caller News Foundation, the Abrams campaign forwarded a statement from spokeswoman Abigail Collazo. Her statement did not specifically address the Panthers’ march, but instead attacked Kemp.

“Brian Kemp is the only candidate in this race who has posed for pictures with supporters wearing racist, hate-filled t-shirts and refused to denounce them, while Abrams continues to condemn any racist, anti-Semitic, or otherwise discriminatory words and actions,” Collazo said.

“Unlike Kemp, Abrams is a leader committed to running an inclusive campaign focused on bringing all Georgians together to find bold solutions on critical issues like health care, education, and the economy,” she continued. (RELATED: Democratic Candidate Criticizes Agriculture Industry, Suggests Workers Transition To Renewable Energy Instead)

At one point during the march, someone driving a vehicle stopped momentarily to speak to the Panthers.

One of the members can be heard saying afterward: “You need to march in your neighborhood. When we was [sic] in West Virginia, 99 percent crackers, stone cold crackers.”

Kemp’s campaign called on Abrams to immediately denounce the Black Panthers.

“It’s no surprise that militant Black Panthers are armed and patrolling the streets of Georgia for Stacey Abrams. The Black Panthers are a radical hate group with a racist and anti-semitic agenda. They are dangerous and encourage violence against our men and women in uniform,” Kemp spokesman Ryan Mahoney said in a statement to TheDCNF.

“Stacey Abrams should immediately denounce the Black Panthers and their hateful record of racism,” he continued. “She should stand against and condemn their attempts to intimidate hardworking Georgia voters just days before the election.”

The close race has brought star power from both sides of the aisle. Vice President Mike Pence campaigned for Kemp on Thursday — the same day Oprah Winfrey knocked on doors on behalf of Abrams.

The Panthers did not respond to a request for comment by TheDCNF.

"44 Million Turkeys, 116 Million Black Friday Shoppers And All The Other Thanksgiving Stats You Didn’t Know You Needed","Thanksgiving is upon us — that holiday during which Americans celebrate the things they are grateful for in their families, their communities and their nation.

And while some dread Thanksgiving conversations with “angry uncles” and their ilk, here are a few reasons to be excited for the holiday:

Carve The Turkey

There’s a reason why many Americans call Thanksgiving “Turkey Day.” The bird is the centerpiece of the table and the meal. The National Turkey Federation estimates 44 million turkeys were consumed by Americans on Thanksgiving in 2017. (RELATED: Over 91,000 Pounds Of Raw Turkey Recalled By This Brand Because Of Salmonella Concerns)

Are you a fan of white meat or dark meat? If you prefer dark, pass your plate to the bird carver first — the typical turkey is 70 percent white meat and only 30 percent dark meat.

Approximately 88 percent of Americans surveyed by the National Turkey Foundation said they eat turkey at Thanksgiving, which raises the question: What are the other 22 percent doing wrong?

Grocery Store Bills

Buying all the ingredients for the perfect Thanksgiving Day feast can leave shoppers with an extra-long receipt in hand and a hefty bill. But the good news is that the average cost of Thanksgiving dinner is at its lowest level in eight years, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation’s 2018 survey.

The average 10-person Thanksgiving meal will cost $48.90, down from 2017’s average of $49.12. That’s thanks to price drops for Turkey Day staples including sweet potatoes, rolls, green peas and, of course, the turkey.

Thanksgiving Day Football

More than 35 million people tuned into FOX to watch the Dallas Cowboys beat the Washington Redskins in 2016, according to The Street. That’s even more than the 25 millionpeople who watched the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade on NBC in 2016.

Thanksgiving Day football is a tradition to both watch and play, and the three NFL match-ups for the 2018 holiday are the Chicago Bears against the Detroit Lions; the Washington Redskins against the Dallas Cowboys; and the Atlanta Falcons against the New Orleans Saints.

Black Friday Shopping

This almost-holiday won’t stop creeping into Thanksgiving, and retailers including Bass Pro Shops, Macy’s and Walmart will be open on Thanksgiving Day, according to USA Today. But three states — Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine — have passed so-called “Sunday laws” to prevent stores from opening on the holiday. However, that just means shoppers rush to the retailers when the clock strikes midnight on Thanksgiving, reported Business Insider.

Upwards of 164 million Americans plan to shop over the five-day Thanksgiving weekend that ends on Cyber Monday, according to a survey by the National Retail Federation. Of those shoppers, 71 percent will hit the stores on Black Friday. That’s roughly 116 million shoppers. (RELATED: Conservatives Can Vote With Their Dollars Using 2ndVote’s 2018 Christmas Shopping Guide)

Those shoppers looking for Christmas gifts and more will be searching for the best deal, but not all Black Friday deals are created equal. The average item markdowns at popular stores vary from less than 20 percent to nearly 70 percent, according to a WalletHub survey.

US Military Branches Celebrate Black Friday In The Way That Only They Can,"When it comes to Black Friday, it’s pretty much business as usual for the men and women of the United States Armed Forces. But that didn’t stop social media managers from the Army, Marines, Navy, and Coast Guard from posting their own unique takes on the day after Thanksgiving’s activities.

If you were thinking you’d beat the U.S. Army to those Black Friday deals, you might be a bit behind.

On the other hand, from the looks of the U.S. Marine Corps’ tweet, recruits didn’t get a whole lot of shopping done.

Poll Results: Black Men Helped Propel Brian Kemp To Victory,"A higher-than-expected number of black men voted for Republican Brian Kemp in Georgia’s gubernatorial election, prompting questions of their voting habits in a post-Barack Obama era.

Democrat Stacey Abrams admitted defeat on Nov. 16, more than a week after Election Day 2018 had passed. Her concession ended one of the closest races — and one of the most controversial — in Georgia’s modern history. Ultimately, Kemp won by nearly 55,000 votes out of around 3,939,000 total votes cast.

This margin of victory is much smaller considering Georgia law requires candidates to obtain more than 50 percent of the total vote or else face a runoff with the second-highest contender. In this context, Kemp escaped a second election with Abrams by about 17,000 votes.

As is typical for states in the deep south, white men voted overwhelmingly for the Republican candidate — where they made the vast bulk of Kemp’s base on Election Day. Kemp also performed extremely well with white women, capturing about 75 percent of their vote. On the other side, black women — perhaps hoping to elect the first black female governor in U.S. history — voted for Abrams by a 97-percent margin.

However, it’s one segment of the Georgia population that has raised eyebrows: black men.

Eight percent of black men pulled the lever for Kemp on Election Day, according to the Associated Press’ VoteCast. CNN’s network exit polling projected that number to be as much as 11 percent. The numbers reflect the double-digit support Donald Trump enjoyed from this demographic in Georgia following the 2016 presidential election. Exit polling following the 2016 election indicated that 15 percent of black men voted for Trump, bucking the norms of the previous two presidential election cycles.

Experts are surmising that black men are returning to their voting behavior before Barack Obama — the first black man elected U.S. president in history — entered the national political scene in 2008.

“Now that Obama is out, basically black men have gone back to where they were before” in terms of supporting the Democratic Party, Ted Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, told The Washington Post. “The fact that Abrams got in the high 80s or low 90s means she outperformed Democratic candidates, pre-Obama, among black men.”

Before the 2008 election, roughly 82 percent of black men favored Democratic candidates — a close reflection to how they voted in the Georgia gubernatorial contest. Johnson attributes this disparity among black men and women to “self-determination and economic empowerment” themes found in conservative ideology, concepts that resonate among males. (RELATED: Stacey Abrams Declares Georgia Gubernatorial Race ‘Not A Free And Fair Election’)

“[T]hat entrepreneurial spirit is alive in the black community,” Johnson said.

While the Georgia gubernatorial election has ended, the controversy surrounding the outcome has not. Abrams — a former state representative and romance novelist — has vehemently tried to delegitimize the election results. Abrams, without evidence, has claimed Kemp used his authority as the Georgia secretary of state to suppress the black vote. When Abrams admitted she would lose the election, she refused to use the word “concede,” arguing it would “acknowledge an action is right, true, or proper.”

Black Friday Online Sales Hit Record Number,"Online sales during Black Friday hit an all time high in 2018, reaching over $6.2 billion in sales — a massive increase to the previous year.

There was a 23 percent increase compared to 2017’s $5.03 billion, according to Saturday report from Adobe Analytics. The numbers show many consumers are staying home to shop instead of heading to crowded malls or stores, most of which have long lines on Black Friday.

“Retailers have done their part to build better mobile experiences for consumers and turning nearly 10 percent more smartphone visitors into buyers this Black Friday versus last,” Taylor Schreiner, the director of Adobe Digital Insights, said to Fox Business.

Numerous incidents of chaotic shopping experiences were reported Friday, which contribute to the historic numbers of shoppers who bought online. (RELATED: Here’s A Definite Round Up Of All The Best Black Friday Brawls You Missed Today [WATCH])

Record numbers are also expected for Cyber Monday according to Schreiner. Adobe is predicting around $7.8 billion in sales.

“Indeed, the entire holiday season continues to see vigorous growth with Cyber Monday expected to be the largest U.S. online shopping day in history,” Schreiner told Fox Business.

"Black Unemployment Rate Falls In November, Ties Record Low","Unemployment amongst black Americans fell in November to 5.9 percent, tying a record low.

Meanwhile, the national unemployment rate stood unchanged at 3.7 percent, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

While the unemployment picture for black Americans is still higher than other demographic groups, it had never fallen below 7 percent since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking the statistic in 1972. The rate for Hispanics is 4.5 percent, while whites are at 3.4 percent, and Asians stand at 2.7 percent.

The black unemployment rate also hit 5.9 percent in May, then a first-time record.

Employment in manufacturing has increased by 288,000 over the year, BLS reported, with transportation and warehousing adding 192,000 jobs, and professional and business services adding 561,000. (RELATED: Trump To Black Voters: ‘What The Hell Do You Have To Lose?’)

The 155,000 jobs created in November fell short of expectations predicted by economists, CNBC reported.

GOP Chair Ronna McDaniel touted the numbers via Twitter on Saturday, calling it a “huge achievement” for President Trump.

Black Witness Booed For Testifying Against Slave Reparations In Congress,"A black writer was booed Wednesday for testifying against slave reparations in a congressional hearing.

Quillette columnist Coleman Hughes said reparation payments to the descendants of slaves would insult black Americans, further divide the country, and make him and other descendants of slaves “victims without their consent.”

The public present for the Democrat-led hearing did not take his opinion well, prompting Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen to tell them to “chill.”

WATCH:



“Racism is a bloody stain on this country’s history and I consider our failure to pay reparations directly to freed slaves after the civil war to be one of the greatest injustices ever perpetuated by the U.S. Government,” Hughes said.

He added, however: “Black people don’t need another apology. We need safer neighborhoods and better schools. We need a less punitive criminal justice system. We need affordable health care. And none of these things can be achieved through reparations for slavery.”

Members of the crowd booed at this point.

“If we were to pay reparations today, we would only divide the country further, making it harder to build the political coalitions required to solve the problems facing black people today,” Hughes added.

“We would insult black Americans by putting a price on the suffering of their ancestors, and we would turn the relationship between black Americans and white Americans from a coalition into a transaction, from a union between citizens, into a lawsuit between plaintiffs and defendants.” (RELATED: Here’s Where Each 2020 Democratic Candidate Stands On Slavery Reparations)

Hughes pointed out that while he is a descendant of slaves who worked on Thomas Jefferson’s plantation, he was born into a privileged home in the suburbs and attended an Ivy League School. Reparations would give him resources, although he is not struggling financially, and withhold them from other black Americans “with the wrong ancestry” who might be poor.

“I understand that reparations are about what people are owed regardless of how well they are doing,” he said.

I understand that. But people who are owed for slavery are no longer here. And we’re not entitled to collect on their debts. Reparations, by definition, are only given to victims. So the moment you give me reparations, you’ve made me into a victim without my consent. Not just that, you’ve made one-third of black Americans who poll against reparations into victims without their consent. And black Americans have fought too long for the right to define themselves to be spoken for in such a condescending manner. The question is not what America owes me by virtue of my ancestry, the question is what all Americans owe each other by virtue of being citizens of the same nation. And the obligation of citizenship is not transactional. It’s not contingent on ancestry. It never expires, and it can’t be paid off. For all these reasons, bill HR 40 is a moral and political mistake. Thank you.

Hughes was booed again as he concluded his testimony, causing Cohen to bang his gavel and hush the crowd. “Chill, chill, chill, chill,” he said. “He was presumptive, but he still has a right to speak.”

The bill at issue was introduced by Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, and would commission a study on reparations payments. Democratic Sen. Cory Booker, who is running for president, introduced a companion bill in the Senate.

A number of Democratic presidential candidates, including Sens. Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand, have endorsed the bills. Former Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke has also pledged his support.

Republican senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have panned the bills, indicating they’re unlikely to gain any real traction.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2019/06/19/black-democrat-booed-slave-reparations-congress/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj_nZONgLT9AhU5MlkFHfUZAQU4KBAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw2UcclB6Ha8Y0ba1yzxa2vW,2019-06-19
OWENS: Black Folks Don’t Need Reparations — We’re Doing Well On Our Own,"There must be another election coming up, because Democrats are once again shamelessly pandering to black folks.

Their latest ruse is reviving the idea of reparations — literally, race-based transfer payments from white Americans to black Americans. Can you believe that’s really a legislative priority for Democrats at a time when African American unemployment is hovering at record lows?

Nevertheless, 64 House Democrats are co-sponsoring a bill that would establish a commission to work out the details of a national reparations policy, and the House Judiciary Committee recently held a hearing to draw public attention to the effort.

It’s important to study the text of the bill in question. Most of it is a rambling litany of the real evils of slavery, spiced up with “woke” language for a contemporary audience, such as the notion that slavery was immoral in part because American slaves were denied “African citizenship rights” and “cultural heritage.” But one thing is very clear: this legislation is concerned with racial reparations that are supposedly owed not just to the descendants of former slaves, but to “African Americans as a group.”

The underlying theory of reparations is that some Americans must pay other Americans compensation in order to redress historical injustices that were perpetrated long before anybody who is alive today was even born.

The concept is utterly impractical as policy, and trying to determine which people are owed how much and by whom would only serve to exacerbate the existing divisions in our society. The whole concept of reparations is also antithetical to the founding principles of this country, as Democratic presidential candidate and Sen. Cory Booker more or less acknowledged during the hearing.

America’s founding, Booker told us, is “tainted” with “racism and white supremacy” that we have yet to “acknowledge.” When Democrats such as Booker speak of “white supremacy,” of course, they’re really talking about America’s founding principles of equality before the law, individual liberty, and limited government.

The type of institutional discrimination that Democrats want people to associate with the term “white supremacy,” on the other hand, is practiced almost exclusively by liberals at all levels of government.

Flint, Michigan; Los Angeles, California; Chicago, Illinois. The places where African Americans are suffering the most hardship are invariably cities that have been controlled for decades by Democratic politicians. Long, difficult experience shows us that feel-good liberal policies do far more harm than good for the black community.

The whole reparations enterprise starts to look even more sinister when you consider how it would work in practice, a determination that the legislation punts to a 13-member commission tasked with recommending “appropriate remedies” for historical discrimination.

If the commission were established today, President Trump and Nancy Pelosi would each get to appoint three of the members, and the Senate president pro tempore (currently Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch) would appoint one more. The remaining six slots — almost half the total — are reserved for “major civil society and reparations organizations that have historically championed the cause of reparatory justice” — in other words, radical left-wing activists.

Dozens of those “reparatory justice” advocates were on hand at the hearing itself, where they booed and hissed at Coleman Hughes, a young African American scholar who dared to argue that there are better ways to help American blacks than reparations, and more pressing issues facing the African American community than the injustices suffered by their ancestors more than a century ago.

That’s because the Democrats don’t actually care about justice, fairness, or any of the other noble principles they constantly invoke in their public comments. The real purpose of holding this conversation about reparations is to reinforce the Democrats’ hold on the African American vote in advance of a critical election that most people expect will be decided by the slimmest of margins. It also promotes the Democratic Party dogma that the redistribution of wealth by a vast and powerful central government is how our society should be structured.

Black Americans don’t need reparations — or any of the other destructive policies Democrats use to keep us dependent on their supposedly benevolent protection. We’re doing better than ever right now, and we’re doing it on our own.

Congressional Black Caucus Accuses Justice Democrats Of Trying To Unseat Black Lawmakers,"The Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) is accusing Justice Democrats of working to unseat black lawmakers.

CBC members say the Justice Democrats, a political action committee associated with the left wing of the Democratic Party, is targeting black House representatives in primary elections, according to The Hill.

Justice Democrats is supporting primary opponents of eight term Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar and 10-term Missouri Democratic Rep. Lacy Clay — who is a member of the CBC. The Justice Democrats are also threatening to knock-off New York Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who is the chairman of the Democratic caucus, a CBC member and potential successor to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. (RELATED: 30-Year Democratic Congressman Gets Progressive Challenger Backed By Justice Democrats)

But the CBC doesn’t think it’s going to end there, as Justice Democrats seeks to oust anyone they don’t believe is sufficiently progressive to advance its agenda. The CBC leadership is concerned that other black Democrats in Congress could soon be under fire, including New York Rep. Yvette Clarke, Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver and Maryland Rep. Anthony Brown.

“It just seems strange that the social Democrats seem to be targeting members of the Congressional Black Caucus, individuals who have stood and fought to make sure that African-Americans are included and part of this process,” CBC leader and New York Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks told The Hill.

“I don’t know what that agenda is, but if they want to come after members of the Black Caucus, it’s two ways,” Meeks added.

Ironically, the two Democratic congresswoman most identified with the Justice Democrats, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, could also face challengers in their upcoming primaries. Minnesota Democrats reportedly want Omar gone and Ocasio-Cortez has spoken of a “serious” primary challenge. She defeated former New York Rep. Joe Crowley in a huge political upset.

In a statement, Justice Democrats’ executive director, Alexandra Rojas, denied the group is targeting black members of Congress because it has backed Black Lives Matter activist Cori Bush and Democratic Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley, one of “the squad” of four progressives that have consistently bucked the establishment Democrats and whom House Speaker criticized this week for their constant sniping.

"Black Unemployment Hits Record Low, Spurred By Uptick In Employment For Black Women","Black unemployment hit a record low in August, spurred by an uptick in employment for black women.

The unemployment rate for black workers fell from 6.0% in July to 5.5 % in August, data from the Department of Labor reveals. These number surpass the record low set in May 2018 of 5.9% for black unemployment.

These record low numbers are impacted by unemployment numbers for black women. While July numbers revealed unemployment for black women to be at 5.2%, August numbers saw that figure drop to 4.4%.

The unemployment rate for black men increased, conversely, from 5.8% from 5.9%. (RELATED: Vast Majority Of Women Affected By Alabama, Georgia Laws Are Black)

130,000 jobs were added in August, about 30,000 fewer jobs than were added in July. Unemployment remained at 3.7 %, consistent with the last three months. The labor force participation rate slightly rose from 63.0% in July to 63.2% in August.

Economists predicted the unemployment rate would remain the same at 3.7%, according to the Wall Street Journal, and that employers would add 150,000 jobs. (RELATED: Unemployment Claims Hit 50-Year Low)

The unemployment rate has held steady between 4% and 3.7% for more than a year before the April jobs report showed it drop to 3.6%. Prior to April’s report, the consistent unemployment rate suggested that workers are jumping back into the workforce to fill open jobs, rather than the workers who are currently collecting unemployment welfare, according to WSJ.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib Tells Detroit Police That Only Black Officials Should Work Facial Recognition Technology,"Democratic Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib told Detroit’s police chief that he should only have black officials assessing the city’s facial recognition technology because “non-African-Americans think African-Americans all look the same.”

The congresswoman made the comments while taking a tour of Detroit’s Real Time Crime Center, where she saw live video from cameras that have been posted on traffic lights and around local businesses, the Detroit News reported Monday.

Tlaib dismissed the technology as “bullsh*t” in an Aug. 20 tweet.

.@detroitpolice You should probably rethink this whole facial recognition bulls**t.https://t.co/ZvHEEQxzWB — Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) August 20, 2019

Tlaib’s spokesman attempted to explain the representative’s statement by insisting she meant accuracy is important when black people compose 80% of the city’s population. (RELATED: Rashida Tlaib Calls Former ICE Chief ‘Ruthless And Inhumane’ In Fiery Hearing Exchange)

Tlaib was a contentious guest throughout the tour, according to the News, with the congresswoman and member of the House Democrats “squad” arguing with the police chief about how the facial recognition technology is used, with her contending that it misidentifies black people more than white people.

“Analysts need to be African-Americans, not people that are not,” Tlaib told Craig. “I think non-African-Americans think African-Americans all look the same.”

She claimed she has seen the same sort of thing occurring on the floor of the House of Representatives with “people calling Elijah Cummings ‘John Lewis,’ and John Lewis ‘Elijah Cummings,’ and they’re totally different people,” Tlaib said, referring to two of her Democratic colleagues. “I see it all the time, and I love them because they go along with it.” (RELATED: Rashida Tlaib Wrote Column For Nation Of Islam Publication)

Craig told her: “I trust people who are trained, regardless of race; regardless of gender. It’s about the training.”

“I know,” Tlaib responded. “But it does make a huge difference with the analysts.”

Tlaib spokesman Denzel McCampbell on Tuesday offered a study by the Memorial University Of Newfound as proof that facial recognition technology is best used by people of the same race as those they are assessing.

“The studies [are] related to cross-race effect or other-race effect,” McCampbell said in an email to the News. “This has shown that individuals are less accurate when identifying people from a race other than their own.”

It’s Impossible To Watch The End Of ‘Black Hawk Down’ Without Getting Emotional,"There’s no way you can watch the end of “Black Hawk Down” without taking a punch to your heart.

As you all know, I’ve been dropping lists of the best content for all of you to watch, and I hope you’ve been following the suggestions.

After watching “Black Hawk Down” for about the 500th time, I’ve determined you simply can’t watch the end of the film about the Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia without getting emotional.

You just can’t. It’s not possible. You show me a man who says they don’t get emotional at the final scene, and I’ll show you somebody who is a liar.

In the final moments of the movie, Josh Hartnett’s character sits next to the body of a fallen teammate and talks about how nobody asks to be a hero. It just sometimes turns out that way.

In what might be the most heartbreaking line in the whole movie, Hartnett says, “I’m going to talk to ma and pa when I get home, okay.”

Watch the final seconds below.

Now, sit there and honestly try to tell me that you can watch it without getting emotional. It gets me every time.

It’s gets me every damn time, and I’m sure it’ll get me next time too.

Celebrities Rally Support For Black-Owned Businesses Destroyed By Riots,"Several celebrities have been fundraising to rebuild black-owned businesses that were destroyed or damaged by the riots during the past week.

After the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after an officer kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes, protests began across the country and turned violent in many places. Rioters vandalized and looted businesses, leaving them badly damaged or completely destroyed.

Celebrities have taken to social media to show their support for the Black Lives Matter movement over the past several days, including support for charities dedicated to rebuilding black-owned businesses.

Lizzo posted a link to We Love Lake Street, a charity dedicated to rebuilding the Lake Street businesses in Minneapolis, which are mostly owned by immigrants and people of color, according to the charity’s website.

“Minneapolis is as fed up as they are resilient,” Lizzo said in an Instagram video. She gave thanks to “the peaceful organization in Minneapolis,” saying that “we see you, even if the media chooses not to cover you.”

Her Instagram post also included links to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which pays the bail for those arrested while protesting, and a petition to defund the Minneapolis Police Department.

Rapper Kanye West has donated over $2 million to charity, including funds to help black-owned businesses in his community of Chicago, the Chicago Tribune reported. (RELATED: Kanye West Joins George Floyd Protesters In Chicago)

The rapper has also set up a college tuition fund for Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter and promised to cover the legal costs for the families of Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed black man who was shot while jogging in February, and Breonna Taylor, who was shot by police officers in her home in March.

Celebrity Stylist Law Roach said on Instagram that he’s using $25,000 to help black-owned businesses rebuild.

“If you are a black business that is destroyed and you are not insured I’m starting a fund with 25k of my own money to help rebuild,” he said. “And I’m asking my friends in fashion to donate as well.”

A fundraiser by the West Broadway Business and Area Coalition and the Northside Funders Group has raised over $1.5 million to help businesses in Minneapolis who were affected by the protests or coronavirus pandemic. The organizers are hoping to reach $5 million in donations.

The Northside Funders Group said in a Facebook post that “Restore North will help the community rebuild, with 100% of all proceeds going directly to affected businesses and the community.”

“Despite centuries of deliberate disinvestment by institutions both public and private, North Minneapolis is home to vibrant neighborhoods, thriving businesses, and resilient residents,” they said.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2020/06/08/celebrities-black-businesses-riots-george-floyd-protests-lizzo-kanye-west-george-floyd-black-lives-matter/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjx7uaPgLT9AhWZEFkFHcpdBHk4UBAWegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw1DTmvJTO236ZBNMtH6kZzF,2020-06-08
"EXCLUSIVE: Black Lives Matter Accused California Charity Of Improperly Using Its Name. Its Fiscal Sponsor Reported Granting $90,000 To The Alleged Imposter","The national arm of Black Lives Matter accused a California-based charity called Black Lives Matter Foundation of improperly using its name Monday.

But BLM Global Network’s fiscal sponsor, Thousand Currents, reported in multiple Form 990s submitted to the IRS that it had granted funds to BLM Foundation.

A spokesperson for Thousand Currents told the Daily Caller News Foundation the funds were actually donated to BLM local chapters and that it would be filing amended Form 990s with the IRS to correct the record.

The charity that manages the finances of Black Lives Matter’s national arm will file amended tax returns with the IRS after it incorrectly reported giving $90,000 to an unrelated foundation that the national movement accused of improperly using the BLM name, a spokesman told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The charity, Thousand Currents, which has served as the fiscal sponsor for Black Lives Matter Global Network, reported in its Form 990 for its 2017 fiscal year that it granted $28,130 to an unrelated California charity called Black Lives Matter Foundation. The following year, Thousand Currents reported granting an additional $62,000 to the foundation.

BLM Foundation was “improperly using our name,” a spokesperson for BLM Global Network told BuzzFeed News on Monday. The spokesperson added that the national group intends to “call them out and follow up.”

Adding to the confusion between the two unrelated BLM organizations, BLM Global Network identified itself as “Black Lives Matter Foundation, Inc.” in a statement posted on its website in September 2019.

The donations to BLM Foundation reported on Thousand Currents’s Form 990s were incorrect, a spokesperson for Thousand Currents told the DCNF and added that and they would be submitting amended filings to IRS to reflect that the funds were granted to local BLM chapters.

“No, grants were not made to the Black Lives Matter Foundation, and it is inaccurate to state that,” a spokesperson for Thousand Currents told the DCNF. “The [employer identification number] was listed incorrectly on the 2017 and 2018 Forms 990. Those funds were granted to Black Lives Matter local chapters in 2017 and 2018 to be used for those chapters’ mission and work in support of Black communities.”

“We are working with our accountants on correcting this minor clerical issue,” the spokesperson added.

BLM Global Network spent millions on consultants, travel and compensation for its own staff between July 2017 and June 2019, according to audited financial statements prepared by Thousand Currents, the DCNF previously reported. The organization granted $328,000 to outside organizations, which include local BLM chapters, during that same timeframe, a figure that represents about 6% of its total spending. (RELATED: National Arm Of Black Lives Matter Spent Millions On Travel And Consultants, Financial Statements Show)

Not only does BLM Foundation share no relationship with BLM Global Network, its founder, Robert Ray Barnes, told the DCNF during a phone interview that he’s ideologically opposed to the proposals put forth by the national BLM movement, which has called for the defunding of police nationwide.

“We need to change the focus of how we deal with the police, but we need to do it coming from a more positive standpoint,” Barnes said. “We have to at some point … reach situations where we can sit down and talk.”

Barnes was bewildered that BLM Global Network accused him of improperly using his name. He noted that a lack of transparency on the part of the national organization often leads people to mail donations intended for BLM Global Network to his charity’s address in California.

“When they send a check to me that says ‘Black Lives Matter Global Network’ at my address — are they that hard to find?” Barnes said. “If you are this major organization, how could anyone mistake me for them, to send it to my address but addressed to them? That means that somehow they went and found me, but couldn’t find them, even with their own name.”

Barnes said his organization returns any donation not specifically addressed to BLM Foundation.

Barnes said BLM Foundation was founded in 2015 — nearly two years before BLM Global Network registered as a business entity in Delaware in late 2016 — and has since then been developing programs that will work to positively reform police departments.

While BLM Foundation has not formally launched any of its programs, Barnes said it has also used its charitable funds to support local churches as well as organizations such as the Peaceful Warriors Foundation, which works to celebrate the music, life and stories of U.S. military veterans.

The state of California issued a cease and desist order to BLM Foundation in December 2019 for failing to submit financial reports on time.

Barnes appealed the order in late December, according to his charity’s file with the California Department of Justice. He told the DCNF on Friday he was actively communicating with the state to file all necessary paperwork for his charity.

"Overwhelming Majority Of Black Americans Support Current Or Increased Police Presence, Survey Shows","Eighty-one percent of black Americans said they would prefer if police spend the same amount of time or more time in their neighborhoods, according to a Gallup survey released Wednesday.

The survey, which also includes responses from other racial and ethnic groups, indicates that 20% of black respondents said they want an increased police presence, 61% want the same presence, and 19% want less.

The support for current policing levels was fairly consistent across racial lines, with an average of 67% of Americans saying the current level of time police spend in their area is adequate. Asian American respondents expressed the greatest preference for decreasing police presence, with 28% favoring this option, the survey shows.

When asked how frequently they interact with police, 32% of black respondents said very often or often, compared with 28% of Hispanic respondents, 22% of white respondents, and 21% of Asian respondents, according to Gallup. (RELATED: Where Does Joe Biden Actually Stand On Defunding The Police?)

The greatest disparity among these racial/ethnic groups was about how confident respondents feel that the police would treat them “with courtesy and respect.”

Among black respondents, 39% said that they were not too confident or not at all confident of receiving positive treatment, compared with 22% of Hispanic respondents, 22% of Asian respondents, and 9% of white respondents.

The survey is part of the Gallup Center on Black Voices, which is “devoted to studying and highlighting the experiences of more than 40 million Black Americans: tracking and reporting on progress on life outcomes and a life well-lived.”

The data contributes to an ongoing debate surrounding policing practices in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers in late May.

Many protesters and activists, largely within the Black Lives Matter movement, have voiced their support to defund police departments amid increased awareness of officer brutality.

A recent poll conducted by the Washington Post and ABC News found that while 55% of Americans oppose redirecting police funds, 63% support Black Lives Matter, Forbes reported.

MSNBC’s Tiffany Cross Calls Black RNC Speakers A ‘Modern-Day Minstrel Show’,"MSNBC guest host Tiffany Cross called black Republican National Convention speakers a “modern-day minstrel show” during a Sunday morning segment on “AM Joy.”

Cross brought up the topic with a panel in the context of current GOP strategy in light of a new poll showing President Donald Trump gaining ground with Hispanics.

Last week’s Republican National Convention included a broad slate of African-American speakers who expressed their support for the president, including Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former NFL player and college football legend Herschel Walker, White House staffer Ja’Ron Smith, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, and others.

“I mean, I watched the Republican convention and seeing the slue of black speakers that they had it really did look like a modern day minstrel show to me,” Cross told panelist and MSNBC contributor Jason Johnson. “What did you make of it?”

WATCH:

“There was a tremendous amount of diversity from the sunken place during the RNC,” Johnson responded. “So we have to remember how important it is that they found that whole slew of black folks. This is the thing, Tiffany, you were very correct when you put this out at the beginning, none of these people have any credibility with the black community, none of these people can erase the stain of of the president’s own racist rhetoric. None of what he was saying makes sense.”

Johnson went on to criticize what was done at the convention as for “racist white people who are already going to vote for them” so they can feel “slightly less racist.” (RELATED: Tucker Carlson Argues That ‘For The First Time Since The Wuhan Coronavirus Arrived Here, The President Seems Likely To Win Reelection’)

Black Lives Matter Co-Founder’s New Org Sponsored By Group That Raised China’s Communist Flag Over Boston City Hall,"Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza’s new organization, Black Futures Lab, is fiscally sponsored by the Chinese Progressive Association, which organized the raising of communist China’s flag over Boston City Hall last year.

The “donate” button on Black Futures Lab’s website takes users to a donation page hosted by the CPA, which notes that “Black Futures Lab is a fiscally sponsored project of the Chinese Progressive Association.” The partnership between the two groups was first reported by the Daily Signal on Tuesday.

The CPA last year sponsored the raising of the Chinese flag over Boston City Hall to mark the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party creating the People’s Republic of China. The event sparked a protest from demonstrators opposed to the Chinese government’s actions in Hong Kong, 7News Boston reported at the time. (RELATED: WaPo, NYT Aiding China’s Global Propaganda Efforts, Watchdog Warns)

According to its mission statement, the CPA “educates, organizes and empowers the low income and working class immigrant Chinese community in San Francisco to build collective power with other oppressed communities to demand better living and working conditions and justice for all people.”

Black Futures Lab “is focused on collaborating with Black people, Black elected officials, and Black community-based organizations to build progressive political and legislative power in order to get us closer to having the communities and political power we deserve,” according to its website. Garza launched the organization in 2018.

Garza is a vocal opponent of American-style capitalism. She said in a 2015 speech that capitalism needs to be abolished in order for black lives to matter.

“It’s not possible for a world to emerge where black lives matter if it’s under capitalism,” she said in 2015 at the left-wing convention Left Forum. “And it’s not possible to abolish capitalism without a struggle against national oppression and gender oppression.”

One of Garza’s fellow co-founders of Black Lives Matter, Patrisse Cullors, described herself and Garza as “trained Marxists” in 2015 as well.

“Myself and Alicia in particular are trained organizers. We are trained Marxists. We are super-versed on, sort of, ideological theories,” Cullors said.

Neither the CPA nor Garza returned the Daily Caller News Foundation’s requests for comment for this article.

Billionaire Leon Black Allegedly Bankrolled Jeffrey Epstein Even After Disgraced Financier Was Convicted Of Soliciting Sex From A Teen,"Leon Black, a billionaire financier, allegedly wired disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein at least $50 million since 2008, despite denying a deep relationship with him, according to the New York Times.

Black, an executive at Apollo Global Management, said in 2019 that Epstein had never done any business with Apollo. However, he did note that Epstein did do personal work for him.

“Mr. Epstein has provided professional services to my family partnership and related family entities, involving tax, estate planning, and philanthropic advice,” according to a transcript of the phone call. Black also said he donated to “charitable organizations” that Epstein was affiliated with.

Black wired Epstein at least $50 million in the years following Epstein’s 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a teenage girl, and the numbers appear to be a bit shady, The New York Times (NYT) reported.

Among the transfers, $10 million reportedly went toward a foundation Epstein started. Two people familiar with the transfers estimated the money wired from Black to Epstein could be as high as $75 million, per the same report.

In 2011, Epstein’s financial advisory firm – Financial Trust – and Black and his family members invested in an emissions control company, Environmental Solutions Worldwide, per the NYT. Two of Black’s sons currently sit on the board.

Over the summer, Deutsche Bank was fined for dismissing red flags against Epstein’s financial activities. Part of the report allegedly showed a payment of $22.5 million to Plan D in 2017 by a company called BV70 LLC, which Deutsche said owned Black’s yacht. Plan D managed Epstein’s Gulfstream jet, the NYT reported.

When an employee at Deutsche questioned the payment, she was allegedly told that it was a fee for a consulting service provided by Southern Trust Company, one of Epstein’s operations in the Virgin Islands, despite no explanation as to why the payment went to Plan D. (RELATED: ‘Would You Mind Taking A Crack At It?’ Photos Show Alleged Epstein Victim Massaging Bill Clinton)

Epstein reportedly told officials in the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2013 that his business, Southern Trust Company, was a “DNA data-mining and genetic research provider with a ‘financial arm.'” The company had no scientists on its staff and there’s little evidence to support Epstein’s claim that the company was involved in DNA- data mining, per the same report.

Black allegedly paid millions in fees to Southern Trust Company, according to the NYT.

Despite Black’s insistence that his ties to Epstein were relatively business-related and did not involve any personal ties, the NYT reports the contrary.

In 1997, Black made Epstein one of the original trustees of the Debra and Leon Black Foundation. Black was a frequent guest at Epstein’s New York mansion, and often met the financial mogul for breakfast or lunch. Black also visited Epstein’s private island residence in the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2012, according to the NYT.

Stephanie Pillersdorf, a spokeswoman for Black, said the transactions between Black and Epstein pertained primarily to business ventures.

“Mr. Black received personal trusts and estates planning advice as well as family office philanthropy and investment services from several financial and legal advisers, including Mr. Epstein, during a six-year period, between 2012 and 2017,” Pillersdorf said, per the NYT. “The trusts and estate planning advice was vetted by leading auditors and law firms.”

Pillersdorf added that Black “continues to be appalled by the conduct that led to the criminal charges against Mr. Epstein, and he deeply regrets having any involvement with him.”

The civil rights activist also expressed a partiality for democratic socialism and said he understood the deep emotions that drive rioting in the United States.

“If we as Negroes succumb to the temptation of using violence in our struggle, unborn generations will be the recipients of a long and bitter night of—a long and desolate night of bitterness,” King said. “And our only legacy to the future will be an endless reign of meaningless chaos.”

Civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. advocated for solutions to racial issues that do not wholly align with the agenda and past actions of the Black Lives Matter organization, though he shared some ideas about economic restructuring.

King Jr. encouraged peaceful protest rather than violence and rioting, methods that have been linked to the Black Lives Matter organization. He also expressed a partiality for democratic socialism and said he understood the deep emotions about racism that drive rioting in the United States.

“The strong man is the man who will not hit back, who can stand up for his rights and yet not hit back,” Martin Luther King Jr. said during a 1956 speech at Holt Street Baptist Church.

“If we as Negroes succumb to the temptation of using violence in our struggle, unborn generations will be the recipients of a long and bitter night of—a long and desolate night of bitterness,” King said. “And our only legacy to the future will be an endless reign of meaningless chaos.”

These statements are evocative of King’s rallying cry and legacy of non-violent activism as he called on Americans to stand up for equality and against racism. (RELATED: Here Are The Other, Unstated Agendas Of ‘Black Lives Matter’)

“Our use of passive resistance in Montgomery,” King told TIME Magazine, “is not based on resistance to get rights for ourselves, but to achieve friendship with the men who are denying us our rights, and change them through friendship and a bond of Christian understanding before God.”

Some movements that oppose racism today appear to embrace the possibility of violence in protest — particularly Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. (BLM). Not to be confused with the broader movement that espouses the “Black Lives Matter” slogan, the BLM organization embraces radical policies and has been linked repeatedly to rioting in the past year.

Founded in the aftermath of the 2013 Trayvon Martin shooting, BLM’s stated mission is to “eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.” The organization commemorated King in a Monday statement, promising to “persevere” as King did and “speak out and take action against injustice everywhere.”

“We’re fighting for our lives and liberation,” the statement said. “We’re mourning the Black lives lost to systemic racism, police brutality, and COVID-19. And we’re recovering from a white supremacist failed coup at our nation’s Capitol just 12 days ago — all while still trying to reckon with the racist roots of the country we are fighting so hard to improve.”

BLM’s Stated Mission

While King sought an end to segregation and racism, BLM not only prioritizes fighting “police brutality” but has also professed the ambition to increase abortion access, to expand LGBTQ equality, and up until about September 2020, to disrupt the Western family unit. The page on which BLM previously promised to disrupt the Western family unit was removed in September 2020.

“It is a political move,” journalist Jason Whitlock said on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” in July 2020 amidst BLM-led riots and protests. “It’s a communist political move. … I’ve seen many of these guys, they claim they’re in Christianity and their religious beliefs — do they understand Black Lives Matter, communism, Marxism, is anti-religious?”

The movement’s leaders also have multiple ties to communist ideology: BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors told TIME in 2018 that Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and Mao Zedong are among her intellectual influences who helped her gain a “new understanding around what our economies could look like.” (RELATED: Black Lives Matter Co-Founder Alicia Garza In 2015: Capitalism Must Be Abolished For Black Lives To Matter)

“We actually do have an ideological frame,” she said, according to the New York Post. “Myself and Alicia in particular, we’re trained organizers. We are trained Marxists. We are super-versed on ideological theories.”

BLM does not explicitly mention Marx on its website, but the organization does make mention of terms with Marxist influences, such as the word “comrade.”

Cullors also said in the Harvard Law Review that reparations are “justified by the historical pains and damage caused by European settler colonialism” and that abolition means “no borders” and “an end to U.S. wars at home and abroad.”

MLK’s Links To Socialism

Comments made by King in his letters and speeches show that he believed democratic socialism was a possible avenue to ending racial disparities.

“I imagine you already know that I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic,” he wrote in a 1952 love letter to his future wife, Coretta Scott. In the same letter, he described himself as ” radically opposed to communism,” writing that “Destructive means cannot bring about constructive ends.”

Later on in his career, King would advocate against capitalism and for a “better distribution of wealth.”

“You can’t talk about solving the economic problem of the Negro without talking about billions of dollars,” he told his staff in 1966, according to the Huffington Post. “You can’t talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums.”

“You’re really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then,” he continued. “You are messing with captains of industry. Now this means that we are treading in difficult water, because it really means that we are saying that something is wrong with capitalism. There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism.”

BLM Linked Rioting

The US Crisis Monitor, a Princeton University project, found that 91% of the 637 riots between May 26 and Sept. 12 were linked to Black Lives Matter groups.

The data also found that 7% of these Black Lives Matter-linked riots turned violent, defining riots as “demonstrations in which any demonstrators engage in violently disruptive or destructive acts (e.g. violence, looting, vandalism, etc.), as well as mob violence in which violent mobs target other individuals, property, businesses, or other groups.”

The US Crisis Monitor defined Black Lives Matter-linked events as “demonstrations that have a local BLM group involved; when the main issue of the demonstration concerns the police killing of a specific Black person (e.g. George Floyd, Breonna Taylor;) when the main issue of the demonstration concerns police brutality against Black people in general; or when the demonstration is in solidarity with the movement in the USA against police brutality against Black people.”

Some Black Lives Matter leaders have publicly declined to condemn violence. (RELATED: Black Lives Matter Linked To 91% Of Riots Over Three Months, Study Finds)

“I don’t care if someone decides to loot a Gucci or a Macy’s or a Nike store, because that makes sure that person eats,” Black Lives Matter Chicago organizer Ariel Atkins said, equating looting with reparations. “That makes sure that person has clothes. That is reparations.”

“I think that it is a tool of white supremacy to say if you want freedom, then you get it by protesting peacefully,” Black Lives Matter New York leader Hawk Newsome said in comments that downplayed rioting.

“I don’t condone nor do I condemn rioting,” Newsome said on another occasion.

Martin Luther King’s Thoughts On Rioting

King addressed rioting in a famous speech titled “The Other America” in which he both condemned rioting and reminded Americans of what emotions and tragedies spur rioting. King noted that American cities are “potentially powder kegs” as a result of the “disappointment and even bitterness in the Negro communities.”

“Let me say as I’ve always said, and I will always continue to say, that riots are socially destructive and self-defeating,” King said. “I’m still convinced that nonviolence is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for freedom and justice.”

“I feel that violence will only create more social problems than they will solve,” he continued. “That in a real sense it is impracticable for the Negro to even think of mounting a violent revolution in the United States. So I will continue to condemn riots, and continue to say to my brothers and sisters that this is not the way. And continue to affirm that there is another way.”

In comments that many activists and BLM proponents clipped and cited as vindication for rioting this summer, King continued, “But at the same time, it is as necessary for me to be as vigorous in condemning the conditions which cause persons to feel that they must engage in riotous activities as it is for me to condemn riots.”

King emphasized that the riots do not “develop out of thin air” and that “certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots.”

“In the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear?” pic.twitter.com/Als3jhxaGH — The Martin Luther King, Jr. Center (@TheKingCenter) May 28, 2020

“But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard,” he said. “And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity.”

King said that America stood in danger of recurring riots as long as “America postpones justice,” urging reforms to prevent such incidents from happening again.

“Social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention,” he said.

"Black Lives Matter Page Owner Allegedly Used $450,000 In Donations For Personal Use, FBI Says","A federal grand jury in Cleveland, Ohio, charged Maejor Page, whose real name is Tyree Conyers-Page, with three counts of money laundering and one count of wire fraud, according to a Department of Justice (DOJ) press release.

The indictment set forth by the government alleged that Page created a 501(c)(3) Facebook account titled “Black Lives Matter of Greater Atlanta.” He allegedly used the account to defraud individuals of over more than $450,000 after the tax-exempt status was revoked by the IRS, according to a press release.

“Page is accused of using unprecedented tensions and uncertainty due to widespread civil unrest and a global pandemic to fill his own bank account,” FBI Special Agent Eric B. Smith said, according to the press release.

The indictment stated that from around May 2020 to approximately September 2020, Mr.Page, created a devious scheme banking on vulnerable individuals to defraud supporters by falsely depicting that all donations made to his 501(c)(3) charity would be used in support of fighting racial injustices.

Page started the Facebook page in February 2016, and in around March of 2016, Mr.Page registered “BLACK LIVES MATTER OF GREATER ATLANTA INC” with the Georgia State’s Corporation Division as a 501(c)(3) non-profit charity, according to the press release.

Facebook allegedly recognized the account as a valid non-profit organization and allowed supporters to make direct donations to the Facebook account. (RELATED: Eight Charged In $860,000 Minnesota Medicaid Scheme)

In May of 2019 “BLACK LIVES MATTER OF GREATER ATLANTA INC’s” tax-exempt status with the IRS was revoked. Page failed to provide the charity’s correct form to the IRS for three consecutive years. In August of 2019 the IRS dissolved “BLACK LIVES MATTER OF GREATER ATLANTA INC.”

Page failed to contact Facebook to cease exhibiting the account as a non-profit charity, according to the press release. As a result, the Facebook account continued to be exhibited as a non-profit charity with a donation portal up until September of 2020.

The FBI announced in September 2020 that Page was charged with wire fraud and money laundering misappropriating $200,000 in donations.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/03/15/tyree-conyers-page-fbi-black-lives-matter-facebook-page-money-laundering-wire-fraud/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj_i_WLgLT9AhVnkIkEHdC1AVY4FBAWegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw2ZcVhwk3ImLCIw0MMpDgI-,2021-03-15
‘Gun Control Has Been Racist’: ‘Black Guns Matter’ Activist Explains Why There’s A Surge In Firearm Sales To Black Americans,"Maj Toure, the leader of Second-Amendment advocacy group Black Guns Matter, wants to educate urban and black communities across the country about their rights as firearms owners, as this population of gun owners is rapidly growing.

In 2020, the size of these gun-owning communities surged. Black Americans had the highest increase in new gun owners of any demographic, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF). Gun ownership increased by 58.2% among black Americans — and Toure explained to the Daily Caller why he’s hoping the trend continues.

Toure said that 2020 and 2021 have been catalysts for surging gun ownership in the black community due to a variety of reasons, among them is the precariousness and insecurity the COVID-19 pandemic caused in the lives of millions of Americans.

“The reason for the surge in the black community is because the black community is seeing that you shouldn’t depend on the government,” he said.

Black Guns Matter tries to reach people in all 50 states to teach safe and legal firearms information, conflict resolution and about constitutional rights. Toure said part of his goal for Black Guns Matter was to make black Americans the largest demographic of new people purchasing firearms to counter the “racist practice of gun control.”

“In the hood we’ve known [not to trust the government.] Any ethnic group in a poor community knows that, but especially the black community. We can take it as far back as the origins of the slave patrol, or we can fast forward to the Rodney King beating,” he said.

Toure was enthusiastic about seeing not only more black people becoming gun owners, but more black women purchasing guns and learning how to use them safely. Rogers Anderson, the commander of the Black Gun Owners Association’s Oakland/Bay Area chapter, told the Guardian that 99.9% of his students are “either single Black women or Black women with children who fear for their safety”

Toure says President Joe Biden’s past actions are partially to blame for keeping some black men from purchasing firearms.

“It’s black women for one reason, because Joe Biden locked up non-violent felons, a lot of black men who now have felonies and can’t purchase firearms,” he told the Caller, referring to the 1994 “tough on crime” law Biden authored that some say contributed to mass incarceration in the 1990s and especially hurt black and brown communities, according to Vox.

Biden also spearheaded a 1984 law called the “Comprehensive Control Act” alongside Republican South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond. The law expanded federal drug trafficking penalties and civil asset forfeiture. Two years later, Biden sponsored the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which increased penalties for drug crimes and created racial disparities in incarceration by sentencing more black men, who more commonly used crack, according to Vox.

“It’s not just because only women want to be involved, but because the current administration also locked up a lot of black men since the 70s and 80s,” Toure said.

“It’s ironic because they say they want to help black and brown communities, however, you’ve used this racist concept of gun control and now we’re seeing black women being the largest purchasers of firearms because they’re not targeted in the war on drugs for nonviolent drug offenses. They’re the largest portion of [new gun buyers] and that’s a beautiful thing.” (RELATED: ‘All You Do Is Impede The Rights Of Law-Abiding Citizens’: Gov. Walker Blasts Gun Control In Exclusive Interview)

“Gun control has been racist,” he added.

In March and April, House Democrats urged Biden to take action by supporting federal gun regulations on certain types of weapons, and White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed that Biden intends to sign executive orders instituting increased gun control.

Toure said that the urgency to buy firearms is also driven by the prospect that Biden and Democrats will enact restrictions on gun purchases.

“I think black folks see the writing on the wall in that regard,” he said. “Black folks are having buyers remorse. I think a lot of people fell into this narrative of ‘oh, Donald Trump hates us, so we’re going to vote [for Biden].’”

He said that a lot of black Americans used their $1,400 stimulus checks to buy guns in March 2021, making that month a record for gun sales. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted more background checks for firearms in March than in any month in 2021, a 36% increase from February. Mass shootings in Atlanta and Boulder also happened in March, possibly playing a role in the gun sales boost.

“They’ve seen the writing on the wall for some time and the money being spent on guns is a clear indication of that,” Toure said.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/04/06/black-guns-matter-man-tourne-gun-sales-surge/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiMgLuQgLT9AhWnGFkFHZISBss4WhAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw3Gi8iMMGdgXRzUxfbGR3va,2021-04-06
Ivy League School Introduces Course That Explores Link Between Black Holes And Racism,"Cornell University offered an astronomy class that explored the “connection between the cosmos and the idea of racial blackness” through concepts like black holes, Fox News reported Wednesday.

The course titled “Black Holes: Race and the Cosmos” aims to challenge the conventional wisdom of the strictly astronomical concepts having no racial implications, according to the catalog description.

Physicists at MIT and SUNY Stony Brook recently announced findings that the total surface area of two black holes was maintained after the two entities merged. But what were the racial implications? https://t.co/DGwoT86JGg via @HMDatMI — City Journal (@CityJournal) June 26, 2021

Students taking the class offered in Spring 2021 were expected to familiarize themselves with works of theorists who “implicitly and explicitly” posit the connection between race and the subject matter of the hard science.

“Theorists use astronomy concepts like ‘black holes’ and ‘event horizons’ to interpret the history of race in creative ways, while artists and musicians conjure blackness through cosmological themes and images,” the description read.

The class fulfilled Cornell’s science distribution requirement, as it covered concepts such as the electromagnetic spectrum, according to City Journal.

Democrats ‘In Trouble’: Leo Terrell Says Black Voters In Virginia Want School Choice And Reject Critical Race Theory,"Civil rights attorney Leo Terrell said Tuesday that Republicans are “surging” in the Virginia gubernatorial race because the state’s black community embraces school choice and rejects critical race theory (CRT).

WATCH:

Former Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia and leading Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin are locked in a tight contest in the Virginia gubernatorial race that has focused on the coronavirus vaccine, the economy and education.

“The issue of critical race theory, the issue of school choice, are the heart and soul of the black community,” Terrell told “Fox & Friends” host Steve Doocy. “They want school choice, they reject critical race theory.” (RELATED: Virginia Governors Race In Dead Heat One Month Out)

Terrell said “the Democratic playbook is old, historically old, because they assume that the black voter wants government to do everything; that’s no longer the case.”

McAuliffe angered many parents when he declared in September, “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.”

McAuliffe should never have told parents to “stay out of the curriculum of their kids … Parents have a direct right to be involved in the curriculum,” Terrell continued. The Democratic Party does not want any opposition to putting “critical race theory in the curriculum,” Terrell said, despite CRT being “rejected” by Democrats, Republicans and all races.

“They don’t accept teaching their kids racism.”

Referring to a video of Vice President Kamala Harris that will be shown in black churches in Virginia, Terrell scoffed that the congregations “are going to be exposed to a political commercial by the Democratic Party because Terry McAuliffe is in trouble.”

He said the black churches “should close their doors” to the Democratic ad.

The former school teacher said it is “very insulting” for Democrats to take the black community for granted because “the only time you see Democrats in black communities is when they want the vote … You won’t see them again they don’t come into the community” until the next election comes around.

Terrell said the Democrats “are pulling out all the stops” in Virginia because if they lose “you can tell the Democratic Party that they’re going to lose the mid-terms in 2022.” (RELATED: As Virginia Governor Race Draws To A Close, McAuliffe Will Not Name One Abortion Restriction He Supports)

Denver Public Schools Claims Black Families Requested Racially Segregated ‘Playground Night’,"Denver Public Schools told the Daily Caller that black families at one of the district’s elementary schools requested that the school provide a “families of color playground night” for black families to meet other black families.

A spokesperson for Denver Public Schools said that Centennial Elementary school leaders met with “some of the Black families whose children attend” Denver Public Schools (DPS) and they requested a separate, segregated space to meet one another.

“Some of these families shared with us that, since the only time many of them see one another is at drop-off and pick-up times, we host some events where Black families can meet one another, connect with one another and share their experiences about the school with one another,” DPS Media Manager Scott Pribble told the Daily Caller.

Pribble said that the school was “honoring their request,” though the school maintains that “all families are welcome to attend all of [the school’s] events.”

The program was posted on Centennial Elementary’s welcome sign and said that the event would be held on Wednesday, Dec. 8 at 4:10 p.m., according to a picture posted by City Journal journalist Christopher Rufo.

The “families of color playground night” is not a one-time event, according to a Facebook post obtained by Rufo. The elementary school hosted the same event on Oct. 13 and Nov. 10. The Dec. 8 event was reportedly canceled due to “COVID protocols,” according to Rufo.

We support efforts like this as they provide connections, support and inspiration for families which share similar experiences and come from similar backgrounds.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2021/12/14/denver-public-schools-racially-segregated-playground-night/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi8mLeOgLT9AhVlD1kFHQsBC5A4PBAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw3lzbmTiifbAxAFtlcfJcDs,2021-12-14
Black Hawk Down Veteran Brad Thomas Reveals The Incredible Advice He Received After The Battle,"Former Army Ranger Brad Thomas received some life-changing advice after fighting in Black Hawk Down.

I sat down with the rock musician, who was also a member of Delta Force, to discuss a variety of topics and he revealed the incredible advice he received about dealing with trauma and brutal experiences after fighting in Somalia.

“I think it’s probably the most poignant thing I’ve ever heard in terms of dealing with trauma or dealing with a significant event,” Thomas told me during our exclusive interview when talking about the moment.

“He said, ‘Alright, men. You’ve lived through an event that will allow you to do the wrong thing, be an alcoholic, get DUIs, beat your wife, be a horrible person and if you do that stuff, you’re letting the bad guy win. Don’t let the bad guy win,'” Thomas explained when talking about the advice the Delta Force person gave the Rangers who fought that day.

You can watch him break down the powerful moment below.

It really doesn’t get much better than that, and I loved the fact he shared that with our audience. I couldn’t ever imagine going through a situation like Black Hawk Down. Luckily, Brad had at least one person able to share some impactful advice with him, and as he pointed out, he’s tried to live out that advice.

BLM Chapter Co-Founder Torches Democrats: They Want To Keep Black Americans ‘Handicapped And Crippled’,"The New York Black Lives Matter (BLM) chapter co-founder slammed Democrats as wanting to keep black Americans “crippled” during a Thursday interview on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.”

Hawk Newsome said Democrats want to keep black Americans dependent on welfare while discussing whether the defund the police rhetoric hurt the black community, which host Bill Hemmer suggested.

“Here’s the problem, because the cops are not the answer. Poor people commit crimes out of desperation. Address the poverty,” Newsome said. “The Republicans don’t care. But they’ll say we’ll teach you to empower yourselves. Democrats want to keep us handicapped and crippled and on welfare, right? Instead of giving us the answer to our problems. Is there a reason why high school students in the South Bronx drop out at a 60% rate? Our schools are failing. You want to end crime? Give the kids programs.”

WATCH:

FBI data shows murders among black Americans spiked in 2020 amid BLM protests and anti-police protests, according to Fox News. Black murders increased 32% in 2020 compared to the previous year, the outlet reported.

Newsome also blasted Democratic New York City Mayor Eric Adams for his inability to keep the city safe after Adams questioned the presence of BLM.

“Don’t listen to what Eric Adams says, he gives great press statements. He’s the master of the press conference,” he said. “Some kid dies, he hugs their mother. He’s holding up sneakers, he’s crying. But what we elected him for, the city of New York, was to keep the city safe. This city is a war zone and he can’t stop it.”

Newsome also alleged Adams is a “white man in blackface” and a “very conservative-minded white man at that.”

Adams recently questioned whether black lives actually mattered while speaking in an interview with Spectrum News. (RELATED: ‘We Can’t Be Hypocrites’: Mayor Eric Adams Calls Out BLM’s Silence On Rising Shootings, Deaths)

California Reparations Report Demands Tree Planting In ‘Black Neighborhoods’ For ‘Shade Equity’,"A report on alleged systemic racism released Wednesday and greenlit by Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom is calling for the planting of trees statewide “to create shade equity” and reduce “heat islands in black neighborhoods.”

The 500-page report was released after Newsom signed legislation in 2020 forming a nine-member task force to “inform Californians about slavery and explore ways the state might provide reparations.” It describes tree demolishing in black neighborhoods for highway construction and says climate change makes these areas hotter.

“Nationally, formerly redlined areas consistently show hotter temperatures than other areas,” the report states. “Therefore, climate change is certain to exacerbate existing, historically-codified disparities that track existing housing-related harms experienced by African Americans.”

The report is billed as the first of its kind by a state government to examine slavery and “the compounding harms that the United States and Californian governments have inflicted upon African Americans,” according to a press release. The California Reparations Task Force issued the document to the state’s legislature, and a final report will then be issued prior to July 2023.

“In particular, so-called ‘heat islands,’ which will worsen due to climate change, exist where built-up urban areas have few trees, vegetation or parks that serve to dissipate or reflect heat, and instead have pavement and building materials that absorb and retain it,” the report also notes.

While the report accurately notes that cities are indeed hotter due to “heat islands,” it uses this fact to claim that black people are disproportionately impacted by heat, former Republican aide Marc Morano, who runs the website Climate Depot, told The Daily Caller News Foundation.

“Adding tree cover to cities will most likely have a negligible impact on the urban heat of the cities,” said Morano. “These solutions appear to be nothing more than just ‘virtue signally’ racial grievance claims. These types of reports are generated to justify bureaucratic jobs and massive bloated budgets for ‘equity’ programs.”

Morano also said that the climate debate has “descended into cultural absurdity” and called the idea of “shade equity” the latest in a round of “racially charged climate claims and identity politics” in the left-leaning movement.

The report further claims “modern efforts to add green space” in black neighborhoods “involve racist narratives.” It argues that the city of Los Angeles intentionally limited tree growth in areas with more black people due to police officers expressing concern that trees “could serve as places to hide drugs or weapons.”

California’s reparations task force did not respond to TheDCNF’s request for comment.

Instagram Marks Post Celebrating Black People Owning Guns As ‘Sensitive Content’,"Instagram thinks a post celebrating black people owning weapons is something the public should be shielded from.

An article titled “Column: Is California ready for more Black people to legally carry guns in public?” was making the rounds, and I screenshot the headline to share on Instagram with the caption, “If you find yourself worrying about more American citizens legally carrying guns and exercising their Second Amendment rights just because they’re minorities, congrats, you’re racist.” (RELATED: David Hookstead Is The True King In The North When It Comes To College Football)

View this post on Instagram A post shared by David Hookstead (@david_hookstead)

To my great surprise, the post was first flagged as hidden and was then tagged as “sensitive content.” Yes, a post about how there’s nothing wrong with all races celebrating their God-given rights is “sensitive content” in the eyes of Instagram.

How the hell does that make sense?

Instagram is censoring my post encouraging and supporting minorities to exercise their God-given Second Amendment rights. What about this could possibly be offensive to anyone? pic.twitter.com/EWfTio32CI — David Hookstead (@dhookstead) June 27, 2022

I attempted to reach out to Instagram on the phone and that quickly turned out to be a road to nowhere. Then, I fired off a pair of emails to the company asking how the hell this could ever be viewed as sensitive content.

So far, neither email has been responded to.

I have reached out to Instagram for a comment on why the company finds black Americans owning guns to be sensitive content that should be hidden from everyone. — David Hookstead (@dhookstead) June 27, 2022

Here’s what I will say. If you find blacks, whites or any other race owning guns to be “sensitive content,” you’re a clown show and should be treated as such.

Nothing about this post is racist or sensitive. In fact, it’s going against people who want to stoke fear with the idea of more armed black Americans.

Black Republican Uses AR-15 To Confront ‘Angry Democrats In Klan Hoods’ In Campaign Ad,"A black Republican pastor running for Congress in Arizona dropped an ad Wednesday in which he uses an AR-15 to confront members of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK).

Jerone Davison is running for Arizona’s fourth congressional district. In the ad dropped on Twitter with the caption “Make Rifles Great Again,” Davison says sometimes an AR-15 is needed.

“Democrats like to say that no one needs an AR-15 for self defense. That no one could possibly need all 30 rounds. But when this rifle is the only thing standing between your family and a dozen angry Democrats in Klan hoods, you just might need that semi-automatic. And all 30 rounds.”

The video shows Davison sitting at his kitchen table drinking from an American flag mug as KKK members armed with pitchforks and other weapons surround his house. Davison then appears at the door with an AR-15 in hand as members of the KKK approach. (RELATED: Ted Cruz Says Critical Race Theory Is ‘Every Bit As Racist As The Klansmen In White Sheets’)

Davison walks out of the house, stopping the Klansmen in their tracks as they throw their hands up in surrender and flee. The end of the video shows a white hood floating in a pool of water.

Davison grew up in Mississippi and dropped out of high school, according to his campaign website.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/07/06/black-republican-jerone-davison-ar-15-democrats-klan-hoods-campaign-ad/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjRjJeRgLT9AhVKEFkFHZclAtY4ZBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw2onjSkHA8kBAOu5HSbPGfc,2022-07-06
MURDOCK: Woke LA Schools Promoting CRT Hold Back Black Kids. It Has To Stop,"Those who argue that Critical Race Theory (CRT) is a conservative hallucination need look no further than Los Angeles to see that the Right is right — yet again.

The 600,000-student Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) is using taxpayer dollars to train government teachers and staff members to instruct boys and girls that meritocracy, success, and hard work are all “white.” So, logically, if you are black, then kakistocracy (rule by the worst), failure, and sloth are just your cup of tea.

This is vile, repugnant, racist garbage. (RELATED: MANNING: The Biden Admin’s Title IX Rule Should Be Stopped Dead In Its Tracks)

Documents unearthed by Fox News Channel’s Jessica Chasmar confirm that this “implicit/unconscious bias training” is guided by University of California, Los Angeles professor Tyrone Howard. It contends that “Whiteness” “incorporates an anti-Blackness ideology which demonizes that which is furthest from White.” Also, “Individualism” “operates from a survival-of-the-fittest approach that stresses singular pursuit and accomplishment.”

When I was in the LAUSD, from kindergarten through grade 12 (1969 – 1982), it did not peddle this sludge. Instead, teachers, counselors, parents, and everyone else encouraged all kids — regardless of race — to focus, learn, strive and, thus, prepare for prosperity in this land of abundance and opportunity.

Forty years later, my old school system tells black kids that if they believe they can rise by doing their homework, studying hard and reaching for riches, then they are acting white.

America’s second largest school district has incubated the self-inflicted cancer of the “acting white” syndrome — which plagues too many black kids who value intelligence — and injected it into the curriculum.

In short: CRT holds blacks down.

This Democrat-promoted concept is beyond reprehensible. Come November, this is one more reason why Americans, starting with blacks, need to stop voting for Democrats.

These training materials urge dismantling the “myth of meritocracy” and fighting “microaggressions” — among them: “Everyone can succeed in the society if they [sic] work hard enough.”

According to these lesson plans, the microaggressors who would express such ugliness must be confronted with the question: “So you feel that everyone can succeed in the society if they work hard enough. Can you give me some examples?”

Here are 10:

Booker T. Washington: This former slave founded the Tuskegee Institute. Madam C.J. Walker: This one-time laundress earned millions via haircare products. Louis Armstrong: This prostitute’s son co-fathered jazz and scored global stardom. Ella Fitzgerald: This poor girl became the 20th Century’s finest female vocalist. Jackie Robinson: This star athlete integrated baseball and is among its greatest. Charlayne Hunter-Gault: She integrated the University of Georgia and thrived in network news. E. Stanley O’Neal: This grandson of a slave rose to CEO of Merrill Lynch. Oprah Winfrey: Actress, broadcaster and media tycoon whose net worth is $2.6 billion. Neil DeGrasse Tyson: Author, astrophysicist, director of Hayden Planetarium. Barack Obama: Law professor, legislator and former president of the United States.

Each of these individuals was born in the U.S., worked hard, and succeeded. Aside from the mixed ethnicity of some, there is nothing “white” about them. They all made it here while being looked at as black and never running from their “blackness.”

Tens of millions of other blacks have yet to achieve such fame and fortune. Regardless, they own shops, fly planes, cure patients, fix computers, construct houses, cultivate crops and otherwise flourish through talent and diligence.

Those who parrot the filthy lie that blacks cannot soar in America through industriousness because they lack “whiteness” are the most repugnant, dangerous and evil racists around.

The CRT advocates who pump this unfiltered sewage into the curriculum in Los Angeles and beyond deserve to be utterly disempowered. Let’s hope the voters do this in November.

‘President Biden Love Locking Black People Up’: Charlamagne Tha God Rips Biden For Allegedly Targeting Black People,"Host of “The Breakfast Club” Charlamagne tha God ripped President Joe Biden on Monday for allegedly targeting black Americans as the administration cracks down on fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans.

Biden signed two bills Friday giving the Department of Justice (DOJ) more leeway to investigate and prosecute fraud over PPP loans, which gave money to small businesses for payroll and business expenses during the pandemic.

The Small Business Administration’s Office of Inspector General said in 2021 that more than 70,000 PPP loans totaling over $4.6 billion were potentially fraudulent, according to NY1.

Charlamagne said the loans and crackdown hurt black Americans.

“There is not one single solitary human I know with good sense who participated in PPP fraud. Why? Because we all knew it was too good to be true,” Charlamagne said, playing a clip of Biden announcing that the DOJ would punish misuse of federal funds.

“Y’all know, President Biden love locking black people up, and y’all just helped them,” Charlamagne said.

“See, I’m not wishing jail on nobody. I just understand that there’s consequences to all our actions. And for some reason in this era, people have forgotten that. All right, folks wanna do whatever it is they want to do, and then get mad when they don’t get away with it.”

“What made y’all think y’all could get away with this fraudulent PPP loan scam in the first place? Some of y’all never owned a business, never ran a business, nothing, but all of a sudden you creating these fake LLCs lying about the number of employees you have, about the profits you made. We told y’all this was going to lead to you going to PPP prison. And you did it anyway,” he continued. “I feel sorry for all the small businesses, all the small black businesses who couldn’t get any PPP money who wanted the relief, who needed the relief and for whatever reason, couldn’t get it.”

Charlamagne then said the program was “clearly a trap” for black and brown people. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: House Republicans Call On Congress To Rescind PPP Loans To Planned Parenthood)

“They killed two birds with one stone. In this case, they killed two n****s with one loan. Okay? Because if you a small black and brown business that couldn’t get a PPP loan, you probably ended up ultimately losing your business. So they killed black and brown businesses. And if you are a black or brown person who got a fake LLC, now you going to prison.”

“It was clearly a trap.”

Charlamagne then clarified that those who misused the loans deserve punishment.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/08/08/president-biden-prison-black-people-charlamagne-tha-god-ppp-loans-fraud/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjumuONgLT9AhWCLFkFHTJzDPA4MhAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw3HJAQq01YhxEANSzfPrMBv,2022-08-08

Biden Admin Investigates University Of Utah Doctoral Program That’s Just For Black Students,"The Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights (OCR) plans to investigate the University of Utah for a doctoral program available only to black students, according to an OCR letter.

University of Michigan-Flint professor Mark Perry filed a complaint against the University of Utah regarding its African American Doctoral Scholars Initiative alleging the program, which only allows black students, violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national orientation, according to the July 26 OCR letter. The OCR confirmed they will investigate the university in a letter to Perry. (RELATED: ‘Hostile Environment of Anti-Semitism’: Biden Admin To Investigate Major University)

“The African American Doctoral Scholars Initiative creates a multidisciplinary, critical mass of African American scholars dedicated to the eradication of institutional and systemic racism and oppression by addressing the inequities endured by African American people,” the program description states. “We create thought leaders who tackle substantive issues central to Black life, history, and culture.”

The initiative is designed for “African American doctoral students” to create graduates who will “implement programs and policies that positively impact Black people in the United States,” the program website states. Scholarships are granted to the students in the program who “demonstrate a commitment to understanding Black life, history and culture in the United States.”

Nearly 65% of students at the University of Utah are white and less than 1% are black, according to Data USA. About 90% of Utah residents are white and less than 2% are black, the U.S. Census Bureau reported.

“There is widespread and systemic sexism and racism at US colleges and universities, and thousands of cases of illegal sex-based and race-based discrimination,” Perry told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Since 2019, I have filed nearly 600 federal civil rights complaints with the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights for more than 1,500 individual violations of Title IX (sex-based discrimination) and Title VI (race-based discrimination). Based on those complaints, the Office for Civil Rights has opened 265 federal civil rights investigations so far, and those investigations have resulted in 178 resolutions, mostly in my favor.”

The staff of the program are all black, Perry noted in his complaint. The “Black-only” program, he said, has just “Black faculty mentors” and directors.

The University of Utah and the OCR did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Al Sharpton Says Democrats Aren’t In Touch With Black And Latino Voters,"MSNBC’s Al Sharpton said Monday that Democrats are out of touch with voters and are “in the game” only because of Former President Donald Trump’s presence in the political sphere.

“Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough said Democrats are having a hard time keeping their base satisfied.

“The question is are Democrats doing what it takes to keep those who have loyally voted Republican, are Democratic voting Democratic because right now, you have people of color breaking away from the Democratic Party and you have white college-educated suburban voters breaking away from Republicans, so it’s creating a real flux.” Scarborough said.

“The Democratic Party and President Biden does have some things they could be using that they’ve done that has benefited clearly Black and Latinos, but it’s not connecting. So you’re seeing this as the polls indicate, Latinos and Black men go the other way because they’re not getting their message to the ground in the way they should.” (RELATED: Biden Approval Rating Sinks Below 40%, Signaling Potential Reversal Of A Political ‘Comeback’: POLL)

Sharpton then said the only thing Democrats have to run on in the weeks leading up the midterms is “the Supreme Court decision on women’s right to choose and the fact that Donald Trump won’t leave the stage.”

“Those are the only things that’s really helping the Democrats stay in the game,” he said. “They must connect the message to those that would be energized. At this point, that has not happened.”

Despite hopes that abortion will be a major factor in voter turnout, likely voters in 11 battleground states are most concerned about inflation and the economy. They trust Republicans to handle the issue better, per a poll conducted by WPA Intelligence on behalf of the Club for Growth.

The poll also found just 11% of voters are most concerned with abortion and reproductive rights.

Ron Johnson Dem Opponent Mandela Barnes Compared Black Conservatives To Slaves,"Republican Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson’s Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, once compared black conservatives to slaves and refused to accept that a black sheriff shares the same race as him, past tweets reviewed by the Daily Caller show.

In a 2017 tweet, Barnes compared the black American musician Tina Campbell to a slave after she announced her support for former President Donald Trump. Barnes quote-tweeted an article headlined “Tina Campbell of Mary Mary supports Trump due to his Christian beliefs” to which he added the comment, “Guess the shackles are still on her feet after all.”

Guess the shackles are still on her feet after all. https://t.co/6Tr0HIuz8G — Mandela Barnes (@TheOtherMandela) October 3, 2017

In 2016, Barnes shared an article from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in which he criticized David Clarke, a conservative black Democrat who served as sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, from 2002-2017. Barnes tweeted out screenshots of the article with the caption “Receipts!”

The article Barnes shared was titled “Lawmaker on Sheriff David Clarke: ‘I don’t even accept him as black.'” The piece featured a quote from Barnes, who was a state representative at the time, saying that Milwaukee Count had “one black countywide elected official … and I don’t even accept him as black.”

The Daily Caller spoke to Wisconsin state Sen. Julian Bradley, the first black Republican to serve in the state Senate, about the two tweets, which Bradley called “disgusting.”

“They’re just — they’re disgusting. It’s something that black conservatives, we experience this regularly, and it’s troubling in Wisconsin, especially because you think about why the Republican Party was started and where. It was started right here in Wisconsin. It was founded for the purpose of abolishing slavery. It was founded for the purpose of remembering all men are created equally. Black men, white men, everybody. All people are equal and should be treated equal and seen and viewed as equal in the law,” Bradley told the Caller.

“Here is a black legislator who somehow thinks he has the right to strip black conservatives of their race. And that’s — it’s disgusting. It’s — it’s absolutely disgusting,” Bradley continued.

Barnes has continued to face criticism for his past social media activity after the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel dug up controversial tweets Barnes posted over the past decade. In one tweet, Barnes called Trump a ‘Russian spy,’ while in another, he wrote that he does not believe George Washington was a top president. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Sen. Ron Johnson To Release Ad Series Slamming ‘Extreme’ Dem Opponent Mandela Barnes)

“As someone who wants to be the next U.S. Senator, Mandela Barnes’ comments prove he is unfit to represent the people of Wisconsin. He seeks to further divide our nation with his polarizing rhetoric while continuing to push dangerous policies that would make Wisconsin less prosperous, less safe and less free,” Mike Marinella, the press secretary for Johnson’s campaign, told the Caller.

EXCLUSIVE: Congressional Black Caucus Backs White Democrat Over Black Republican,"The Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) is throwing their support behind a white Democrat, despite the fact that he is being challenged by a black Republican, the Daily Caller has learned.

Jennifer-Ruth Green, a black Republican, is challenging Frank Mrvan, a white Democrat, in Indiana’s First Congressional District. The race is considered a “toss-up” by nonpartisan election analysts. According to recent campaign finance filings reviewed by the Caller, the Congressional Black Caucus on Sept. 28 donated $5,000 to Mrvan, despite the fact that he is white and Green is black.

Green outraised Mrvan in Q3. She raised around $1.4 million, while he raised less than $940,000.

In 2021, the Congressional Black Caucus allegedly blocked black Republican Florida Rep. Byron Donalds from joining the group.

At the time, Donalds’ spokesman Harrison Fields said, “The sad reality is although the Congressman and those in the CBC share the same race, the (R) behind his name disqualifies him from membership today.”

The Daily Caller contacted the Congressional Black Caucus about their support for Mrvan to which they released the following statement: “The Congressional Black Caucus PAC is committed to electing African-Americans and African-American allies to Congress who will fight for our values. Congressman Mrvan understands the importance of a woman’s right to choose and protecting access to healthcare for all people. One of his first votes in Congress was for the American Rescue Plan which helped end this pandemic, put workers back on the job, and shored up the kinds of small businesses that are the backbone of Black community. We support him because we know he will continue to fight against racial and economic injustice and ensure Northwest Indiana is able to continue to grow and thrive.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/10/19/congressional-black-caucus-backs-white-democrat-black-republican-jennifer-ruth-green-frank-mrvan-indiana/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj_i_WLgLT9AhVnkIkEHdC1AVY4FBAWegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw0irG_dO-j_BIANgWAZBGjT,2022-10-19
"California Could Give Over $200,000 In Reparations To Each Black Resident","Black residents of California could receive $223,200 each in reparations payments, according to an estimate by the state’s reparations task force reported by The New York Times.

The nine-member task force, authorized by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, recommended $569 billion total in reparations for black residents due to the effects of housing discrimination, though the number could increase before the final recommendations are due June 2023, according to the NYT. Currently, 6.5% of California’s population, or 2.5 million people, identify as black or African-American. (RELATED: California Projected To Have Massive Budget Shortfall As Businesses Flee The State)

“We are looking at reparations on a scale that is the largest since Reconstruction,” said Jovan Scott Lewis, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and member of the task force said, according to the NYT. “That is why we must put forward a robust plan, with plenty of options.” To be eligible for the reparations, one must be a descendant of enslaved African Americans or of a “free black person living in the United States prior to the end of the 19th century,” according to the NYT. The main areas identified by the task force for reparations were housing discrimination, mass incarceration, unjust property seizures, devaluation of Black businesses and health care, yet the estimated $569 billion, or $223,200 per person, only addresses housing discrimination between 1933 to 1977.

In September, Newsom vetoed a bill by the task force that requested the recommendations not be due until 2024.

Here we go! So you know! @ASM_Irwin voted for Reparations too! Election is over! Now their true colors show once again! California will continue to see an exodus!! https://t.co/DFaUOYS0ZI — Lori Mills for CA Assembly 42 (@LoriMills4CA42) December 2, 2022

In March, the task force released a 500-word report outlining why the descendants of slaves should receive recommendations, and the task force is scheduled to meet again in mid-December. The California legislature will approve or deny the recommendations while also deciding how black residents will be repaid, according to the NYT.

Many of the task force members recommend tuition and housing grants, but others are requesting direct cash payments.

California’s budget is predicted to operate in a $25 billion deficit after an expected tax revenue drop of $41 billion in fiscal year 2021-2022 through fiscal year 2023-2024.

Newsom’s office did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

“This is my human right,” he says. “If anybody wants to come chase me down about that, let’s go to court.” He encourages others to arm themselves, especially people who live in high crime neighborhoods.

I point out that means he wants more guns in places where there are already more shootings. That’s the point, says Toure. “The only thing that’s going to stop evil are good, solid people strong enough to stop them.”

He sells a T-shirt with the slogan “make criminals afraid again” printed on the front.

“Criminals should be deathly afraid,” says Toure. “If you’re robbing people and carjacking, I want you to know that we’re gonna arm our community to deal with you very, very properly.”

More guns in the hands of citizens, he says, deters criminals.

There is evidence for that. Economist John Lott, author of “More Guns, Less Crime,” points out that crime usually drops in states that approve concealed carry laws. The explanation is that criminals in those states fear that their victims could be armed.

I push back at Toure, pointing out that more guns also may lead to more accidental shootings.

“That’s under the assumption that those gun owners aren’t getting training,” replies Toure. Training is what Toure does. In 2016, he held his first Black Guns Matter event.

He expected 30 people, but 300 showed up. “It was beautiful,” he says.

His group now teaches classes all around America.

“We’re teaching absolute beginners that want to know how to be safe and responsible firearms owners.” If you are threatened, he says, you need a gun and need to know how to use it.

In my video, he tells his students, “No one’s coming to save me! I have to save and protect myself and my family.”

Last year, about 90% of gun stores reported an increase in sales to black people.

“I made it so,” says Toure. “Gun control is racist.” Gun control was “started to literally stop black people from having the means to defend themselves.”

That is true. Before the Civil War, Tennessee changed its constitution to say that only “free white men” have a right to bear arms. Virginia banned blacks from carrying “any firelock of any kind.”

Later, when some local governments wouldn’t protect blacks from racist whites, blacks often took up arms to protect themselves. Where blacks had access to firearms, there were fewer lynchings.

Toure says gun control is still racist.

“Who’s arrested more for firearms possession? … black and brown folks. The narrative that anyone with a firearm is a bad guy is a pervasive theme, especially if you are in an urban environment and if you happen to be black.”

In his gun classes, Toure tells his students, “Follow the rules, and communicate with law enforcement.” black people must be extra clear that they have a gun to defend themselves.

It’s a double standard, he complains. “White folks don’t gotta articulate their position the same way.”

Next, Toure plans to expand his classes to teach conflict resolution, and to teach as many people as he can about armed self-defense.

“All the facts and data are in favor of respect for the Second Amendment,” he says, “especially in the black community.”

Meet The Celebrity-Endorsed Extremist Movement Expert Calls The ‘Greatest Threat To Black Americans’ Today,"Black Hebrew Israelite (BHI) ideology is growing in America according to several experts that spoke with the Daily Caller News Foundation, one going so far as to call it the “greatest threat to black Americans.”

A 2019 poll sponsored by the Philos Project entitled “African American Attitudes Toward Israel” surveyed over 1,000 African American participants. Several of the questions specifically pertained to BHI ideology. Males were twice as likely to pick the response stating “I agree with most of the core ideas taught by Black Hebrew Israelites” than females.

The DCNF spoke with Bishop Nathanyel, the head of the IUC church with locations in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Nathaniel stated that the term ‘Black Hebrew Israelites’ was a false moniker made up by the media.

Black Hebrew Israelite (BHI) ideology is growing in America, experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation, as high-profile individuals echo its claims and antisemitism becomes more visible.

Celebrities such as Kanye West and Kyrie Irving have brought increased media attention to antisemitism, the BHI movement and its beliefs in recent months. One expert told DCNF that the BHI ideology is the “greatest threat to black Americans” today.

BHI ideology is a form of replacement theory regarding Jewish heritage and ethnicity, according to experts, which claims that the Bible states that the real Jews are black, and cannot be white. Both the chairman of the Louis D. Brandeis Center, Kenneth Marcus, and Israel 365 founder Rabbi Tuly Weisz told the DCNF that this “replacement theory” has become very prominent among members of BHI.

“So right now, there’s a lot of discussion in left-wing media of replacement theory. The notion there is that Jews are replacing whites,” Marcus explained. “The Black Hebrew movement also has this notion that Jews are not the Jews, but rather it’s the black Hebrews, who have replaced that. So there are various movements that have taken this notion that Jews have been replaced.”

“Unfortunately now some of the extremists in the Black Hebrew Israelite community are … manipulating the black community … to replace the Jewish people. And that’s really dangerous and that’s really offensive to Jews,” Weisz noted. (RELATED: REPORT: Nike Cuts Ties With Kyrie Irving)

Bishop Glenn Plummer of the Church of God in Christ in Israel, the largest black church in the world, confirmed that membership with the ideology of the Black Hebrew Israelites is growing, describing it as a philosophical movement. Plummer called BHI the “greatest threat to black Americans” today and warned that the “black church leadership” is not taking the movement as seriously as they should be.

“Now, in the United States, the so-called Black Hebrews Israelite movement, and I will refer to it as a movement, is a headless, leaderless movement,” Plummer explained. “So you can’t point to one leader there or one organization there. It’s a philosophy and it’s splintered into all these little groups and all this, but it is growing.”

The BHI movement began in America in the 1960s. Churches in Chicago were divided by incoming BHI ideology and eventually split leading to the birth of a “cult,” according to Plummer.

“The Black Hebrew Israelite movement is not a new movement. It’s not new in the context of a few years. It’s been around for a number of decades,” Plummer stated.

A 2019 poll sponsored by the Philos Project entitled “African American Attitudes Toward Israel” surveyed over 1,000 African American participants. Several of the questions specifically pertained to BHI ideology.

When respondents were asked whether they were familiar with BHI teachings, 23% indicated that they considered themselves a “Black Hebrew Israelite” or “agreed with most of the core ideas taught by Black Hebrew Israelites.” According to Luke Moon, Deputy Director of the Philos Project, this number represented a concerning increase from past numbers.

Irving, a basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets, was suspended on Nov. 3 after posting a link to the antisemitic film “Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America.” Irving later apologized and condemned antisemitism, but he has not been the only one to push this antisemitic rhetoric.

West has made the rounds pushing anti-Jewish sentiment on multiple occasions. On Tim Pool’s podcast “Timcast IRL,” the rapper defended Irving and talked about the importance of “bloodlines.”

“I’ve been labeled antisemite, right? So there’s different beliefs about our bloodlines, you know, like the documentary that Kyrie posted and in general, America has been left ignorant and history has been changed,” West said. “So when we start questioning things that question the indoctrination, then you immediately get, you know, demonized, demonetized, and what’s so beautiful about this time is everyone got to see what’s really been happening.”

On Sunday, Nov. 22, a group of protesters from the church Israel United in Christ (IUC), showed up outside the Barclays Center where the Nets were playing. The group, dressed in matching purple hoodies with gold fringe sewn on the hems, chanted, “We’ve got some good news, we are the Jews,” according to the New York Post.

The DCNF spoke with Bishop Nathanyel, the head of the IUC church with locations in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Nathaniel said the term “Black Hebrew Israelites” is a false moniker made up by the media.

“No Israelite organization calls themselves Black Hebrew Israelites,” he said. “The media has concocted that [for those] opposed to the Jewish people who colonized the land in 1948.”

In regards to Irving, Nathaniel told the DCNF that the church was not protesting the suspension but rather Irving’s “right to examine his race,” and echoed a common BHI belief that white Jews must prove their origin.

“But they must prove according to the Torah, according to the Tanakh, that they are the people of the book. We can prove it,” he said. “And many of them fear sitting down with us not because of violence, because they know we are not violent but because we can prove that we’re the Israelites, according to Deuteronomy 28:15-68, 1 Kings 8:46-52, [and] Luke 21:24.”

Most vulnerable to these kinds of beliefs, according to Plummer, are young men due to their need for discipline. Plummer also said this lacking aspect in their lives leads young black men to search for purpose, leaving BHI to willingly supply it.

“That’s why the armies of the world go towards young men. Because men require discipline,” he noted. (RELATED: Kanye West Allegedly Owes California $600,000 In Taxes For Yeezy Clothing Company)

The Philos Project poll found that 31% of African American males report seeing more antisemitism from other blacks than in the past, compared to 25% of female respondents. Males were twice as likely to express agreement with the “core ideas” of the Black Hebrew Israelites than females, the poll found.

Marcus also pointed to the growing extremism in America, noting that young people are especially vulnerable, and said black America is no exception.

“Most African Americans are not sympathetic to this sort of extremism,” he stated. “[W]e do see, especially in certain groups like college students, a greater likelihood to adopt radical views and it can include black supremacy just as it can include anti-Zionism.”

Weisz told DCNF that the solution to this growing problem is to prevent ignorance. “The more that the African Americans know their history and Jewish history, the more they will be protected.”

The church is the answer for Plummer, stating that BHI ideology is the “self-proclaimed” enemy.

“[Black Hebrew Israelites] are enemies, self-proclaimed enemies of the black church,” Plummer said. “[T]he church is the one that will talk them out of that and the church is the one that preaches the Bible. And the church is one that talks about truth, and morality and character and what’s right and what’s wrong.”

Irving and the Nets did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment. West could not be reached for comment.

Dwayne Johnson Updates Fans On The Fate Of ‘Black Adam’,"Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson tweeted a critical update to fans, letting them know that Black Adam will not be part of the new DC multiverse in the immediate future.

Johnson released a lengthy statement addressing James Gunn’s decision to put Black Adam on ice. “My Passionate friends, I wanted to give you a long-awaited Black Adam update regarding the character’s future in the new DC Universe,” Johnson said. “James Gunn and I connected, and Black Adam will not be in their first chapter of storytelling. However, DC and Seven Bucks have agreed to continue exploring the most valuable ways Black Adam can be utilized in future DC multiverse chapters,” he said.

Johnson did not attack Gunn and spoke respectfully about the update.

“James and I have known each other for years and have always rooted for each other to succeed. It’s no different now, and I will always root for DC (and Marvel) to win and WIN BIG,” Johnson said.

He also let some emotion seep into his note.

“You guys know me, and I have very thick skin – and you can always count on me to be direct with my words. These decisions made by James and DC Leadership represent their vision of DCU through their creative lens,” he said. (RELATED: James Cameron Suggests Matt Damon May Appear In Future ‘Avatar’ Project)

Johnson then reminisced about the good times, and spoke directly to his adoring fans.

“After 15 years of relentless hard work to finally make Black Adam, I’m very proud of the film we delivered for fans worldwide. I will always look back on the fan reaction to Black Adam with tremendous gratitude, humility, and love. We did great,” Johnson said.

The superstar actor thanked those who supported him in the Black Adam role and beyond, using the opportunity to sprinkle in some humor and self-promotion for his alcohol brand.

“To my very passionate and vocal Black Adam/Super Hero genre fans – I love you, THANK YOU, and I will ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOU and do my best to deliver and entertain you. What a helluva month – now we all need some Teremana!” Johnson said.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2022/12/21/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-james-gunn-dc-multiverse-black-adam/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj_i_WLgLT9AhVnkIkEHdC1AVY4FBAWegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw0I_zrfUgRP0132pFN-X0dp,2022-12-21
Black Gun Owners Slam New Jersey’s Concealed Carry Law,"Black gun owners in New Jersey have pushed back against a recent concealed carry law, with one firearms instructor saying the law, like many other gun laws, targets and criminalizes minority communities, according to PBS affiliate WHYY.

The instructor, Douglas Worthen, argued that the recent legislation, which heightens requirements for gun ownership, will block black residents from defending themselves, while one of the law’s changes, an increase in fees, will further deter marginalized community members from seeking a permit, according to WHYY. The bill would require gun owners who seek a concealed carry permit to purchase liability insurance and take training courses, while also increasing permit fees and restricting guns in “sensitive places” like schools, public parks, courthouses and bars, according to the legislation.

Worthen believes the “sensitive places” restriction will block people from defending themselves outside of their homes, according to WHYY. “Black ancestors … at one point couldn’t even possess any firearms at all. The infringement on people of color in this country has been around for a very, very long time. It still exists present-day, but just has a different form.” (RELATED: ‘Profoundly Discriminatory’: LGBTQ Oregonians Fear New Gun Law Could Leave Them Vulnerable)

The New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center reported in 2022 that black and Hispanic gun owners are more likely to carry a gun outside of their home, and the new law will not only limit that ability, but also increase the cost, according to WHYY. “When [people] see these fees, they get discouraged and are like ‘you know what, I’m not paying that,’” Worthen said.

#BREAKING Speaking on @News12NJ‘s “Ask Governor Murphy” program, New Jersey @GovMurphy says he will sign the state’s new concealed carry restriction law into law Thursday morning during an event in Union County. – @ActualAlexZ — Shlomo Schorr (@OneJerseySchorr) December 21, 2022

Gun purchases by black Americans have jumped over the last two years, according to a survey by the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Leon Grauer, a Newark-based licensed attorney and organizer of the New Jersey Black Gun Owners Association, believes the increase is purchases is a response to the murder of George Floyd and a an understanding that there is a need to fend off crime in underserved neighborhoods, according to WHYY.

“A lot of people within the Black community perceive incidents, such as the killing of George Floyd, and other incidents highlighting their need for personal protection,” Grauer said. “Also, in cities that have high crime rates, particularly high violent crime rates, just as in the white community people feel empowered to defend themselves, many people in the Black community feel empowered to have a firearm to defend themselves.”

Grauer asserted that there are many gun owners in his community who value safety and regulations, further saying that the belief that those who come from marginalized communities are against guns is a misconception, according to WHYY.

“Historically, ever since slavery, firearms have been a means of self-defense and self-preservation for Black people in America. There is a perception that perhaps during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and ‘60s, Black people in America, en masse, put down their guns and live by a non-violent strategy, but it’s far from the truth,” Grauer said.

The state Senate voted along party lines, 21-16, to approve the legislation, which received the minimum number of votes required to clear the house. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy intends to “swiftly” sign the bill into law.

Murphy did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

MSNBC Guest Claims White Voters Accept ‘Inconveniences’ To Suppress Black Voters,"A MSNBC contributor claimed Monday that white voters accept “inconveniences” from voter ID laws in order to suppress black turnout in elections.

“I don’t think you can take partisanship out of it, because really the partisanship is just a proxy for racism,” Jason Johnson told “Deadline: White House” host Nicolle Wallace. “I mean, let’s be clear. When you have voter suppression laws in a place like Ohio, you have and we’ve seen this sociologically, that there’s a certain segment of white people in America who would rather have their own lives inconvenienced than run the risk of black people being on an equal plane.” (RELATED: Raphael Warnock Insists ‘Voter Suppression’ Is Still Going On Despite Record Turnout — And His Own Victory)

WATCH:

“The intention is to keep black people from voting, but it inconveniences everybody,” Johnson added. “I am very sure that somebody living in Lorraine, Ohio, doesn’t like the fact that their ID cards and things don’t work the way they used to as well.”

Early voting turnout in Georgia in the first general election after the state passed new election laws was “blowing the doors off expectations,” MSNBC reported in November, when Republicans underperformed expectations of a nation-wide “red wave.”

President Joe Biden called Georgia’s law “Jim Crow in the 21st Century” when Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia signed the voting law in March 2021, but Georgia reported record turnout for the 2022 primary election.

“The way you solve this problem is that the party leadership, now, whether that’s Joe Biden or formerly Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer, any of these people, they have to start saying this is not an issue of compromise,” Johnson said. “The rhetoric has to start there. It has to say voting rights is fundamental. This is not something we can negotiate.”

Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York claimed the law was an “existential threat to democracy.”

Despite the new election integrity law in Georgia, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock defeated Republican nominee Herschel Walker in a Dec. 6 runoff election.

DeSantis Defends Nixing AP Black History Course,"Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday defended his decision to block an Advanced Placement (AP) course centered around black history and activism following criticism from the White House.

“The issue is, we have guidelines and standards in Florida. We want education, not indoctrination,” DeSantis said, according to a video from a press conference. He also noted that the state already requires a non-AP course on black history.

DeSantis blasted the AP curriculum over its inclusion of black queer studies. “Who would say that an important part of black history is queer theory? That is somebody pushing an agenda on our kids … When you try to use black history to shoehorn in queer theory, you are clearly trying to use that for political purposes,” he stated in the video.

Queer theory … that’s the wrong side of the line for Florida standards.” pic.twitter.com/HzKnWsyUb3 — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) January 23, 2023

The Florida Department of Education rejected the AP course on Jan. 12. “The course is a vehicle for a political agenda and leaves large, ambiguous gaps that can be filled with additional ideological material, which we will not allow,” DeSantis’ press secretary Bryan Griffin told the Daily Caller News Foundation at the time.

The governor signed legislation in April banning schools from teaching that “a person, by virtue of his or her race, color, national origin, or sex is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously.”

White House Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre denounced Florida’s decision, arguing that “they didn’t block AP European History, they didn’t block music history, they didn’t block art history, but the state chooses to block a course that is meant for high achieving high school students to learn about their history of arts and culture, and it is incomprehensible.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/23/desantis-rejects-black-history-course-ap-indoctrination/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi126SLgLT9AhW9D1kFHV5-DAA4ChAWegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw0EbSMeeRLOue9t8DxxQQtG,2023-01-23
Stacey Abrams Silent About New Poll Showing 0% Of Black Georgians Had Trouble Voting,"During the 2022 midterm elections, Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams criticized Georgia’s updated voting laws believing they were a form of voter suppression; however, a recent University of Georgia School of Public and International Affairs post-election poll shows that 0% of black Georgians had trouble voting.

Of black Georgia residents who participated in the post-election poll, 0% had a “poor” experience and 94.3% were either “very confident” or “somewhat confident” their vote counted as intended, according to the poll.

“Yet again, the myth of voter suppression in Georgia fails to be supported by a shred of evidence,” Republican Georgia Gov. Brain Kemp said in a release about the poll. “Democrats have juiced this lie for every cent it was worth, disparaging our state and undermining faith in our elections.”

Stacey Abrams, who criticized Georgia’s updated election law and claimed “voter suppression” occurred during the 2022 midterm elections, has stayed silent after a recent poll showed 0% of black Georgians had trouble voting.

Of black Georgia residents who participated in the post-election poll, 0% had a “poor” experience and 94.3% were either “very confident” or “somewhat confident” their vote counted as intended, according to the University of Georgia School of Public and International Affairs post-election poll. In March 2021, Georgia passed the Election Integrity Act, which required voters to have an ID to receive an absentee ballot and placed a restriction on where ballot boxes were placed, leading President Joe Biden to call the new law “Jim Crow in the 21st Century.” (RELATED: Stacey Abrams Uses Concession Speech To Compare Her Loss To The Religious Persecution Of Saint Paul)

The law worked to curb alleged voter fraud and expanded in-person early voting in most counties, while also extended voting periods to weekends and expanded the hours polls are open.

Abrams did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s requests for comment about the University of Georgia poll.

After the law passed in March, Abrams criticized the law, which was implemented by Kemp, and continued to criticize the law during the midterms. Leading up to the election, Georgia voters broke the state early voting record, with 2,288,889 ballots cast, according to the Georgia secretary of State office.

“It does not mean voter suppression doesn’t exist,” Abrams said in October during a campaign rally. “But we’re stronger, better, and faster than it.” Abrams first accused Georgia of participating in voter suppression after Kemp defeated her for the first time during the 2018 gubernatorial election.

In November, Kemp defeated Abrams a second time 53.4% to 45.9%, receiving 2,110,328 votes, according to Politico. Kemp received 298,857 more votes than Abrams.

The post-election poll, conducted with 1,253 respondents from Nov. 13 to Dec. 6, has a margin of error of 2.8%.

The poll further showed that 79.7% of black respondents were either confident or somewhat confident that votes across all of Georgia were properly counted, while 89.6% gave election officials either a good or excellent rating for their work during the election, according to the poll.

Furthermore, 99.4% of black Georgians felt safe while voting, 99.5% said that they did not have a self-reported problem while voting and 84.1% said it was easy to cast a ballot, according to the poll.

“Yet again, the myth of voter suppression in Georgia fails to be supported by a shred of evidence,” Republican Georgia Gov. Brain Kemp said in a release about the poll. “Democrats have juiced this lie for every cent it was worth, disparaging our state and undermining faith in our elections. But the facts are clear: Georgia’s Election Integrity Act made it easy to vote and hard to cheat. It is past time for President Biden and his allies to apologize to the people of Georgia and request the Department of Justice withdraw their ridiculous lawsuit against the state.”

Leading up to the 2022 midterm election, other politicians criticized Kemp’s election laws with Democratic Georgia state Rep. Park Cannon speaking at the Atlanta screening of “Vigilante: Georgia’s Vote Suppression Hitman.” The movie, presented by the Palast Investigative Fund, claims to “bust the most brazen, racist attack on voting rights yet,” and discusses Kemp and “voter suppression” in Georgia.

“Kemp has kept his history of privilege and political fixes well hidden — including the long history of exploitation by his family aimed at both enchained Blacks and politically helpless poor whites,” according to Greg Palast’s website.

The movie screening in Atlanta featured Cannon, the Black Voters Matter Fund, Georgia Coalition For The People’s Agenda, NAACP and New Georgia Coalition.

Cannon, Palast, the Black Voters Matter Fund, Georgia Coalition For The People’s Agenda, NAACP and New Georgia Coalition did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Black Truck Driver Shown Pleading With Memphis Protesters To Clear The Streets,"A black truck driver is shown pleading with a group of demonstrators in a video taken by a Daily Caller field reporter Friday.

Police departments in major cities braced themselves for massive demonstrations across the country following the release of police body cam footage of the alleged beating of Tyre Nichols, in Memphis, Tennessee. Five police officers have been fired and charged with second-degree murder after they pulled Nichols over during a traffic stop and a “confrontation occurred” which reportedly sent Nichols to the hospital in critical condition. Nichols died three days later. (RELATED: ‘I Feel Sorry For Them’: Tyre Nichols’ Mother Gives Gut-Wrenching Interview On CNN)

“I understand that, and I feel everything. But look, man, holding up traffic don’t do nothing,” the driver said in the video, taken by Daily Caller reporter Jorge Ventura.

Five officers, Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills Jr and Justin Smith, were charged and booked in the Shelby County jail for their role in Nichols’ death. They were charged with aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression.

“The news today from Memphis officials that these five officers are being held criminally accountable for their deadly and brutal actions gives us hope as we continue to push for justice for Tyre,” the Nichols’ family’s lawyers said.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/28/black-truck-driver-shown-pleading-with-memphis-protesters-to-clear-the-streets/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi8mLeOgLT9AhVlD1kFHQsBC5A4PBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw3vFTPTalAx34ZRCVOB1kY1,2023-01-28
"Massive Demonstrations Break Out After Police Allegedly Beat, Kill Black Man In Memphis","Demonstrations are breaking out in Memphis, Tennessee after police in the city beat a black man so badly he died three days later.

Demonstrations began Friday night as Memphis police released bodycam footage of Tyre Nichols’s interaction with five police black officers, all of whom have been arrested and charged. Two additional Shelby County deputies are under investigation following the release of the footage.

The officers pulled Nichols over during a traffic stop in early January after which a “confrontation occurred.” Video footage appears to show the officers beating Nichols, injuries which reportedly sent the 29-year-old to the hospital in critical condition. Nichols died three days later.

Protesters have shut down the Memphis-Arkansas Bridge, chanting “no justice, no peace,” causing hundreds of cars to stand still for hours at a time. Some stuck in traffic are concerned that the demonstrations will cause injury or death, although they say they support the aim of the protesters.

“I got two babies in the car…I mean no harm…but this right here, come on,” two women said in a video circulating on social media.

Another trucker pled with demonstrators to clear the highway saying, “look, man, holding up traffic don’t do nothing.”

The demonstrators began marching towards the upcoming traffic as the bodycam footage of Nichols’ interaction with police was released, chanting, “Fuck around and find out.”

Tyre Nichols’s mother, RowVaughn Wells, has called on protesters to remain peaceful following the release of the footage.

“But I want each and every one of you to protest in peace. I don’t want us burning up our cities, tearing up the streets because that’s not what my son stood for,” she said. “And if you guys are here for me and Tyre, you will protest peacefully.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/28/riots-police-tyre-nichols-beat-kill-black-tennessee-memphis/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjumuONgLT9AhWCLFkFHTJzDPA4MhAWegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw0VFbUWzvAfYA7t6U6xoLba,2023-01-28
MSNBC Columnist Says Black Men Live In ‘Combat Zones’ Because Of Police. Congressman Pushes Back,"MSNBC’s Mike Barnicle said Tuesday on “Morning Joe” that black men live in “combat zones” because they no longer respect police, prompting Republican New York Rep and former NYPD Detective Anthony D’Esposito to push back.

The panel were talking about the death of Tyre Nichols, who was savagely beaten by police Jan. 7 and later succumbed to his injuries, when Barnicle said black men in America are living in “combat zones.”

“So, Congressman, I don’t think you’ll get any argument here that the job of being a police officer in specific districts, specific cities, has never been tougher,” Barnicle said. “But at the the end of all that, we do live in a nation where there is a lost legion of young men and boys who are living in combat zones, and they are largely African-American, and they have lost all respect, as well as their parents have, for policing, how difficult the job of policing is.”

“What do we do about trying to convince young African-Americans and people of color in city after city that the police are there to help, not hurt or hinder?”

D’Esposito said the need for community policing is important, but then disagreed with Barnicle. (RELATED: ‘Nobody At The NYT Has Ever Tried To Handcuff Somebody’: CNN Analyst Pushes Back Against Tyre Nichols Reporting)

“I would have to disagree that there’s not every community, every African-American or minority community across this nation, [that] there are people there who dislike the police,” D’Esposito said. “I worked in Brownsville, Brooklyn, which is probably one of the most violent square miles in New York City, and I will tell you that, as we’ve seen … when the Democrats and the New York State legislature passed criminal justice reform, they said that the purpose of that was to protect those minority communities. And those communities are the ones that have suffered most.”

“Body bag after body bag being removed from communities like that. They want police on the street. They want to see men and women in uniform on their corners because there are people, good people, who live in those communities, who want to go out and get a gallon of milk and not have to be worried about getting struck with a stray bullet,” he continued.

The Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson then thanked D’Esposito for making that point, agreeing “people want good policing.”

Nichols was pulled over by Memphis police Jan. 7 for an alleged traffic violation and subsequently fled on foot. Five police officers have since been fired and charged after a “confrontation occurred,” leaving Nichols with deadly injuries. He died at St. Francis Hospital three days after the traffic stop.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/01/31/barnicle-desposito-msnbc-tyre-nichols-police/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjumuONgLT9AhWCLFkFHTJzDPA4MhAWegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw3bOENTsviE-8LC7_Zr29eb,2023-01-31
"Schools To Host Black Lives Matter At School Week Which Teaches Kids About ‘Trans Affirmation,’ ‘Restorative Justice’","Several of the nation’s schools are preparing to celebrate “Black Lives Matter at School” week which features curriculums on “restorative justice” and “globalism.”

With lesson plans, reading, documentaries and activities, students learn about activism and “structural racism.”

“Any education leader interested in building awareness on the history and struggles of the African American community should seek meaningful policy solutions rather than virtue-signaling,” Wenyuan Wu, executive director of Californians for Equal Rights Foundation, a group that focused on combating racial discrimination, told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Schools across the country are celebrating national “Black Lives Matter at School” week which teaches students about “restorative justice,” “globalism” and to be “trans-affirming,” according to the curriculum.

National “Black Lives Matter at School” week, which takes place from Feb. 6 to 10, focuses K-12 curriculums on 13 guiding principles including “restorative justice,” trans-affirmation and “diversity and globalism,” according to the curriculum. Through lesson plans, suggested reading, documentaries and activities, students learn about “structural racism” and how to be activists for the movement. (RELATED: Wisconsin School Board Bans Pride, BLM Flags From Classrooms)

“Black Lives Matter (BLM), as a political movement and an organization, has been proven to be a corrupted trojan horse that hijacks public education and injects hate and division into our young students,” Wenyuan Wu, executive director of Californians for Equal Rights Foundation, a group that focused on combating racial discrimination, told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The national group suggests schools start the week teaching about “restorative justice, empathy and loving engagement,” the curriculum showed. Lessons include “Who You Gonna Call, exploring alternatives to policing” which asks students to read articles that detail how to rely on community organizations rather than the police and participate in a workshop that discovers “viable alternatives to policing.”

On day two, educators are advised to focus on “diversity and globalism” with suggested reading on Palestine including “Determined to Stay,” a story about Palestinians fighting for their land against “Israeli efforts,” the lesson plans stated. Educators are given suggested lessons on diversity, including “Teaching Tolerance,” which features an “anti-racism activity” where first through fifth-grade students learn about “unfair practices” and discrimination using Dr. Seuss’s picture book, The Sneetches.

During the week, students learn about “homophobia and transphobia” and to “recognize that LGBTQ people exist,” the curriculum showed. A suggested lesson plan for third through sixth graders focuses on the past of LGBTQ people and “events in American history that are often omitted from textbooks.”

A guiding principle of the week includes “black families” with lessons on the patriarchy, its “system of oppression” and the privileges men have over women, the curriculum showed. Suggested reading for the guiding principle includes the picture book “My Rainbow,” a story about a mom who makes a rainbow wig for her transgender daughter.

Schools throughout the country have begun their celebration of the week; San Diego Unified School District raised a BLM flag below the American flag on Wednesday, according to KPBS News. In Maryland, Howard County Schools began teaching the BLM at Schools curriculum on “Diversity and Globalism” including lessons on “speciesism,” a type of oppression against animals.

“I understand and can advocate for the principles of Black Lives Matter,” the lesson plans state.

Milwaukee Public Schools is hosting events in honor of “Black Lives Matter at School” week including “BLM Family Night” where families can participate in “cultural experiences” at the Black Holocaust Museum, according to the school website. Shoreline Public Schools in Washington plans to celebrate the week in order to help students “understand inequities based on race” and to “affirm that the lives of people of color matter,” the school district website showed.

BLM at School raised more than $103,000 for its national week of action as of Friday, according to its website. Several teachers unions have backed the week-long event in the country’s schools including the National Education Association, Chicago Teachers Union and the Virginia Education Association.

“Giving the BLM brand legitimacy in public schools is handing ideologies, radicals and groomers a license to harm our next generation,” Wu told the DCNF. “Any education leader interested in building awareness on the history and struggles of the African American community should seek meaningful policy solutions rather than virtue-signaling.”

BLM at School, San Diego Unified School District, Howard County Schools, Milwaukee Public Schools and Shoreline Public Schools did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

"‘Bullsh*t’: Border Agency Circulates Anti-Law Enforcement, ‘BLACK RESISTANCE’ Flyer, Document Shows","UPDATE: This story has been updated to include a statement from a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol spokesperson.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) Office of Privacy and Diversity recently circulated a Black History Month flyer to agency personnel that presented anti-law enforcement figures and movements, according to a copy the Daily Caller News Foundation obtained.

The flyer, which also promoted “BLACK RESISTANCE,” promoted a number of activists and movements, including Colin Kaepernick and Black Lives Matter. Kaepernick has advocated for abolishing the police along with the Black Lives Matter movement.(RELATED: ‘Absence’: Border Sheriff Says Biden Admin Failed To Respond To Calls For Help)

“CBP, like other law enforcement agencies, are rooted in white supremacy and a history of slave-catching. These images and videos depict a painful reminder that this country is so backwards, that we’re living in our past,” Black Lives Matter wrote in 2021.

The flyer also featured an image of Democratic California Rep. Maxine Waters, who encouraged anti-police protestors “to get more confrontational.”

Townhall first obtained the document.

Two Border Patrol agents who spoke with the DCNF said that they’re no longer surprised by messaging like this from their agency.

“I’m honestly not surprised,” one of the agents, who wished to remain anonymous as they weren’t authorized to speak, told the DCNF. “I think a lot of us are used to seeing stuff like this by now. It still puts a bad taste in my mouth, at the same time makes me laugh because I can’t believe people are still backing that bullshit.”

“Each year the theme for National Black History Month is selected by the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, established on September 9, 1915, by Dr. Carter G. Woodson,” a CBP spokesperson told the DCNF in a statement. “This year’s theme is “Black Resistance in the Past, Present, and Future.” The flyer/poster includes names and historical reference representative of Black Resistance. CBP distributed the poster along with information about the process for establishing the theme to advance the educational intent of Black History Month, and Chief Ortiz sent an email to staff about it.”

Christian High School Apologizes For ‘Racist’ Black History Month Lunch Of Fried Chicken And Collard Greens,"A Christian high school issued an apology for its Black History Month lunch consisting of fried chicken and collard greens after students complained that the meal was racist, according to WOOD TV8.

Grand Rapids Christian High School in Michigan offered the lunch Tuesday, giving students mac and cheese, cornbread and banana pudding, in addition to fried chicken and collard greens, according to WOOD TV8. Superintendent Tom DeJonge was forced to issue an apology after students called the lunch “racist,” saying the school had been trying to serve an “authentic Soul Food lunch,” according to an email sent to parents Wednesday. (RELATED: New York Middle School Celebrates Black History Month With ‘Inexcusably Insensitive’ Meal)

“(We) recognize that the initial publication of the meal had a negative impact on our community, and for this we are sorry,” DeJonge said in the apology. “As a staff, we humbly commit to continuing to learn and grow in this area as we seek to produce culturally competent students who are prepared for lives of service to Christ. We are committed to continuing to meet with and listen to our staff and students as we seek to build and further strengthen an environment that is welcoming to all.”

DeJonge also said in the school’s statement that they had consulted an “executive chef, Xaviar Jamarillo,” to create the meal for students and notified parents that the meal recognizing Black History Month would be taking place on Feb. 7, according to the apology. Students did not take to the meal, even after the school explained that it was trying to encourage an inclusive environment to “celebrate a variety of cultures.”

DeJonge promised the school would consider how the “stereotypes” fail to “create the sense of inclusiveness, belonging and culture we espouse to achieve as a Christian school community,” and that students should feel able to voice their concerns to administrators, who will do better to “always be on alert,” according to the apology.

Actor Idris Elba Hits Back At Critics After Rejecting ‘Black Actor’ Label,"Esteemed Actor Idris Elba has come under fire for his recent remarks that he would no longer like to be known as a “black actor” and wants his talents appreciated irrespective of his skin color.

In an interview with Esquire UK, the actor said that society’s preoccupation with race has created obstacles for his career, and that he would no longer like to be defined by his ethnicity.

“As humans, we are obsessed with race. And that obsession can really hinder people’s aspirations, hinder people’s growth,” Elba said.

“I stopped describing myself as a Black actor when I realised it put me in a box. We’ve got to grow. We’ve got to. Our skin is no more than that: it’s just skin. Rant over.” (RELATED: Idris Elba Hasn’t Been Contacted To Play James Bond)

Elba’s call to discard racial essentialism ignited criticism.

Kellee Terrell, a screenwriter who has collaborated with Blumhouse and Amazon Studios, claimed that Elba’s comments were made with selfish intent.

“There’s an innocuous way that Black folks in Hollywood like Idris, Terry Crews, etc—play the “good colorblind negro” to have individual success.” Terrell tweeted, “Meanwhile,Black folks like Gina, Gabrielle, John Boyega, etc, reject that bullshit to ensure COMMUNAL SUCCESS.”

Political analyst Ameshia Cross tweeted that Idris took a “dangerous path” with his comments.

On Saturday, Elba took to Twitter to clarify his comments from the Esquire UK interview, claiming that he hasn’t disowned his racial identity, but doubled-down that he doesn’t want his race being affected with how he’s viewed in his profession.

“There isn’t a soul on this earth that can question whether I consider myself a BLACK MAN or not.” Elba added, “Being an ‘actor’ is a profession, like being an ‘architect’ ,they are not defined by race. However, If YOU define your work by your race, that is your Perogative. Ah lie?”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/11/actor-idris-elba-hits-back-at-critics-after-rejecting-black-actor-label/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj_i_WLgLT9AhVnkIkEHdC1AVY4FBAWegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw197dIy8gEE5Dphx4vIhtyx,2023-02-11
Why Hasn’t Anyone From Jeffrey Epstein’s ‘Little Black Book’ Been Arrested Yet?,"Jeffrey Epstein’s associates could face federal criminal prosecutions based on the available evidence, and building a case against them could take years, sex trafficking legal experts say.

Epstein kept a detailed list of his contacts in a little black book and was photographed with many powerful figures, including former President Bill Clinton, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Prince Andrew of the United Kingdom, former President Donald Trump and more.

Epstein’s longtime pilot, Larry Visoski, testified during the criminal trial of Epstein’s partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, that he saw Clinton, Trump and disgraced actor Kevin Spacey among Epstein’s famous clients. He did not make specific allegations in his testimony. One Maxwell accuser, who testified under pseudonym, said in her testimony that Maxwell bragged about her connections to powerful figures.

Legal action against Epstein’s alleged associates has been confined to civil lawsuits by victims and attorneys general, despite the evidence available for criminal prosecutions, such as Epstein’s little black book and the testimonies in the Maxwell trial.

Benjamin Bull, chief legal counsel at the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), said prosecutors should be “salivating” over the chance to pursue justice for Epstein’s victims. “Any serious prosecutor worth his salt would be all over this little black book,” Bull told the Daily Caller.

“It’s a roadmap leading to the people guilty of trafficking children among Epstein’s friends and benefactors, such as Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and other prominent but culpable perpetrators,” he continued. “The scandal waiting to explode is why law enforcement has ignored this ever-growing sex trafficking ring. We need an explanation for why people are not being charged and prosecuted. Is this an instance of classic influence peddling corruption in law enforcement? Why no action? The silence is now deafening.”

Bull is a former prosecutor of obscenity and child pornography cases and has won multiple cases in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. He has also trained Justice Department prosecutors, numerous state attorneys general and prosecutorial organizations.

An investigation and prosecution involving wide-ranging criminal activity by sex traffickers can take years before charges are brought, and the international scale of Epstein’s activities could slow the process even more.

“It is not atypical for a human trafficking case to take several years to investigate and prosecute,” said Jane Anderson, a former human trafficking prosecutor in Miami-Dade County. “Investigators and prosecutors should investigate all sex crimes, following the evidence they uncover, including following up on any victim disclosure of sexual assault or exploitation.”

Prosecutors can obtain primary sources of evidence such as “interviews, digital evidence, public and government records, financial records, and more. Some evidence requires probable cause (or other legal standards) and tools like court orders, search warrants, or subpoenas to access,” Anderson told the Caller.

A criminal case can usually be established beyond a reasonable doubt if at least one witness can provide testimony, according to Anderson.

“The law in most states specifically says that a case can be established beyond a reasonable doubt based on the testimony of one witness. However, I would think most prosecutors would prefer to have corroborating evidence (testimonial, physical, circumstantial, or direct) to support a victim’s testimony,” Anderson said.

If no victims are able to testify, prosecutors can pursue a case based on other primary source evidence and witness testimony, Anderson noted. Prosecutors can also pursue related charges based on organized crime statutes and money laundering if victims are too traumatized and fearful to give credible testimony.

Typically, sex trafficking rings commit a variety of additional crimes as part of the criminal enterprise, such as “physical and sexual violence, financial crimes, drug crimes, image-abuse crimes, stalking, and witness intimidation,” Anderson told the Caller.

“Organized crime statutes and conspiracy statutes would also want to be looked at. There are other prostitution-related crimes that could be used to charge traffickers or ‘buyers’ – not victims – but, they are typically misdemeanors or low level felony crimes, depending on the state,” Anderson added. “It is a good investigatory and prosecutorial strategy to focus on the offender’s entire criminal activity to better hold them accountable, whether a victim is able or unable to testify.”

A broad range of activities not typically associated with sex trafficking are covered under sex trafficking statues, according to lawyer and sexual abuse investigator Carol Merchasin, Counsel at McAllister Olvarius.

“By terms of the statute, sex trafficking by fraud, force or coercion does not require the movement of people across borders or state lines, nor does it require cash to change hands,” Merchasin told the Caller. “Fraudulently inducing someone to have sex in exchange for promises of career advancement could be deemed sex trafficking, and anyone who is a beneficiary of this can be held liable under the statute. So, regardless of what is going on with the federal criminal probe into Epstein’s circle, victims of sex trafficking will be able to bring civil claims against anyone who trafficked them or benefited from that trafficking.”

Disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of sex trafficking because he made fraudulent promises in return for sex, Merchasin pointed out. “From the perspective of the law itself, this means that a surprisingly broad range of people participate in sex trafficking. In my practice, the traffickers are not criminal gangs or international financiers but gurus, spiritual leaders, or the heads of a religious cult,” Merchasin continued.

The National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking released by the Trump administration and updated by the Biden administration emphasizes a prosecutorial strategy of targeting related crimes by sex trafficking rings if victims are unable to testify. It also provides strategies for greater law enforcement coordination and capacity when prosecuting sex trafficking.

“Many human trafficking violations span years, involve dozens or hundreds of victims, and cross jurisdictions. The target of an investigation may lead to an extensive network of potentially culpable co-conspirators, including facilitators who benefit financially and buyers of goods, labor, or services who turn a blind eye to victims. In those cases, asset forfeiture and restitution are valuable and effective tools,” according to the action plan.

“Many human trafficking cases rely on victim testimony, yet there are challenges in securing human trafficking victims’ participation as witnesses,” the action plan reads. Federal anti-trafficking experts and sex trafficking survivors contributed to the plan’s guidance on prosecuting sex trafficking crimes.

Under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), victims can bring civil action against traffickers and financial beneficiaries of sex trafficking. The TVPA previously required victims to bring claims within 10 years of the offense or their 18th birthday if they were a minor at the time of the offense. In 2022, Congress passed legislation removing the statute of limitations for civil claims by individuals who were trafficked as minors.

If Epstein victims’ civil cases fall outside the statute of limitations, there are other legal avenues they can pursue. New York’s Child Victims Act, for example, extended the statute of limitations for civil and criminal cases involving sexual abuse.

Prominent Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre singled out a list of eight alleged associates, known as the “Epstein Eight,” in her civil lawsuit against Maxwell. On Nov. 18, New York judge Loretta Preska promised to unseal the identities of the eight individuals, with the lone exception of “Doe 183,” Insider reported.

The “Doe 183” name will be kept sealed because the alleged relationship with Epstein “has been a subject of intense media coverage,” Preska said, according to Insider. The individual has allegedly made a years-long legal effort to keep his or her personal information out of the public and shares a lawyer with alleged Epstein benefactor Les Wexner, Insider found.

Giuffre and Prince Andrew settled a civil sexual assault lawsuit for an estimated $3 million with no trial or admission of guilt on Andrew’s part. Giuffre alleged that Andrew sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17 years old, according to The Guardian. Andrew is reportedly prepared to file a lawsuit against Guiffre demanding a retraction and apology for her claims.

Epstein accusers recently filed a civil lawsuit against J.P. Morgan Chase and Deutsche Bank for enabling Epstein’s sex trafficking operation, Reuters reported. The lawsuit alleges that former J.P. Morgan executive Jes Staley was an operative in Epstein’s sex trafficking, according to Bloomberg. J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank are fighting to dismiss the lawsuits on the grounds that they did not benefit from or participate in Epstein’s sex trafficking operation.

Former U.S. Virgin Islands Attorney General Denise George won a $105 million settlement with the Epstein estate, which must sell Epstein’s private island Little St. James as part of the settlement. Epstein committed many of his crimes on the island, which is currently on the market for $125 million.

Epstein was found dead in a jail cell in 2019 while he awaited trial on sex crimes charges brought by federal prosecutors. His death was ruled a suicide.

School District Offers Community Service Hours To Students Who Participate In Black History Month Events,"A California school district is offering community service hours to students who participate in Black History Month events, according to the school district.

Anaheim Union High School District (AUHSD) is rewarding students with community service hours if they attend or participate in Black History Month events promoted by the school district’s Black Lives Matter Task Force throughout February, according to the school district. Events include a black history parade and the school district’s Black History Month celebration. (RELATED: Schools To Host Black Lives Matter At School Week Which Teaches Kids About ‘Trans Affirmation,’ ‘Restorative Justice’)

“School districts communicate messages to students through both word and deed – and by offering community service hours for certain events and not others, they are clearly attempting to influence not only student behavior, but also perceptions,” Nicole Neily, president of Parents Defending Education, an organization looking to increase parental rights in schools, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Children should be encouraged to engage with their communities in whichever manner they see fit – and that participation should not be unduly influenced by an administrator placing their thumb on the scale.”

Students could earn community service hours for attending the “Orange County Black History Parade & Unity Festival” and can make up their “Saturday Academy” session, an academic enrichment class, if they choose to attend the parade, the school promotion stated. Community service is awarded to students who attend the school district’s “Black History Month Celebration,” a performance which includes a performance painter, a West African Dance and a performance of “Lift Every Voice And Sing,” the black national anthem.

Students received credit for community service if they attended the “Los Angeles Black College Expo” where 150 colleges and universities, including 40 historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) are featured, the school district stated. In March, students can attend the school district’s “black student union leadership summit” to receive community service credit.

Please join us for the 3rd annual Black History Month Celebration on Friday, February 24th, 2023 at 6:30 PM at the Kennedy High School Performing Arts Center and Live-streamed on the AUHSD Communications channel at:https://t.co/r4OakQGruX pic.twitter.com/O4cXJN6MQN — Anaheim Union High School District (@AnaheimUHSD) February 10, 2023

The AUHSD’s Black Lives Matter Task Force asked students to register for the events ahead of time, according to a registration form. While registering, students had t0 mark if they were members of the district’s Black Lives Matter Task Force and were then given the option to receive information on joining the club.

“Students, we are offering community service hours for many of our events,” the student registration form stated. “The members of the AUHSD Black Lives Matter Task Force look forward to your participation throughout the month.”

"‘When They Say Woke, They Mean Black’: Joy Reid Blasts DeSantis’ Education Policy","MSNBC’s Joy Reid tore into Gov. Ron DeSantis’ education policy Wednesday during a segment focused on the Florida Board of Education’s decision to reject an African American Studies course.

The DeSantis administration rejected a proposed AP African American studies course in January for sections on “queer theory” and its use of the tenets of critical race theory. The College Board released reformed curriculum for the course in February, doing away with many of the rejected sections.

“When they say woke, they mean black. Black folk invented the term woke and they have twisted it. And the things that they object to, the black national anthem, the fact that white people were marching for Black Lives Matter — that’s what they’re afraid of is the connection of even white folks to empathy for black folks,” Reid said.

DeSantis blasted woke ideology during his inauguration ceremony for his second term as governor in January.

“We reject this woke ideology. We seek normalcy, not philosophical lunacy. We will not allow reality, facts, and truth to become optional. We will never surrender to the woke mob. Florida is where woke goes to die!” DeSantis said.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/15/joy-reid-board-education-ron-desantis-policy-african-american-studies-woke/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjr68OMgLT9AhWmKlkFHY1eC9g4HhAWegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw37YiQjgpBsKJOU9vfnY7DQ,2023-02-15
"US Diplomat Deletes Tweets About #BlackGirlMagic In Afghanistan, Black History Month","America’s top diplomat in Afghanistan deleted several tweets Thursday after being ridiculed for pondering whether Afghans need “black girl magic.”

Karen Decker, the Biden administration’s Chargé d’Affaires of the U.S. Mission to Afghanistan, tweeted Tuesday asking if Afghans are familiar with #BlackGirlMagic and whether or not Afghan girls need a similar movement. She walked back the statement Thursday after the State Department distanced itself from her remarks.

“Are Afghans familiar with #BlackGirlMagic and the movement it inspired? Do Afghan girls need a similar movement? What about Afghan Women? Teach me, ready to learn. #BlackHistoryMonth,” Decker tweeted. She tagged Lizzo, Regina King and Beyonce at the end of her post.

The tweet was just one of several black history month-related posts Decker deleted after being mocked online. Days earlier, she tweeted “Abe Lincoln born today in 1809. He did some stuff. It’s also NAACP day, home of grassroots activism, inclusive communities and making sure Black voices are heard. What does that look like for Afghans struggling to be heard?.”

In another post, she asked Afghans what the most exciting sporting event was they can remember after noting that both starting quarterbacks in this year’s Super Bowl were black.

“Sometimes our best intentions go awry because we haven’t listened enough or don’t truly understand others’ lived experience,” Decker tweeted Thursday. “My efforts to celebrate courageous African Americans this month fall in that category. I apologize to any and all who I may have offended or hurt.”

Decker still has at least nine tweets visible on her timeline in which she speaks about black history month without making any mention of Afghanistan. She has several more resembling the #BlackGirlMagic tweet, in which she attempts to relate historical black American figures or black American culture to Afghanistan.

State Department Spokesman Ned Price stopped short of condemning the tweets, but did call them “inappropriate”: “I will say that there’s sentiments in her tweet thread that one can appreciate,” Price said. “I think the messaging in this context is rather inappropriate and ineffective, and it is not messaging that we would issue from here.”",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/17/karen-decker-tweets-afghanistan-black-girl-magic/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjx7uaPgLT9AhWZEFkFHcpdBHk4UBAWegQICRAC&usg=AOvVaw1yVBMwXUAhwGzvEvnz2j8v,2023-02-17
Diversity Officers Pink Slipped Like Never Before During Black History Month,"With layoffs hitting nearly every part of the American economy, one sector’s losses may actually be good news for the rest of the country. Highly-paid, under-worked diversity officers are often the first to go as Big Tech companies and other corporations announce massive layoffs. What’s more ironic, news of these layoffs is coming during Black History Month.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=013858372769713515008:m9uq4uupsfm&q=https://dailycaller.com/2023/02/20/dei-officers-fired-big-tech-layoffs-black-history-month/&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjr68OMgLT9AhWmKlkFHY1eC9g4HhAWegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw0qL0Bqhn3Bb-1LWOIL6fPw,2023-02-20
