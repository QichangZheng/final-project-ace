A Dinner With Exiled King Trump and His Knights - The American Spectator,"The only new movie that I had planned to see this month was Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (not really). But that was before a Black Lives Matter TikTok “influencer” scared me off. Some loon named Lavynder Lee suggested in a video that it would be racist for white folks to see the movie on opening weekend. “This message is to all our wimpy accomplices and ‘white allies,’” Lee emoted in the video. “This message is to all the white people who have ‘BLM’ in their bio…. You can go see [Black Panther: Wakanda Forever] on another weekend. Go see it on the second or third weekend. But the first weekend? That’s for us.”

And not only must I not see the Marvel fantasy, but I should also buy a black person a ticket, then stand outside the theater like a goon to make sure systemic racists don’t ruin the show. “You buy your ticket, you give it to a black person or a black family who can’t afford to go,” Lee insisted. “And then you go sit in that theater, in front of the doors. You make sure that every black person in that theater can enjoy that movie in peace. You make sure that you use your body to block us from anybody who’d be coming in that theater to do us harm. That is your job.” Thoroughly intimidated, I took refuge with a much better and — in the week of the most consequential midterm election of my lifetime — far more relevant new film, the Daily Wire production My Dinner with Trump.

This is a fascinating insider look at the two-years-later reunion dinner of former President Donald Trump and his closest advisers and Cabinet heads. They included daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner, chief of staff Mark Meadows, economic adviser Larry Kudlow, policy adviser Stephen Miller, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, and Senior Counselor Kellyanne Conway. After two years of the Biden administration’s nonsensical Marxist blatherers, from the president and vice president down, it’s jarring to watch thoughtful people speaking in clear, complete, and eloquent sentences.

The dinner took place at Trump’s private club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where the diners reflected on both the great accomplishments of their administration and the catastrophic disaster of the current one. Hence, the documentary is naturally bittersweet — alternating between glory days and dark nights — as well as touching and dramatic.

The first thing that strikes the viewer is, as always, Donald Trump himself. Trump is conservative nitroglycerin. He can blow away progressive forces such as the corrupt media — like no other before him. But then, he just might explode in our faces. He did the latter last Saturday when he foolishly nicknamed the popular Florida governor and his possible presidential rival, Ron DeSantis, “Ron DeSanctimonious,” three days before the Florida election. For all Trump’s bombast, DeSantis is about to manage something Trump couldn’t — win a second term.

Nonetheless, in My Dinner with Trump, the ex-president comes off as a pleasant country squire interacting with close friends. Sitting at the head of a long dining table while appetizing food gets served, Trump appears sincerely proud of everything he and his team managed to do, yet sad about the chaotic decline that followed them. Refreshingly, he partially blames himself for the linkage. “I had two jobs — to run the country and to survive,” Trump muses at one point. “If you think about it, survival was much more difficult.”

Trump humorously admits that he made some damaging key personnel choices: “You know we had great people in this administration, but we don’t get any credit because we had guys like [Gen. Mark] Milley, who a camera hit him in the face and he blew his whole deal. I’ll never forget the way he apologized the following week. He walks over to a church that’s on fire, and he goes, and he apologizes.”

Like the tragic figure of an exiled king, Trump truly laments the total collapse of the southern border he once came close to securing. And he can’t seem to understand the Biden regime’s reckless abandonment of it. He ponders whether it’s intentional or the result of incompetence. Miller provides the simple and accurate answer: “They hate the country. I mean, that’s what it comes down to. And they hate a lot of the people in the country. But I just want to say, because this is so important, people don’t know how much you did on the border.”

Other topics at the dinner such as defense, diplomacy, and economics receive intelligent input from Trump’s experts. For instance, when Trump assails the media censorship that silenced him and continues to do so to other conservatives, saying, “The media is shut, closed, not free, corrupt as can be, and probably scared,” Carson responds with calm, Spock-like logic: “I don’t think people actually recognize what’s happening. Because when we talk about liberties, freedom of speech, they think they can only be taken away by the federal government. But the fact of the matter is Big Tech and the media take it away with a complicit government.”

My Dinner with Trump is a must-see time capsule of an Arthurian moment in American history, the further consequences of which will be made known this very Tuesday. Yet the dinner itself was originally a tiny part of a longer film. DW Entertainment producer and notable independent filmmaker Dallas Sonnier (Bone Tomahawk, Dragged Across Concrete) seized on the segment as the heart of the picture and expanded it, inspired by the iconic ’80s documentary My Dinner with Andre. (Yes, once upon a time, in the ’80s, an intellectual dinner conversation between two artists could make a theatrical hit film.)

“It took many rounds of blessing from the Trump family to get us to the finish line,” Sonnier said. “And we are honestly thrilled they trusted us with this opportunity.”

In the end, the Trump family loved the movie. And so will most of the audience.

Can They Really Charge Trump After This? - The American Spectator,"The Biden administration had the perfect way to get rid of Trump. The former president appeared to have stonewalled the Department of Justice from obtaining classified documents containing national-security material. An obstruction charge looked to be a relatively simple prosecution, especially before a Washington, D.C., jury.

But that’s all in jeopardy with the revelation that Joe Biden himself had three secret troves of classified documents on national-security material: one in a locked closet at a foreign policy think tank, the Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, aka the Penn Biden Center; another in his Wilmington, Delaware, home’s garage — alongside his Corvette; and a third in a room adjacent to his garage.

It’s impossible for the investigation into Donald Trump to be insulated from politics. A special counsel, Jack Smith, has been assigned to oversee the investigation into Trump’s handling of the material and alleged obstruction of the DOJ’s investigation, thus lending some appearance of political neutrality. But Smith reports to Attorney General Merrick Garland, who of course reports to Biden.

When it really comes down to it, Garland has the power to charge or not charge Trump.

Here’s the problem for the Biden administration: A prosecution of a former president has to be sold politically. You can’t charge a president on a basis that a huge swath of the population can’t get behind. If you did, all you’d accomplish by such a prosecution would be tarnishing the Justice Department’s reputation.

In the mind of the public, both cases are about illegally retaining classified documents. Upon leaving office, two former elected officials illegally stored classified documents, some of which were classified at the SCI, or sensitive compartmented information, level. In the case of Biden, CNN has reported that he had in his possession “intelligence memos and briefing materials that covered topics including Ukraine, Iran and the United Kingdom.” In Trump’s case, the Washington Post has reported on the basis of anonymous sources that the documents included “highly sensitive intelligence regarding Iran and China.”

Since the sitting president allegedly has committed a related crime, it would be exceedingly difficult to establish the support for charges that you’d need from the American people to prosecute Trump without blowing your reputation. Such a prosecution would come across as hypocritical, unfair, and partisan.

Yes, Trump was served a subpoena in May 2021 asking for “any and all documents or writings in the custody or control of Donald J. Trump and/or the Office of Donald J. Trump bearing classification markings” and maintained such documents in his possession until they were seized by the FBI while Biden’s lawyers voluntarily handed over the classified documents. Trump, therefore, could be charged with a separate crime.

But the argument that “both Trump and Biden illegally stored classified material, yet only Trump is being charged” would haunt any prosecution of Trump, no matter how good of a public relations campaign the DOJ and the media waged to convince Americans that Trump’s case is different. The Biden administration may come to the conclusion that a prosecution on obstruction charges is no longer politically feasible.

The liberal media is reluctantly facing this possibility.

An article in CNN Thursday is headlined “Biden’s document scandal eats away at efforts to hold Republicans accountable.”

“President Joe Biden’s embarrassment over classified documents found in his former offices is spiraling into a major political crisis that threatens to undermine the case for Donald Trump to be charged for his own hoarding of secret material,” it said.

“Garland and Smith may well think even harder before charging Trump,” concluded a Vox article comparing both cases.

The Associated Press quoted Jay Town, a U.S. attorney during the Trump administration, who said, “To the extent that the political narrative is a consideration … it does make it harder to bring charges against former President Trump as it relates to the documents seized at Mar-a-Lago.”

For its part, the media is working to convince the public that the two cases are distinct. It’s an effort that will need to widely succeed if the Biden administration wants to prosecute Trump for obstruction and sell it politically.

The Biden administration has an alternative if it doesn’t want to make the now politically uncomfortable move of charging Trump on the basis of his handling of classified documents: It can just charge him with something else.

Smith is also working his way through investigating Trump’s actions leading up to Jan. 6. According to the New York Times, Smith has issued subpoenas that suggest he is looking into whether claims of a stolen election were used to raise money, who covered legal expenses for Trump’s associates, and whether money passed to people “who were not disclosed.”

Charging Trump for something that Biden didn’t do would at least be less awkward.

There’s another solution, though. The Department of Justice could charge both Biden and Trump for their handling of classified documents. That would silence accusations of partisanship.

"CHAOS! Republicans Control House, Barely, and Trump Is In-and-Out - The American Spectator","Republicans will control the House of Representatives, barely. The instability will require strategic brilliance, which is in short supply.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump wants to run again, but he is done.

Eventually, Joe Biden, who makes a fool of himself, will not run.

China intends to dominate the world, the opening gambit being an increasingly likely invasion of Taiwan. But Biden’s priority for our military remains woke indoctrination, and he inexplicably says that China does not threaten Taiwan. China should be paying reparations for COVID. Yet Biden at the Global Summit won’t even discuss China’s coverup.

Instead, our disoriented president just met with China’s Xi Jinping about “climate change” and then boasted about (supposedly) partnering with the world’s greatest polluter.

So much is at stake for the U.S. and the world, and the disappointing (for Republicans) midterm elections have emboldened Biden, in midlife crisis at age 79, to double down on his destructive policies. Never considered intelligent, now the pathetic Biden is in mental decline, as is apparent when he is televised live, before CNN edits his comments. Thus, Biden remains the ideal vessel for the so-called progressives who dominate our declining culture.

Trump did lose in 2020 because of a stolen election. It was stolen not by the vote-counters but by the dishonest, agenda-driven media — print, broadcast, internet, social — that covered Trump critically and Biden uncritically and discredited or even buried stories (think Hunter Biden) counter to its narrative. But all this now is noise. While Trump’s policies were solid, he lacks credibility, and his self-inflicted wounds are overdone. He is generally being persecuted politically and unfairly, but his possible indictment may be grounded, and friendly media like Fox News may not circle the wagons around him.

Biden and his neo-Marxist ideologues have torn down America’s heritage, divided our nation by race, brainwashed and sexualized little kids, unsecured our borders, repudiated energy independence, and condoned and enabled violent crime. Biden even nominated a Supreme Court justice who says she believes in women’s rights, but who cannot define a woman. And the once-plausible American Civil Liberties Union gives the Biden administration a pass on its routine infringement of civil liberties. But even Biden’s complicit media could not ignore the sharply rising prices at the gas pump and at the grocery market.

Only 28 percent of U.S. voters said the country is heading in the right direction. So why not a tsunami, or at least a wave election, for Republicans to gain dozens of seats in the House of Representatives and become a tight majority in the U.S. Senate?

We are told of triumphs, such as the unseating of Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, which marks the first time in more than four decades that Republicans unseated the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. That last time was a campaign I created in 1980 to unseat 20-year incumbent DCCC Chair Jim Corman. The National Republican Congressional Committee then refused to target his California district (62 percent Democrat; 31 percent Republican, and with unfavorable demographics). When the NRCC belatedly targeted it, it was not to win but to keep Corman occupied in his own district rather than raising money for Democrat target districts around the country.

Beltway Republican leaders don’t create reality. In fact, they are typically behind the curve, as the saying goes, looking in the rearview mirror. They now fail to grasp the paradox that securing independent votes for a Republican means playing down partisanship. In this election, they were spread too thin and thus lost too many close races. Nor did they consider the impact of weak statewide Republican candidates. In contrast, the gains in New York congressional districts reflected Lee Zeldin’s incredible showing, as well as New York’s independent, fair redistricting that provided the margin to take the House. Otherwise, the Democrats would be in control!

The week before the election, I wrote a postelection strategy that assumed major gains to control the House and at least a couple of seats to control the Senate. (Nonetheless, the bulk of that strategy paper still holds.) Yet, as I had reviewed daily the RealClearPolitics compilation of major polls, I never saw consistent “red wave” data. Despite my professional experience of conducting more than 1,500 political surveys, I watched too much Sean Hannity and drank the Kool-Aid. Put another way, I naively assumed Beltway Republicans had internal upbeat tracking polling and real-time turnout models behind all the intoxicating predictions.

Forty years ago, in the 1982 California campaign for governor, George Deukmejian defeated Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, despite polls showing Bradley ahead. The liberal media said polls failed to uncover a prejudice against black candidates, and that myth persists. Actually, Bradley did win on Election Day, but Deukmejian handily won the absentee ballots, tabulated afterwards, and thus won overall. The California Republican Party had quickly adapted after California law changed to allow absentee ballots for any reason, and it mailed to solicit and “bank” absentee ballots. Now, the Democrats dominate non–Election Day balloting, in California and nationally.

Using COVID in 2020, Democrats have made elections a continuing process, with emphasis on mail-in voting and (especially union) ballot harvesting. Government unions seek Election Day holiday to vote and turn out voters. Republicans had two years to get their act together. They didn’t.

The national generic party vote is informative, but not decisively. Much of the Republican advantage likely puffed up numbers in safe Republican seats. Besides, national polls require confirmation, not cheerleading, and only the relevant state or congressional district polls can be dispositive. As I did years ago for absentee ballots cast, polling must allocate for mail-in voters who voted and thus need to be polled; their voter propensity is retroactively 100 percent. Those continuing data are combined, as mathematically appropriate, with polls of those yet to vote, to identify trends and forecast. Until Republicans can change the new rules and protocols (Florida modified some), they must actively pursue pre–Election Day voting, especially mail-in ballots. Banked ballots obviously are certain votes. And polling also failed to account for measurable higher-than-expected Democrat turnout.

On the issues, the biased media implied that the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision outlawed abortion when it simply returned the matter to the states, which for nearly a half century was the conservative rationale to reverse Roe. Republicans moved too quickly at the state level, but, worse, Sen. Lindsey Graham introduced federal legislation to limit abortions (though even a Republican-controlled Senate/House would never pass it). Voters juxtaposed the Dobbs decision (“anti-democratic” with a small “d”) with the media hyping Democrat talking points, notably the Republicans’ alleged “threat to democracy” — a phony issue but one that nonetheless animated the turnout of Democrats and appealed to independents.

You do not nationalize an issue that will jeopardize your probability of victory. Abortion was more of a motivating factor for Democrat voters. Review the dominant media, including the major networks and newspapers, to analyze how, through labels like calling Republicans “election deniers,” the media pushed the Democratic Party agenda and raised turnout. It’s time to confront the phony “democracy is on the ballot” catchphrase with the obvious: The authoritarian Biden really argues that if you don’t vote for him and his party, you’re against democracy.

Simply highlighting problems is not enough. Republicans nearly succeeded in nationalizing the crime issue but failed, as with inflation, to explain how Democrats caused the problem and why electing Republicans would make a difference. Republican strategists still don’t realize, as Zeldin showed in New York, that you campaign in New York City to reach the New York City media market — Nassau, Suffolk, and Westchester counties and beyond, just as the crime issue in Los Angeles City reaches its media market, including Orange, Ventura, San Bernardino, and Riverside counties. This is how you reach the target-rich suburbs!

Govs. Glenn Youngkin last year and Brian Kemp and Ron DeSantis this year won great victories because they remained aloof from Trump, who twice cost the GOP control of the U.S. Senate — two years ago in Georgia and now in multiple states. The loss of the Senate majority in 2020 cost the nation trillions of dollars in extra spending and some awful new judges. Trump had discouraged mail-in balloting two years ago. This year he endorsed candidates less likely to win in a general election, then contributed little financially to help them, and his campaigning was primarily about himself. His possible run in 2024 is anathema to the pivotal independent voters. Worse, during the crucial preelection week, he predicted his likely 2024 run. Trump’s choice in Ohio, J.D. Vance, won only because Trump’s nemesis Mitch McConnell deployed nearly $30 million there. Ironically, Trump’s Kari Lake for Arizona governor was a solid candidate who should have won. And Michigan’s impressive Tudor Dixon also failed to reach sufficient independent voters. Independents voted handily for John Fetterman in Pennsylvania and gave the edge to Raphael Warnock in Georgia. Trump candidates emulate Trump in confusing a general election with a Republican primary.

I voted for Trump against Biden and would do so again. I recognize his flaws, but I’m a policy guy. I supported most of Trump’s policies and worked with the administration on criminal justice reform and other matters. But he would never have been impeached if Republicans controlled the House. And given “peace and prosperity” — his successful foreign policy and robust economy — absent his tweets and dysfunctional behavior, Republicans in 2018 might have kept control of the House by a few seats. Back then Trump apologists dismissed his destructive behavior as eccentric (“that’s Trump”); now, it’s admittedly toxic. Republicans should not confront him but simply stand down and ignore him.

Trump won the nomination in 2016 with a plurality in early winner-take-all primaries against a large field of candidates who only dropped out one by one. In 2024, DeSantis will be the alternative, and, unless he stumbles, others will drop out early rather than risk a Trump plurality win. Perhaps the Republican National Committee will repeal the winner-take-all rules, which were originally crafted to give Jeb Bush the nomination in 2016 but instead facilitated Trump’s ascendancy. This almost certainly denies Trump a path to the nomination but also could divide the party for the eventual nominee.

The signature Trump name-calling already backfires, not among the incorrigible Never-Trump Republicans, many of whom morphed into Never Republicans, but among disenchanted conservatives who want it all in 2024 — to claim the Senate, the House, and the presidency.

Nearly 50 years ago, hardly anyone expected that both President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew would vacate their positions. The House speaker needs to demonstrate gravitas and seriousness, as he is second in line for the presidency. Biden will not be the nominee, and a successor would not favor his running mate Kamala Harris, whom Biden’s team will continue to sabotage, risking a convention revolt among black delegates.

With the president unpopular, Republicans wanted 2022 to be a referendum on Biden, not Trump. And, looking forward, the new speaker of the House can praise Trump administration policies but remain agnostic on Trump. But the inexcusably tiny Republican margin in the House provides no cushion for the speaker to preside over a government in exile. Still, Republicans can paint the Senate and Biden as obstructionists. The good news is that some Democrats who barely won reelection may no longer always shill for Biden.

Democrats already have a 50-seat majority in the U.S. Senate, but electing Herschel Walker remains critical. The plainspoken Walker seems more authentic than the polished Warnock, especially among black voters who see the attacks on Walker as a takedown. If Trump stays out of it, and Kemp helps, Walker could win. Perhaps then one or two Senate seats will open up next year, where a Republican governor appoints. Given his preelection tirade against Biden, Joe Manchin likely considered switching parties if Republicans won a majority and offered him a committee chairmanship. If Biden continues to disrespect Manchin and continues his attack on West Virginia coal, and if Manchin fears a Republican challenger in 2024, he could switch parties.

In 2022, Democrats pushed abortion/pro-choice policies and a strategy of scaremongering about threats to democracy/election denial. In 2024, abortion should be a state issue, unless Republicans stupidly nationalize it. And democracy/election denial should finally be off the table. If Trump persists, most Republican candidates will ignore him. The Republican Party, sans Trump, will have a new lease on life in 2024.

Looking ahead, Republicans will antagonize independent voters if their agenda is mainly clumsy investigations, but serious hearings could unearth major scandals, including on COVID policy, especially the long-term effects of mandated vaccinations. Republicans also need to build on their inroads among nonwhite voters. And they need to reach younger voters who will turn out in a presidential year.

Republicans must ensure that Biden is blamed for continued inflation, higher interest rates, a tech meltdown, unemployment, any recession, racial division, culture disintegration, open borders, and foreign-policy debacles, while Republicans get credit for anything positive. There are preemptive ways to do all that and propose alternative policies. Finally, Republicans must create a permanent sentiment of buyer’s remorse among independents who voted Democrat this time.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/a-further-perspective/,2022-11-16
DeSantis Is the Only Person Who Can Beat Trump. His Time Is Now. - The American Spectator,"Timing is everything in politics. There is a virtual graveyard of political figures who either peaked too early or entered races too late. In another time and place, the outcome for these candidates may have been different.

The midterms left no doubt in observers’ minds that Gov. Ron DeSantis is now a shining star. He is a star not just among Republicans, but among all politicians. Even Democrats gaze with envy at the political successes — and 19-percentage-point victory margin — of Ron DeSantis. But stardom like this is rarely enduring, and DeSantis should run for president in 2024 while his star remains bright — even if that means primarying Trump.

Donald Trump’s star has assuredly faded. It’s not just the distractions of endless scandals, the Jan. 6 hearings, and the Mar-a-Lago raid that have diminished his potential as a candidate who could win in 2024. Now, it’s actual performance — the only thing that matters. Over the past year, Trump has expended tremendous political capital. He endorsed over 300 candidates, held 30 rallies, and raised tens of millions of dollars. But the results were largely a bust. Trump’s lackluster midterm performance is a harbinger of what would happen if he were the nominee in 2024.

Doubts about Trump’s 2024 general election electability have been quietly brewing for months in the backrooms where political elites gather for whiskey and cigars. Yet, up until now, Republicans have been hesitant to turn against Trump. Like kids afraid of a schoolyard bully, no one wanted to be a target of Trump’s vengeful wrath or earn themselves a new nickname. But last Tuesday changed that. A full-fledged coup of sorts may now be taking place in the Republican Party.

DeSantis’ 19-percentage-point margin of victory was a feat considering that Florida has long been a swing state and has a nearly even number of registered Democrats and Republicans. For a win of this epic magnitude, DeSantis had to garner the support of independents and people who traditionally don’t vote for Republicans, such as minorities and educated elites. The governor even flipped solidly blue Miami-Dade County. This is precisely what Republicans need in 2024.

Electing Trump in the 2024 primary will yield disastrous results in the general election. He cannot win the votes of non-MAGA voters, which will be essential to winning the general election, in the way that Ron DeSantis can. We saw this happen in many 2022 races, such as in Maryland, where Trump-endorsed Dan Cox practically handed the governorship back over to the Democrats because of his inability to attract unaffiliated voters and non-Trump Republicans. We must win the war, not the battle.

Some argue that DeSantis should wait and that primarying Trump would be political suicide. Yes — it would be a bloodbath for sure. Trump also has a cult-like following that DeSantis would need to break. But, ultimately, I believe DeSantis would prevail. Moreover, a more battle-hardened DeSantis would emerge on the other side of the fight. One that would undoubtedly be ready for the ultimate job.

If DeSantis chooses to wait it out and run in 2028, he risks joining the graveyard of political stars who missed their time. By 2028, his successful COVID policies will be old history, he will have lost the bully pulpit of his governorship, and there is the risk of new rising stars and more challenging Democratic opponents.

Trump has too much baggage, he is losing supporters, and even if he wins the primary, he will lose the 2024 general election. Voters will vote against Trump in another referendum, as they did in 2020 and in 2022 by proxy. Conversely, DeSantis is a popular, effective, and fearless executive with demonstrated success. He has Trump-like policies without the drama and can appeal to a wider electorate. When DeSantis gets votes, it’s not a referendum on his opponent. It’s an affirmation of his strong leadership skills and commonsense policies.

DeSantis is the only Republican who could run against Trump and win. Ron DeSantis is not just what the Republican Party needs right now — he’s what America needs. His time is now.

Donald Trump Should Enter Retirement - The American Spectator,"Those of us who favor free enterprise, limited government, property rights, and free trade can no longer support Donald Trump in his quest to win the presidency in 2024.

Full disclosure: In 2015, I set up two groups in support of Trump. One, Libertarians for Trump, garnered some 5,000 signatures. That’s not much, but it is significant for the very small libertarian community. The second, Scholars for Trump, which was limited to people with Ph.Ds. and other such advanced degrees, had about 250 sign-ons. We did this to obviate the charge that only rednecks, clutching their “guns and Bibles” in flyover country, would support this man.

Why our support for the Donald? It had little to do with him personally or public-policy-wise. Our main fear was that virago, Hillary. There are no absolutes in politics. Voting is always a relative matter. Trump would certainly be preferable to Godzilla. Imagine a Joe Biden who is not senile. The horror.

From a personal point of view, I was not all that put off by Trump’s obvious obnoxiousness. I’m from Brooklyn; he was raised in nearby Queens. With the exception of Staten Island, everyone in the Big Apple is personally detestable. No big deal then, and even now.

Why, then, turn against him at present? It is simple. There are now far better alternatives around. Within the Republican Party, there are Greg Abbott, Ted Cruz, Ron DeSantis, Josh Hawley, Larry Hogan, Asa Hutchinson, Rand Paul, Mike Pence, Mike Pompeo, Marco Rubio, Ben Sasse, Rick Scott, Tim Scott, Chris Sununu, and Glenn Youngkin. That’s quite a lineup. Who needs a blustering liar?

Then, too, his recent misbehavior has far surpassed mere personal obnoxiousness. I’m not talking about his lukewarm support for the “insurrection” of Jan. 6. He specifically said he wanted it to be “peaceful.” If that was a real attempt to take over the government by force, then the earth is flat. No, I’m horrified by Trump’s responsibility for the recent midterm election debacle; he supported candidates with loyalty to him over those with electability. Then, too, the timing of his recent announcement showed that he is not at all a team player. It was scheduled so as to take some of the wind out of Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker’s sails. And don’t get me started on how he ostensibly raised money for that man’s campaign and then fraudulently grabbed off quite a bit of it for himself.

Probably, senile old war horse Joe Biden will not garner his party’s presidential nomination. A younger person, with fewer faux pas in his past, likely will. That candidate will pulverize Trump, if Trump ever gets so far. A large part of the conservative vote is still under the influence of Trump derangement syndrome. None of the others mentioned above has anything like the negative baggage of this man. Moreover, it’s not clear that Trump would beat Biden in round two should that unlikely scenario ever come to pass.

Big mystery: why are Democrats so intent upon making it impossible for Trump to run in 2024? One would have thought that they would appreciate that as the Republican nominee, widely hated Trump would be just about the best guarantee of a Democratic victory. Perhaps their visceral hatred of this man outweighs their more usual focus on power. They have launched at him more lawsuits than you can shake a stick at; success in any one or a few of them would preclude any candidacy of his in 2024. Perhaps they are playing the long game: they plan to delay putting him in jail until after the 2024 election.

One further bit of unasked-for advice to the GOP: be NICE to the Donald. Adopt Ronald Reagan’s 11th commandment: speak no ill of any other Republican. Of course, Trump will not adhere to any such principle. Oh, no, for him, there will be name-calling galore. Why respond to nastiness with sweetness? Trump is in a position to upset the entire apple cart. If he wins the Republican nomination, he will almost certainly lose in the general election of 2024, assuming neither Biden nor Harris runs against him, given the enmity many conservatives have for him. But if he does not come away with the nomination, and feels cheated by this process, he can start a third party and practically guarantee a Democratic victory. That is why the other GOP candidates must be cordial to him. If enough MAGA-ites appreciate this, that will likely put any third-party effort to rest.

We cannot finish without engaging in this process ourselves. We hereby acknowledge and thank Trump for his positive contributions: the Supreme Court and other judicial nominations; holding the line on taxes, inflation, and business regulation; and his contribution to the Abraham Accords. Many would add his border policy. We should all wish him well in his retirement, provided he does not continue to undermine all the good he has accomplished. Some people just don’t know when to say goodbye.

Trump’s Claims About Pro-Life Politicians Fail to Impress",https://spectator.org/category/politics/biden-watch/,2023-01-20
FBI Uses Phony Photo to Try and Frame Trump - The American Spectator,"A personal note: I know former President Donald Trump. I have been privileged to visit him over the years in his Trump Tower office and residence before he was president. Later, I visited him in the Oval Office while he was president, along with my American Spectator colleagues Bob Tyrrell and Wlady Pleszczynski. While there, the president took us back to the inner recesses of two smaller rooms that provide the president of the moment with more private office space.

Fact: The former president is what is called in the vernacular a “neatnik.” I’m one as well, and the precise, literal dictionary definition is “a person who is compulsively neat.”

And “neatnik” perfectly describes Trump.

Which brings us to that now-infamous photo published by the FBI of classified documents at Mar-a-Largo — the documents spread willy-nilly all over the floor.

Hello? Hello?

There is no way Trump would have real-estate brochures or family photos spread around on the floor of his various offices, let alone classified documents that had been declassified. Never, say again never, in all my visits in various places was anything remotely out of place.

Which is to say that this photograph looks like a deliberate attempt to frame Trump for something he would never do in a thousand years even if he had never been president. Trump himself has insisted, “They dropped them, not me — Very deceiving.”

So, if true, the obvious question? Who specifically in the FBI removed those documents from whatever container they were in and willfully — deliberately — spread them all over the floor in Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, taking a photograph to deliberately mislead the public? Something that in and of itself would be surely a violation of security procedures if not of federal law.

In fact, how were these documents handled by the FBI? Were the FBI agents wearing gloves as they handled them? If not, look to this information, supplied by the FBI itself on the official FBI website. The headline:

All About Fingerprints Fingerprints vary from person to person (even identical twins have different prints) and don’t change over time. As a result, they are an effective way of identifying fugitives and helping to prove both guilt and innocence.

Got it. So, it shouldn’t be hard for the bureau to identify the fingerprints on these documents and inform the American people just who in their Trump-raiding posse appears to have mishandled classified information and have tried to frame a former president with a phony, staged photograph.

This phony photograph really is just one more piece of evidence suggesting that the FBI has deliberately, willfully tossed aside the immense respect Americans once had for this once-great law-enforcement institution. Whether it was the anti-Trump shenanigans of the now-disgraced former agent Peter Strzok; or the corruption of former Director James Comey and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe; or the just-revealed resignation of Timothy Thibault, an assistant special-agent-in-charge, over allegations that he “helped shield Hunter Biden from criminal investigations into his laptop and business dealings”; or, now, what appears to be an abysmally clumsy attempt to use a faked photograph to frame Trump — the FBI is in serious trouble. And, assuming there is a Republican House majority after the midterm elections, the bureau should be investigated from top to bottom.

Bottom line?

Anybody who knows Donald Trump and has been privileged to spend time with him in various Trump domains knows that this photograph of classified documents spread helter-skelter on the floor looks like nothing more than a quite deliberate falsehood — a photographic lie designed to frame him with a manufactured, blatant untruth.

And the American people have a right to know exactly who did this.

Not to mention what their punishment will be.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/constitution-law/,2022-09-02
House Jan. 6 Report Exposes That Trump Only Cares About Himself — And Not His Supporters - The American Spectator,"Donald Trump is counting on the fact that most Americans aren’t reading the House Jan. 6 report — I am an exception — and don’t really care what’s in it.

The four criminal charges the committee recommended in 845 pages — obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make a false statement, and assisting an insurrection — don’t capture the chaos that led to this moment.

Of course, every American charged with a crime should be presumed innocent in a court of law. And yet I’m not the only Trump critic who wonders if the feds should not prosecute the 45th president because it would put the former president front and center when fans and haters alike are ready for him to fade away.

Here’s what I learned from the report, which I should note was produced by an overwhelmingly Democratic committee joined by outgoing Reps. Liz Cheney, R-Wy., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill.

Trump knew he lost, but he repeated The Big Lie anyway.

The base believes Trump won in 2020 in part because the base thinks that Trump believes he won in 2020. The report documents the many times that Trump was informed that his claims of fraud were bogus, but he repeated them anyway.

For example, Trump signed “a knowingly false representation” to a federal court in a case involving Georgia, wrote U.S. District Court Judge David Carter.

“I have no doubt that an aggressive DA or US Atty someplace will go after both the president and his lawyers once all the dust settles on this,” wrote Trump lawyer John Eastman.

“The emails show that President Trump knew that specific numbers of voter fraud were wrong,” wrote Carter, “but continued to tout those numbers, both in court and in public.”

Trump made fun of his most stalwart defenders.

Former aide Hope Hicks told the committee that Trump was skeptical when his credibility-challenged attorneys claimed “massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba, and likely China” in the U.S. elections. Later, as he talked with Powell, who had linked Dominion voting machines to Venezuela, he muted the phone so that he could say of Powell’s remarks, “This does sound crazy, doesn’t it?”

Trump’s zaniest and crummiest lawyers knew that Trump lost.

Don’t feel too bad for Powell. Her legal team responded to a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion with the argument that reasonable people would not accept her statements “as fact but view them only as claims that await testing by the courts through the adversary process.”

Crazy-car attorney John Eastman, the report noted, “all but admitted that (his plan) didn’t work” and likely would fail 9–0 if before the Supreme Court.

Team Normal outnumbered the Clown Car.

“Team Normal” was the phrase former campaign manager Bill Stepien used to distinguish professional aides from the Trump “Clown Car” — a phrase created by former Attorney General Bill Barr. As Trump continued to push his Big Lie, Team Normal — Barr, Stepien — stepped back and the Clown Car took the lead.

A former Trump official told New York Magazine’s Olivia Nuzzi, “There were always weird people around him, but the more normal people disappeared, and all he’s surrounded by are the cuckoo birds.”

I covered the Trump White House. I know that most staffers were normal people.

As Trump was trying to push DOJ lawyers to act against their instincts and put a sycophant at the helm, department lawyers threatened to quit and leave the department a “graveyard.”

Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue told Trump, “Mr. President, these aren’t bureaucratic leftovers from another administration. You picked them. This is your leadership team. And what happens if, within 48 hours, we have hundreds of resignations from your Justice Department because of your actions?”

In the end, Trump had to give up the fight to avert a mass walkout.

But first the likes of “body man” — read: nonlawyer — John McEntee wrote a one-pager that argued that the vice president “has substantial discretion to address issues with the electoral process.”

It was inevitable.

As someone who covered the Trump White House for all four years, I am struck by all the many one-time staffers who refused to parrot the Big Lie. For the most part, their names aren’t well-known outside the Beltway, but they started out with enthusiasm, rooted for the boss to win in 2020, and probably never thought the day would come when the Trump base would dismiss them as traitors and RINOs. And yet Trump’s insistence on pulling everyone behind his Big Lie brought them to this moment.

After Jan. 6, 2021, the love was gone. When I visited the White House, the press office was a ghost town. In the lower press office — a once bustling hub of young aides with promising futures before them — desks were empty. Likewise, the more prestigious upper press office had become a cavern.

Katrina Pierson captured the turn of events when she texted campaign bigfoot-lookalike Brad Parscale after he claimed to be shocked that a woman died during the Jan. 6 insurrection.

Pierson responded, “You do realize this was going to happen.”

Ignore the guy in the Viking hat.

Mark Corallo, a public relations consultant who worked in the Justice Department under Republican Attorney General John Ashcroft, told me that he didn’t read the report and considered the exercise “grossly partisan.”

“I have a great idea,” Corallo said of Trump, “ignore the dude.”

“He’s never going to be president again,” said Corallo, “and the more we talk about him, the more life we give him.”

Corallo argued, “The guy in the Viking Hat” — that would be Jacob Chansley, who also was carrying a six-foot spear and was sentenced to 41 months in prison — “was not going to overthrow the United States government.” The U.S. military never would let that occur, he said confidently.

I’m not as sanguine about what might have been. Then-Vice President Mike Pence spent hours in the Capitol loading dock as the crazies stormed the Capitol. He refused Secret Service entreaties to get into a car because he feared agents would ignore his orders — he wanted to stay on the premises so that he could certify the electors’ vote — so they could move him, his wife, Karen, and daughter, Charlotte, out of harm’s way.

Trump was safe in the West Wing, slamming Pence for lacking “courage” while Pence stayed in the same building where a hopped-up mob wanted to destroy him.

Pence stayed so that he could recognize state electors on Jan. 6. (It turns out that the vote was not completed until the wee hours of Jan. 7.)

I cannot help but wonder: what would have happened if the vice president’s motorcade had left the Capitol? Would a Pence exit have been seen as a green light for the faithful to storm what they saw as America’s Bastille?

So while I understand the instinct to cross one’s fingers and hope Trump simply fades away, I say: Never forget.

As one Trump Georgia campaign official said afterward, he felt “angry” because “no one really cared if — if people were potentially putting themselves in jeopardy.” We were just “useful idiots or rubes at that point.”

Let my people in.

As for Trump, he showed his usual disregard for those around him when he tried to persuade the Secret Service to allow supporters who might be armed onto the Capitol Mall after he urged the crowd to “fight like hell” as he pointed toward the Dome.

One-time Special Assistant to the President Cassidy Hutchinson testified that Trump told agents, “I don’t f**ing care that they have weapons. They’re not here to hurt me. Take the f**ing (magnetometers) away. Let my people in.”

In a disaster movie, Trump would be the character who claws between mothers and children for a seat on the lifeboat.

2017 All Over Again

When Trump first assumed office, I naively waited for the moment when the billionaire would realize the awesome responsibility of the presidency and calibrate his behavior accordingly. I hoped that America would see the president who delivered a strong first State of the Union address to atone for his “American carnage” inaugural address.

That hope was dashed in May 2017. After Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, his press team maintained that Trump fired Comey based on a recommendation by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein based on Comey’s public mishandling of an FBI probe into Hillary Clinton’s emails.

Within days, Trump told a different story when he told NBC News’ Lester Holt that he was going to fire Comey regardless of what the DOJ recommended.

The moment revealed that Trump was ready to destroy the meticulously groomed reputations of his appointees for a fleeting moment’s satisfaction. To spend time in Trump’s orbit is to feel used up and kicked to the curb.

Trump gratuitously jabbed other public servants for just doing their jobs. Trump and Giuliani wrongly accused Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Wandrea “Shaye” Moss by name of tampering with the vote count. The asymmetry of the situation was breathtaking — the most powerful man in the world used his position to target two African-American election workers who had to go into hiding because of the president’s gratuitous lies.

If there’s one victory Trump can claim, it is destroying public faith in the election system. A September Monmouth University poll found that nearly a third of Americans — including six out of 10 Republicans — believe Joe Biden won the election because of fraud.

Evidence? Giuliani famously said, “We’ve got lots of theories, we just don’t have the evidence.”

Barr called the phenomenon “Whac-A-Mole” — with Trump claiming fraud or abuse in one state one day, then averting attention to another venue the next, with no public resolution. Trump’s cascading charges didn’t need proof, they only needed to sow doubt.

In the years since 2000, when then-Vice President Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College, states have developed multiple strategies to make voting more convenient. Think early voting, automatic registration, and ballot harvesting. The sad result may be that more people think Biden won due to foul play.

And Biden’s not the guy who told Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, “I just want to find 11,780 votes.” That was Trump talking.

Official Election Defense Fund, Not

The Big Lie has paid dividends for Trump. For a while, the Republican National Committee sent out fundraising letters that were not fact-checked to raise dollars ostensibly to fund Trump’s legal challenges. The RNC had three of its largest 2020 fundraising days right after the election, for the “Official Election Defense Fund,” which the report notes wasn’t an official election defense fund.

The effort raised some $250 million after Trump lost. Trump must be laughing all the way to the bank.

Some 842 Americans have faced federal charges for illegally taking part in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Many will end up behind bars, yet the former president who urged them on is a free man, safely ensconced in Mar-a-Lago, and raising buckets of money to bankroll his grift. He also is running for president. It just doesn’t seem fair — because it isn’t.

Letitia James’ Campaign Strategy: Suing Trump - The American Spectator,"New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a civil suit against former President Donald Trump and three of his children on Wednesday. Thank goodness her solving New York’s crime problem allows Ms. James to devote resources to civil matters.

She seeks both a “minimum” of $250 million and sanctions that bar the defendants from acquiring real estate in New York, serving as an officer for any corporation there, and applying for loans in the Empire State. It seems harsh but, then again, so does the melodramatic Ms. James.

Political opponents in El Salvador, Honduras, Colombia, Panama, Nicaragua, and Mexico, countries also facing terrible crime and myriad economic problems at the time, legally pursued former presidents as James does now. This finds no precedent in American history. But among banana republics, the justice system being wielded as politics by other means comes as the price of entering the arena.

James fulfilled a campaign promise on Wednesday in filing suit against Trump.

“I’m running for attorney general because I will never be afraid to challenge this illegitimate president when our fundamental rights are at stake,” she explained in a video promoting her campaign ahead of the 2018 Democratic primary.

Four years later, James, either unable to obtain or unwilling to pursue a criminal indictment, has filed a civil suit against the former president.

“He should be charged with obstructing justice,” James said in the 2018 video. “I believe that the president of these United States can be indicted for criminal offenses, and we would join with law enforcement and other attorneys general across this nation in removing this president from office.

“In addition to that, the office of attorney general will continue to follow the money because we believe he’s engaged in a pattern and practice of money laundering. Laundering the money from foreign governments here in New York State, and particularly related to his real estate holdings.”

James charged in her press conference that Trump and his children “violated several state criminal laws.” Then why sue him in civil court rather than try him in a criminal court?

James uses her position to target political enemies by civil suit, press conference, and news release. She displayed this modus operandi in declaring, in almost the exact words she used for Trump, that former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a man she had hoped to replace in Albany before poor polling dashed that dream, “violated multiple state and federal laws.” Then she cowered from prosecuting Cuomo for these supposed violations just as she now refuses to pursue a prosecution of Trump.

“The NRA is fraught with fraud and abuse,” James said, upon filing a lawsuit against the National Rifle Association, “which is why, today, we seek to dissolve the NRA, because no organization is above the law.”

James boasts of a “comprehensive three-year investigation,” obtaining “millions of pages of documents,” and hearing from “65 witnesses” during the Trump inquiry. When a public official commits those kinds of resources to an investigation that concludes with a civil suit — the kind of cases heard in Judge Hatchett, Judge Judy, and Judge Mathis — The Price Is Right’s sad horn blows in everybody’s ears.

James on Wednesday rejected the notion “that this is part of a witch hunt,” and over the summer she insisted of her investigations, “This has nothing to do with politics…. It has to do with the law.”

But polling from last week shows that the incumbent attorney general is trailing her Republican challenger by a point and, more troubling for her reelection campaign, receiving just 43 percent of the vote. The fact that New Yorkers soured on her after witnessing and feeling the consequences of another of her campaign promises — ending cash bail — does not surprise.

When James found herself in a tough Democratic primary in 2018, she started saying “Trump” the way other people use “the” and “is.” Four years later, trailing her Republican opponent, she again invokes Trump, Trump, Trump.

James concluded her prepared remarks on Wednesday by characterizing her suit as “making good” on a “promise.”

For so many familiar with her rhetoric in the 2018 election, the promise kept seems like her Third Worldish pledge to pursue a political enemy.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/deep-state/,2022-09-22
"McCarthy’s Win Was a Trump Victory, and the Media Can’t Stand It - The American Spectator","Newly elected Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy was crystal clear after his 15-ballot election win. National Review reported:

“I do want to especially thank President Trump,” McCarthy told reporters. “I don’t think anybody should doubt his influence. He was with me from the beginning … he was all in.” “He would call me, and he would call others. He really was — I was just talking to him tonight — helping get those final votes,” McCarthy said. “What he’s really saying, really, for the party and the country, that we have to come together. We have to focus on the economy. We’ve got to focus, make our borders secure. We gotta do so much work to do, and he was a great influence to make that all happen. So, thank you President Trump.”

McCarthy could not have been clearer. Former President Donald Trump went out of his way to campaign for McCarthy — and it worked. McCarthy won.

Trump triumphed.

So where are the countless media reports that McCarthy himself is attributing his win to Trump? After all, if a Trump-backed candidate lost in 2022, the media and Trump critics were quick to pounce and blame the loss on Trump.

The obvious reason for the liberal media silence on Trump’s triumph is, of course, that the liberal media is not about reporting news. First, last, and always, they are about fake news — and targeting Trump.

Take this utterly laughable headline from the Huffington Post:

Trump Weighs In On Speaker Battle And Winds Up Proving His Weakness In The House, Too

Oops.

CNN gloated early on in the voting process:

McCarthy’s bet on Trump has yet to pay off as he scrambles for speaker’s gavel

Oops again.

Then there was this classic over at NBC News:

Trump’s endorsement proves worthless to Kevin McCarthy in his speaker bid

Really? Really? There aren’t enough washcloths in the NBC newsroom to wipe so much egg from the face of NBC’s peacock.

The real point here isn’t McCarthy. The real point here is that the media cannot help themselves when it comes to underestimating Trump. They did it repeatedly in 2016, then all throughout his presidency — and they are at it still. They never learn.

My favorite headline from 2016 came from this New York Times story that ran on election day:

Hillary Clinton has an 85% chance to win.

Riiiiiight.

The real question in all of this is how can supposedly sophisticated political observers get Trump wrong — and get him wrong repeatedly?

The answer is obvious. They let their left-wing politics — not to mention their obsessive Trump Derangement Syndrome — cloud their judgment. They live in a bubble, a bubble where colleagues, friends, and others share their TDS. And, tellingly, that obsession with Trump extends to his supporters, the millions of Americans who are routinely pictured in the left-wing media as a bunch of rubes, racists, and ignoramuses.

Once upon a time, way back there when Trump-style supporters were serious supporters of Democrat President Franklin Roosevelt, FDR would call them the “forgotten m[e]n.” Now, these “forgotten man” Americans are despised by far-left elites in the media.

As 2023 begins and the 2024 presidential election year rises on the horizon, it would do the media a world of good to spend some time taking stock of their reflexive Never Trumpism and its seriously bad influence on their resulting seriously bad judgment.

Will that happen? Of course not. They are too far gone.

And so, as Trump triumphs in McCarthy’s victory — a victory McCarthy himself is attributing to the former president — the media falls silent.

Of course.

Fact: Trump triumphed in the speaker’s race.

And Speaker McCarthy is the first to say so.

Which drives the fake news crazy.

"On Trump, Kanye, Biscuit, Jews, and Dinners - The American Spectator","I begin with certain definitions:

1. The Jew-hater formerly known as Kanye West now prefers to be called “Ye.” Therefore, for the duration of this article, I shall call him “Kanye.”

2. The White Supremacist, Holocaust-mocking Jew-hater who was ancillary to the unfortunate dinner at Mar-a-Lago has compared Jews murdered in the death camps to baked cookies. Therefore, for the duration of this article, I shall call him by the name “Biscuit.”

3. Donald John Trump is a Philosemite. You don’t hear that term often because not so many people, other than Bible Christians who believe that Genesis 12:3 is the Word of G-d, love Jews. But that’s what a Philosemite is: he or she loves Jews, even despite certain Jews (just as I do). “And I shall bless them that bless thee, and he that curseth thee shall I curse; and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.”

Now to business:

I do not know why Donald Trump loves Jews. Maybe because more than 90 percent of Orthodox Jews voted for him against both Hillary and Joe Biden. Maybe because his daughter is an Orthodox Jew. Maybe because Jared Kushner, his son-in-law whom he loves and trusts, is an Orthodox Jew. Maybe because Trump’s grandchildren are Orthodox Jews who observe the Shabbat according to its laws, eat strictly kosher, and attend yeshiva Jewish parochial school. Or — my personal theory — maybe because his father, Fred, who was one of the great Philosemites of the prior generation and who even donated property to a Jewish congregation for them to have a synagogue, taught young Donald that part of the Trump Family Legacy is to love Jews.

When others refused to hire Jews, Trump did. (1) He opened the restricted Mar-a-Lago private club to Blacks and Jews when he bought it. (2) He surrounded himself with honorable Jewish legal scholars and attorneys like David Friedman and Jason Greenblatt, and even a bum named Michael Cohen, whose kid’s bar mitzvah he attended. In Israel, Trump would be elected prime minister by a landslide. After nearly half a century of broken promises by other American presidents, (3) Trump formally declared and America recognized United Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. (4) He moved America’s Israel embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. (5) He recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. (6) He recognized the permanent legality of all Jewish communities and cities (ridiculously called “settlements”) in Judea and Samaria (falsely called the “West Bank”) as legal in all situations that Israel’s own courts regard them as legal. (7) He cut off hundreds of millions of dollars’ funding for the Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) illegal government in the Palestine Authority on grounds that they pay monthly stipends (“Pay to Slay”) to families of Arab terrorists who murder Jews or otherwise perpetrate acts of terror. (8) He closed down the Palestine Liberation Organization office in Washington, D.C., (9) closed down America’s long-standing “Palestine” consulate in Jerusalem, (10) pulled the United States out of the anti-Semitic U.N. Human Rights Council, (11) cut off $300 million in funding that America had been sending to the Jew-hating UNRWA, a Jew-hating United Nations agency that runs schools in places like Gaza where Arab Muslim children are taught to hate Jews and to murder Jews; (12) appointed a U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, who warned anti-Israel countries that “We’re taking down names”; (13) commuted the anti-Semitic Iowa prison sentence of Sholom Rubashkin, (14) almost unilaterally brought about the Abraham Accords that induced several leading Arab Muslim countries for the first time to enter into true peace agreements with Israel without Israel ceding an inch of Jewish territory in Judea and Samaria. (15) His Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, endorsed yeshiva education during visits to two yeshivas in a New York City trip while skipping visiting the city’s public schools. Moreover, (16) Trump issued an executive order on combating anti-Semitism to enhance enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, to protect Jewish college students from the overt Jew-hatred now rampant on so many American campuses, and (17) he named Kenneth Marcus as Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the Department of Education to investigate anti-Semitic episodes at campuses like Rutgers in New Jersey. (18) Trump deported the last Nazi war criminal known to be hiding in America, (19) signed into law a bill making it easier for Holocaust victims to reclaim stolen property, (20) ended the disastrous Iran deal and implemented crushing sanctions against Iran, (21) signed the Taylor Force Act, (22) knocked off Qassem Soleimani, (23) rubbed out Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, (24) shattered State Department policy by authorizing Americans born in Jerusalem to list Israel on their American passports as their country of birth, (25) imposed sanctions on the International Criminal Court for unfairly and illegally investigating Israel, and (26) said at his 2019 State of the Union address “We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.”

That is the definition of a lifelong Philosemite. Copy and paste the above paragraph, and email it or post it or re-tweet it to anyone who does not already know that Trump and his father were and are lifelong Philosemites, friends and admirers of Jews. Not to mention Ivanka and his grandkids.

But the left-wing news media say otherwise? Since when can we trust ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times, and the Washington Post? The New York Times, run by self-hating Jews who lean over backward to prove they are “neutral” on Jewish matters, covered up the Holocaust (as they did the Holodomor) and opposed the creation of Israel. This is documented all over the place.

When Trump first sought the Republican nomination for president in 2016, the media fell over themselves trying to prove Trump anti-Jewish. They found an Absolute Nobody, an activist for homosexual rights in New Jersey who very briefly was spokesman for an insignificant group named for the very significant Anne Frank, to go on CNN and other TV stations and be quoted in the New York Times for equating Trump with anti-Semitism. They twisted every possible Trump quote and gesture to have hidden meanings that only they could divine. It was like their obscene equating of Laura Ingraham with Nazism by showing a photo of her waving to an audience at the 2016 Republican convention, capturing a split second of the wave to make it look like a “Sieg Heil” Hitler salute.

It is a game of “Gotcha!” You say you are not an anti-Semite, so we will hire people whose job description will be to follow you, investigate you, and magnify-glass you until they can find their proof. And then, ah blessed Charlottesville! Take a pin-pointed picture of despicable White Supremacists and neo-Nazi-wannabes amid a hugely larger crowd of demonstrators seeking to deter the tearing down of historic monuments dedicated to heroes who fought for Virginia a century earlier, then catch Trump saying there were good people on both sides — because there were — and … Gotcha! Just a bit of editing and clipping, and it can be distorted to seem he was saying the Nazis were the good people to whom he was referring.

Lies. Damned lies. And more damned lies.

OK. So, uh, what was that quiet private Mar-a-Lago dinner with Kanye and Biscuit about?

I begin with a verse from First Samuel 15:17 when the prophet Shmuel (Samuel) confronted King Sha’ul (Saul) for not having fulfilled G-d’s command to eradicate the Amalekites. Sha’ul explained that he spared certain sheep, cattle, and Amalekite King Agag to accommodate the demands of the common people, and Shmuel said to him: “Although you may be insignificant in your own eyes, you are the head of the tribes of Israel, and G-d anointed you to be king of Israel.” In other words, your exalted position does not afford you the luxury to show compassion and sensitivity to embodiments of evil. If you wanted that flexibility to dine with Agag over Amalekite filet mignon and lamb chops, you should have stuck to building hotels and skating rinks in Bethlehem and Ḥevron, and golf courses and casinos in Shiloh and Bethel. But you became King of Israel. That changed your rules of engagement, whether you like it or not.

I understand why Trump agreed to meet with Kanye. Trump is running for President in 2024, and he benefits by maintaining an open line of communication with that mental case because Kanye potentially might split off votes from some Black Trump voters. But, if he had to meet with Kanye, Trump should have done it by inviting Kanye to a mano a mano working lunch in his private office behind closed doors. Frankly, since Kanye is a certified nut — a meshuggeneh — the better part of wisdom would have been (and would be, going forward) to steer clear of Kanye, and let him further self-destruct over the next two years until he hangs himself with laces from a pair of Yeezy sneakers.

Just sayin’.

In any event, Trump should not be meeting with the likes of Biscuit. I believe Trump a million percent when he says he didn’t know Biscuit or what that oddball stands for or against. I believe it because one of the most worldly and well-informed colleagues in my inner orbit of rabbinic leaders recently wrote me, off the record, to ask me whether I ever had heard of Biscuit and, if so, could I fill him in on who the fool is. So I did.

If that rabbi, a leading expert on identifying and responding to American anti-Semitism, never had heard of Biscuit, it is totally believable Trump did not either. Moreover, I ask myself (as every human being, and also every “Gotcha!” journalist, should): If I invite John Doe, whom I already know, to dinner, and Doe unexpectedly shows up with a guy he identifies as his friend Richard Roe — and it all catches me by surprise — what in the world am I realistically expected to do? Throw out the guy? I don’t even know who he is. No, I have to grit my teeth, maybe utter some imprecations under my breath, and then smile and ask the waiter to set up another place setting.

I challenge any other person, under oath and on a lie detector, to say he or she would do otherwise. I have seen uninvited people show up at family Thanksgiving dinners, brought by moronic family members who never thought to ask first. No one throws out such people. Rather, you set up an extra place setting, and next year you do not invite the family moron either. That was Trump’s dilemma with Biscuit.

Where Trump runs into trouble here is in two ways:

1. He has so much self-confidence in his own judgment and smarts, and so much distrust of others’ advice, that he leaves himself bereft of insightful advisors whom he truly can trust. For example, he trusted Paul Ryan on budgeting to build the wall, and look what happened. He trusted Rex Tillerson on foreign policy and “Mad Dog” on defense, and look where that got him. And that screwy Omarosa. Nevertheless, he needs to understand that, as President who was and who seeks to be again, he needs two or three people to advise him, to vet interlopers. I am not available because I am recovering from a lung transplant. My dear friend, Steve, would be great, but he recently moved to Israel. Ted Cruz is busy in the Senate watching McConnell, DeSantis is busy coloring Florida red and kicking the mouse’s patoot(ie) out of whoever now is running Disney. Maybe Mike Huckabee. Or my TAS colleague Jeffrey Lord. Or Ben Stein, another TAS colleague. Or Wlady. I also would love to see Steve Bannon back. But Trump needs a second opinion, just as we all do when we go to a doctor for a second opinion after we get a diagnosis (and the doctor says: “You want a second opinion? OK. You are ugly, too”). Had I been there, I would have told Trump: “Kanye is seriously mentally disturbed; just ask Taylor Swift. You cannot make a deal with him or even trust what he will tweet about a meeting. Stay away from him, or at least limit your time to a 15-minute closed-door working lunch. Bring plenty of hand sanitizer, and have a food taster present before you bite.” Then, when Biscuit showed up, I would have been at the next room or table and would have escorted Biscuit to my table — to get him away from Trump — if I did not recognize him. No way would I let him near my president without proper vetting. This is not voting in Arizona. Like, howzabout some I.D.? And since I would happen to be a good advisor, I would recognize Biscuit by name if not by face and have him escorted out of the building pronto. As a friendly gesture, I would give him a kosher-certified cookie on the way out, certified by Israel’s new Minister of Internal Security, the Hon. Itamar Ben-Gvir, every neo-Nazi-wannabe’s cookie monster.

2. Trump believes, as a guiding principle of business success, that he must never publicly apologize or acknowledge a possible misstep. This guiding principle is what Shakespeare professors call a “tragic flaw.” I remember an episode of The Apprentice where Trump unloaded a “You’re Fired!” on a guy who decently volunteered to share blame with someone else. Trump busted him because he believes a successful executive never sticks out his neck to acknowledge partial fault. This belief is tragic. For example, all he had to do after the Kanye-Biscuit dinner brouhaha was to tweet as follows:

“I despise anti-Semitism, and I despise anti-Semites. I told Kanye that, when he attacks Jews, he is attacking my Ivanka and my grandchildren, so he is attacking me. Either he retreats publicly — and fast — or he is permanently out of my orbit. I am disgusted to learn who [Biscuit] is and what [Biscuit] has said about the Holocaust and about Jews like my grandchildren. I am disgusted that Kanye associates with [Biscuit]. I have given orders today to have [Biscuit’s] photo posted in all my buildings because he is to be thrown out immediately if he ever shows up at any hotel, casino, or golf course of mine. And I will immediately fire any manager of a Trump property who fails to throw [Biscuit] out on his rump.”

That’s all Trump needs:

1. To have two or three trusted advisors he can consult when sticky situations arise;

2. The ability to acknowledge a misstep rapidly, without enabling his “Gotcha!” haters to pile on for days and weeks;

3. The gumption to tweet a no-holds-barred 128-word tweet like the one above.

Republicans Are Missing the Point of Trump — Again - The American Spectator,"“It is rational to attack the police; nay, it is glorious. But the modern critics of religious authority are like men who should attack the police without ever having heard of burglars.”

— G.K. Chesterton, Orthodoxy

Casting about for someone to hold accountable after Republicans performed below expectations in the midterm elections, many Republicans offered a simple solution: Blame Trump.

“Trump stopped the wave,” said Jim Durkin, Illinois state House GOP leader.

“With regards to the governor’s office, there’s no way in a red year a candidate should lose by double digits…. And that really speaks to how poor our candidates were and how much Trump interfered in our primary process,” Pennsylvania Republican consultant David La Torre said.

“I think Trump’s kind of a drag on our ticket…. I think Donald Trump gives us problems, politically,” former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan opined.

The sentiment has been echoed across the country. But this blithe dismissal of Donald Trump — and, by proxy, millions of Trump supporters — is misguided. To borrow Chesterton’s metaphor, Republicans are attacking the Trump police without ever having heard of the liberal authoritarian burglars that he was largely elected to stop.

We’ve seen this movie before. Rewind back to 2016. Mainstream Republicans back then didn’t like Trump either. So why did he win both the Republican nomination and the presidency? It’s actually not that complicated: People were tired of woke bullies bossing them about, and Donald Trump stood up to those bullies. He said he’d stand up to China even though people called him a racist for it. Trump said he’d stem the flow of immigration from Mexico, and he was roundly criticized. But he didn’t back down from the liberal media that relentlessly attacked him. Trump kept speaking his mind. In contrast, Establishment Republicans largely forgot about the lower middle class affected by these policies. Trump spoke to the forgotten class — spoke for them.

And it wasn’t just the lower middle class. There were plenty of people who were tired of the varied left-wing bullies in their world. For example, I and my colleagues ran a study right before the general election in 2016 where we randomly assigned some people to a “woke/political correctness” prime. The prime wasn’t especially overwhelming: Participants in that condition simply read a brief statement explaining PC norms and filled out a four-item questionnaire about political correctness. Without the prime, our left-leaning sample went for Clinton. But simply having people briefly answer questions about political correctness caused a significant shift towards Trump, so much so that it almost wiped out Clinton’s lead among an otherwise left-leaning group of people. Why? Making people think about wokeness made them long for freedom from wokeness, from liberal bullies, and, well, Trump was their anti-authoritarian champion. He was the person who stood up to the bullies on their behalf. Trump at least wasn’t afraid of those bullies — like much of the Republican Party seemed afraid of them.

Polling data from 2015/2016 confirm this. People often didn’t like what Trump said, but they liked that he wasn’t afraid to say it. In fact, the best predictor of Trump support in one poll wasn’t all the things people often think of — age, race, anti-immigration attitudes — it was “feeling voiceless.” Trump was their voice.

These reasons are even more important today. And if Republicans want to win moving forward, they need to better understand this fact. They need to more fully “get” Trump voters. They need to understand the metaphorical Trump police and the authoritarian burglars.

While of course many Republicans besides Trump have since stood up to woke bullies successfully — and with less offensive language — I worry that quite a few Establishment Republicans are still missing the point. Consider these comments made by Morgan Boyd, a Republican official in western Pennsylvania: “It’s time for [Trump] to pass the torch to more mainstream, traditional Republican candidates.”

There will be many people who hear these comments and respond: “You mean those traditional candidates who trashed the Tea Party and sneered at the lower-middle-class voters Trump brought into the GOP? You mean those traditional Republican presidential candidates (like Mitt Romney, who lost Pennsylvania by over 5 percentage points in 2012) who had lost Pennsylvania elections for 24 straight years — until Trump won the state in 2016?”

As a result, instead of trashing Trump, Republicans should instead attempt to fully understand his appeal. Brit Hume said on Fox News that Republicans’ problem is now to find a way to “work around” Trump. I’ve no end of respect for Hume, but I could not disagree more. That is the Republican mindset that implicitly dismisses the legitimate concerns that Trump addressed. You want to work around all the people who Trump brought to the party? You want to work around all the lower-middle-class people you ignored — but Trump didn’t? You want to work around all the political independents who didn’t often vote for traditional Republicans — but did vote for Trump?

No, you simply can’t work around them. You have to show them that, although you are moving past Trump, you are capturing Trumpism. You have to embrace the populist movement that appealed to freedom-loving people everywhere. You have to realize that there are a lot of people like me, who didn’t vote for Trump or who didn’t like him, but who nonetheless liked what he did for the country. To many of us, traditional Republicans supported the uber-rich and ignored the fact that their own constituents have to fear what they say at work or else be fired for merely expressing a political opinion that their colleagues don’t like. Establishment Republicans didn’t seem to do much for them — but Trump sure as heck did. Maybe we were wrong about Establishment Republicans, but it often feels as though they don’t seem to like the person who did the most for those bullied people. Comments like those discussed in this article solidify this feeling — and will ultimately make it harder for Republicans to keep many of the people Trump brought to the party.

So, yes, of course the fact that Trump raised questions about the legitimacy of elections hurt the GOP in the midterms. Trump’s opinion on that issue was a loser from the start, and it is still a loser today. Indeed, the midterms suggested that more Americans agreed with me about election security than I realized. They are tired of the whole “stolen election” talk on both sides of the aisle. Note that famous liberal election delegitimizer Stacey Abrams was roundly crushed in the midterms as well. Americans essentially said, to both parties, “Enough with all the election-questioning stuff.” (Maybe election skeptic Hillary Clinton should take note, too, if she really wants to make another run at the presidency.)

But while analyzing the effect of Trump’s statements on election legitimacy is of course reasonable, if Republicans think they can just pretend that “OK, that didn’t happen” with Trump and “work around” him — they will have another thing coming.

There obviously is a path forward here. Gov. Ron DeSantis won big in Florida and captured quite a lot of the Trump vote by embracing many of the same Trump policies without as much of the accompanying Trumpy baggage. Indeed, this and other similar conservative wins help instantiate this piece’s key lesson for Republicans throughout the country: This time, as Republicans wrestle with the issues posed by another Trump run at the presidency, they should remember that — for all his flaws — the former president spoke for a lot of average people tired of the bullies throwing them under the bus. I am one of those people, and, unless Republicans plan to stand up to those same bullies with equal force, unless they convince us that their politicians care about the same things we do, they are going to lose a lot of votes in the other direction in 2024. This should be at the front of every Republican’s mind in places like Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, and Wisconsin. For many of us, we are tired of COVID lockdowns and masks and mandates and cancel culture and anti-science green-energy cults and (above all) the erosion of free speech in this country. We want to wake up in a free society, not this increasingly authoritarian dystopia that we find ourselves in.

Trump blasted many of those metaphorical burglars with loud trumpets. I can only hope “traditional” Republicans are listening.

The Squad Is Way More Anti-Semitic Than Trump’s Dinner With Ye - The American Spectator,"Donald Trump’s dinner last month at Mar-a-Lago with the vile Kanye West, now legally known as “Ye,” and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes has thrust the conversation surrounding anti-Semitism into the national spotlight. Republican lawmakers correctly criticized the get-together, which by most accounts concluded in a heated exchange between Trump and West over the rapper suggesting that the former president join the presidential ticket as his running mate. For their part, Democrat denouncements over the affair included White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre affirming in a Nov. 28 press conference that “this administration, this President totally rejects bigotry, racism, antisemitism.” That same day, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) spoke on the Senate floor and condemned Trump’s decision to “meet with this antisemite.” The disturbing language used by West reflects the hateful ideology espoused by anti-Semitic Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who was featured in a suppressed 2005 photograph alongside a beaming then–Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, which surfaced following Obama’s presidency. Schumer’s curious omission of West from his statement marks cowardice in denouncing anti-Semitism if it conflicts with the progressives’ preferred white-nationalist narrative.

The evolving criticism over Trump’s unfortunate meeting highlights how liberals are successfully manipulating the dialogue involving anti-Semitism to distract from the Democrats’ embrace of progressive Jew-haters, with whom they frequently dine, praise, and elevate to influential government positions.

One day following Jean-Pierre’s comments, anti-Semitic “Squad” member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) tweeted her “delight to root for #TeamUSA” after attending the World Cup in Qatar, where she was part of a small delegation accompanying U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Omar currently serves as vice chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. The congresswoman, and a growing number of Democrats, display their hatred of Jews by attacking Israel. Omar recently cosponsored an anti-Israel House resolution, introduced by Democrat Rep. Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), that calls for the U.S. to use the term “Nakba,” defined as “catastrophe,” when discussing the creation of the state of Israel. It bears mentioning that New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman, another co-sponsor of the “Nakba” measure, received Schumer’s endorsement during the last election.

Blinken’s invitation to Omar was extended despite the congresswoman’s questionable associations with Qatari officials. In 2019, a witness confirmed to the Jerusalem Post that Omar was “recruited by a foreign government, received funding from a foreign government, and passed sensitive information through intermediaries to Iran.” Kuwait-born Canadian businessman Alan Bender made the allegations during a trial involving the Qatari emir’s brother. According to testimony, Omar was the “crown jewel” of U.S. politicians and used her position to recruit other like-minded lawmakers. Omar denied the accusations and predictably disparaged her detractors as “Islamophobes.” Employing a similar tactic, Omar is currently attempting to fend off House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy’s justified threat to fulfill his promise of removing her from the House Foreign Affairs Committee should he become the House majority leader.

Omar’s trip to Qatar underscores liberal comfort with promoting the political stature of anti-Semites. Serving as a portent of the party’s ideological intent, outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi posed with anti-Israel members of Congress, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Omar, on a 2019 Rolling Stone cover titled “Women Shaping the Future.” Last year, Omar equated the actions of the U.S. and Israel to that of terrorist groups like the Taliban. Her colleague Tlaib once called for the destruction of the world’s sole Jewish homeland in a since-deleted 2020 tweet. In 2021, President Joe Biden gushed over Tlaib while visiting Michigan and expressed his admiration for the lawmaker’s “intellect.”

The trafficking of anti-Semitism by Democrats is having a deleterious effect on U.S. policy toward Israel and Jewish Americans. As “moderate” congressional Democrats such as Ted Deutch retire, other policymakers, including New Jersey Rep. Josh Gottheimer, are increasingly sidelined. The controversial lobbying group J Street, which featured Blinken as its headliner this week, basked in its endorsements’ electoral success. It witnessed victories by candidates like Pennsylvania Rep.-elect Summer Lee, whose campaign received a boost following an October fundraiser held by her future Squad comrades. At universities, assaults against Jewish students occur under the anti-Zionist umbrella, with leftists leaving Jewish youth unwarrantedly exposed to its deceitful smearing of Israel as an “apartheid” state. The AMCHA Initiative, an organization investigating and combating campus anti-Semitism, revealed in its report this year that attacks involving Jewish identity on campus jumped 100 to 200 percent in the academic year following Israel’s 2021 war with Hamas. The study notes that the presence of Israel-hate groups on campus more than doubled the likelihood that a campus would play host to anti-Semitic activity.

Democrats’ dubious outrage over Trump’s behavior is evidenced by years of boosting anti-Semites into government echelons. The party’s underwriting of anti-Semitic politicians is a far more potent threat to U.S. Jews than one mistaken meal at Mar-a-Lago.

The Political War President — Trump Live From Ohio - The American Spectator,"Watching Donald Trump’s Ohio rally Saturday reminded me of the best scene in Gone With the Wind, which comes early in the movie at the Twelve Oakes barbecue. It’s a brilliantly constructed sequence wherein Scarlett O’Hara’s (Vivien Leigh) egoistical pursuit of Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) during the grand social occasion contrasts with the undercurrent of imminent Civil War. Except the Southern male aristocrats gathered in the Georgia mansion’s den don’t dread the war, they eagerly look forward to it. “Gentlemen can always fight better than rabble,” one of them crows. Scarlett’s father Gerald (Thomas Mitchell) then asks a more somber Ashley, the wartime troop captain, for his opinion. “Well, gentlemen,” says Ashley. “If Georgia fights, I go with her. But like my father, I hope the Yankees let us leave the Union in peace.” I can appreciate the sentiment. If Trump runs, and wins the Republican nomination, I go with him. But like many others, I hope he passes the “make America great again” baton to a younger warrior.

For I believe political and cultural war is now unavoidable. The other side has crossed the Rubicon. They’ve done more than insult us. They’ve threatened us. Joe Biden and his entire governmental apparatus — spearheaded by AG Merrick Garland’s Justice Department and SecDef Lloyd Austin’s Pentagon — have publicly condemned all patriotic, peaceful opposers to the Marxist transformation of our country as anti-democratic traitors.

And they have put their agents where their mouths are, raiding Trump’s home and intimidating MAGA supporters in true Stasi-like fashion. Now they must be made to pay for it, and so extremely that such a domestic menace will never resurface. This said, Trump’s Youngstown, Ohio speech was the finest, most defiant he has ever given, and the perfect response to Biden’s The Great Dictator screed in Philadelphia.

“I don’t think we’ve ever had a more radicalized or dangerous time in our country,” Trump said. “I watched Biden the other day with the red behind him — and CNN changed it to pink, because they wanted it to look better. But that was terrible, the terrible words that were said. But that’s where they’re coming from. But you know what? We’re strong and we’re smart. We’re smarter than them. We’re stronger than them. Our cruel and vindictive political class is not just coming after me. They’re coming after you through me. They’ve already taken away your vote. They’re taking away your voice. And now they want to take away your freedom. And it’s not going to happen.”

Trump delivered his oration with his typical humor that drives leftists insane. How can he be so flippant, they fume, when the walls are closing in? One reason could be the huge legal double victory Trump had Thursday over the same Garland DOJ that defiled his Mar-a-Lago home. Federal Judge Eileen Cannon not only ignored Justice’s demand she qualify her decision to appoint a Special Master on the FBI-seized documents or face appeal, she assigned the man the Trump team wanted for the job (Raymond Dearie).

Trump even had fun with the “deadly serious” January 6 Committee, calling it “the sham unselect committee.” “Which I thought ended a couple of weeks ago when Liz Cheney lost by a record number. Nobody has ever lost so big before.” That must have stuck in Cheney’s Trump-deranged, soon-to-be civilian craw.

However, Trump was deadly serious, unusually eloquent, and disturbingly accurate in his condemnation of the present statist tyranny: “They want to censor you from the internet, banish you from the public square, get you fired from your jobs, target you for destruction with 87,000 new IRS agents.… Use the FBI to spy on patriotic parents, and criminalize political dissent as if we were a Third World country. But the thugs and tyrants attacking our movement … have no idea of the sleeping giant they have awoken. The American people will never accept the corruption and the ruination of our beloved country.”

Ultimately, Trump hit a high note he had never reached before, in what may one day be known as the “We are a nation” speech, like Ronald Reagan’s 1964 endorsement of the doomed Barry Goldwater became the “A Time for Choosing” speech. Some excerpts from late in his remarks:

We are a nation that surrendered in Afghanistan, leaving behind dead soldiers, American citizens, and 85-billion dollars’ worth of the finest military equipment in the world. We are a nation that allowed Russia to devastate a country, Ukraine, killing hundreds of thousands of people. And it will only get worse. It would never have happened with me as your Commander-in-Chief.… We are a nation that has weaponized its law enforcement against the opposing political party like never ever before.… We are a nation that is allowing Iran to build a massive nuclear weapon, and China to use the trillions of dollars it has taken from us to build a military to rival our own.… And, perhaps more importantly, we are a nation that is no longer respected or listened to around the world.… A nation that is hostile to liberty, freedom, and faith.… We are a nation that has lost its confidence, willpower, and strength. We are a nation that has lost its way. But we are not going to let this continue. Two years ago, we were a great nation. And we will soon be a great nation again.

I’d still prefer Ron DeSantis to be the 2024 Republican presidential nominee. He’s just as tough as Trump yet fresher. But after watching the latter’s well-written and impressively delivered speech, I’m even more certain of one thing. If Trump runs, I go with him.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/nations-pulse/,2022-09-19
The Trumping of Benjamin Netanyahu - The American Spectator,"Political foes of Israel’s old/new Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seem to be borrowing a page from the American left’s playbook. They’ve mounted a worldwide campaign to portray him as a threat to democracy. Much as the threat and then the reality of civil disobedience and uncivil violence was raised against Donald Trump even before he was inaugurated, Netanyahu’s enemies raise the specter of a constitutional breakdown that they themselves organize.

The Israeli left, as the left in so many places, has used such tactics against their political opponents for a long time. The rightist Menachem Begin was portrayed relentlessly by the ruling socialists in the first decades of Israel’s independence as a dangerous revolutionary, and support of him put one beyond the pale — an early version of cancel culture.

The reality of Begin was decidedly different. When he was finally called to join the cabinet in the life and death situation when Israel stood isolated and without any ally against Egypt’s announced plan to wipe it out, Begin advocated making his nastiest political enemy the leader. In Begin’s selfless vision, that man, for all his faults, was a proven a dauntless war-time leader. And when Begin became prime minister about ten years later, he respected the constitutional norms scrupulously, showing the left’s calumnies to be just that. And Begin’s term finally verified Israel’s democratic credentials, much as Jefferson’s ascension did in 1801, showing that the nation was larger than one political faction.

Netanyahu’s position is different than Begin’s. There has been real choice in Israel ever since Begin, with the Right and the Left surging and ebbing in turn, as in all the other democracies. What he faces is a constitutional aberration sorely in need of correction — the slow usurpation by Israel’s judiciary of the supreme power of the state, power limited only by their own all-too-imperfect consciences.

There are some parallels to the establishment of meaningful power in the hands of America’s judiciary. Until John Marshall became Chief Justice, the courts were insignificant in comparison to the other two branches, where real political power was being exerted. It took Marshall’s genius to make the judiciary a co-equal partner in the Marbury decision, an enduring landmark in the progress of free constitutional government.

But Marshall worked with a written Constitution. And although Israel has written Basic Laws, they are more of an afterthought, not the incredibly well-thought-out structure of America’s Constitution.

For much of Israel’s governmental structure maintains continuity with British law, the law that ruled the Holy Land for the three decades preceding Israeli independence. Britain’s constitution is unwritten, and decisively rejected the idea of judicial review.

That rejection took place in the political ferment in the decades leading up to England’s Civil War. The great jurist, Justice Edward Coke, dared to challenge King James I by asserting that the law was supreme over kings as well as commoners. This was an old strain, introduced less pointedly by Fortescue in the late Middle Ages, and based by Fortescue on biblical precedent — even kings are answerable to G-d’s laws and any sovereign powers they have depend on their faithfulness to the Sovereign of Universe.

Coke’s brilliant scholarship and articulateness threatened not only the king, who neutralized his judicial power, but also left him without allies in Parliament, who did not care for his claim of judicial supremacy any more than did the king. Coke eventually joined forces with the parliamentarians and helped to bring about the great Petition of Right, marking the beginning of Parliament’s successful struggle to become the supreme political and legal power.

So, there was no early assertion of judicial power against an all-powerful parliament in Israel. It followed the British model. But when the opposition took power finally in Israel, things were ripe for change, just as the first change in power in America set the stage for Marshall to establish the power of the judiciary.

For just as Marshall was the last of the old Federalist guard to have a hold on power in the U.S., so too were the judges in Israel people appointed by the left in all their years of rule, and so were the only ones still in positions of power, though that power was as yet undeveloped.

It took some years and the leadership of a powerful will and intellect in the person of Israel’s former chief justice, Aharon Barak. He expanded the power of the courts, making them an effective check on the Knesset’s power and on that of the governments that Israel’s parliament maintains.

The development of an independent judiciary is of paramount importance in maintaining political freedom. Without the power to assert the supreme force of the underlying compact that binds government and the governed, democracies become people’s republics, democratic in name only. Unrestrained power in the hands of the legislature or executive, over time, always generates abuse.

But who governs the governor? Lincoln raised the question in the wake of the disastrous Dred Scott decision, which helped to undermine the Constitution’s hold on the people and grease the skids to civil war. Lincoln’s powerful arguments in the Douglas debates made a strong case that the power of the judiciary as well is subject to the undying sovereignty of the people.

Lincoln’s insight was firmly based in American political thought. In Federalist 51, Madison made his argument for setting up co-equal powers that would hold each other in check by the balancing opposition of their natural and fallible ambitions. Gravity by nature pull structures down, but if we design a cantilevered structure, the downward pull of gravity on one part of the structure meets the same downward pull on the other side, and the structure stands firm. Government is not then dependent on the powerholders being perfect, which is just as well, for perfect people are in short supply. As Madison memorably put it:

Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place. It may be a reflection on human nature, that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government. But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary.

That’s true even in the Holy Land.

What Barak did verifies Madison’s observation. We Americans know that even with rights specified in words, a skilled player can game it. Despite the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments and civil rights legislation after the Civil War, our justices and most of the rest of our political society tolerated the de facto extension of quasi-slavery for many decades. How much the more so are the opportunities when the constitution is in the British mode — or was made to be so.

For Israel has Basic Laws, a sort of a constitution, and they were held in that kind of esteem—until Barak decided that his court was the judge of which Basic Laws could stand. In America, it would be as if SCOTUS could rule on the Constitution and declare the parts it didn’t like invalid. This makes the court the sovereign power, subject to nothing other than its own sense of what is right, and accepting no constraints from anyone. At least in the headiest days of the Warren Court, the justices believed — or at least said they believed — that their penumbras and such were actually in the Constitution, and so had its authority.

But Barak’s judicial activism was breathtaking in its raw assertion of power, implying that he and his cohorts were indeed so angelic as to be able to properly wield such divine power. Barak’s tactics seemed more Machiavellian than heavenly. He moved with great skill to gut the power of the elected government by subjecting it to judicial oversight unaccountable to any law.

Jonathan Rosenblum of Mishpacha magazine writes:

Barak’s tactical acumen reached its peak in his transformation of the position of attorney general from one of acting as the government’s chief legal advisor and representative to one of acting as the de facto emissary of the Court to keep an eye on the legislative and executive branches — all without a stitch of statutory warrant. Barak ruled that the attorney general — a position in which he served from 1975 through 1978 — can nix any government action he determines to be unreasonable, and thus illegal. And that decision is not subject to judicial review.

And we think that Special Prosecutors have too much power!

Barak is no longer on the court, but he is fighting the political battle to gut Netanyahu before he can fulfill his campaign promise to reform the runaway power of this rogue government branch. The justices who have inherited his power have now ruled that Netanyahu cannot hold a portfolio in the government while the attorney general continues his endless pursuit of a bribery charge that he continues to hold over his head without ever bringing evidence capable of conviction. The court has also just ruled one of Netanyahu’s picks for his Cabinet may not be seated, something that could result in the dissolution of Netanyahu’s majority coalition.

This is just the briefest of summaries of the situation. It is enough to disabuse the reader of the line of American legacy media, which this audience suspects with good reason of being not accurate.

Netanyahu prizes The Federalist as one of the greatest works of political thought in human history. There’s little doubt that his effort to rebuild the cantilever that Barak collapsed and to rebalance the government among branches close to co-equal would command Madison’s approval as well.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/political-hay/,2023-01-22
To Trump: Your Support for Gay Propaganda Will Not Make America Great Again - The American Spectator,"Donald Trump is usually a repository of common sense. But on matters related to “gay rights,” he is hopelessly unmoored from common sense. Trump’s support for that appalling movement, which is so destructive to the country, at a recent Log Cabin Republicans’ gala held at his Mar-a-Lago estate is completely indefensible.

The gross propaganda to which Trump offered inane homage strikes at the roots of a country’s strength, namely, the first form of government — the two-parent family that God placed at the center of his plan for humanity. God, not man, is the measure of morality, and he expressed clearly in the design of the human body and the difference between men and women that “gay rights” are a lying fiction that corrupts children and weakens a nation. Has Trump not been paying attention for the last five decades? The “gay rights” movement has been a disaster for the traditional family and children, exposing many of them to the implicit child abuse of “gay adoption” and increasingly hubristic “IVF” experiments. The “gay rights” movement has not made America great again. Rather, it has made America weak and depraved and has led to the abomination of transgenderism.

Trump needs to think more and talk less and crack open the philosophical works of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas, who recognized the depravity of homosexuality and its baneful influence on the common good. A “conservatism” that fails to see the centrality of the traditional family to the common good and fosters respect for a lifestyle that is utterly destructive of the family and the moral health of children is worthless.

Pull your head out of your ass, Mr. Trump, and defend the natural moral law, which is essential to the strength and longevity of a country. The Log Cabin Republicans are just a bunch of degenerates with fat wallets. Do you really need their money this badly, Mr. President? Your greed is pathetic. And I say this as someone who voted for you twice and sees you as an immensely amusing and, at times, admirable American original. Hell, I will probably vote for you again and may even vote for you against Ron DeSantis, should he choose to run. As a friend of mine put it to me, “DeSantis is not an upgrade on Trump on gay issues.” In other words, DeSantis is just as unsound on those issues as Trump. In fact, DeSantis began his run for governor by pooh-poohing the “bathroom wars.” Social conservatives, recall, supported his primary opponent. After he squeaked out his gubernatorial victory, he suddenly saw the value of the bathroom wars. But his opposition to the LGBTQ movement is restricted to the “T” in that tiresome acronym, and even on the issue of transgenderism his disdain only applies to its imposition on children, not adults.

Yet even DeSantis, who is a mediocre retail politician at best, has the sense to keep his distance from frivolous Republicans who want to turn the GOP into the Gay Old Party. Trump has heedlessly seconded this movement, and, if it succeeds in dominating the party, America will be subject to two equally immoral parties spewing nonsense about sexuality and, thereby, creating a culture that renders any national greatness impossible.

No doubt the philosophically shallow Trump would scoff at this view and counsel me that I am too uptight. But that is simply not true: Opposition to the LGBTQ movement is not idle and pompous morality but an essential defense of Judeo-Christian civilization and the preservation of religious liberty. An LGBTQ America is a godless America in which Christians are treated as the worst, not the best, citizens in the country. Look back on the last days of the decadent Roman Empire, and you can see the civilizational oblivion where that perverse, upside-down culture leads.

By the way, I have been pretty hard on Ronna McDaniel, hoping that she will lose the race for Republican National Committee chair. Perhaps that was a waste of my time. I have heard that her challenger, Harmeet Dhillon, a San Francisco–based attorney, is lousy on gay issues too. According to a GOP source, she is not as reckless as McDaniel — Dhillon probably wouldn’t, like McDaniel, send out “Gay Pride Month” tweets — but, philosophically, she is basically in the same camp as McDaniel on gay issues. So does it really matter if she wins? Maybe, maybe not. On balance, she is better on issues across the board than McDaniel.

But to anybody hoping for a revived GOP willing to stand up to the Democratic culture of death and depravity, Trump’s hosting of the Log Cabin Republicans is depressing as hell. Kari Lake was also there, goofing off with outré rhetoric and naughty asides. How stupid, how shameful. Lake is a polished and talented politician, but if she can’t see that gay propaganda threatens the future of the country, she is not much of a conservative and, in the end, not even worth supporting. The last thing America needs are two parties echoing each other on woke nonsense about the gloriousness of a movement that has clearly been a civilizational cataclysm for America.

President Trump, you toppled Roe v. Wade and defended religious freedom during your term and did so in the face of intense persecution from the media and ruling class. Don’t throw that noble legacy away for the Log Cabin Republicans’ mess of pottage.

Trump’s CNN Lawsuit Shows Freedom of Press Does Not Include Right to Libel - The American Spectator,"Former President Donald J. Trump is suing CNN for defamation. For those who know something about modern American libel standards, the case raises the following question: Will Trump be able to show “actual malice”? That is, will he be able to show not only that CNN defamed him through false reporting but that it did so with the knowledge that its reports were false, or at least with “reckless disregard” for whether or not they were true ? This is the high standard that a public figure like Trump must meet in order to sue successfully for libel in an American court.

Trump’s case also raises a deeper question about American law: Should Trump — or any other public figure — be required to show “actual malice” to prevail in a libel suit? As I argue at greater length here, the answer to this question is “no.” The actual malice standard is not really a requirement of the First Amendment. It is instead an extra-constitutional novelty imposed on our understanding of the freedom of the press by an activist Supreme Court.

Modern American libel law has been decisively shaped by the Supreme Court’s 1964 ruling in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. Here the court took a perfectly reasonable ruling and used it as the vehicle to graft an unreasonable and non-constitutional standard onto our law. L.B. Sullivan — a city commissioner of Montgomery, Alabama — deserved to lose his libel action because he could not show that he had been defamed by an ad critical of him that had been written by civil rights activists and published by the New York Times. The ad had not even named Sullivan.

The Court, however, not content to deprive Sullivan of his improper victory in the courts of Alabama, went further. It declared, with Justice William Brennan Jr. writing for his colleagues, that henceforward “public officials” would be held to a standard different from that of ordinary litigants when suing for libel. Public officials would have to show not only that they had been defamed by false publication. They also would have to show that the publisher had acted with “actual malice” — that is, again, with knowledge that the story was untrue or with reckless disregard for its truth or falsity. Subsequent rulings extended the doctrine so that today not only “public officials” but also “public figures” — practically any well-known person — must show actual malice to sue successfully. This doctrine, the Court has suggested, is necessary in order to protect the freedom of debate and criticism that the First Amendment aims to secure.

The claim that the First Amendment requires a showing of “actual malice” in certain libel cases is the work of the Warren Court and is the kind of bold (some might say reckless) innovation for which it was famous (some might say infamous). The older approach to American libel law recognized no distinction between the standards to be applied to ordinary citizens, on the one hand, and public figures, on the other. It treated the rights of reputation of all Americans as equally worthy of protection. It held simply that libel was a wrong, an injury to another, and, therefore, not part of the freedom of the press.

The traditional understanding was well expressed by Justice Frank Murphy in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942). Said Murphy: “There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which has never been thought to raise any constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting” (emphasis mine). Murphy’s understanding can be traced all the way back to our nation’s founding. The great legal commentators among the Founding Fathers — men like James Kent, Justice James Wilson, and Justice Joseph Story — all held that libel, or false and defamatory speech, was properly regarded as an injury, subject to legal action, and not part of the freedom of the press.

New York Times v. Sullivan worked a serious change not only in American legal doctrine but also in the practice of American self-government. Under the traditional standards, public figures could and did sue successfully when they were libeled by the press. The press was then subject to a wholesome legal restraint. It could criticize public figures in as cutting a manner as it liked — so long as the criticism was truthful. Since the imposition of the actual malice standard, however, it has proven almost impossible for public figures to sue the press successfully, even in cases — such as recent former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin’s suit against the New York Times — in which the publisher admits that the defamatory information was erroneous. Not surprisingly, the modern American press, blessed with this almost perfect legal impunity, has become increasingly careless of the truth.

Today’s Supreme Court should use cases like Trump’s to revisit New York Times v. Sullivan and restore our nation’s traditional libel standards. This is necessary not just for the sake of public figures whose reputations have been unjustly damaged by the press, and not just for the sake of getting the Constitution right — although those are certainly important considerations. It is also necessary for the preservation of genuine self-government.

Self-government — a core promise of the American way of life — means that the people get to decide the basic direction of the country by electing their political leaders. For this to be a serious process and not a farce, the voters must be able to give genuine, informed consent to the election of those who make the laws and administer the government. This in turn requires that they have access to accurate information about those contending for office and an opportunity to think through the alternatives with which they are confronted. A responsible press has an essential role to play in this process.

As we are seeing, however, an irresponsible, partisan press can derail our process of self-government. Such a press seeks not to assist the people’s deliberations but instead to shape political outcomes by using slander to render some leaders and some movements odious to the public. This, after all, is what was attempted in 2016 with candidate Trump. Those who publicized the false claim that Trump was guilty of “Russian collusion” did so precisely because they feared that the issues on which he was running might be sufficiently powerful to secure him the presidency. That attempt failed in 2016, but it was used with some success thereafter to impede Trump’s ability to govern. And the press’s brutalization of Trump is only one example.

Politics in a mass democracy such as our own will never display the lofty rationality of a Platonic dialogue. In modern times it may not even rise to the level of the Lincoln–Douglas debates. But there is no reason that it has to be the absolute circus that it has become. The Supreme Court helped to cause this problem and it can help to fix it — by reversing New York Times v. Sullivan.

Trump and the Secret Documents - The American Spectator,"Since 2015 the animating thought among the Democrats and their sycophants in the FBI and our intelligence community has been to prevent and then cripple Donald Trump’s presidency. Among them pursuit of that idea is becoming more desperate as Trump’s 2024 candidacy approaches.

From the Justice Department list filed in court on Friday and selective leaks to anti-Trump newspapers such as the Washington Post, we have learned a little — but not much — about the documents seized by the FBI in its raid on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate.

Among about 10,000 documents seized were dozens of classified documents in categories such as top secret, empty file folders marked with classification designations, and thousands of other documents, some of which were seized to show how the secret documents were carelessly stored.

Trump’s lawyers contend that some of the documents are privileged under either the attorney-client or executive privileges. That led a judge to grant Trump’s motion to have a special master appointed to examine the documents to see if there are privileged papers among them.

That rather routine decision by the judge has led to some of the most outrageous condemnations of her decision. Some have compared it to the Supreme Court’s decision in Dred Scott, which upheld slavery, and Korematsu, which upheld the internment of Japanese citizens in World War II.

Nonsense. Any reasonable claim that any of the documents are privileged should trigger such a decision.

In civil litigation where documents are produced under civil procedure rules, if one side produces documents to the other — which attorneys do after reviewing them — privileges are waived.

In criminal cases, documents or other materials seized by law enforcement may be privileged. A reasonable claim of possible privilege of seized materials would routinely result in the appointment of a special master — an impartial person — who would review the documents for privilege and report to the judge on his findings.

The Justice Department moved to reverse or limit the decision to allow a special master to review the documents before the FBI could. It seems to be in a big rush to get enough material to indict Trump. It insists risibly that its own review is sufficient to protect Trump’s privileges.

There supposedly is an unwritten Justice Department rule that no indictment of a current political leader be issued within 60 days of an election. Trump won’t be on the ballot in November, but that won’t stop the DOJ from indicting him as soon as it can.

The attorney-client privilege is easy to understand. Any communications between Trump and his lawyers are privileged no matter how small in volume. (There are a few exceptions, such as that a client’s plan to commit a future crime is not privileged and must be reported by the attorney.) The executive privilege is another matter.

Trump and his lawyers own every communication between him and his lawyers. But other documents, privileged or not, classified or not, would be the property of the federal government. The Supreme Court has never ruled on whether a former president can assert an executive privilege over documents in his possession.

President Joe Biden has already indicated that he won’t support any Trump claim of executive privilege and has delegated — wrongly — his authority over such determinations to the national archivist.

The Justice Department, in its rush to indict Trump, will soon run out of time to appeal the judge’s order to appoint a special master. Both sides have nominated people to serve in that capacity.

The special master’s examination of the roughly 10,000 documents seized by the FBI in the Mar-a-Lago raid will take weeks or months. The DOJ can be counted on to appeal any determination of the special master that any of the documents, classified or not, are subject to either the attorney-client or executive privileges.

That, too, will take time. The DOJ doesn’t want to wait for any of those appeals. Its political aim to block another Trump presidency could be thwarted if it has to wait.

There’s an enormous amount of hyperbole — some probably stirred up by the DOJ — from the left on these issues. One commentator poses the possibility that Trump was about to sell our secrets to foreign governments. Again, nonsense. The biggest problem for the DOJ is its previous inaction on Hillary Clinton’s “Clinton-mail” system.

Some have preemptively defended former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whose private “Clinton-mail” server was admitted by former FBI Director James Comey, to have contained a number of top-secret documents and emails about them to and from her staff. “Clinton-mail” was totally unsecured. Anyone — including the nations who are our greatest adversaries — could have intercepted, and probably did intercept, those messages, at any time. In that same statement, Comey contended that a case against Clinton couldn’t be made because there was no intent to violate the law.

But Title 18 U.S. Code Section 793 — the so-called “Espionage Act” — doesn’t have a specific intent standard. Under it, gross negligence in handling classified information is sufficient for a crime to be committed.

Clinton’s emails contained some of our greatest secrets: SI-TK intelligence (special intelligence — Talent Keyhole) from spy satellites and SAPs (Special Access Programs), which are covert operations conducted under the authority of presidential special orders. Some SAPs involve the military, not just the intelligence community. Some SAPs leave blood on the ground.

Indicting Trump for possessing secret and top-secret documents and handling them with “gross negligence” under Section 793 would be amount to almost the exact same conduct that Comey contended was not prosecutable in Clinton’s case. Trump’s conduct, bad as it is, is arguably even less negligent than Clinton’s. Trump had documents stored in boxes that were apparently not protected. Clinton’s email system was comprehensively vulnerable to foreign interception, which likely occurred. Is there evidence that Trump’s boxes were searched by foreign agents?

Unequal justice under the law is one of the principal characteristics of a dictatorship. Biden’s Justice Department won’t be dissuaded from indicting Trump because of that. “Prosecutorial discretion” will be its excuse.

Clinton’s behavior was clearly prosecutable under Section 793 and other statutes. Trump’s conduct — really that of his staff — is not excusable, but, as alluded to above, if it wasn’t prosecutable against Hillary, it’s not prosecutable against Trump & Co. either.

Nevertheless, we have to expect Trump and several of his staffers to be indicted.

Biden and the other Democrats are terrified of Trump’s coming campaign for the presidency. They want to stop his run — by indicting and convicting him for aiding and abetting an insurrection under the 14th Amendment. This is the angle that the Jan. 6 Committee of the House is pursuing.

As I have written earlier, the DOJ will also probably charge Trump under Title 18 U.S. Code Section 2071, which also prohibits someone convicted under it from holding federal office. (Despite the fact, as I have also pointed out, that Section 2071 is unconstitutional because it adds, by law, a qualification for the presidency outside the Constitution. Congress can’t amend the Constitution by passing a law).

None of this will or should stop Trump from announcing his candidacy — likely right after the November election — and campaigning against Biden. The Jan. 6 Committee will soon recommend that Trump be indicted under the 14th Amendment.

Biden has already said that Trump should be prosecuted for his conduct on Jan. 6, 2021. The DOJ will likely proceed with that and any other grounds it can come up with and indict Trump, probably right after he announces his 2024 campaign. Trump will probably seek to rush a trial, and the result will be a media circus that will keep Trump at the top of the news and all the Trump haters in the media in full cry.

The Justice Department’s pursuit of Trump is an obviously political move by Attorney General Merrick Garland with Biden’s approval. Neither apparently has a problem with unequal justice under the law.

The only real possibility for the Democrats to bar another Trump run is the 14th Amendment. Trump’s conduct on Jan. 6, 2021, was execrable. But it doesn’t constitute engaging in an insurrection against the United States.",https://spectator.org/chaos-republicans-control-house-barely-and-trump-is-in-and-out/,2022-09-13
Trump Stands Up for Free Speech - The American Spectator,"Bravo. In a speech this past week, former President Donald Trump vowed that if reelected he will make a point of ending the federal government’s censorship of Americans’ free speech. Said the former president:

Within hours of my inauguration, I will sign an executive order banning any federal department or agency from colluding with any organization, business, or person, to censor, limit, categorize, or impede the lawful speech of American citizens…. I will begin the process of identifying and firing every federal bureaucrat who has engaged in domestic censorship — directly or indirectly — whether they are the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, the FBI, the DOJ, no matter who they are.

He also touched on another problem — namely, the revolving door that has developed between federal government employees and Big Tech — saying he would have a “seven-year cooling off period” for “any employee of the FBI, CIA, NSA, DNI, DHS, or DOD” who headed to a Big Tech company that handles “vast quantities of U.S. user data.” Note well that only in the last few weeks did Elon Musk fire Twitter’s legal counsel — former FBI general counsel James Baker — who played a role in the Trump–Russia collusion hoax and then left the FBI to go to Twitter to be its legal counsel. Baker is the personification of the Big Government–Big Tech revolving door that Trump vows to end. Trump’s proposal is a seriously much-needed and quite-basic reform that should never have been needed in the first place. But the American Left’s addiction to working with Big Tech to silence dissent — aka conservatives and Trump supporters, not to mention Trump himself — has made this reform vital to the success of a functioning democracy. From over at RT, here is but one sample headline from the many that have now started to appear following Musk’s repeated “Twitter Files” dumps that show just how the censorship game was played in an unholy alliance between Twitter and Big Government:

Twitter files unveil more FBI collusion A top executive coordinated US election “enforcement” with federal agents

The RT story begins by reporting this:

US federal agencies worked closely with Twitter moderators to clamp down on what they saw as “disinformation” during the 2020 election. Executives went to great lengths to scrub certain content they deemed false and dangerous, following increasingly frequent sit-downs with law enforcement and intelligence orgs, according to the third installment of the “Twitter Files.” Published on Friday by journalist Matt Taibbi, the trove of files includes messages from Twitter’s former head of Trust and Safety, Yoel Roth, revealing he was running out of “generic” names to disguise his increasingly regular meetings with federal officials ahead of the 2020 election in the company calendar.",https://spectator.org/desantis-is-the-only-person-who-can-beat-trump-his-time-is-now/,2022-12-16
Trump Takes Aim at New York Times v. Sullivan - The American Spectator,"As readers of this space know, former President Donald J. Trump is suing CNN for defamation. Trump claims in his suit that CNN defamed him by repeatedly likening him to Hitler and, in particular, by claiming that his complaints about the integrity of the 2020 election are nothing but a “Big Lie,” such as was used by Hitler to win and maintain power. For its part, CNN claimed in a motion for dismissal filed over the holidays that, even if it said everything Trump alleges, he still has no case. According to CNN, its comparisons of Trump to Hitler were mere “opinion” and “rhetorical hyperbole,” not the kind of factually false derogatory claims for which one can sue for defamation.

Now Trump’s lawyers have filed their response to CNN’s motion to dismiss. Their argument is noteworthy not only for the way in which they try to keep CNN on the hook by appealing to the prevailing legal standards of defamation, but also for the way in which they seek to challenge those standards themselves as being too favorable to media organizations that promote inflammatory coverage of public figures. It seems, in other words, that the Trump legal team wants the federal courts — and ultimately the Supreme Court — to revisit New York Times v. Sullivan (1964), the fountainhead of modern American libel law and the source of the legal standards that make it so hard for public figures to sue successfully for defamation.

Again, CNN claims that its numerous Trump–Hitler comparisons are all just “opinion” and “hyperbole” and are, therefore, a privileged form of speech for which one cannot be sued for defamation. After all, the law of defamation is intended to protect people (much less public figures) not from negative opinion but from false claims of fact that are damaging to one’s reputation. Arguing within this existing legal framework, Trump’s lawyers respond that it is strange, and indeed unpersuasive, for CNN to claim that these remarks are mere opinion. After all, CNN bills itself as a source of “news” — as is stated in its name, Cable News Network. Moreover, CNN markets itself as “the most trusted name in news.” Viewed in this context, perhaps it would be reasonable for the court to treat CNN’s assertions that Trump is the same as Hitler as defamatory factual claims. Along the way, Trump’s lawyers observe that, for decades after World War II, American courts held that it was per se defamation to call somebody Hitler.

More fundamentally, and more daringly, Trump’s lawyers also invite the courts to revisit New York Times v. Sullivan and thus to reconsider the legal standards imposed by that ruling. In truth, Trump would have a very hard time prevailing in his suit even if he could convince the court to treat CNN’s comparisons of him to Hitler as fact and not just opinion. The reason for this difficulty arises from New York Times and subsequent cases, in which the Supreme Court held that public figures (like Trump) who claim to have been defamed must show not only that they were the victims of false and damaging statements but also that the statements were made with “actual malice” — that is, that those who made the statements knew they were false or were recklessly indifferent as to their truth or falsity. In practice, it has proven all but impossible to meet such a standard, and successful suits brought by public figures are very rare.

As a candidate and as president, Trump complained about the New York Times standard in his rough and ready way. He said that we need to “open up” our libel laws so as to make it easier to sue the purveyors of false and defamatory material. Now his lawyers are following that call up with their submission to the court.

According to Trump’s legal team, New York Times v. Sullivan should be reconsidered because the doctrine of the case is not accomplishing what it had intended. In 1964, the Supreme Court wanted to make it hard for public figures to sue for libel because they thought the high bar for such suits was needed to protect the First Amendment and the vigorous public debate necessary for self-government. They feared that if it were too easy to sue for libel, public figures might use sympathetic state courts to bring abusive libel suits intended to stifle public discussion of important issues.

According to Trump’s filing, however, whatever the court intended in 1964, decades of experience now show that the “actual malice” standard actually undermines the First Amendment and democratic self-government. By giving big “news” organizations near impunity to defame public figures, that standard permits an often-partisan media to pollute the public discourse with lies — a situation that is hardly conducive to responsible and rational self-government on the part of voters.

This argument deserves serious consideration. (Indeed, I have made a version of it myself and have further contended that New York Times v. Sullivan deserves to be reversed because it is not really based on the original understanding of the First Amendment.) Getting the Supreme Court to reverse any long-standing precedent is, admittedly, a long shot. Nevertheless, it is no longer possible to pretend that Trump’s complaints about the “actual malice” standard are a fringe opinion. As his lawyers observe, numerous respected American jurists have expressed skepticism about what the court did in New York Times: Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Byron White, Justice Potter Stewart, Justice Neil Gorsuch, and Judge Laurence Silberman.

Will the courts heed Trump’s invitation to reconsider New York Times v. Sullivan? Stay tuned! If they do, it will mark a first step toward restoring the kind of spirited — but also rational and decent — public discourse necessary for a well-functioning democracy.

Trump’s CNN Lawsuit Shows Freedom of Press Does Not Include Right to Libel

Refereeing Trump v. DeSantis on COVID - The American Spectator,"When we (meaning the editors here at The American Spectator and yours truly) were discussing the topic of this column Tuesday afternoon, I groaned at the subject matter below — because there is no emerging unscathed from an attempt to find cohesion among the factions of the MAGA/revivalist/America First movement once the conversation turns to Donald Trump versus Ron DeSantis.

I keep saying the obvious, which is that if we’re going to fix the ugly mess the Bush Republicans, the Deep State, and the hard-left Democrat machines have made of America, Trump/DeSantis isn’t an either/or proposition. We need both of them, and a whole lot more than just those two. We need an entire movement of fearless, passionate, smart, and ruthless conservative patriots — an army of strong men and sane women — if we’re going to touch off the American revival this country must have in order to save itself.

That means that either Trump or DeSantis can be the GOP’s nominee in 2024, and the activists, donors, and supporters of the movement should be prepared to happily throw in behind either one — or if it’s somebody else who can credibly argue he or she is worthy of bearing the standard, then perhaps him or her as well. Perhaps more importantly, we need revivalist Republicans on the ballot and bearing the standard in every race below president — in this fall’s midterm cycle, which so far seems to be a qualified success particularly down the ballot in a lot of places, but not a perfect one, and in many cycles to come.

But while a spirit of harmony inside the movement should prevail, that harmony should be based on truth and a plan. And this requires a sober, dispassionate analysis of what’s going right and what’s going wrong, and how to fix the latter.

And when the topic of the COVID-19 response came up late last week and over the weekend, it provided a very good opportunity to conduct such an analysis.

How did it come up? Well, DeSantis is running for re-election in Florida against the testosterone-challenged trans-Democrat Charlie Crist, and this was the latest ad his campaign popped out onto the airwaves:

Soon you will start seeing this statewide…. Governor @RonDeSantisFL delivers results for the people of Florida. From parents to small business owners, waitresses to nurses, sheriffs to teachers… Floridians are grateful for the Governor’s leadership. pic.twitter.com/HxgovXgIPc — Casey DeSantis (@CaseyDeSantis) September 6, 2022

The replies under that ad are pretty indicative of the late word that some 80 percent of Twitter utterings are the work of bots, which is something Trump and DeSantis seem to have in common — they both are invaluable for their ability to bring forth the reality about their opponents. The ad demonstrates the flop-sweat DeSantis induces in today’s Left just like Trump’s very existence seems to do with the Deep State and all of its various organisms.

But along with the cacophony of hate-tweets and “fact-checks” issued by basement-dwelling losers came something of an interesting discussion about the ad. Specifically, here’s something Ben Domenech said, which touched things off:

This message would curbstomp the other Florida man if taken nationwide, in part because he failed to do so much of the same. https://t.co/zLjmae0nqr — Ben Domenech (@bdomenech) September 6, 2022

100% true. It was he who put Pence in charge (rather than Azar), who then installed Fauci and Birx as the de-facto covid czars. He knew quickly this was a huge mistake but did nothing b/c PR concerns about upcoming election. Unforgivable. — Credentialed Expert (@SteveKSCCHS) September 6, 2022

So chalk Domenech up as a DeSantis backer, I guess.

The thing is that Ben Domenech is very much an America First revivalist. Is he a particular Trump supporter? Not really, but neither is he David French. Let’s not forget whom Ben Domenech is married to, and let’s recognize you aren’t getting full-on MAGA from him if he values his domestic tranquility.

But that isn’t the point. Domenech’s critique of Trump here comes from the right — in the sense that what he’s saying is Trump took a weak line against the Fauci-fascist takeover of the federal government that COVID-19 brought on.

And in this, while there’s a counter-argument which also deserves examination, Domenech isn’t wrong.

To acknowledge this is not to back DeSantis over Trump or to say Trump disqualified himself for 2024. It’s simply to say that one of the main reasons Trump lost re-election, or that the 2020 election was close enough in so many states that it could be stolen from him if that’s how you prefer to frame it, was COVID.

I would argue, and have, that COVID was the primary reason 2020 happened the way it did. If nothing else, the government’s alarmist/wacko overreaction to the virus, complete with lockdowns, mandates, school closures, and other abject stupidities created the atmosphere within which the Democrats were able to pollute the electoral process with mail-in ballots, drop boxes, and the rest. In several states they did it without so much as the color of law by getting the state legislature’s assent, making the election in fact a questionable affair in terms of the Constitution.

And pointing this out doesn’t make you a conspiracy theorist or a terrorist. If it did, we could round up half the Democrats on Capitol Hill who have contested every Republican presidential election victory this century.

I’ve also argued that the original sin of Trump’s COVID response was not lustily firing Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx the minute it became obvious they were bent on wrecking the U.S. economy in an election year obviously for the purposes of destroying the Trump administration. Birx essentially bragged about it in her ridiculous, unhinged recently published memoir, and it’s fairly clear by what documents have leaked on Fauci that he’s been engaged in a partisan war against Trump and his supporters largely from the first and certainly since various revivalist Republicans on Capitol Hill began sniffing around his activities.

When I argued those things it aroused the ire of the more loyal Trump partisans. I’m not taking the position Domenech takes: that those folks are suckers. They’re defensive of Trump, and it’s not a character flaw to be so, given the villainy of the forces that have been aligned against him. What I will say, though, is that because of that opposition Trump has a very high bar to clear if he’s going to be successful. He — and the movement — has to beat:

the federal government;

America’s institutions are almost universally corrupt, which is why the country is in such declining shape. We’re not finished, not by a long shot, but we have some massive reform and reinvention to do. And that can’t be done in a half-assed, sloppy way. We can’t make mistakes if we’re going to get where we need to go.

And yes, 2020 — the response to COVID and what it did to our electoral processes, I mean — was a big setback on the way to the American revival.

What would actually be a great moment would be if Trump, through an interview or by some other means, would engage a candid discussion of that experience and why and how things happened the way they did.

I think he can do that without it sounding like a weepy, pandering apology. It certainly doesn’t need to.

It doesn’t need to because Trump actually had all the right instincts about COVID.

Seriously, he did.

Trump knew that COVID came from a biolab in Wuhan, which had ties to the Chinese military, and while the virus wasn’t a bioweapon per se (or at least we don’t have proof of that so far), the way the Chinese government handled itself following the release out of that lab looked a whole lot like it came from somebody’s biowarfare playbook. The telltale sign of that was the fact the Chinese government shut off domestic travel out of Wuhan but the airport there stayed open for international flights for weeks. Trump was reticent to spread panic among the population about the virus, so much so that the Democrats who did spread that panic made him out not to care about the people who were dying from it (while they encouraged thousands of those deaths by pushing “solutions” like bringing COVID patients into nursing homes). Eventually the panic over the virus was overwhelming and he felt he had to give ground to it, which was a mistake. Trump also wanted to go after COVID and beat it rather than lock the country down. He agreed to “two weeks to slow the spread” and give the hospitals and medical sector an opportunity to scale up a response to the virus. The problem was that the public heath bureaucracy both at the federal level and the state level was exposed as a dysfunctional, corrupt mess, which had wasted billions of dollars spent supposedly on emergency preparedness and didn’t even have stockpiles of gear. The response of that bureaucracy to COVID was to pay hospitals exorbitant sums to put patients on ventilators, which killed them in droves, and we’ve yet to conduct a real ethical audit of that practice. Finally, Trump had the correct instinct about the virus, which was that it was better to treat it and get herd immunity through people having recovered from it. The problem with that was it flew in the face of Big Pharma’s profit motive, because widely available and dirt-cheap antiviral drugs like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin showed amazing properties in treating COVID — a recent study showed a 92 percent success rate for ivermectin, for example — and had Fauci and Birx done their jobs and implemented Trump’s choices rather than subvert and sabotage them, hundreds of thousands of lives would have been saved. That’s not my opinion, it’s the sworn testimony of Dr. Harvey Risch, professor of epidemiology at Yale.

I bring all of this up because once he got some on-the-ground information about COVID, the four things above encompass DeSantis’ response to the virus.

And the trolls of the left say Florida had the third-highest number of COVID deaths. Well, assuming that number isn’t a lie, of course it did. Florida has the highest number of retirees and old people in America, and therefore the highest at-risk population. There was no way to avoid a big COVID death toll in the Sunshine State, but it could have been infinitely worse if DeSantis hadn’t stepped in with a surge of monoclonal antibody treatments and other attempts to treat the virus rather than lock the state down.

Florida also did a massive voluntary campaign to vaccinate its at-risk population, which was what Trump wanted to do nationally and didn’t get the chance.

Of course, the jury is definitely out on whether COVID vaccines work all that well, which could be a sore spot for Trump on something he’d like to take credit for. Operation Warp Speed was certainly an achievement in the sense that it was a successful mobilization of government and industry for a specific purpose, though what we know after about 100 years of such efforts being periodically undertaken is that they rarely produce the desired effect without ugly collateral damage, and we’re just starting to see inklings of the vaccine craze’s blowback.

Had vaccinations been voluntary and targeted to people with COVID comorbidities rather than every American three years and up, we might be in a better place.

The point of all of this is to say that yes, DeSantis’ COVID record is better than Trump’s. And yes, DeSantis managed to make successful policy despite some major headwinds. He had to fight the same federal public health bureaucracy that Trump did, and he pulled it off for the most part.

But DeSantis’ successful COVID response mostly came after Trump had lost re-election. It was 2021, more than 2020, when Florida began to emerge as an oasis of sanity and freedom. And it does seem easier to create such an oasis at the state level than if you’re in the White House and having to bed down with the snakes of the Deep State each evening as Trump had to do.

He didn’t think he had the power to fire the people who truly created the failed federal COVID response, which is a structural problem whichever Republican is able to succeed in toppling Team Biden or its remnants in 2024 will have to address in January 2025. And that’s too bad.

There are a lot of dead Americans, and a lot of others still suffering from the lingering effects of long COVID, and millions of our kids whose educations have been disfigured thanks to the COVID response, and countless business owners and others crushed by the economic devastation that response needlessly inflicted, who might have escaped harm otherwise.

The GOP should own up to all of this and pledge never to let it happen again. That Democrats will never do that, and in fact will double down on tyranny at their next excuse, should give the American people a clear and obvious choice how to move forward. That’s true regardless of whether it’s Trump or DeSantis bearing the standard.",https://spectator.org/fbi-phony-photo-frame-trump/,2022-09-07
Trump’s Lame Insult - The American Spectator,"Republicans stand on the precipice of an election that reverts Congress back to their control. Yet, Donald Trump used his perch this weekend to attack another Republican. Does “Ron DeSanctimonious” even make sense? “Low Energy” worked for Jeb Bush because the guy came across as in need of a line of cocaine or at least a Red Bull. “DeSanctimonious” sounds like “DeSantis.” But sanctimonious does not describe Ron DeSantis. It also looks worn to use the same gimmick that worked seven years ago. Leaving aside whether it makes sense in a descriptive way, the nickname makes no sense in a political way. Who attacks a Republican right before an election? Until this weekend, “a Democrat” stood as the only correct answer.

Woodward Calls Trump ‘Dangerous.’ The Donald’s Got Nothing on the Other Guys. - The American Spectator,"The “journalist” Bob Woodward is promoting his forthcoming audiobook The Trump Tapes just in time for the midterm elections. Earlier this week, he said he considers former President Donald Trump to be “dangerous” and a “threat to democracy” and a “threat to the presidency.”

Woodward ended his previous book on Trump by saying, “Trump is the wrong man for the job.” Let’s see how Trump stacks up against other presidents.

Did Trump in his four years in office repeatedly and unconstitutionally suspend the writ of habeas corpus? No, that was Abraham Lincoln. Did Trump initiate a war without congressional sanction? No, that was James K. Polk and Harry Truman. Did Trump use the IRS to intimidate his political opponents? No, that was Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, and Barack Obama. Did Trump have oral sex with a young intern in the White House and then lie about it under oath and to the American people? No, that was Bill Clinton. Did the Trump campaign steal elections in Texas and Illinois? No, that was the Kennedy campaign. Did Trump secretly receive injections of methamphetamine from a physician referred to as “Dr. Feelgood”? No, that was Kennedy. Did Trump become wealthy while in public office? No, that was Lyndon B. Johnson. Did Trump forcibly remove tens of thousands of Americans from their homes and place them in internment camps without any legal basis? No, that was FDR. Did Trump suffer from debilitating medical conditions and hide it from the American people? No, that was Woodrow Wilson, FDR, and Kennedy.

Did Trump shut down newspapers that opposed his war policies? No, that was Wilson. Did Trump ban blacks from the White House? No, that was Wilson. Did Trump prosecute and imprison people who opposed his war policies? No, that, too, was Wilson. Did Trump refuse to grant refuge to Europe’s Jews fleeing persecution and death? No, FDR did that. Did Trump appoint his brother as attorney general to cover up his sins and protect him from the legal consequences of his actions? No, that was Kennedy. Did Trump repeatedly try to assassinate a foreign leader? No, that was Kennedy. Did Trump rise to power on the back of a notoriously corrupt political machine? No, that was Truman and a few other presidents. Did Trump as president tour foreign nations and apologize for past American “sins”? No, that was Obama.

Trump did question the legitimacy of an election, but so, too, did Andrew Jackson (the infamous “corrupt bargain” of 1824) — yet Woodward, to my knowledge, has never considered Jackson to be a threat to democracy and the presidency. Nor has Woodward, to my knowledge, ever called Lincoln, Wilson, FDR, Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, or Obama a threat to democracy and the presidency. Woodward, of course, gained fame and riches by portraying Richard Nixon as a threat to democracy and the presidency, a view that is still the conventional wisdom but that does not survive the scrutiny of truly courageous writers such as Geoff Shepard and Len Colodny — if only they had the readership of Woodward’s books.

Woodward rode the Nixon presidency and resignation to fame and fortune. He will likely follow a similar path with Trump. In the end, it’s always about Woodward, not the presidents he chronicles. With Watergate, he and the Washington Post promoted the narrative of “journalists” as heroes and saviors of democracy. It wasn’t true in the early 1970s, and it’s not true today.",https://spectator.org/gas-prices-economics-biden-partisan-agenda/,2022-10-26
