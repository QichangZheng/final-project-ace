A Deadly Waiting Game in Ukraine - The American Spectator,"The invasion of Ukraine, as with many other wars in modern Russian history, has followed a familiar pattern. First, the much-lauded Russian Armed Forces stumbles into a damaging and humiliating debacle characterized by operational inflexibility and failures of coordination. Then, the Russians reconstitute themselves: Assets are reinforced, plans are redrawn from scratch, and commanders who have proven themselves to be useless are fired. Occasionally, entirely different approaches to warfare are invented or resuscitated. All of this leads to round two, which Russia frequently wins.

This theme played out most famously on the Eastern Front in the Second World War, as well as in the Winter War against Finland a few years prior. More recently, the First Chechen War ended in disaster for Moscow in 1996 but was followed by a decisive Russian victory in the Second Chechen War three years later. Sometimes the learning experience takes a while: The tsar’s troops were so badly beaten in the 1905 Russo–Japanese War that it set off a revolution at home, but their sons returned four decades later and swept the Japanese out of Manchuria.

Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has now undergone such a necessary recalibration. When the Russian army began its attack along four separate axes in February, the plan was clearly to rout the Ukrainian military with as few shots fired as possible. When it quickly became evident that no rout was forthcoming, the attack derailed into a mess of abandoned vehicles and traffic jams.

After an awkward lull in the fighting, the Russians withdrew and changed both their axis of advance and their tactics. In an approach reminiscent of the Western Front in the First World War, Russian attacks in the Donbas now open with massive artillery barrages designed to maul fortifications, followed by quick but cautious infantry assaults aimed at small and defensible gains rather than vast breakthroughs or encirclements. The result has been a brutal, grinding second phase to the war, with Russia making slow and steady gains.

Moscow has further recalibrated on a different level of the conflict. Just as Russian military planners counted on a rapid collapse of the Ukrainian army’s organized resistance, so too did Russia’s leaders gamble that NATO and the EU would offer only a tepid and disjointed response. Ukraine’s swift defeat could then be presented to the rest of Europe as a fait accompli, and any subsequent reprisals would be light.

With this plan long since invalidated, Russia has changed tack. Its strategy is no longer to awe Europe and the U.S., but to outlast them. The invading Russian troops may not be as motivated or as numerous as the defending Ukrainians, but what they do have is “10 to 15 times more” artillery than Ukraine, according to a top Kyiv official last month. Other officials have claimed that Russia fires 60,000 shells per day, an order of magnitude more than Ukraine.

The artillery gap could continue to widen. Russia enjoys a large domestic arms production industry and favorable supply lines to the front. Ukraine had little in the way of an arms industry to begin with, and now it has neither enough functioning factories nor enough workers to staff them. To make matters worse, its supply lines and depots are exposed to constant Russian shelling.

Ukraine’s deficits in production capability should, in theory, be filled in by its supporters in NATO. But deliveries thus far have failed to keep pace with expenditure. The latest U.S. military aid package to Ukraine, announced last week, features 1,000 “precision” 155-mm rounds. The previous package, announced mid-June, included 36,000 standard rounds. Altogether, the artillery ammunition that the U.S. has sent Ukraine in the span of a month could sustain Ukraine’s rate of fire for no more than a week, or Russia’s rate for less than a day.

What NATO Can Afford

Why isn’t more help coming, faster? This question gets to the heart of Russia’s new strategy. Moscow is betting that gas prices, recession, voter dissatisfaction, and the threat of China will all make NATO leaders think twice before giving away more equipment to its opponent.

Indeed, sending what the Ukrainians need would be a momentous task: Kyiv believes that it requires 1,000 155-mm howitzers, 500 tanks, 300 MLRS, 2,000 armored vehicles, and 1,000 drones to achieve “heavy weapons parity” with Russia. For reference, that is more howitzers than the U.S. has deployed in its own active armed forces. Delivering even a portion of this equipment, and providing the copious amounts of training necessary to use and maintain it, would be by far the most ambitious military aid project in history.

And then there would still be the question of supplying ammunition to these weapon systems. Despite America’s huge military budget, artillery is not as central to U.S. military doctrine as it is to Russian doctrine, and so the U.S. maintains quite a small ammo stockpile. For the whole of 2019, the U.S. Army allocated funds to purchase around 150,000 conventional 155-mm shells. The order was seen at the time as an “eye-popping” nine-fold increase over a previous plan to purchase only 16,000 shells — yet in the context of the Ukraine war, it would’ve lasted roughly three days at Russia’s rate of expenditure. A disturbing possibility is that the dwindling of U.S. ammunition aid to Ukraine may be best explained not by stinginess, but by a genuine depletion of American ammo reserves.

That is not to say that the U.S. has hollowed out its own armed forces to support Ukraine. Again, artillery plays a smaller role in American doctrine than in Russian doctrine, and NATO easily overmatches Russia in areas such as air and naval power. But fighters are not being supplied to Ukraine for fear of escalation; and even if they were to be sent, there would be no means to maintain them and no trained pilots to operate them.

If the war drags on — as it almost certainly will — NATO will not be able to sustain the kind of aid that Ukraine requires without some kind of partial mobilization of workers into wartime production. This would be a politically damaging move, at home but also abroad, where Russia and China are looking for any excuse to accuse the West of reckless escalation. It would also be an inadvisable allocation of production at a time when much of Europe is tipping into double-digit inflation. (READ MORE: China’s Share of Ukraine)

Ultimately, NATO’s willingness to sacrifice for Ukraine has found its limits. With Finland and Sweden on the verge of becoming members, rearmament happening among previously inert countries like Germany, and serious weakness in the Russian economy, the alliance does not expect imminent further westward expansion by Moscow. Losing Ukraine to Russia would be a humanitarian disaster and a blow to democratic prestige, but not an existential danger to Washington or Brussels. NATO can afford to lose the war, even if Ukraine cannot.

Kyiv or Bust

The calculus is a bit different on the other side of the war. It is something of an axiom among Russia watchers that President Vladimir Putin’s domestic popularity is shaped first and foremost by his cultivated strongman image. His highest-ever approval ratings were in 2008, when Russia crushed Georgia in a five-day war, and 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea.

But Putin’s image is also a proxy for the current Russian regime as a whole. During the turmoil of the 1990s, the Russian state and economy came under the de facto control of two factions: the oligarchs, who accumulated vast wealth by buying up former Soviet assets; and the siloviki, men with backgrounds in the army, law enforcement, or the intelligence agencies.

Putin’s greatest political accomplishment has been the taming of the once-invincible oligarchs through methods ranging from sidelining to assassination. The current Russian state could be described as a securocracy — rule by siloviki — with Putin, an alum of the Soviet KGB, as its face.

Hence, the current government derives its legitimacy from its ability to assert Russia’s sovereignty and to project the power of its state through the military and other means. Any outcome short of a major victory in Ukraine risks undermining the entire regime. With businesses shuttering, incomes falling, and restaurants running out of potatoes, Putin would have nothing else with which to justify his continued hold onto power.

A defeated Russia would tip perilously toward regime change. By Putin’s own reckoning, such a transformation would be inevitably followed by the undermining of national sovereignty and possibly even the dismemberment of Russia at the hands of NATO. Needless to say, Moscow will accept no outcome other than the subjugation of Ukraine, or at least a substantial portion of it.

China, for its part, believes in a Russian victory almost as much as Russia does. No doubt Beijing only wishes that it could have happened in days or weeks instead of months.

The duration and intensity of both the war and the sanctions on Russia have helped to spur a global economic downturn, in which China stands to suffer the most from out of any major power. It has been struggling to cool down an out-of-control real estate market, which, if forced to deleverage by a recession, could cause a worldwide economic crisis. In general, growth is slowing and cracks in the country’s traditional financial infrastructure are beginning to appear, as evidenced by recent bank runs at multiple small regional banks.

Some onlookers have used these facts to argue that the leadership of the Communist Party must be running out of patience with Putin and may soon pressure him to accede to an unfavorable negotiated peace. But it is more likely that China believes that a Russian loss would only make things much worse. Most of the sanctions currently in place would probably stay in place, and so the economic benefits would be marginal.

More importantly, while NATO has seemingly regained its sense of purpose thanks to Putin’s invasion, allowing Russia to lose would only further galvanize the Western alliance. Beijing is convinced that the U.S. wishes to cripple China and sees Russia as a vital impediment to Washington’s plans. A defeated Russia and a rejuvenated NATO would be President Xi Jinping’s worst nightmare.

Beijing has plenty of other concerns as well. The People’s Republic shares a gigantic border with its northern neighbor and has no desire to see nuclear-armed Russia undergo serious unrest or revolution. China must also contend with its dangerous reliance on foreign food and energy, usually imported by sea. A close relationship with Russia acts as insurance in case of open conflict with the West, offering access to safer overland imports.

The U.S. and most of Europe, by contrast, have far fewer reasons to stick with Ukraine to the bitter end. There is, of course, the shared belief in democracy and international rule of law. In better times, that would have been enough. But with a seemingly once-in-a-generation economic crisis in progress, more concrete cost and benefit calculations have taken precedence.

The Dilemma

Russia will more than likely win its war against Ukraine if events proceed on their current trajectory. As aforementioned, such an outcome would not be too materially damaging for the United States or Europe; indeed, Russia would be sure to emerge in much worse shape than any country in NATO (barring perhaps Germany).

Nonetheless, should the United States and NATO recommit to ensuring Ukrainian victory, Putin is still far from unbeatable. But defeating him will be costly.

The West could begin to provide Ukraine with air support, which would entail flying sorties with NATO jets and NATO pilots. The riskiness of such an escalation has led most commentators to rule it out as a possibility from day one of the war, and for good reason.

The alternative, as previously described, is for America (and maybe France, the U.K., or Germany) to act as Ukraine’s artillery munitions factory. This would do less to heighten tensions but would entail some mobilization of resources away from civilian goods production. Such a move would be difficult to justify to voters worried about the economy.

If it picks either option, NATO must be prepared for a long war against the Russians. Certainly, it would not end this year, and perhaps not even the next. Some analysts have suggested that Russia could deploy tactical nuclear weapons if it feels that it cannot win. What is more likely, at least at first, is that Russia would begin mass conscription. What the Russian Armed Forces have deployed so far in Ukraine — probably around 300,000 troops in total — is a fraction of the manpower that it is capable of summoning in a desperate situation. Putin has so far refused to initiate mobilization on account of the instability it would cause, but his thinking is certain to change if the alternative is a lost war.

Dealing with China, on the other hand, is entirely about how much economic hurt America and its allies would be willing to endure. Despite launching aircraft carriers and spy campaigns, the Communist Party is well aware that it is not yet strong enough to make a move on Taiwan. Instead, it threads the needle in Ukraine, supporting Russia rhetorically but not materially, mostly complying with sanctions in some areas but keeping Russia’s economy afloat in others. Beijing appears to be confident that Putin’s waiting game in Ukraine will eventually win out against NATO and that China’s own strength will eclipse America’s in the Pacific in due time. Given this, Russia’s biggest ally is keen to sit on the sidelines and bide its time.

If the West wants to force China to officially take a side, it must be willing to expand sanctions beyond Russia. Vague threats are insufficient. Now, while China is still dependent on America and on EU countries for vital aspects of high-tech manufacturing, will be the best opportunity to obtain concessions for the foreseeable future.

But leaders in Washington are afraid, perhaps rightly, that Beijing would sooner plunge the world into a depression than appear weak and lose Russia as a partner. With the midterm elections approaching and Americans citing inflation as their top issue by a huge margin, few political leaders in the U.S. are particularly eager to start a trade war.

If Ukraine is to be saved, its allies and supporters must be prepared to make more and greater political, economic, and military sacrifices that they are under no obligation to make. In the absence of such sacrifices, Putin will win his war. Not because of any particularly impressive leadership, tactics, or technology — but because he is willing to go to round two, and the West is not.",https://spectator.org/a-deadly-waiting-game-in-ukraine/,2022-07-12
Biden’s Colossal Misreading of Putin’s Motivations in Ukraine - The American Spectator,"The prolific British historian Niall Ferguson, writing in Bloomberg News, concludes that the Biden administration “is making a colossal mistake thinking that it can protract the war in Ukraine, bleed Russia dry, topple Putin and signal to China to keep its hands off Taiwan.” If this in fact is the administration’s policy — and Ferguson relies on apparently well-sourced New York Times stories by David Sanger and unnamed senior administration officials — then Ferguson is right. It is a colossal mistake and a misreading of Russian history.

According to Ferguson, the Biden administration envisions Putin’s regime collapsing if the war in Ukraine drags on without Russia achieving victory. New reports have portrayed the Russian invasion as a quagmire — a sort of rerun of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. And while Ukrainians suffer, so the argument goes, Russians are suffering, too — both soldiers as a result of the Ukrainian resistance and civilians as a result of Western economic sanctions. Revolution is in the air. And there is some historical justification for the notion that an inconclusive war can lead to revolution — the Russo-Japanese War led to a revolution in Russia in 1905, and the colossal losses and shortages caused by the First World War led to the Romanov dynasty’s collapse in March 1917.

But there is another side to Russian history — one that glories in the heroic fighting of its brave soldiers and civilians in the face of hardship and the drudgery and horror of war. In 2017, Gregory Carleton, a professor of Russian Studies at Tufts University, wrote a book that Biden administration policymakers should read: Russia: The Story of War. Carleton’s book provides a cultural history of what he calls Russia’s “civic religion” and a “grand narrative of war” that goes back to Russia’s experience of war — against the Mongols in the 13th through 15th centuries, during the Time of Troubles in the early 17th century, and against Napoleon and Hitler.

Russia’s grand narrative of war — which is partly myth — includes references to invasions, stout resistance, self-reliance, and incredible self-sacrifice. And the most evocative of these historical experiences are the Battle of Borodino against Napoleon’s Grand Armée in 1812 and the Battle of Brest against the German Army in 1941.

At Borodino on the third day of the battle, Russia suffered more than 50,000 casualties in an unsuccessful effort to prevent Napoleon’s forces from reaching Moscow. French losses were estimated at 35,000. It was the bloodiest day of the Napoleonic Wars. Twenty-nine Russian generals died at Borodino. Carleton described the suffering and tragedy there as the nation’s “Golgotha,” which was forever seared into the Russian soul by Tolstoy’s War and Peace. Borodino, Carleton explained, was an example of defiance, resilience, and courage among Russian troops and civilians.

The World War II battle at Brest is less well known, but it is similarly evocative of Russian courage, defiance, and resistance. Hitler’s troops attacked the fortress there in June 1941, and about 4,000 Russian soldiers, Carleton noted, “held out for weeks against overwhelming German forces.” The garrison at Brest refused to surrender despite being weakened by hunger and thirst. “Outgunned, out-teched, and outnumbered,” Carleton wrote, “Red Army soldiers fought like superhumans.” The heroic fight was memorialized by Russian historian Sergei Smirnov in Brest Fortress, published in 1965 and still in print in Putin’s Russia. The battle at Brest is also the subject of movies and documentaries, and a portion of the fortress’s actual walls has been preserved as an historic site.

Carleton noted that Vladimir Putin appeals to Russia’s historic grand narrative of war. In doing so, Carleton explains, he touches feelings and emotions that “lie deep in the soil of Russian history.” It doesn’t matter that in the Ukraine war Russia is the aggressor and invader. The Brest myth, for example, lives on despite the fact that Stalin was Hitler’s accomplice in starting the European phase of World War II and despite the facts that Stalin gobbled up the Baltic states and invaded Finland in the war’s early years. In Russia, as in many other countries, myth and history become one. And leaders like Putin use mythical history to their advantage.

According to early surveys — conducted by Russian and non-Russian pollsters — recently analyzed by scholars at the London School of Economics, ordinary Russians in February and March “expressed support for the Ukrainian war and for President Putin.” There have been protests within Russia, and Russian police have detained thousands of protesters across Russia. But Putin’s regime puts out pro-war propaganda and censors news reports about the war, and that undoubtedly has an impact on ordinary Russians’ views about the war. Meanwhile the Guardian reports instances of low morale among Russian troops based on statements made by soldiers captured by Ukrainian forces — who, reports note, made those statements under obvious duress. The Daily Mail reported that intercepted radio messages among invading Russian troops similarly showed instances of low morale. These reports, however, are anecdotal. Most Russian troops are obeying orders. The invasion, shellings, and bombings continue. There are no signs of a general mutiny among Russian forces.

The Biden administration would be well-advised not to protract this war in the hope that Russian defeats and casualties and hardships at home will topple Putin. The longer the war lasts, the more Ukrainian soldiers and civilians will die. The United States should be encouraging both sides to negotiate an end to the fighting. As Ferguson says, it would be “wonderful” if the war’s drudgery and tragedy led to Putin’s downfall. But, he writes, “Prolonging the war runs the risk not just of leaving tens of thousands of Ukrainians dead and millions homeless, but also of handing Putin something he can plausibly present at home as victory.” And prolonging the war could also lead to escalation and World War III if the U.S. and NATO become field belligerents. As Ferguson writes, “History talks in the corridors of power.”",https://spectator.org/biden-putin-war-ukraine/,2022-03-23
Biden Ukase Affirms Failure of Obama Student Loan Takeover - The American Spectator,"President Barack Obama engineered a federal takeover of the student-loan industry 12 years ago. The failure of this scheme finds confirmation in President Joe Biden’s executive fiat that waives student-loan repayment to the federal government.

“An entire generation is now saddled with unsustainable debt in exchange for an attempt at least at a college degree,” Biden said Wednesday, announcing the scheme that allows most borrowers who earn under $125,000 to default on as much as $20,000 of their debts. “The burden is so heavy that even if you graduate, you may not have access to the middle-class life that the college degree once provided.”

How could this be so? Obama fixed this problem 12 years ago.

“By cutting out the middleman, we’ll save American taxpayers $68 billion in the coming years,” the then president said at a ceremony at Northern Virginia Community College’s Alexandria campus in March 2010. “That’s real money — real savings that we’ll reinvest to help improve the quality of higher education and make it more affordable.”

None of this happened. Texas Tech University’s decision to open a waterpark several months before the bill was signed foreshadowed that Obama would fall short of these ambitions.

When Obama said those words, students of four-year institutions paid an average of about $21,000 a year for tuition, fees, room, and board. They pay about $30,000 now.

Boston College is charging $62,950 for the 2022–2023 school year. The University of Connecticut is charging out-of-state enrollees $55,724. California State University Northridge is charging $32,716 for students living off campus, in part because “[i]n accordance with California Assembly Bill 990 the California State University Northridge provides the typical market cost of a one-bedroom apartment in the Northridge area.”

Since the Higher Education Act of 1965 put the federal government heavily into the business (charity?) of subsidizing college, costs have skyrocketed from $1,286 (about $11,000 in 2021 dollars) annually for tuition, fees, room, and board at a four-year school to about $30,000 now.

This latest gambit by the Biden administration, like all the ones before it dating to the Johnson administration, does not make college more affordable for students. It incentivizes colleges to raise their prices.

The more they do, the more a sucker known as Uncle Sam coughs up.",https://spectator.org/biden-ukase-affirms-failure-of-obama-student-loan-takeover/,2022-08-25
Bob Bartley Prepared Me for Ukraine - The American Spectator,"Friday

Long ago and far away, when I was a third-year student at Yale Law School, one of my closest friends was a super genius named Duncan Kennedy. Duncan sat next to me in many classes and always had something brilliant to say to the professors.

One of his smartest was that no matter how many “Socratic Bulls–t” questions a professor would ask, the answer would always be, from us students, “Sir, with the greatest possible respect, you are simply restating the previous question.”

I have found this to be a genius key for unlocking the doors of fraud and bunco schemes. For example, I have been going to a charming psychiatrist for many years now. We often discuss why I love my wife so incredibly much and how I can both worship her and play smart-aleck jokes on her.

His usual answer is that I love her because she has some ingredient in her personality that my mother was desperately lacking, and my wife supplies. Part of that ingredient is an immense dose of forgiveness, a personality trait pretty much unknown at 9342 Harvey Road, Silver Spring, Maryland.

When I pursue this avenue and ask what the missing ingredient and now supplied personality trait was, the doctor usually says, “Something that was of life or death importance in your childhood, which Mildred did not know much about, and which Alex has built into her soul like Jesus Christ.”

My answer to that is always, “Doctor, with the greatest possible respect, you are simply restating the prior question.”

This all comes to life because about fifteen years later, I lived near Bob Bartley, the genius editor of the Editorial Page of the Wall Street Journal and a pioneering conservative. He was also my boss. I wrote editorials for the WSJ and many, many columns about the political content (always leftist) of TV and Hollywood movies.

Occasionally, we would take the 7th Avenue IRT into work together and we would talk. At one point, there was a big skirmish going on between Israel and Syrian-based terrorists. There was an issue in the media about whether the U.S. should send satellite imagery to Israel to help them defend themselves against the killers, who were (as now) mostly targeting housewives and children.

Naturally, the leftists in the Democrat party insisted that Israel was the bully in the situation and that Israel should not get the weapons to use against the poor innocent Palestinians.

We at the Wall Street Journal were firmly behind Israel. And once when we were discussing this on the train, Bob said to me, “Look, Ben, there’s no doubt at all that Israel can beat the terrorists. The reason we have to send Israel the best imagery we have is to show ourselves — not that fraud they call ‘The World’ — that we value courage and a people who barely escaped extermination less than one generation ago — and we’ll help them to keep on surviving.”

Bob Bartley died almost 20 years ago. But in the current era his words ring out loud and clear: we have to help Ukraine survive with the best weapons we have not to show who the Ukrainians are, but to show ourselves who we are. This is a question we will endlessly have to ask ourselves and endlessly have to answer. Ukraine gives us a thing of hideous brutality, a cruel war, but also something beautiful: a chance to show ourselves who we are.",https://spectator.org/bob-bartley-prepared-me-for-ukraine/,2022-04-10
Boris Johnson Walks Streets of Kyiv in Surprise Visit to Ukraine - The American Spectator,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson surprised the world Saturday with a secret visit to war-torn Kyiv. The trip went public after a tweet from the Ukrainian embassy in London surfaced with a photo of the two leaders in Kyiv, followed by the caption: “Surprise.”

The city’s mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said Sunday that Johnson’s visit showed the world who the country’s “real friends” are. Johnson has received international praise for his visit, with the Ukrainian defense ministry tweeting, “This is what courage looks like. This is what true friendship between peoples and between nations looks like.”

The leaders of Slovenia, Poland, and the Czech Republic also visited Kyiv in recent days, and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen was in Ukraine Friday, where she was shown the atrocities committed against civilians in Bucha. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer was also in Kyiv earlier Saturday morning.

In the Saturday meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Johnson said, “I think that the Ukrainians have shown the courage of a lion, and you Volodymyr have given the roar of that lion. The U.K. and others [will] supply the equipment, the technology, the know-how, the intelligence, so that Ukraine will never be invaded again. So Ukraine is so fortified and protected — so that Ukraine can never be bullied again. Never be blackmailed again. Never be threatened in the same way again.”

Following news of the meeting going public, Downing Street said the U.K. is offering 120 armored vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems to Ukraine. This comes after the announcement Friday that the government will be sending $130 million in military equipment, including Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles, helmets, night-vision devices, and body armor. In a tweet Saturday, Johnson said, “We’re setting out a new package of financial & military aid which is a testament of our commitment to his [Zelensky] country’s struggle against Russia’s barbaric campaign.”

After Johnson surprised the world with his appearance on the streets of Kyiv, NBC host Chuck Todd pressed National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan Sunday on whether President Joe Biden would do the same. “It was quite the symbol to see Prime Minister Boris Johnson walking the streets of Kyiv with President Zelenskyy,” Todd told Sullivan. “It raises the question: are we going to see President Biden in Kyiv?”

Sullivan responded: “President Biden doesn’t currently have any plans to travel to Kyiv, but I will tell you he sits in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room on a daily basis, organizing and coordinating the world when it comes to the delivery of weapons.”",https://spectator.org/boris-johnson-walks-streets-of-kyiv-in-surprise-visit-to-ukraine/,2022-04-11
Can Russia Outlast Ukraine? - The American Spectator,"The Russian war to conquer Ukraine is nearly 11 months old. The U.S. media, which demands instant gratification, has grown bored with it. Nearly the only media mention of Ukraine occurred when top-secret intelligence information about Ukraine (and Iran and the U.K.) was found at President Biden’s “think tank” in D.C. and in his Delaware home and garage.

We need to pay a lot more attention to Ukraine — and give it the resources it needs to keep fighting — because Russia shows no sign of wanting to end the war despite its heavy losses and internal dissension.

Both sides are underreporting their military losses. Ukraine claimed to have lost about 13,000 troops — and tens of thousands of civilians — as of December. Russia claims that only about 22,000 of its soldiers have been killed, but the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff says that over 100,000 have been killed and an equal number have been wounded.

Many Ukrainian cities have been bombed nearly out of existence, resulting in tens of thousands of civilian deaths and perhaps eight million refugees who have fled, many to other countries. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of civilians, including children, have been forcibly resettled in Russia. As I write this, more Ukrainian civilians are being killed by Russian missiles. That and other Russian war crimes are commonplace.

The war in Ukraine will continue, as this column has noted, at least while Russian President Vladimir Putin lives. It may outlast him because at least two of his principal supporters — Wagner Group creator and commander Yevgeny Prigozhin and Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev — are positioning themselves to succeed him. Both are eager to conquer Ukraine.

Russia, as always, is not monolithic. Its rivals — Prigozhin, the Russian General Staff, Patrushev, and the FSB and GRU intelligence agencies — always joust for power. Last week, the General Staff seemed to lose ground. Gen. Valery Gerasimov, chief of the General Staff, had to take over command of the forces in Ukraine from the latest in a series of commanders there. The rivalry between Prigozhin and the generals has become acute.

We are left to wonder what President Joe Biden’s strategy is. He has sent tens of billions of dollars in aid and military equipment to Ukraine, which is a principal reason Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been able to keep up the fight.

As this column has stated repeatedly, Ukraine most urgently needs more combat aircraft to fight the Russians. Very early in the war, Poland offered more than a dozen MiG-29 fighter bombers to Ukraine but Biden objected to the transfer and it was canceled. Why?

A hint of the reason was recently revealed by Bing West in National Review. West writes that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley “likes to show a note card from a White House meeting in October 2021, five months before the war began. The card reads: ‘Contain war inside the geographical boundaries of Ukraine.’”

West concludes that Biden has created a sanctuary for Russian forces by preventing Ukraine from extending its attacks into Russian territory.

But several Ukrainian attacks have hit Russian territory, at least in Crimea, which Russia annexed nine years ago. In April, Ukrainian helicopters struck an oil depot near the Russian city of Belgorod. At least three Russian soldiers were killed in a Ukrainian attack on the Engels Air Base inside Russia. In August, Ukraine attacked Russia’s Saki Air Base in Crimea. In October, Ukrainian drone ships (and possibly drone submarines) struck the Russian naval base in Sevastopol.

Russian forces are now trying to retake some of the ground they lost to Ukraine in Ukraine’s fall counteroffensive. Heavy fighting is reported in the Donetsk region, near the cities of Soledar and Bakhmut.

Russian soil — and the parts of Ukraine that Russia has tried to annex — cannot be a sanctuary for Russian forces. Ukraine, as noted above, is dependent on the U.S. for military aid if it’s going to keep fighting for its freedom. That aid is now threatened, not only by some faux “conservatives” in Congress, but also by the Biden administration, which is coming to the conclusion that we are running out of ordnance to send there.

Last week, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said, “If the conflict does go on for another six months to another year, it certainly continues to stress the supply chain in ways that are challenging.” Asked whether we need to stop giving aid to Ukraine, Del Toro said, “I wouldn’t say we were quite there yet.” Yet?

Adm. Daryl Caudle, commander of U.S. Fleet Forces Command, said, “I’m not as forgiving of the defense industrial base. I am not forgiving the fact that they’re not delivering the ordnance we need.” Caudle continued, “All this stuff about COVID this, parts, supply chain this, I just don’t really care.” He added, “I need [Standard Missile]-6s delivered on time. I need more [torpedoes] delivered on time.”

Del Toro and Caudle have a legitimate beef. Defense contractors have fallen behind production schedules on ordnance and ships. But the answer is not to cut off aid to Ukraine. The answer is to spend the money to help the relevant contractors get the supplies and people they need to catch up.

Early in the COVID pandemic, former President Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to force companies to give priority to government contracts to develop and produce the COVID vaccines. That law can and should be invoked by Biden to require defense contractors and subcontractors to produce the ordnance we are running low on while we supply what Ukraine needs.

If that isn’t done, the question of whether Russia can outlast Ukraine — and conquer it — is yes. Putin is supposedly drafting another 200,000–300,000 more men for an offensive planned in February. On Jan. 11, Russian naval vessels left their Black Sea port of Novorossiysk en masse, perhaps to practice for that offensive and, perhaps, to enable it to occur sooner.

Ukraine has a population of about 41 million. Russia’s population is about 146 million. As the late and unlamented Joseph Stalin is sometimes purported to have said, “Quantity has a quality all its own.” Ukraine cannot keep feeding troops into the war as long as Russia can.

Biden apparently has no plan to end the Russian war in Ukraine, nor do the NATO nations. Zelensky wants to address the UN on Feb. 24, the first anniversary of the war, but conditions on the ground may prevent him from doing so. Even if Zelensky does, the UN won’t do anything to help.

Gen. Milley, who dabbles in politics far more than any uniformed officer should, said in November that a military solution to the war may be impossible and advocated negotiations with Russia. That caused the White House to scramble to reassure Ukraine of our continued aid.

Negotiations with Russia cannot occur before the coming Russian offensive. If it fails, Putin will want negotiations, but only to gain time for yet another offensive. No peace can come in Ukraine while Putin — and Prigozhin and Patrushev — are alive and while Russian forces are still in Ukraine.

Can Ukraine Kill Climate Change? - The American Spectator,"All apocalyptic movements end in failure, but often only after they have wreaked untold damage on the societies that believe in them. That’s the takeaway from Richard Landes’s Heaven on Earth: The Varieties of the Millennial Experience, which explores the appeal of these movements over the centuries, their chief characteristics, and how they take over societies and eventually run out of steam.

Global warming, for all its scientific veneer, has the basic characteristics of an apocalyptic movement: there is a prophecy of impending doom, a demand for repentance and societal self-sacrifice (in this case, giving up the fossil fuels upon which industrial society depends), and a sense of urgency that if action is not taken immediately, it will be too late. In the end, if the required sacrifices are made, there is an idyllic future. In this case, it’s a green new world, powered by sun and wind. Since its emergence in the 1980s, the global warming apocalypse has shown remarkable resilience, emerging stronger than ever from a near-death experience in November 2009 when leaked emails between top climate scientists exposed their shenanigans in suppressing scientific dissent and deleting data.

What probably saved the movement was that the West’s political elite had by then committed themselves. At the beginning of 2009, global warming had scored its most important convert: President Barack Obama. The hacked emails became news just before 40,000 delegates, including over 100 heads of state, Obama among them, converged on Copenhagen for the 15th annual UN climate conference.

In 2018, the movement obtained a major public relations boost when Greta Thunberg launched an international children’s crusade. President Donald Trump took the United States on a brief time out, but even while still on the campaign trail, now-President Joe Biden promised, “We are going to get rid of fossil fuels.” At the 2021 UN climate conference in Glasgow, Biden showed up from Rome in an 85-car emissions-spewing cavalcade. This time, along with the unusually huge number of delegates — including 27 from Palau (total population: 18,000) — he was one of 120 heads of state. Today, the movement would seem by most measures to be at its peak, riding what Landes would call its “cresting wave.” Yet, it is possible that the crisis in Ukraine may mark the beginning of its end.

This is because, as Rupert Darwall points out in his 2013 book The Age of Global Warming, the theory needs prosperity and a benign global order to thrive, given that global cooperation and commitment are essential to bringing down emissions. Both are threatened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, says it wants to slash Russian gas imports by two-thirds this year. But securing substitutes for cheap Russian oil and gas (Europe gets 40 percent of its oil and gas from Russia) will be a drag on the European standard of living — if sufficient quantities can be found at all. European countries already show signs of recognizing that staving off energy rationing and blackouts overrides climate goals. Thanks to Germany’s heavy investment in renewables, consumers are saddled with the highest electricity costs in Europe. In a statement that would have been unthinkable from a Green Party politician before the invasion of Ukraine, German minister for economic affairs Robert Habeck recently declared, “We have to keep coal-powered plants on standby and maybe even let them operate.” Coal is, of course, the most emissions-rich and polluting of the fossil fuels.

The Biden administration still seems to think it can have it both ways. Biden has promised Europe more natural gas from the United States while showing no signs of walking back his regulatory war against fossil fuels.

The effort to lower global carbon emissions entails other costs. The huge turnout for the UN’s endless stream of climate conferences obscures the extent to which action to constrain global warming is a Western obsession. Obtaining the active participation of non-Western countries in the effort to lower CO2 emissions costs money — to be blunt, they have to be bribed. From their perspective, it is the developed Western countries that have caused the problem, and solving it should not come at the expense of their own development. (RELATED: 35 Leftist Stupidities About the War in Ukraine)

Moreover, the price tag is going up. The developed nations have pledged to give the undeveloped world $100 billion a year until 2025, a goal they have yet to meet. Last year at the Glasgow conference, the 54-member African Group, backed by 24 other countries, including China and India, demanded $1.3 trillion a year thereafter — a tenfold increase. The West, struggling with inflation and the escalating cost of energy, is unlikely to be receptive. That the Russian threat requires sharply rising defense budgets will further reduce Western enthusiasm for funding third-world proposals to combat climate change.

Darwall’s other requirement for global warming to thrive, a benign global order, has also been upended by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Whatever their private opinion of the global warming apocalypse, Russia and China have thus far paid it lip service and sent representatives to conferences. (That their private opinion is low is suggested by the fact that neither Russian President Vladimir Putin nor Chinese President Xi Jinping showed up at Glasgow or even sent any new proposals to cut down their emissions.) Now, in place of a benign social order, it looks as if a new Cold War is shaping up with Russia and China leading the opposing side. The incentive to soothe Western sensibilities by engaging in annual climate change rituals will be gone. China has already announced it will be expanding domestic coal mining by 300 million tons a year.

Despite Europe’s efforts, greenhouse gas emissions have been going up steadily since the first UN climate conference in 1995, with the highest emissions to date produced in 2021. And despite the steady stream of warnings over the last few decades that there were only 12 (or 10 or nine) years before irreparable damage to the planet, the world’s major cities have not sunk under rising seas nor have climate refugees poured over borders. (That there are currently millions of refugees escaping intolerable conditions is due to Putin, not climate change.) If Russia and China, the countries that produce 35 percent of the world’s carbon emissions, opt-out, the West may well tire of shouldering the heavy, now patently useless burden of making their own economies achieve “zero-net emissions.”

Landes likens the life cycle of apocalyptic movements to “waves.” The fourth and final wave is the receding wave when the movement goes out to sea. Whenever that happens, it will leave in its wake a multitude of corroding offshore windmills.

Charity Tournament for Ukraine Excludes Belarusian Player Who Spoke Out Against Russia’s Invasion - The American Spectator,"Maybe I’ve always fallen for connecting dots that bear no connecting, but it struck me as odd — not unfair, as that would be expressing a bias, which is a no-no to old-school fair-and-accurate types such as myself — that Novak Djokovic, the best active tennis player in the world, or at least tied for such with at most two others — withdrew from the U.S. Open because he cannot enter the U.S. due to not being vaccinated against the Red Chinese flu.

The United States Tennis Association, which owns the tournament, had the good sense to say the decision would not be theirs, thus avoiding the kind of imbroglio that Djokovic ran into in Australia. Then, Tennis Australia indicated to him he would get a medical exemption (along with several other players) upon the certification of a blind medical exam assuring he had good cause to ask for one. They were overruled by federal officials, necessitating that Djokovic stay several nights in a quarantine hotel while the issue was debated among deep legal minds.

So due to a decision by U.S. medical authorities no one elected, he is not getting on a plane. However, what struck me was not that the process here was clear, if scary; what pricked my brain was that it is not at all clear that the illegal migrants New York City has been welcoming are vaccinated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requires a medical examination and vaccination for people (including illegals) seeking legal residency, but this is a process that only begins once they are granted formal permission to stay in the country at least for the duration of the process.

Capisce? Double standard? Or plain idiocy?

Meanwhile, on the women’s side, Victoria Azarenka as well as other Belorussian and Russian players will be in the draw, but Vika was excluded from a charity tournament this week for Ukraine, even though she personally and courageously went on the record against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

So, I ask you, are we witnessing, and aiding and abetting, the kind of treatment that can lead to internment camps?

As you may recall, this kind of thing — fear and accusation toward entire ethnonational classes of people — has happened and can happen again in moments of know-nothing emotion. At the start of World War II, thousands, if not tens of thousands, of hardworking, patriotic, mostly West Coast Americans, hardy fishermen, farmers, and small businessmen, were rounded up because they were descendants of immigrants (legal ones) from Japan. They were placed in unpleasant detention camps in climates they were unaccustomed to and unprepared for. They suffered pain, humiliation, and loss of income. These were not German concentration camps or Soviet gulags, but then ours is a free country, rule of law and all that. Our standards are higher.

Keep in mind we are the one country that has corrected its laws when it has done injustice by law. And so Japanese Americans volunteered to fight fascist and Nazi totalitarianism and covered themselves with glory. Notably, the mythic 442nd Regimental Combat Team earned a record 21 Medals of Honor.

This sort of courage and patriotism was true, too, of the Harlem Hellfighters, or the Men of Bronze, as the 369th New York was called in World War I. They fought ahead of the famed Rainbow Division in French uniforms due to the American military’s reluctance to include colored troops in regular combat units. This was the Jim Crow era, and these were New Yorkers who knew perfectly well what the score was back home. Their French commander, Gen. Henri Gouraud, awarded them a regimental Croix de Guerre and the honor of being the first Allied troops to cross the Rhine. When in the Fifth Avenue victory parade they reached 110th Street where it was supposed to conclude, they kept right on marching to a syncopated “La Marseillaise” arranged by their famous band and shouted “Vive Gouraud!” And not one of them ever complained that the U.S. Army refused them due honors and benefits.

And there were so many more: Jews facing anti-Semitism in the ranks while fighting a regime whose program was based on their extermination, sons of Italian immigrants putting up with taunts for being related to the enemy, and the Navajo code talkers. Well, we know this. And we know the last, best hope on earth is a hope filled with broken promises and shameful failures, but it is the best hope just the same.

So the slight paid Miss Azarenka — which obviously, but in all fairness, does not compare — is nothing new. It is regrettable, but she can live with it and does, in good grace. If it makes the Ukrainian tennis players who protested her presence at the event feel better, fine. ‘Tis not for us to begrudge them nor to point out the millions, or is it billions, of American dollars in arms that New York state taxpayers, along with those of 49 other states, are sending their government to help their resistance. Yet it might be well to ask them to show some reservation in their feelings for others in their line of work who happen to have been born a few miles away.

This is sad, yes, and it is a shame to mix sports up with the world’s wickedness. And meanwhile, sports are still here to entertain and inspire. We might want to complain about the high price of tickets at the U.S. Open, but it is the World Series of tennis and these prices help young players who have yet to make it. This year, just for showing up at the qualifiers (the 16 out of 128 who won three matches this week get into the main draw), you get $20,000. If you get to the main draw first round, you get $80,000, and that is if you lose. So a charity tournament for Ukraine is very nice, and I hope it goes directly to real people and real soldiers.

I should not apologize for the sour note, but OK I will, and now it is nice to think of catching a match with Serena Williams, which may or may not be her last, according to the consensus in the sports press. I am not so sure about her announced “final tournament before retirement” because look at Tom Brady. And although she did not shine in her most recent match play in Toronto and Cincinnati, with someone so talented and competitive, a deep run is not improbable, and even a win — against a hot number like Iga Świątek or Caroline Garcia or even her longtime friend and rival Vika Azarenka (who lost two finals here to her) — yes, even a win is possible.

In New York, in America, anything is. That, remember, is a line spoken by a Puerto Rican bullied by one of New York’s finest.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/a-further-perspective/,2022-08-28
Did China Give Russia a ‘Blank Check’ for Ukraine Invasion? - The American Spectator,"On July 6, 1914, German Foreign Minister Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg sent a telegram to Germany’s Ambassador to Austria-Hungary instructing him to inform Emperor Francis Joseph that while Kaiser Wilhelm II “cannot interfere in the dispute now going on between Austria-Hungary and that country [Serbia],” Austria-Hungary may “rest assured that His Majesty [Germany] will faithfully stand by Austria-Hungary, as is required by the obligations of his [Germany’s] alliance and … friendship.” This was the so-called “blank check” whereby Germany pledged to support Austria-Hungary if it went to war against Serbia. Emboldened by Germany’s “blank check,” Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to the Serbs (a document that Winston Churchill called “the most insolent … of its kind ever devised”), then declared war against Serbia on July 28, 1914, and shelled Belgrade — one month after Serbian terrorists assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife in Sarajevo. Thus began the war that George Kennan called the “seminal catastrophe” of the 20th century.

Fast forward to February 4, 2022. China’s President Xi Jinping and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin declared in Beijing that their “partnership” had “no limits.” Three weeks later, Russia invaded Ukraine. Did Putin interpret this partnership without limits as a “blank check” that emboldened him to invade Ukraine? Was Xi signaling to Putin that China would back Russia in its Ukraine venture? Washington Post China expert Josh Rogin has written that President Xi is Putin’s “co-conspirator” in the Ukraine war. Since the war began, China has diplomatically sided with Russia, and as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Reid Standish notes, China’s “state-run media have pushed Russia’s narrative of the invasion to audiences at home and abroad.” And Raffaello Pantucci of London’s Royal United Services Institute has noted the “durability of the China-Russia relationship” even in the face of Western sanctions and international condemnation.

One week before Russia invaded Ukraine, China and Russia agreed to expand their energy relationship, including a coal deal worth $20 billion and oil and gas deals worth more than $117 billion. BBC News reports that the two countries seek to construct a gas pipeline that will be worth more than $400 billion. China may be helping Russia financially and militarily, though China calls reports of the latter “fake news.” And the Economist warns that Western statesmen would be foolish to underestimate Xi’s bond with Putin, which is fueled by shared geopolitical interests. (READ MORE from Francis P. Sempa: On Russia and China, Welcome Back to the 19th Century)

Germany’s blank check to Austria-Hungary set Europe ablaze in a war that few statesmen wanted and even fewer believed would last more than four years, claim over 15 million lives, produce over 40 million casualties, lead to the fall of four empires, spawn the twin ideologies of fascism and communism, and lead to an even more deadly and destructive global war.

We don’t know how the Ukraine war will end. It is already a tragedy for the Ukrainian people, and risks becoming a broader European and perhaps global nightmare. China’s “blank check” to Russia — if that is what it was — will live in infamy if, as in the case of Germany in 1914, it sets in motion events that help trigger what Winston Churchill memorably described as “a world of monstrous shadows moving in convulsive combinations through vistas of fathomless catastrophe.”",https://spectator.org/category/politics/another-perspective/,2022-04-23
China’s Share of Ukraine - The American Spectator,"Xi Jinping’s China, which is Vladimir Putin’s silent partner in Ukraine, is penetrating global finance, agriculture, energy, and government systems in order to amass data on a hitherto unknown scale.

Machine learning — which is well short of real artificial intelligence — has to be based on massive databases from which computers can learn and predict what the next set of data should be.

We know, for example, that China is gathering DNA data on millions of people, including Americans, for its own reasons. It is entirely possible that the DNA of a virus can be “tuned” to be deadly to one racial or ethnic group and not another. The Chinese may have such research into bioweapons well under way.

Simpler data gathering, and espionage, can be accomplished by many routes. We’ve known since the 2003 “Titan Rain” Chinese computer attacks on American networks of China’s deeply penetrating and endless attempts to infiltrate U.S. government-connected computer systems, such as those of intelligence, military, and military contractors. These attacks come hundreds or thousands of times each day.

We spend billions each year trying to guard against cyberattacks by China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Sometimes our defenses are sufficient, and sometimes they are not.

China’s efforts to gather data take many more forms and can penetrate to any level, grand or trivial.

On February 4, in Beijing, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping stood together on the opening day of the Chinese Winter Olympics. They announced a new strategic partnership between the two regimes.

In a joint statement, the two leaders said, “Friendship between the two States has no limits, there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation,” promising to work against the United States and supporting each other on Ukraine and Taiwan. Putin probably shared with Xi his plans for the invasion of Ukraine.

Xi is Putin’s silent partner in the Ukraine war.

A friend of mine has a young teenage son. He bought his son a fairly expensive Chinese-made drone, produced by a company called Da-Jiang Innovations (DJI). They took the drone to a large private area they often visit and flew it, taking videos with the drone’s camera.

A couple of weeks later, my friend checked out the DJI website. On it, he found some of the videos he and his son took. DJI, through its “AeroScope” program, gathers real-time information from DJI’s drones, which include both the recorded videos and the location of the drone operator. What happened to my friend is happening to Ukrainian forces fighting against the Russian invasion.

Ukraine has been using several types of drones to spot Russian forces and direct its own to counter them. Many of those drones were made in the U.S., Turkey, and China.

The Chinese drones are products of DJI. As a result, the Ukrainians believe, China is sharing intelligence information with the Russians that helps said Russians locate the Ukrainian drone operators. That data sharing gives the Russian forces an enormous tactical advantage in combat.

In March, Ukrainian Minister of Digital Information Mykhailo Fedorov wrote DJI’s chairman asking him to block AeroSpace from tracking any of his company’s drones that were purchased and activated in Ukraine. (Why he unwisely limited his request to only some drones in Ukraine is a mystery.) In response, DJI halted drone sales to both Russia and Ukraine and said it “abhorred” the use of drones in combat.

There is no reason to believe China has halted its information sharing with Russia because, as Putin and Xi have stated, their alliance is unlimited.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine continues with fighting concentrated in the eastern Donbas region. Russia’s defense ministry claimed that missile strikes in western Ukraine killed up to 80 Polish fighters who were trying to keep the flow of Western weaponry going into Ukraine. In Ukraine’s north, Russia has renewed its strikes on Kyiv, possibly trying to get lucky and kill Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky or at least further disrupt the functioning of Ukraine’s government.

Ukrainian forces are, as usual, outgunned. Russian artillery — which can be spotted by Ukrainian air forces, including drones — may be countered, in some degree, by the arrival of long-delayed U.S. multiple launch rockets. Whatever the result, both sides are continuing to lose troops at a steady and alarming rate.

A recent Washington Post report said that Western experts expect Russia will soon exhaust its military capabilities in the Donbas region. That’s possible, but Russia will not give up on Putin’s ambition to conquer Ukraine. If Russian forces exhaust their current capabilities, Putin might slow his campaign and regroup. He will continue to spend whatever it takes to reach his goal.

For Putin, a direct Chinese intervention, such as sending troops to fight with the Russians in Ukraine, would be a blow to Putin’s prestige that he can’t afford. It’s highly unlikely that China will intervene directly in the Ukraine war, but it will continue to intervene indirectly as it possibly has with its drones.

Russia, with China’s help, will continue its cyberwar against Ukraine. Though Russia has its own considerable cyberwar capabilities, China can — and will — aid its cyberespionage effort by, for example, penetrating Ukraine’s cellphone networks.

Putin’s alliance with Xi should be among President Joe Biden’s major concerns, but it evidently is not. That evidence is, in part, shown by Congress’s inattention to building up our forces in order to counter China’s in the Indo-Pacific region, which obviously includes Taiwan.

In a recent interview, Indo-Pacific Command’s boss, Adm. John Aquilino, contested congressional Democrats’ inattention to what he needs to counter China. They provided him with more assets such as an increase in the number of littoral combat ships, which are neither survivable in combat nor among Aquilino’s greatest needs.

Meanwhile, Biden and his cabinet, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, are more concerned with the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade.

As this column has stated before, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is the war that ended peace. Lithuania is playing with fire by enforcing sanctions against Russian shipments passing through Lithuanian land to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. By doing so, Lithuania, a NATO member, is putting itself at the top of Putin’s attack list. Meanwhile, Russia has moved nuclear-capable missiles into Belarus, which borders Ukraine.

At the same time, Xi’s military is preparing for its conquest of Taiwan.

Our military planners used to be intent on preparing for a two-front war. But we no longer have the capability of fighting such a war. Biden’s profound weakness lies in making war more likely in Europe, in Taiwan, and with Iran. He is rendering our military a shambles.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/at-large/,2022-06-28
Conservative Isolationists Gather in D.C. to Push Against U.S. Escalation in Ukraine - The American Spectator,"Conservative thinkers and leaders who believe in foreign policy restraint met Thursday for an “emergency conference” in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Many of the speakers conjectured that the media and political elite are escalating the U.S.’s role in the conflict in worrying ways. Sen. Rand Paul, Ohio Senate candidate J. D. Vance, Compact magazine founder Sohrab Ahmari, “Breaking Points” host Saagar Enjeti, and Federalist editor-in-chief Mollie Hemingway were among the speakers.

The isolationist strand of conservatism has grown in recent decades, as it was accelerated by distaste for the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan. The American Conservative, one of the co-sponsors of the conference, was founded in opposition to the Iraq War in 2002. Conservative isolationists found their ideas brought to the forefront in 2016 when then-candidate Donald Trump delivered a speech calling for “a new foreign policy direction for our country” that would replace “chaos with peace.”

“My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else,” said Trump. “It has to be first. Has to be.”

The conference seemed to echo the language from Trump’s speech in its title: “Up From Chaos: Conserving American Security.” American Moment, the other co-sponsor of the event, introduced its conference by blaming the invasion of Ukraine on Washington’s “failed, bipartisan foreign policy consensus.”

“Since the end of the Cold War,” American Moment’s event description says, “American elites squandered our peace dividend and chose instead to pursue endless and aimless engagement abroad.”

Many of the conference’s speakers postulated that America’s media and political class is egging on a further escalation against Russia. Joe Kent, a congressional candidate from Washington, told attendees that the elite is “dead set” on sending the U.S. into the conflict. Hemingway aimed her ire at the media, saying, “CNN is pushing for escalation.”

Others used the word “propaganda” to describe information coming out of Ukraine which they claimed is meant to encourage the U.S. to involve itself in the conflict.

Rachel Bovard, the senior director of policy at the Conservative Partnership Institute, said that the conflict in Ukraine is being filtered to the U.S. through “mass narrative control.” Bovard said that there is “an element of narrative shaping that plays into America’s moral fervor.” There’s a “hype that captures us,” she said.

Micah Meadowcroft, the managing editor of the American Conservative, drew attention to American shows of support for Ukraine and pointed out that the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., has been lit up in blue and yellow lights for “night after night.” He asked what would be different “propaganda-wise” if the U.S. were actually a belligerent in the war.

“Why,” asked Hemingway, “is the American public being targeted by a propaganda campaign?”

Vance argued that the conflict is being framed in explicitly moral terms in the United States. Taking a realist stance on foreign policy, he argued that one should always separate care and concern for people around the world from policymaking. “Let’s step back and separate ourselves from the moral dimensions,” he said in reference to what one should do when evaluating a conflict.

Vance concluded that Ukraine is not in the vital interest of the United States. Thus, according to his restrained foreign policy goals, he believes the U.S. should not involve itself. Further, Vance said he believes NATO is “not actually serving an especially useful function.” He asked, “In practice, what does [NATO] actually do for us?” and said, “Using American power to do the dirty work for NATO is a pretty bad idea.”

Vance has faced strong backlash — including, he said at the conference, from some of his own donors — for his remarks on Ukraine. “I gotta be honest with you,” Vance said in the leadup to the invasion, “I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.” He later said, “Spare me the performative affection for the Ukraine.” He has since fallen in the polls, receiving 11 percent support in the most recent one. The Ohio Senate primary will be held on May 3.

In his speech, Vance lauded University of Chicago professor John Mearsheimer, calling him “one of the great realist thinkers in American foreign policy.” Mearsheimer blames the West for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in line with his theory that great powers seek to achieve regional hegemony in an international system which is anarchical. NATO’s expansion, he argues, therefore incited Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine in order to preserve that hegemony. Others have argued that Mearsheimer’s claim that Russia felt threatened by NATO expansion or by the possibility that Ukraine would join NATO is just buying into Russian propaganda, as Putin had no real reason to fear that NATO would attack him.

Vance was not alone in lauding Mearsheimer. Adam Korzeniewski, who was an official in the Treasury Department during the Trump administration, did so as well, while Dan Caldwell, the vice president of foreign policy at Stand Together, denounced the fierceness of the ongoing attacks on Mearsheimer.

Some of the speakers argued that the U.S. has already escalated its response to the Russian invasion to an inappropriate level.

Kent, for instance, said that the U.S. is “backing [Putin] into a corner.” He continued, saying, “This is going to lead to a World War III scenario or a prolonged campaign in Ukraine.”

He argued that the sanctions the U.S. has imposed on Russia are so excessive that they could lead to the “death of the U.S. dollar.” He said that the U.S. is setting itself up for a “financial Pearl Harbor.” What the U.S. is doing in Ukraine, he argued, is “wrong for the American people.” Kent urged for diplomacy to be used to put a stop to the conflict, saying at one point that it would be reasonable for Putin to demand parts of eastern Ukraine, which he noted are Russian-speaking.

Kent’s account of the damage he said the sanctions are creating back home showcased that some of the Right’s new isolationist thinkers are even more doctrinaire in their restraint than the isolationists of the past. In comparison to the isolationism of many of the other speakers, Paul seemed almost hawkish as he voiced his support for putting sanctions on Russia. He has long been seen as following in the isolationist direction of his father, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul. Paul also noted that the invasion has been a disaster for Putin.

Some in recent weeks have denounced the isolationist Right’s rhetoric and occasional suspicion of Ukraine as being pro-Putin, which the speakers repeatedly mentioned and attempted to ward off with disclaimers that they do in fact denounce Putin’s invasion and feel for the people of Ukraine.

Vance argued against the perspective that the conflict in Ukraine is as simple as “good guys vs. bad guys.” He accidentally had a slip of the tongue and said, “The guy in Russia is good, sorry I mean bad,” in reference to Putin, thus quickly clarifying that he is not pro-Putin as he has been made out to be.

Meadowcroft took on a similar perspective that the war in Ukraine isn’t so black and white, and quoted Russian novelist and Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn to illustrate this point. He read: “If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.”

While the speakers at this conference favor isolationism, most Republicans in the House and the Senate have been pushing President Joe Biden to stand up even more aggressively against Putin, setting up a heated debate in the conservative movement.

Don’t Be Fooled by the Idea of China Intervening in Ukraine - The American Spectator,"Amidst the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there are increasing calls for China to intervene based on the view that China is the only country that can stop Putin’s aggression. This view is gaining popularity and thus needs to be seriously evaluated. Before I do that, I want to clarify how I use the term “China”: it refers to the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), or the party leader Xi Jinping.

First, let’s review a few facts:

In early February, China and Russia partnered up against the democratic countries at the Beijing Olympics summit, declaring a “no limits” strategic cooperation.

Since the invasion, China has refused to call Russia’s invasion an “invasion.”

In early March, China announced that it would not join sanctions against Russia.

The Western elites who believe China is the only country that can stop the Russian invasion tend to be political analysts, businesspeople, or academics who have interests in or close ties with China.

These facts should be enough to conclude that believing China will intervene is a pipe dream. But empirical evidence is not enough to understand the Chinese Communist Party. We must go into the most fundamental reasons why China will not intervene.

The two most important principles of the CCP are political ideology and economic interest.

Ideologically, the CCP worships political power and military force. As the CCP’s founder, Mao Zedong (1893–1976), put it, “Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.” For the CCP, there is no right or wrong but power and force. Thus, ideologically, the CCP stands firmly with dictators such as Putin.

Economically, the CCP is practical and pro-business. The party is very good at grabbing resources and using money as a weapon to influence the elites of the world. This is why it prefers stability. In his annual speech to the National People’s Congress a few days ago, Premier Li Keqiang mentioned “stability” 81 times.

Thus, economically, China may have some incentive to end the Russia–Ukraine conflict because wars cause instability and hurt the economic activities of the world, including China. And this seems to be the argument made by the pro-China camp, either naively or deceitfully. But either way, this view is wrong.

For the CCP, political ideology always trumps economic interest. The reason is simple: maintaining its absolute rule by force is the most important — and the only — goal. Why does the CCP care about economic benefit if it no longer rules? This sounds familiar. Putin said, “Why do we need a world if Russia is not in it?” Of course, his “Russia” is his Russia.

The overriding political ideology dictates that China — the CCP and Xi Jinping — stands shoulder to shoulder with Putin and therefore will never oppose the latter’s aggression.

If the above analysis is not enough to convince the well-intentioned people in the democracies, we can look further at what the CCP has done beyond the Russian invasion:

It is sending warplanes to harass and intimidate Taiwan on a daily basis.

It has destroyed the rule of law and human rights in Hong Kong.

It practices an ethnic cleansing policy against the Uyghur people in Xinjiang.

It has been supporting the Kim dynasty in North Korea, Venezuela’s Maduro, communist Cuba, and other dictatorships.

According to the late Soviet President Andrei Gromyko, in 1958, Mao Zedong suggested that China lure the U.S. troops into China and then attack them with Soviet atomic bombs.

Since its founding in 1921, the CCP has waged numerous political campaigns that killed millions of people.

All these show that CCP is a brutal political and military machine that does not hesitate to use force to achieve its goal.

Compared with the political system of Russia, the CCP is categorically more dictatorial and powerful. As Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) put it, we are “50 times more vulnerable to China than we ever have been to Russia.” (READ MORE: Ukraine: China to the Rescue?)

But the CCP is also opportunistic and deceitful. It has many faces; it tells Putin that it is firmly behind his invasion, sends some humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and at the same time tells the U.S. that “sound China-US relations bring benefits to both countries and beyond.” It also mobilizes the world’s elites on its payroll to sing along that “only China can stop Russia and save the world.”

The democratic countries have fallen to these tricks many times, just like the trusting Charlie Brown always believes that he will kick the football held by Lucy this time.

It is time we quit wishful thinking and stop being fooled by China, again.

Establishment Scholar: Trust Iran’s ‘Moderates’ Not to Build Nukes - The American Spectator,"As protests rage across Iran, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim–Christian Understanding (ACMCU) Honorary Fellow and perennial think tanker Shireen T. Hunter assured her audience that American policymakers “know that Iran doesn’t have that kind of capacity” to develop nuclear weapons. Although being “certainly no nuclear expert,” she ventured this naïve assessment during an Oct. 26 ACMCU webinar, “Iran Takes a Conservative Turn,” during which she romanticized about reforming Iran’s Islamic Republic.

Webinar moderator John Esposito, founding director of the Saudi-endowed ACMCU, introduced Hunter, whose résumé includes distinguished think-tank stints (including the Center for Strategic and International Studies) and Carnegie Endowment awards. Setting the tone for the well-published Hunter’s latest media appearance, Esposito lamented that then-President Donald Trump in 2018 withdrew America from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear proliferation agreement with Iran. Esposito asserted — against all evidence — that “Iran continued to observe the JCPOA.” Thereafter, imaginary “Iranian reformists” — always on the cusp of power but for American intransigence — lost power to “hardliners,” i.e., Iran’s leaders, so that Iran now has “a more intractable conservative government.”

Reflecting a belief of the academic Left that in time was adopted by the diplomatic establishment, Hunter concurred that “Iranian moderates” had negotiated the JCPOA, “which literally put a cap on any Iranian ability to develop nuclear weapons.” Only “some minor peaceful uses were agreed upon” in the JCPOA for nuclear research, she added, yet these individuals “lost credibility” to “hardliners” because of continuing American sanctions. Her faith that Iran respected the JCPOA, including in its production of heavy water, have proven misplaced in recent years.

“The U.S. held out for the best and ignored the good,” Hunter has said repeatedly over the years concerning American relations with the terrorism-supporting Islamic Republic. After 9/11, Iran cooperated with the United States in its counterterrorism efforts in Afghanistan, she claimed, ignoring Iran’s longstanding support for al-Qaeda. President George W. Bush in 2002 (correctly) denounced Iran as a member of his “axis of evil,” a move Hunter criticized. Citing neither evidence nor logic, she alleged that the “Iran issue has been manipulated” while the “Bush administration actively encouraged Arab–Iranian tensions or Sunni–Shia tensions after 2003 Iraqi invasion.”

In fact, the agreement with the still-cheating, ever-brutal Iran was terrible from its inception, based as it was on elusive “Iranian moderates” who, like unicorns, are sought perpetually by the mullahs’ apologists.

Examples of this search abound. The agenda of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, one of Hunter’s faux reformers, lost influence after his presidential term ended in 2005 “in part because of the lack of response from George Bush administration to Iran’s overtures.” She cited an alleged 2003 letter from Iranian diplomats to American officials outlining a rapprochement, which analysts have revealed as merely the freelancing initiative of a Swiss diplomat. “At certain times,” she cooed, “Khatami did not talk about Israel’s destruction,” yet she neglected to mention that he made his support of any Israeli–Palestinian peace dependent upon Hamas’ consent, an unlikely prospect from jihadists. She considered President Hassan Rouhani’s 2013–2021 administration as the “last chance for a kind of evolutionary reform in Iran,” a superficial assertion that numerous analysts would deny.

By contrast, Hunter’s own comments suggested a far more ideologically driven, less reformable Islamic Republic of Iran. Downplaying Iranian thuggery, she referenced Iran’s current unrest, unleashed by the “death of a young woman apparently at the hands of Iran’s security forces … who were unhappy with her inadequate head-covering.” She observed that the “new generation, the generation that was born in the 2000s, no longer seems to be sharing the religious-based ideology of the state,” as “even the hardliners are admitting.” Now the “regime is actually at the moment in a bind,” for “abolishing the compulsory hijab” or offering any other liberalization “will be seen as a sign of weakness and then this will lead to other demands.”

“This is the dilemma of in general an ideological system, this is what happened in the Soviet Union as well. Can a government or regime survive if it gives up its ideological principles?” Hunter asked. This “is haunting the Supreme Leader [Ali] Khamenei. Can the Islamic Republic survive if it doesn’t try to impose hijab compulsorily?” she asked. Unpersuasively, she suggested that her “own feeling is that, yes, they can.”

Like the old Soviet Union, Hunter noted, Iran’s “current regime does not look at itself to be concerned mainly with Iran.” The Islamic Republic “looks behind its back to see what the impact of its policies is going to be among its constituents in the broader Muslim world,” she explained. If the Islamic Republic “dilutes its Islamic orthodoxy or whatever, will it lose its allies?”

Such a regime would go down fighting, Hunter reasoned. “There will be no repeat of 1979,” when Iran’s Islamic Revolution overthrew the shah, for the “current government is unlikely, like the shah, for example, to just leave.” For the Islamic Republic’s leaders, “these guys will do whatever it takes,” creating a “real danger in Iran of sudden collapse of power. I don’t think that this is going to be a kind of easy thing, that the regime will dismantle itself.”

Despite the establishment’s reformist dreams — nurtured by academics like Hunter and Esposito — that Iran’s theocracy is stable and trustworthy, the mullahs’ rule is more likely to end with a bang than with a whimper. That religious dictatorship in Iran could somehow accommodate political pragmatism, much less pluralism, was always a pious hope, the weak foundation for numerous bad acts of faith, like the JCPOA. On Iran, as with so many other matters, many of Middle East studies’ leading oracles, for all the tribute they collect in tuition and taxpayer dollars, have proved themselves to be false prophets.

Will a GOP House Majority Put the Brakes on Ukraine Escalation? - The American Spectator,"It’s a distinct possibility, though there are too many variables to predict it, that if the Republicans take the House there will be some sort of conclusion to the war in Ukraine.

This column has called for just that. Not in a shameful betrayal of the freedom-loving people who’ve fought by our side, like, for example, what the Democrats did to the South Vietnamese after an honorable peace was reached in Paris, but rather in a way that preserves our interests and keeps Joe Biden’s much-ballyhooed nuclear Armageddon away.

It doesn’t seem that Team Biden is very interested in such a peace. It’s not in evidence that the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill is committed to it, either. But a statement made Wednesday by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who is likely three weeks away from being the House speaker–elect, might indicate that it’s more possible than it was a few days ago:

House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy warned Tuesday that Republicans will not write a “blank check” for Ukraine if they win back the House majority, reflecting his party’s growing skepticism about financial support for Kyiv as it battles Russia’s invasion. “I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,” McCarthy told Punchbowl News. “They just won’t do it. … It’s not a free blank check.” The comments from McCarthy, who is in line to become speaker if Republicans win the House, raised fresh questions about the resiliency of America’s support for Ukraine as a growing number of Republicans, particularly those aligned with Donald Trump’s “America First” approach, question the need for federal spending abroad at a time of record-high inflation at home. Since Russia launched its invasion in February, Congress has approved tens of billions in emergency security and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine, while the Biden administration has shipped billions worth of weapons and equipment from military inventories. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre sidestepped Tuesday afternoon when asked about McCarthy’s comments. She instead thanked congressional leaders for bipartisan work to “support Ukraine to defend itself from Russia’s war crimes and atrocities.” “We will continue to work with Congress and continue to monitor those conversations on these efforts and support Ukraine as long as it takes,” she said. “We are going to keep that promise that we’re making to the brave Ukrainians who are fighting every day, to fight for their freedom and their democracy.”

We’ve unloaded more money this year on Ukraine, with fewer controls on that outlay, than we spend on our crumbling highway infrastructure. And we’ve spent that money at a time when prices of everything are skyrocketing — and our own military is, by its own estimation, eminently likely to lose the next significant war it fights (we’ve already lost an “insignificant” — if you’ll forgive the dismissive tone of such a characterization — war in Afghanistan thanks to poor leadership over 20 years). Ukraine, a country that has strategic value to American national interests only with respect to its status as a laundromat for our governmental elite, is hardly a place worthy of nuclear, or even conventional, brinksmanship.

That’s not just my judgment. Go look at those polls the various organizations are taking of the American people and see where Ukraine ranks compared to, for example, the border, inflation, and crime in our streets. It might be a top-tier issue for Team Biden and the rest of our ruling elite, but it sure doesn’t play in Peoria.

The interesting thing is, were the Ukraine war to end right now, we could claim it as a success — in that our efforts have preserved the territorial integrity, for the most part if nothing else, of Ukraine and that they’ve cut the vaunted Russian army to ribbons using, essentially, 25-year-old surplus gear. As proxy wars go, this has been a nice winner, if an expensive one.

Of course, anyone who thinks it needed to cost us more than $60 billion to accomplish what’s been accomplished is an utter moron. Don’t be shocked to see blowback on a monster scale if and when the weapons our tax dollars bought, which were subsequently resold to God-knows-whom, are inevitably brought to bear … somewhere.

Not to mention the ever-turning drums at the laundromat wringing out comfortable retirements for well-connected Beltway denizens of various stripes.

How much faith do we put in McCarthy as a bringer of peace to Ukraine? I’m certainly not suggesting much. But it does appear that his ascension as House speaker would signify some accountability and rationality to the taxpayer-funded bacchanal of escalation that Team Biden is bent on.

Perhaps more aid to the Ukrainians is warranted. Perhaps there is no peace to be had there … yet.

But taking away Team Biden’s limitless credit card where Ukraine is concerned is something long overdue. And without it, maybe, just maybe, the administration might be motivated to sit down with the Russians and craft a peace that serves our interests and keeps our cities from glowing in the dark for reasons not involving a functional power grid.

That we can no longer take that last piece for granted, in all the possible interpretations, is damage enough. Vote Republican on Nov. 8.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/commie-watch/,2022-10-21
Homage to Ukraina - The American Spectator,"In Kiev, one never really knew who was Russian and who was Ukrainian. But the wool was pulled from my eyes one Saturday afternoon when the academic in charge of German scholars and I had a chat over watermelon and I asked him if he was Ukrainian. At that, shifting from Russian to Ukrainian, he launched into a long passage from Ukraine’s greatest and most heroic poet, Taras Shevchenko (1814–61), words full of violent and withering disdain for oppressor Russians, which in his recitation very much matched his own. Having absorbed that, I can’t say anything about Ukraine since February 24 has surprised me.

Unfortunately, that includes the unspeakable, barbaric cruelty set in motion by one Vladimir Putin, whose threats to resort to nuclear weapons were already enough to put a bounty on his head. Putin has said all along he just wants to reunify with Russia’s “younger brothers” even as he insists Russia and Ukraine share a common starting point going back to ninth-century Kievan Rus’. Given that Moscow got its start in the thirteenth century at the earliest, as a lowly vassal state of the Mongols (sort of the way it’s now willing to be China’s), perhaps Russia would have better luck if it called itself Ukraine’s younger brother.

Too late, alas. Ukrainians no longer have any use for it. No one with any self-respect wants fraternal relations of any sort with Putin and his willing subjects. It might be good to remind conservatives who’ve wished to wash their hands of Ukraine that Ronald Reagan fought the Cold War because, for starters, he loathed what he called the Evil Empire. No one wants it back or to see Reagan’s greatest triumph squandered. Reagan chose freedom, as all along we supposedly have. Ukraine has chosen it as well, and who lately has deserved it more?",https://spectator.org/category/politics/daily-folios-and-consecutive-sentences/,2022-05-15
How Future Historians Will View Ukraine - The American Spectator,"I can’t get the horror of the Russian atrocities in Ukraine out of my head. I keep hearing that cute little toddler crying out hysterically, “Daddy, Mommy is dead!” Her mother was killed in her apartment by a Russian bomb. The videos of teenage Russian conscripts burning to death in their tanks from Javelin missiles don’t make me feel much better.

Is there any point to all of this needless human suffering? “History does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme.” Perhaps it is time to start reflecting on what Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will mean to future historians.

What we are witnessing is the breakdown of the prevailing world order that Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev called “peaceful co-existence” in which nations with different systems respect one another’s borders. Proxy wars, maybe, but no mass invasions. Since World War II, the U.S. and Russia have fought lots of little wars in which “our guys” kill and maim “their guys,” as if modern warfare were an Olympic sport. Nixon and Kissinger called it “Vietnamization,” but proxy warfare goes back to the Romans, who used soldiers from conquered countries to do a lot of the dying for Rome.

Francis Fukuyama, then a mid-level bureaucrat, proclaimed in 1989 that the fall of the Berlin Wall marked the “end of history.” His not very good article is unjustly famous for its clever title. History never ends, at least not until World War III ends everything. The win for the West heralded by Fukuyama was supposedly that the people of the world had realized that liberty and free but regulated markets create better lives. However, that idea has still not been accepted everywhere. Some countries still believe that autocrats like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping own the future.

For sure, the war in Ukraine will be seen as the last gasp of a dying empire, but which one — the Russian or the American? The last time we got this close to World War III was in 1962 when Russia put nuclear missiles in Cuba in violation of our Monroe Doctrine. Many Americans mistakenly think that is a law. On the contrary, it was a unilateral declaration by a rising America in 1823 of its sphere of influence and a warning to European powers to keep their mitts off our hemisphere. That’s pretty much what Putin says about Ukraine, and President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have validated his claim by saying that we will not put boots on the ground or send MIGs to Ukraine but will only defend full-fledged members of NATO.

I predicted that Putin would not invade because Biden was in the process of accepting his claims to a sphere of influence. I was wrong, but not because I misjudged Biden but because I did not understand that Putin had the broader goal of showcasing his military might, not merely keeping Ukraine out of NATO and in his sphere of influence.

Two things can happen now: (1) the Ukrainians, armed with Western defensive weapons and their own courageous fighting spirit, may eventually repel the Russian invaders in a bloody but pivotal war; that would mean the end of Putin, and the triumph of Western values; or (2) Putin may win and restore a Russian sphere of influence, albeit one reduced in scope.

That’s what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meant when he said this war is a war for “all the world,” not just Ukraine. We can go back to the Peace of Westphalia, the treaties by which the Great Powers divvied up the parts of the world they cared about in 1648, or we can move forward to the end of history.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/europe/,2022-03-15
Is Ukraine Winning? - The American Spectator,"Tomorrow, Aug. 24, is Ukraine’s independence day, when it celebrates its 1991 independence from the Soviet Union. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that he expects Russian forces to do something especially nasty on that day.

Aug. 24 is also the day on which the Russian war against Ukraine will be six months old. That’s not very long as major wars go.

World War I lasted four years, World War II lasted six, and the Korean War three. The three Punic Wars between Rome and Carthage spanned about 120 years. The war against Western civilization waged by Islamist terrorists and the nations that support them was declared in Osama bin Laden’s 1996 fatwa against the United States. It didn’t end with President Joe Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. It’s just on hiatus.

The Russian war to conquer Ukraine is not as big as the World Wars, at least so far, despite Russia’s frequent threats of nuclear escalation. But neither is it just a local war. Many NATO nations have stood by Ukraine, sending the country billions of dollars in weapons and supplies. It’s not quite a proxy war between Russia and NATO, but as Ukrainian troops are trained by British and other forces, it is taking that form.

The Russia–Ukraine war has started to disappear from the news, a phenomenon that is a reflection of the West’s self-absorption rather than the war’s importance. The only thing that attracts attention now — aside from Putin’s random cutoffs of gas supplies — is the Russian shelling of what is probably the largest nuclear power plant in Europe at Zaporizhzhia.

Both sides accuse each other of the shelling, but why would Ukraine shell its own nuclear power plant and possibly cut off a major supply of electricity? Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned French President Emmanuel Macron of a “catastrophe” that could result at Zaporizhzhia.

This war, as I have written before, is — like World War I — a war that ends a long era of relative peace. It is a conflict that, to Russia, China, Iran, and others, legitimizes war as just another aspect of foreign policy.

In all of this, there is some good news. For six months, Ukraine has been “winning” the war by not losing. Unaccountably and unexpectedly, by sheer tenacity and by using weapons such as the U.S.-provided Javelin anti-tank missile, Ukraine may be able to outlast Russia and emerge hugely damaged but still independent.

Last week, Zelensky said, “I will personally do everything possible to return Crimea so that it becomes part of Europe together with Ukraine.” That’s bold talk for a man who wastes his time posing for Vogue magazine with his wife. But it reflects the enormous damage Ukrainian forces have done to Russia beyond Ukraine’s post-2015 borders.

According to a Reuters report, on Aug. 9, explosions — probably caused by Ukrainian drone attacks — at the Russian Saky air base in Crimea “put more than half of the Russian Black Sea fleet’s naval aviation combat jets” out of action. A U.S. official, according to the Reuters report, said that “Ukraine was now consistently achieving ‘kinetic effects’ deep behind Russia’s lines which was having a material impact on Russia’s logistics support and ‘a significant psychological effect on the Russian leadership.’”

One Ukrainian drone strike reportedly hit the Crimean headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea fleet and ammunition depots in the area, doing little damage but bringing a strategic location into play. Another caused the explosion of an ammunition depot in Russia on its border with Ukraine.

Ukrainian forces, using U.S.-provided HIMARS rockets, have destroyed many of the bridges to the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine, presaging a large movement of Ukrainian troops against Russian forces in southern Ukraine. Dmytro Marchenko, a Ukrainian general, has boasted that Kherson will be liberated “by the end of the year.” Russia, which has occupied Kherson since March, is sending more troops to the Kherson area to reinforce those already there.

Civilian life in Kherson is reportedly terrible. Tens of thousands have fled the bombing and shelling. Schools, which are just resuming, are beginning to teach a Russian-approved curriculum. Russia plans to hold fake referenda in September to have the population “approve” Russia’s domination.

About one-fifth of Ukrainian territory is in Russian hands, but that has been achieved at enormous cost to both belligerents. Many Ukrainian towns, villages, and cities have been destroyed despite the fact that they are not military targets. Russian forces, as I have written here and here, have committed war crimes as a matter of strategy.

Both sides have, so far, lost a tremendous number of troops, and Ukraine has suffered thousands of civilians killed. Russia admits to about 1,300 dead, but their losses, according to Ukrainian estimates, may be as high as 43,000. But it has nearly one million troops to spend. Ukraine has lost at least 9,000 troops, most of whom were likely poorly trained conscripts, in addition to about 5,300 civilians killed.

And the war will go on at least through the fall and winter months. Putin has staked too much on his war to quit. A Ukrainian counteroffensive would be slowed by rain and mud, but it could open new gaps in Russian strength by drawing troops from the Donbas region and other areas that could be exploited.

The Russia–Ukraine war is not at a tipping point, at least not yet. Biden has, to his credit, sent billions of dollars in weapon systems to Ukraine, but, to his shame, he has denied Ukraine the one kind of weapon it could use to tip the scales against Russia: combat aircraft.

The Biden administration has said that to enable Ukraine to obtain such aircraft would be “escalatory.” To the president, the only escalation permissible is that undertaken by Russia.

When the fall and winter months come and the roads are turned into mud, ice, and snow, if Ukraine were provided with all-weather combat aircraft, it could tip the balance against Russia, push the war into Crimea, inflict enormous losses on Russian forces near Kherson, and recover much of the other territory now held by the invading country.

Still, even with this approach, there would be no end to this war in sight. It will go on for years, at least as long as Putin is alive.

In 1979–1989, Soviet Russia tried to conquer Afghanistan and retreated with its tail between its legs. We should do whatever we can to make Ukraine Putin’s Afghanistan.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/free-market/,2022-08-23
Kissinger Calls for ‘Peace Through Negotiation’ in Ukraine War - The American Spectator,"News reports indicate that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to negotiate an end to the Ukraine war. Kyiv officials have proposed a UN mediated “peace summit,” which Russia appears to have rejected. Now in his 99th year, Henry Kissinger, writing in the UK Spectator, suggests that the road to peace starts by learning the lessons of the First World War, a conflict that “Europe’s leaders sleepwalked … into [and] which none of them would have entered had they foreseen the world at war’s end in 1918.” Kissinger references a recent book by former U.S. diplomat Philip Zelikow titled The Road Less Traveled: The Secret Battle to End the Great War, 1916-1917.

Zelikow writes about what he calls the “lost peace” of August 1916 to January 1917, when Europe’s leaders and America’s President Woodrow Wilson missed opportunities for peace. Zelikow places most of the blame on Wilson, who, Kissinger notes, delayed efforts at mediation until after the November presidential election despite learning from his emissary Edward House that “peace based on the modified status quo ante was within reach.” But by November 1916, the disastrous British offensive at the Somme and Germany’s struggle with France over Verdun added millions more to the butcher’s bill of that terrible war and dashed hopes for a negotiated peace.

In his book, Zelikow noted that German diplomats were willing to abandon Belgium and most of France (including portions of Alsace-Lorraine) and accept Wilson as mediator to negotiate peace without victory. French and British diplomats were also open to such a resolution. The generals on both sides, however, kept planning more lethal and futile offensives. Wilson’s decision to delay mediation efforts until after the election undermined the diplomats’ plans for a negotiated peace and, in Kissinger’s words, the “Great War went on for two more years and claimed millions more victims, irretrievably damaging Europe’s established equilibrium.” The war resulted in the breakup of four empires and produced a structure of peace, writes Kissinger, that “proved far more fragile than the structure it replaced.”

Kissinger writes that the military situation in Ukraine may be ripe to induce the diplomats of Russia and Ukraine to negotiate peace. “[T]he time is approaching,” he explains, “to build on the strategic changes which have already been accomplished and to integrate them into a new structure towards achieving peace through negotiation.” Winter, he believes, will impose “a pause on large-scale military operations there.” He applauds Ukraine and its leaders for stymieing Russian offensives and repeats his earlier recommendation of a “ceasefire line along the borders existing where the war started on February 24.” Crimea, he suggests, could be “the subject of a negotiation after a ceasefire.” And Ukraine, he says, should be “link[ed]” to NATO. He even suggests the possibility of internationally supervised referendums for disputed territory in Ukraine. “The goal of a peace process would be … to confirm the freedom of Ukraine and to define a new international structure, especially for Central and Eastern Europe,” and he suggests that Russia should eventually have a place in that new structure of peace.

Kissinger insists that Russia should not be “rendered impotent by the war.” Russia’s role in contributing to the “global equilibrium and to the balance of power” should not be “degraded,” he writes. There is a hint here of reviving Kissinger’s (and Nixon’s) triangular diplomacy with Russia and China. Peace requires efforts to produce security and reconciliation where possible, Kissinger explains. “If we cannot achieve both,” he continues, “we will not be able to reach either.” Successful diplomacy requires “vision” and “courage.”

Zelikow, taking the long view of history, writes that “the failure to end the Great War in 1916-1917 was much more than a human tragedy…. It became a turning point in world history.” It led to the rise of communism and later Nazism, the two ideologies that made the 20th century the bloodiest in human history. George Kennan was right: the Great War was the “seminal catastrophe” of the 20th century. Kissinger is hopeful that today’s diplomats will not miss this opportunity for peace by continuing a conflict that could lead to nuclear escalation and become the seminal catastrophe of the 21st century.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/hither-and-yon/,2022-12-27
Media Manipulation: Putin’s Ukraine Invasion Evil but Warring on Israel and Armenia OK - The American Spectator,"About my love for Armenians.

I grew up in Brooklyn, in mostly ethnically Jewish neighborhoods. There were kosher restaurants galore; Irv’s Knishery in Canarsie was my favorite. There was Tina’s Bake Shop, who made the best chocolate cream pie ever. In time, I stopped patronizing them as I learned they baked on Shabbat. There was Appy’s Deli. What can I say? I miss Appy’s.

Jews everywhere. On Friday nights, a middle-aged guy down the block would wheel his television outside to his front yard, and a dozen of his buddies would congregate to watch the Yankees game. I never missed it. As soon as Sabbath meal with my Mom and sisters had ended, and we had recited grace, I hurried down the block. The men looked forward to my participating because I knew more baseball lore and data than a “walking encyclopedia.” I would have made a great baseball announcer, synergizing the best of Mel Allen, Tom Hamilton, and Vin Scully. We Orthodox Jews may not engage in employment on Shabbat, but I woulda called ’em for free. Ah, but we also may not engage electricity on the L-rd’s day. So I became a rabbi, an attorney, and a columnist.

I attended yeshiva (Jewish parochial school) for twelve years until college. “Some of my best friends” were Jews. Also all my worst enemies.

I first got to know non-Jews when I went to college. Thing is, Columbia University in the City of New York had plenty of leftists to keep me busy. My friends mostly were commies. That’s basically all I had to choose from. One kid had a beard like Trotsky. He ended up an investment banker on Wall Street. From Das Kapital to Dow Jones in less than a decade. Makers’ Mark tastes better than vodka.

In time I met more non-Jews: professors, other college friends, coworkers. I came to enjoy other cultures, too, although I best can be described as “Such a Jew what you are!” My favorite music includes a bunch of Irish songs. My favorite? This one. (And, by the way, Happy St. Patty’s Day this week: Erin Go Bragh! And … Fund the Police!)

I found that I love Italians, too. Their heritage and culture, at least as practiced in America, are so similar to Jewish culture that you almost can’t tell Lucky Luciano from Bugsy Siegel. During the 1940s — think On the Waterfront — Italian unions ran the Manhattan and Jersey City docks, and they helped Jews illegally run guns to the nascent country of Israel when Harry Truman invoked his inner Joe Biden and imposed a full ban on allowing any weapons to the Jews as they were being attacked by seven Arab countries intent on murdering the Jewish country before it even birthed. Ethnic Italians, like ethnic East European Jews, are loud, emotional, hug and kiss, what-you-see-is-what-you-get. We eat starches. We respect Mama. They do the construction stuff in Joyzee — Bada bing! Bada boom! — and we represent them in court and with the IRS. Walk softly and carry a big attaché case.

I have continued expanding my cultural horizons and ethnic fascinations. Probably my best non-rabbinic friend is an American-born attorney of Formosan (Taiwanese) descent who is depressed that his beloved Seahawks suddenly are bereft of Russell Wilson and Bobby Wagner. I try to console him by reminding that, when I followed the NFL until Kaepernick ruined it for me, my team was the Jets. The Jets have been rebuilding since the 1970s. The Biblical Jews got through the Sinai and into the Promised Land sooner. Divide the Red Sea? The Jets can’t even pierce through a four-man defensive front line.

My dear friend is unaware how much he has expanded my horizons as we enter the Year of the Tiger. Like all Jews, I love Chinese food. It’s a Jewish thing. Also, it’s equally crazy — if you think about it — as Jackie Mason observed: “No Chinaman ever asks a Jew where he can find a good matzo ball.”

And then there are the Armenians.

I have come to value Armenians deeply. As a law professor of twenty years, I have taught more than two thousand students; many of Armenian descent. I love their sense of tradition, family, religious devotion, and overall ethnicity. I cannot eat their foods because of kosher rules, and I have not attended their worship, but I love their devotion to heritage. A particular divorced Armenian lady and her two grown daughters became very close to my family and to my wife, Ellen of blessed memory. Among my law students, I connect warmly with everyone: blacks, whites, Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, Arabs, Hispanics, Asians, Indians.

Despite my edgy writings and my humor that always risks offending, never once in twenty years and among 2,000 students has anyone ever expressed umbrage. I somehow have side-stepped cancel culture, except for two Jewish rabidly leftist professors who would destroy me if they could because I wrote that Kamala Harris leveraged her immorality to rise in California Democrat circles. Rush Limbaugh read the whole article on his radio show, and it thus got a gazillion hits, made me famous, so those two Jewish leftists tried going after me. The score is:

• For Dov — 2,000 non-Jewish students of every imaginable background.

• Against Dov — 2 whining knee-jerk bleeding-heart Jewish rabidly leftist professors for AOC and Black Lives Matter and against yarmulkas.

(Oh, and by the way: Kamala Harris rose in California Democrat circles immorally.)

In my gaining a deeper appreciation for Armenian Americans and their culture, I learned about the Medz Yeghern, something too close to the Shoah (Holocaust) that Nazi Germany inflicted on Jews. In light of Turkish dictator Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s extraordinary anti-Semitism (until last week, as it happens), my affinity towards Armenia only has increased. I always devote time in one of my last Spring Term classes to speak about April 24 and the Medz Yeghern. Armenian American students often have come to me after class or written me, even years later, that they were emotionally touched during those moments when the Orthodox rabbi with the yarmulka spoke about the evil Ataturk perpetrated and how Turkey to this day will not at least admit they sinned grievously a century ago.

It is outrageous that that the world, which now appropriately condemns Putin for disrupting the social order and sympathizes with Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukraine, never offered sympathy for Armenia as the Artsakh region faced horrific destruction only recently at the hands of Azerbaijan during the 2020 Second War over Nagorno-Karabakh. During the Soviet Union years, the region was deemed an autonomous oblast and was known as Artsakh. It is an enclave geographically within Azerbaijan, but approximately 80 percent Armenian ethnic and religiously Armenian Apostolic. In a 1991 referendum, as the Soviet Union collapsed, the population voted overwhelmingly to unite with Armenia. However, Azerbaijan launched war to assert sovereignty. The thing is, Putin and Iran — very bad players, but Armenia’s main energy suppliers — supported Armenia in the conflict while Turkey backed Azerbaijan. Amid the conflict, the Armenian Apostolic Ghazanchetsots (Holy Savior) Cathedral in Shusha, the main seat of the Artsakh bishopric and a landmark of Shusha and of Armenian cultural and religious identity, was attacked and damaged to the degree that Human Rights Watch declared it a possible war crime. Azerbaijan now has altered its historic construction. It was Azerbaijan who launched war to change the map.

Remember? Neither do most anyone else — because the media decided not to manipulate sympathies on that one. Walter Duranty of the New York Times had manipulated news of Stalin’s 1932-1933 Holodomor mass murders in Ukraine, so they passed unnoticed here. Again, the Times chose mostly to ignore the Shoah, assuring Hitler almost free rein there.

The media pick and choose “good guys” and “bad guys,” then proceed to tug at heart strings to manipulate public opinion. Similarly, they align towards Israel’s haters and therefore present the only country in the world with a Jewish majority dishonestly as “apartheid.” Consider: Jews cannot even set foot in Mecca or Medina. There is no synagogue in all of Saudi Arabia. By contrast, Arab Muslims in Israel engage in all aspects of daily public life, receive the same government benefits Jews do, hold political office, even comprise a critical component of the present governing Israeli political coalition. Arab Muslims are included among Israeli university professors, graduate students awarded government fellowships, high-ranking judges, and even receive monthly government stipends aimed at encouraging large families. When Arab terror groups strike at Israel with murderous rockets, they base launchers on rooftops of residential apartment buildings, on hospital grounds, and in school yards. Then, when Israel strikes defensively to obliterate those rocket-launch sites, the photos look awful, and the media choose not to explain. So no Ben & Jerry’s.

The left media are at war with conservatives. They manipulate others to hate DeSantis, Pence, Cotton, Pompeo, Cruz, Tucker supporters, Trump supporters, populist conservatives, Israel supporters, Armenia supporters.

Like Zelensky, we won’t roll over.

Moscow’s Strategy in Ukraine Puts Russian Soldiers Through Putin’s Meat Grinder - The American Spectator,"According to reports from the front lines in Bakhmut, Russia is losing a significant number of troops to take the strategically insignificant Ukrainian city. Yet Russian President Vladimir Putin says everything is going according to plan. Unfortunately, he may be right.

Bakhmut, a city in Donetsk Oblast, has been under attack since August, and Russia has slowly advanced as Ukrainian troops have doggedly contested every foot of ground. The Kremlin has been characteristically quiet about casualties, but an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky estimates that Russia may have lost up to 20,000 troops in the axis between Bakhmut and nearby Russian-occupied Soledar. This is a heavy price to pay for a city that has no significant strategic value.

Nevertheless, on Sunday Putin said: “The dynamics are positive. Everything is developing within the plan of the Defense Ministry and the General Staff. And I hope that our fighters will please us more than once again with the results of their combat work.”

One could dismiss this statement as the usual totalitarian messaging, where everything is always positive, the regime is always right, and the supreme leader is working from an inscrutable plan that mere mortals have no hope of understanding. Trust us, comrades, Putin is saying. Forget those body bags; final victory is assured.

But in some respects, Putin is right. Despite thousands of lost lives, Russia still holds significant amounts of Ukrainian territory. Occupation forces are busy forcibly integrating the subject populations into Moscow’s alternative reality. And at the front lines, Russia seems to be engaging in a calculated effort to weaken Ukraine through attrition warfare.

The siege of Bakhmut is like a scaled-down version of the 1916 Battle of Verdun. In that battle — the longest of World War I at 11 months — German strategists calculated that the French would commit any troops necessary to hold the symbolically important city. By seizing key fortifications on the edge of the town, the Germans invited the French to mount counterattacks that would devastate their forces while the Kaiser’s troops enjoyed the relative advantage of the defense.

Ultimately, Verdun did not work out to Germany’s advantage. Both sides suffered over 350,000 casualties — slightly more on the French side, but nothing like the lopsided casualty count that Chief of the German General Staff General Erich von Falkenhayn had expected. The battle cost him his job.

Russian military leadership had a shakeup last week as well. Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov took command from Sergey Surovikin, who had commanded since October and now will act as Gerasimov’s deputy. But, unlike Verdun, this may not signal a change in Russia’s approach to the war.

The numbers weigh in Moscow’s favor. American estimates indicate that each side has likely suffered equal casualties. But even if Kyiv is doing somewhat better at minimizing losses, Russia has a deeper mobilization base with three times the population of Ukraine. And Putin is more than happy to empty his prisons, pay for Wagner Group mercenaries, enforce harsh conscription, and generally treat his troops as cannon fodder. Putin does not seem to mind bleeding Russia if it also means bleeding Ukraine.

This dynamic is evident in Bakhmut. “When we kill five out of 10 of their soldiers at once, they are replenished again to 10 over the course of several hours,” said Ukrainian deputy battalion commander Andriy Kryshchenko. Russian troops can maintain a combat tempo that the Ukrainians can’t match. (RELATED: Can Russia Outlast Ukraine?)

The Ukrainian troops are more motivated than the Russians, better trained, better equipped, and have a moral cause that is recognized and supported by the free world. But the leveling effect of urban warfare can dampen these advantages. Whether the Ukrainians can hold Bakhmut is questionable. The city itself has no strategic importance other than the symbolism attached to it. It won’t decide the conflict either way. But to the extent Ukrainian leaders feel it must be held, they will continue to pay the price.

This underscores the importance of restoring maneuver to the Ukrainian war. Recent discussions of weapons shipments to Ukraine — such as British Challenger 2 tanks, German-made Leopard 2 tanks from Poland and perhaps Finland, and American armored Bradley infantry fighting vehicles — show that Western awareness of Kyiv’s need to focus less on relentless urban warfare and more on retaking the vast tracts of occupied territory annexed by Russia. The Ukrainians have demonstrated their ability to seize and hold ground on the northern and southern flanks of the occupied zone. If these new weapons are available later in the spring, after the muddy season — rasputitsa or “the season of bad roads” in Russian — fades and mobility becomes easier, Ukraine may be able to mount the kind of offensive operations it needs to both liberate the occupied areas and demonstrate a healthy return on Western investment of arms and equipment.

But until then, the Bakhmut meat grinder continues, according to plan.

Ukraine’s Freedom Fighter - The American Spectator,"“Two visions of the world remain locked in dispute,” said President Ronald Reagan in July 1983. “The first believes all men are created equal by a loving God who has blessed us with freedom. Abraham Lincoln spoke for us…. The second vision believes that religion is opium for the masses. It believes that eternal principles like truth, liberty, and democracy have no meaning beyond the whim of the state. And Lenin spoke for them.”

Reagan said that on July 19, 1983, in remarks at an official ceremony marking Captive Nations Week. Captive Nations Week had begun in July 1959 via an official Act of Congress, Public Law 86-90, supported by President Dwight Eisenhower, and resurrected with a vengeance under Reagan in the 1980s, as Reagan sought to re-moralize the Cold War. The law set aside a week every July to designate and honor the unfortunate nations suffocating under the jackboot of Soviet and international communism. Among them was the Ukraine.

I thought of that statement of Reagan’s yesterday, July 19, 2022, nearly four decades later, to the day, as I sat in a packed room at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation and Museum (VOC) in Washington, D.C., where the honored guest was the first lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, whose husband and countrymen and countrywomen have bravely battled for eternal principles like truth, liberty, and democracy against the calculations of brooding men from Vladimir Lenin to Vladimir Putin.

Zelenska is in Washington this week, speaking at the State Department and to Congress. In between, she visited the Victims of Communism Museum to pay homage to the people of her country and other nations crushed by Soviet communism. Among those peoples, few suffered like her fellow Ukrainians. In the 1930s, Stalin unleashed a famine on the population that killed anywhere from five to 10 million people. The horrors of Holodomor are hard to surpass in the history of human rights abuses.

While touring the Victims of Communism Museum, Zelenska paused to accept the organization’s Dissident Human Rights Award, which was presented to her by VOC staff and founders Andrew Bremberg, Ed Feulner, Elizabeth Spalding, and Lee Edwards, the last of whom has worked tirelessly and nobly in the decades since the end of the Cold War to establish in our nation’s capital this crucial memorial to the estimated 100 million-plus communist victims. This week is once again Captive Nations Week, and who better to be on hand to accept that award than the first lady of the Ukraine? Her nation right now, in 2022, is battling to not again become a captive nation to yet another Kremlin thug, former KGB lieutenant colonel and reigning Russian despot for life Vladimir Putin.

“Communism is just another form of totalitarianism,” noted Zelenska, speaking in her native tongue through a translator. “That is exactly what Ukraine is facing today.” She accepted the award “in the name of every Ukrainian man and woman fighting Russian aggression today,” including their would-be “enslavement” and their denial of basic freedoms and human rights.

Zelenska observed that modern Russia’s aggression against Ukraine shows that “the 20th century is repeating itself in the worst and ugliest forms.” She told the story of a mayor in a town near Kiev who was shot and killed by Russian troops for the crime of distributing food and medicine to his residents.

It indeed sounds like the 20th century is repeating itself in the worst and ugliest forms, at least for Russia’s neighbor. That was something that Stalin’s goons would have done as well. No country ever shot dissidents like the USSR.

“In certain places,” said Zelenska, “the darkness has never faded away.” The despots now find more sophisticated weapons to use and ways to exploit social media. Whatever the means, the results continue: The people of Ukraine remain victims of Russia’s brutal rulers.

To this day, in certain places like Ukraine, what Ronald Reagan said on July 19, 1983, remains eerily similar to what Olena Zelenska said on July 19, 2022: Two visions of the world remain locked in dispute. The first believes in the blessings of freedom bestowed by a God who creates all men and women equal; the second vision believes that eternal principles like truth, liberty, and democracy have no meaning beyond the whim of the state. Lenin spoke for the latter; Lincoln, Reagan, and Olena Zelenska spoke for the former.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/special-report/,2022-07-20
"On Chanukah, My Appendix, and the High Kohen - The American Spectator","Chanukah is celebrated this year from Sunday night, Dec. 18, through Monday, Dec. 26, at sunset, corresponding to the Hebrew calendar days of 25 Kislev through 2 Tevet.

Chanukah is so interesting, isn’t it? It’s the easiest of all our Jewish holidays to celebrate. No construction of an outdoor home, as we do on Sukkot, with wood beams and rooftops lined with bamboo sticks (East Coast) or palm fronds (West Coast). No need to fast for 25 hours as we do on Tisha B’Av and Yom Kippur, or to attend services for six or 10-plus hours as we do respectively on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. No need to turn the kitchen upside down, schlep pots and pans and flatware and dishes to and from the basement (East Coast) or the garage (West Coast) or the kids’ bathtub, and then to line almost everything in the kitchen in aluminum foil as we do on Passover. All you have to do is light a candle or two or nine. You sing a song or two (America) or eight or 10 (Israel), and you wonder for a week whether any of the carols they play in the mall can be adapted with Hebrew lyrics. Perhaps you even contemplate that you never met anyone who made a dreidel out of clay, although the plastic ones may one day be banned in California.

Chanukah is fascinating because, since it is so incredibly easy, more American Jews “celebrate it” than they do any other Jewish holiday. The most assimilated, Hellenized, Judaically ignorant, and self-mocking Jew or pseudo-Jew can stop three minutes per year for Chanukah. Intermarried Doug Emhoff and his Kamala celebrate the message of Matisyahu the Hasmonean, high Kohen, whose sons fought the Hellenist assimilationists to liberate the Beit HaMikdash (Holy Temple), by lighting a candle in a menorah for the White House public relations team. In the Emhoff-Kamala background: a Christmas tree the size of Goliath, with more Christmas regalia on the Emhoff-Kamala mantle above the fireplace. So, anyone apparently can “do Chanukah.” Even non-Jews. All it takes is a few candles and a match. That still leaves plenty of time for Christmas dinner (for assimilated Jews like Elena Kagan and Emhoff, at a Chinese non-kosher restaurant), yule logs, Santa, Christmas breakfast, opening Christmas presents, and Christmas lunch.

In part, with everyone else in America centering their mall shopping, their amusement-park visiting, and even their television-watching on “the other winter holiday,” assimilated American Jews do not want to miss out on the winter wonderland. So, they have an Adam Sandler Chanukah, where two non-Jews together make a “fine looking Jew” and the 25 percent bloodline of a famous non-Jewish actor is “not too shabby.”

Well, here’s my Chanukah reminiscence. All in a rabbi’s life.

Back in 2006, I was hospitalized with an “Appendicitis for the Ages.” If you ever wondered how bad it really is if your appendix actually starts leaking before they take it out, wonder no more. It is pretty, pretty, pretty bad. By the time my wife forced me into the car at 3 a.m. — the earliest hours of the morning that, for some reason, we call “the middle of the night” — I quietly knew this was bad. We got to the hospital. It did not take long for the emergency room people to realize that, in the words of the triage expert: “Wow, Rabbi, this emergency room typically is jam-packed with people who have sniffles and coughs. Tonight, for the first time in weeks, thanks to you, we finally have a real life-or-death emergency here in the emergency room!” I was honored.

I ended up in a bit of peril and was stuck in the hospital for several days. They soon told me that the hospital had these very sweet and kind undergraduate volunteers from a nearby Christian Bible college who would come by to help with the patients, “Good Samaritans” trying to assist in little ways without inadvertently killing anyone.

After several days spent supine, I was itching to resume walking, and they assigned this incredibly darling guy to help me ambulate. He was so amazingly excited to learn that he, a Christian Bible student, had been assigned to a Bible-learned full-fledged Orthodox rabbi with a yarmulka who actually was studied in the book that this fellow called the “Old Testament” (but that we Jews call the “Torah,” the “Chumash,” the “Pentateuch,” the “Five Books of Moses,” or the “Artscroll with the blue cover”). As he started walking alongside me down the hall, he thanked me profusely for giving him the opportunity to bless a rabbi. He explained that G-d said to Abraham in Genesis (B’reishit) 12:3 that He will bless those who bless Abraham’s children, so this nice guy always had wanted so much to bless any Jew. And now, he got himself a bonus — double points: an Orthodox rabbi.

So, we walked and schmoozed. And then he asked me a question whose Judaic erudition, coming from a fellow at a Christian Bible college, actually quite impressed me: “Rabbi, have you ever heard of Matisyahu? I am absolutely fixated on Matisyahu and would like to know all I can about him.”

I was so impressed. As it says on the Chanukah dreidel acrostic: Ness Gadol Haya Poh — A Great Miracle Happened Here. So I told him all about Matisyahu:

“Matisyahu was the Kohen Gadol — the High Priest — of the Jewish People…”

Suddenly, my volunteer helper interrupted me: “Did you say that Matisyahu is the High Priest of the Jewish People?”

“Yes,” I answered, “what you would call the ‘High Priest,’ or, as we prefer to say, the ‘Kohen Gadol.’ In a way, you might say he was a king without a crown.”

“Please continue,” he eagerly urged me. “Wow! Matisyahu was like a king without a crown! I can hardly wait to tell my dormitory friends!”

I was bemused but continued:

“Well, Matisyahu was based in Israel, in a city called Modi’in. We Jews were under Greek domination, and they had conquered our land and defiled our Beit HaMikdash, the Holy Temple on Mount Zion in Jerusalem. And now they were coercing us, at pain of death, to abandon our Torah laws and values. In an incident that is probably the most famous and retold event in Matisyahu’s entire life, it is said that the local Greek occupation forces compelled all the local Jews to gather at a central location, where the leading Greek official demanded that some Jew in the group eat a piece of forbidden pork or ham or bacon. One of those pig foods. As you know from Bible college, we Jews are forbidden from eating pig.

“Well, one Jewish guy in the group apparently was looking to advance his status with the Greeks, so he stepped forward and proudly proclaimed that he would eat it. And, at that juncture, Matisyahu stepped forward, unsheathed a long sword, and he slew the guy dead.” (READ MORE from Dov Fischer: The Chanukah of Fools)

My helper stopped in his tracks. We were two-thirds of the way down the hall. “Matisyahu had a sword? He used the sword? Matisyahu killed a guy with a sword? Just for eating a piece of pork?”

I nodded affirmatively. “Yep. That’s Matisyahu.” I explained the context. “We Jews are quite peaceful and do not go around slaying people, nor do we even stop other people at the supermarket (East Coast — Key Food; West Coast — Ralphs; St. Louis — Schnucks; Louisville — Winn-Dixie; everywhere else — Piggly Wiggly) to stop them from buying Oscar Mayer sausages. Rather, this was a moment in time when the Jewish people faced utter destruction, and we were on the brink of not only physical catastrophe but spiritual destruction. It was not about a single guy eating non-kosher food but about a defiant apostate signaling publicly to the Greeks that all the Jews could be terrorized into abandoning our G-d and Torah, into abandoning not only our kosher laws but all of Judaism. It was a moment in time, in a different context from today.”

Our walk came to an end. I was feeling pretty tired by now, but my new Friend for a Day was utterly breathless: “I cannot thank you enough, Rabbi. I will always remember this walk — as long as I live. I thought I knew a bunch about Matisyahu, but wait until I tell my friends that Matisyahu killed people with a sword, especially Jews who eat pork or ham. Wow!”

I injected that he should be aware that Matisyahu planted the seeds that led to Jewish freedom and the Chanukah miracle. He had five grown sons. The most famous, Yehudah HaMaccabee — Judah the Maccabee — was the hero who ultimately led the revolt that drove the Greeks out of Israel, liberated the Holy Temple from Greek desecration, and revived the daily lighting of the menorah in the Temple. It was that rekindling, when there was not enough kindling oil to last more than a day, that led to the great miracle of Chanukah, as only a single day’s supply of oil sustained eight days, enough time for more sacred oil to be produced in accordance with Judaic law.

He paused and asked, “Did you just say, Rabbi, that Matisyahu has five fully grown sons, and one of them freed Israel from the Greeks and caused Israeli independence?”

I was back at my bed, quite exhausted from my first walk since the surgery, and I think I nodded affirmatively. He was such a sweet fellow, and we wished each other well.

That night my wife, Ellen of blessed memory, visited me at the hospital after her long day of work. I told her about this really nice guy from a Christian Bible college, about our walk and our conversation. She started giggling in the infectious way that only she could. Once she started, I could not but laugh hysterically, too. She always did that to me. And then I caught my breath and asked her, “El, what exactly are we laughing about?”

She then asked me: “Dov, you are so enthralled with the music of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, MBD, Safam, and Garth Brooks that you never follow other popular music. You don’t realize there is a pretty popular reggae singer out there named ‘Matisyahu,’ right?”

“Nope, Ellen. Never heard of him.”

“Well,” she said. “Now that Bible college has heard of him — and, oh, have they!”",https://spectator.org/category/politics/ukraine-under-assault/,2022-12-20
One Consequence of the Ukraine War: Nuclear Saber-Rattling - The American Spectator,"It might be too early to draw specific tactical and operational lessons from the war in Ukraine but one strategic trend has already emerged. In its wake, nuclear saber-rattling has become an almost daily event. Indeed, it could be hypothesized that the bigger a nation’s arsenal of conventional Soviet/Russian arms, the greater its tendency to engage in nuclear brinkmanship or its incentives to go nuclear.

The first and foremost example of this practice is Russia itself. Apparently alarmed by the abysmal performance of its military in Ukraine, key Russian leaders have increasingly resorted to opaque nuclear warnings. In fact, Putin himself has acted as the main choreographer of this danse macabre.

For instance, in late April on the occasion of Russia test-launching a new ICBM named Sarmat (after the nomadic barbarian Sarmatian people of the 4th and 5th centuries known for their fights against the Romans and Attila the Hun), Putin declared that the new weapon would have no analog in the world for a long time to come and would make those “who, in the heat of frenzied aggressive rhetoric, are trying to threaten our country, think twice before acting against Russia.” He went on to stress that “the new complex has the highest tactical and technical characteristics and is capable of overcoming all modern anti-missile defense systems.”

Within a week, his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, stated in an interview on Russian state TV that the risk of nuclear war between Russia and the West is now “considerable.” While claiming he did not want the danger of nuclear war to be “artificially inflated,” he nevertheless warned that it was “serious,” “real,” and “cannot be underestimated.”

A day later in an address before Russian lawmakers, it was again Putin who said on April 27, “If someone decides to intervene in current events [in Ukraine] from the outside and creates unacceptable strategic threats for Russia, then [they] must know that our response, our retaliatory strikes, will be lightning-fast, quick,” according to the Ukrainian paper Ukrayinska Pravda. He warned: “We have all the tools for this — such that no one else can boast of right now. And we won’t brag — we’ll use them if needed! And everyone should know about it! All decisions in this regard have already been made.”

Putin left it purposely unclear if he was referring to the newly developed Kinzhal (Dagger) hypersonic missile, which Russia used for the first time in March to hit a Ukrainian target armed when the missile was armed with a conventional warhead, or to the new nuclear-capable Sarmat ICBM slated to be operationally deployed later this year. However, the U.S. quickly called Putin’s comments dangerous, escalatory, and totally unacceptable. President Joe Biden reacted by saying, “No one should be making idle comments about the use of nuclear weapons or the possibility of using them. It’s irresponsible.”

Yet, as if to dispel any doubts about Putin’s intentions and in a transparent effort to infuse credibility into the barrage of recent warnings, the Russian defense ministry on May 4 announced its forces carried out simulated nuclear missile strikes in Kaliningrad, a territory sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. The exercises included simulated “electronic launches” of the nuclear-capable Iskander mobile ballistic missile system (NATO designation SS-26). Accordingly, the forces practiced multiple strikes at targets imitating launchers of missile systems, airfields, protected infrastructure, military equipment, and command posts of a mock enemy. Military personnel also maneuvered to avoid “a possible retaliatory strike” — as well as “operated in conditions of radiation and chemical contamination,” the ministry said.

Just in case these warnings were somehow ignored, the Russian defense ministry announced two days later that this year’s Victory Day Parade held on May 9 in Moscow would include a rare flight of the Ilyushin Il-80, an airborne command and control plane designed to serve Putin and other top officials in the event of a nuclear war. Known as the “Flying Kremlin,” it has not been seen at a Victory Day commemoration since 2010, and its comeback is likely an indication that Putin was bent on transmitting yet another ominous nuclear signal to the West. (READ MORE from Avigdor Haselkorn: Putin’s Dangerous New Strategic Doctrine)

Russia’s nuclear saber-rattling is meant to accomplish five goals. First, it conveys the Kremlin’s concern that its military’s conventional capabilities have proven critically deficient. The nuclear warnings are thus meant as a stopgap measure to ward off any aggressor who might (erroneously) believe Russia can be militarily overpowered. Moscow is in effect reverting to its practice in the wake of NATO’s 1999 air campaign in Kosovo where the effective use of precision-guided munitions forced Yugoslav forces to withdraw and drove the Russian leadership to come up with the concept of de-escalation. The new doctrine, which was in effect until about 2013, embraced the issuance of a threat of a limited nuclear strike to force an opponent to accept a return to the status quo ante. To that end, and in an effort to gain credibility, all large-scale military exercises that Russia conducted beginning in 2000 featured simulations of limited nuclear strikes. Interestingly, it was Putin, then secretary of the Security Council of Russia, who supervised the development of the new doctrine. By the time the doctrine was adopted in the spring of 2000, it was Putin who signed it under his new capacity as president.

Second, Moscow is exercising nuclear brinkmanship fully aware that while the West has increasingly supplied Ukraine’s war machine, the United States and its European allies have avoided direct involvement in the conflict for fear of provoking a Russian nuclear escalation.

Third, the Russians could be trying to back coercive diplomacy with the “madman theory” of threatening excessive force, which includes the specter of resorting to nuclear weapons, now that their war plan has been largely foiled. The nuclear threats demonstrate to the West that Putin will not back down until he achieves his goals in Ukraine.

Fourth, Russia aims to reassure its friends and allies of its immense capabilities so as to squelch any nascent thoughts of switching sides.

Lastly, the Kremlin is acting to maintain its prestige on the global scene and to warn anyone tempted to write it off as a superpower to think again. Undoubtedly, the Russian leadership has its domestic audience in mind as well. After all, the Putin regime is built on the notion that a strongman leader can revive the glory of the Russian empire.

Another example of this trend is provided by North Korea. Evidently, its leader, Kim Jong-un, has been seriously perturbed by the Russian military failures in Ukraine. To judge by his recent declarations, Kim seems increasingly doubtful that the Korean People’s Army’s conventional capabilities provide adequate defense. He may have concluded that the Soviet-supplied main weapon systems of the KPA are no match for the high-grade Western arms used by the Ukrainians to devastating effect in the war. In response, there has been a noticeable intensification of the North’s nuclear saber-rattling.

For example, the North Korean Central News Agency on April 25 quoted Kim on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of the founding of North Korea’s armed forces as expressing a“firm will” to continue developing “at the fastest possible pace” the nuclear arsenal of the KPA so that it could “preemptively and thoroughly contain and frustrate all dangerous attempts and threatening moves, including ever-escalating nuclear threats from hostile forces, if necessary.” He vowed that the North’s nuclear weapons would “never be confined to the single mission of war deterrent” in situations where the North faces external threats to its “fundamental interests.”

Kim’s threat to use his nuclear forces to protect his country’s ambiguously defined “fundamental interests” suggests the adoption of a “first strike” nuclear doctrine. At a minimum, his pronouncement officially expands the role of his nuclear force beyond the mere deterrence of an existential threat. Rather, the country’s nuclear arsenal is now readily available to offensively thwart other ill-defined inimical circumstances. This way, Kim apparently believes he will compensate for the growing gap between the KPA’s conventional capabilities and those of its potential enemies.

Finally, there is Iran. Although Iran may have other reasons for its steady progress toward achieving a nuclear weapons capability, it certainly feels more vulnerable in the wake of the war in Ukraine.

After all, Russia’s military setbacks in Ukraine have occurred precisely as Tehran was working hard to establish strong strategic and military ties with Moscow.

In August 2021, newly installed Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi described efforts to enhance and strengthen relations with Russia as a top priority in his administration’s foreign policy. He went on to assure his Russian counterpart of Tehran’s “serious resolve” to finalize a comprehensive cooperation deal with Moscow.

Two months later, Iran’s Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, arrived in Moscow on a four-day visit. Addressing a meeting at Iran’s embassy in the Russian capital on October 18, Bagheri said that following the lifting of the UN arms embargo the year before, the Iranian government signed deals with Russia for the purchase of fighter and training aircraft along with attack helicopters.

In a meeting with Gen. Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of the Russian armed forces, Bagheri said that “the military and defense relations have grown remarkably in recent years,” adding that he hopes that “the growing course of cooperation would continue.” Baqeri also referred to Iran’s 25-year strategic partnership deal with China, saying that establishing a similar agreement with Russia would be “beneficial.”

Subsequently, reports indicated the two countries have concluded a $10 billion deal to supply arms to Iran, including artillery systems, armored vehicles, and T-90 tanks. In January 2022, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi himself traveled to Moscow where he handed over Iran’s draft proposal for a 20-year cooperation agreement with Russia.

Thus, in view of the Russian military’s dreadful performance in Ukraine, the recent surge in tough talk by the Iranian leadership, including open advocacy of nuclear weapons as an essential element of Iran’s national security, could have been expected.

On March 10, in a speech to Iran’s Assembly of Experts, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei openly described Iran’s development of nuclear capabilities as part of its “arms of power.” He declared, “I believe that [compromises in ongoing nuclear negotiations] are mistakes. If, over the years, the people who want to chop off some of those arms of power had been given permission to do so, our country would be facing great danger today.”

The Kayhan Daily, the mouthpiece of the Iranian regime, wrote on February 28: “An important lesson of the Ukrainian war is that, in order to dispel threats, one must be strong. Disarming and handing over one’s sources of strength is the deadliest mistake.”

On April 9, in a speech marking the country’s “Nuclear Technology Day,” Iranian President Raisi stated: “For more than the 100th time, our message from Tehran to Vienna [where negotiations were being held on curbing Iran’s nuclear program] is that we will not back off from the Iranian people’s nuclear rights … not even an iota.”

There should be little question that the war in Ukraine has caused leaders of Russia, North Korea, and Iran great worry that the conflict will result in a shift in the global balance of power in favor of a resurgent West. They likely reacted with great trepidation over the prospect that Washington will actually achieve its strategic goal in the war and, in the words of U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on April 25, “have Russia weakened.” North Korea and Iran must now also harbor grave doubts about the likelihood of Russian military support in case of war. Additionally, Russia’s role as a source of new advanced weaponry is increasingly in doubt given Western sanctions, which reportedly have already caused some arms manufacturers to stop production for lack of essential imported components. Worse yet, the three countries face daunting uncertainties about the combat efficacy of some of their key conventional military capabilities.

In sum, in the aftermath of Russia’s military failures in Ukraine, the three regimes surely feel more vulnerable. However, as a result, the nuclear taboo that has held for decades is now ever closer to being broken.

"Questions for the Washington Uniparty on Ukraine, One Year Later - The American Spectator","President Joe Biden’s surprise visit to Ukrainian premier Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv earlier this week was an unmistakable sign of solidarity with Ukraine on the one-year anniversary of Russian kingpin Vladimir Putin’s reckless, unjust invasion. To the extent Biden’s aim was to send such a symbolic message to Moscow and its allies, he succeeded.

Unfortunately, Biden’s trip, especially seen in concert with recent similar actions such as Zelensky’s December speech before a joint session of Congress and even Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-KY) sartorial choice to wear a Ukrainian flag-colored necktie to Biden’s State of the Union address earlier this month, raises a number of discomfiting questions about the Washington, D.C., uniparty’s seemingly interminable commitment to prolonging this Eastern European quagmire. On the one-year anniversary of the culmination of Europe’s first extended land war since World War II, here are some pressing questions for establishment politicians from both major political parties.

No. 1: What is the meaning of “as long as it takes”? In Kyiv, Biden reiterated that the U.S. “will remain with Ukraine as long as it takes.” This presumably entails both a moral and, more relevant, fiscal commitment — indeed, Biden promised a new tranche of military aid to Ukraine, on top of the $113 billion in aid U.S. taxpayers dispensed with in 2022, and on top of recently announced top-tier materiel such as Patriot missile defense systems. But items such as Patriot missile defense systems and M142 HIMARS rocket launchers don’t grow on trees; resources are necessarily scarce, and each additional item we ship off into a proxy war against a nuclear-armed hegemon necessarily depletes our own military arsenal. Furthermore, America is massively indebted with soaring annual budget deficits. And Chinese President Xi Jinping surely grins as America strips bare our military and ships off the parts to Europe, not Asia. So how long is “as long as it takes” — and, related, do we simply not care at all about the costs?

No. 2: Is the U.S. national interest in the conflict synonymous with Ukraine’s national interest? The bipartisan foreign policy establishment’s absolutist stand with Ukraine — at seemingly all costs, “as long as it takes,” and so forth — implicitly conflates the national interests of the U.S. and Ukraine. After all, if the U.S. is that existentially committed to Ukrainian “victory” — whatever precisely that entails, and however Zelensky defines it — then it follows that our national interest in the conflict is precisely coterminous with Ukraine’s own national interest. But although there is strong overlap, this is simply not the case; the national interests are not coterminous. Ukraine’s national interest is indeed the maximalist stance Zelensky espouses — namely, refusal to countenance yielding even a square foot of territory in the Donbas (or Crimea). The U.S. national interest, by contrast, is definitely served by Zelensky’s remaining in power in Kyiv and not being toppled for an Alexander Lukashenko–style Moscow puppet; crucially, however, there is exceedingly little (if any) U.S. interest in where the exact national boundary lines are drawn in eastern Ukraine, where the population is often closely divided between ethnic Ukrainians and ethnic Russians. The crude post-Soviet dissolution boundaries in this part of the world are not akin to Moses descending Mount Sinai with the Word of God.

No. 3: Is the U.S. fearful of all-out war with Russia? Russia is the country with the single most confirmed nuclear weapons in the entire world: 6,255, as of 2021. (The U.S. was second, with 5,550 at that time.) As Zelensky sometimes flirts with openly calling for World War III, and continually endeavors to drag NATO — and thus, the U.S. — further into the conflict, does the prospect of cataclysmic nuclear war with Russia not cross the minds of the Washington uniparty and bipartisan foreign policy “blob”? That fear, if anything, should be exacerbated by Putin’s de facto withdrawal of Russia, over the past week, from the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START). Putin (loathsomely) speculates fairly openly about deploying nuclear weapons — all while the U.S., as well as European nations such as Germany and Poland, ship off increasingly sophisticated materiel. Is no one here interested in de-escalation and avoiding what Biden not-so-reassuringly referred to last October as nuclear “Armageddon”?

No. 4: Has the U.S. learned anything about “endless wars”? The American public is naturally war-weary after decades of failed regime change wars and moralistic nation-building crusade boondoggles. There is simply no political appetite right now for a dramatically prolonged military engagement — especially one in Europe, while our actual top geopolitical threat, China, flies spy balloons over our continent unimpeded and tests nuclear-capable hypersonic missiles around the world. The Washington uniparty’s desire for escalation in Eastern Europe may aid rapacious Beltway defense contractors, but it is manifestly contrary to the expressed interests of the American people, who would rather our elected officials focus instead on our own porous southern border with Mexico. In every way, the Biden administration’s current approach is “America Last,” not “America First.”

No. 5: What is the U.S.’s long-term plan to deal with Russia? It is unclear at best whether anyone in a foreign policy decision-making capacity has given a second of thought to what U.S.-Russian relations might possibly look like when this war is finally over. At this rate, and absent a course correction toward de-escalation and direct mediated negotiation between the warring parties, Moscow will loathe America and Europe after the conflict even more than they did prior to the conflict’s onset. But given that China, and not Russia, is this century’s dominant threat to America, a shrewder and more forward-looking approach to the conflict would at least lay the groundwork for possibly peeling Russia away from China and slightly closer to the Western sphere of influence after the war is over. Unfortunately, there is thus far no reason to believe this has a chance.

Political leaders of both parties should be asked these important questions. The stakes, as Biden’s “Armageddon” slip of the tongue inadvertently revealed, could not possibly be higher.

Recovering a More Perfect Union: A Rebuke of the 1619 Project - The American Spectator,"Toward a More Perfect Union: The Moral and Cultural Case for Teaching the Great American Story

By Timothy S. Goeglein

(Fidelis Publishing, 208 pages, $26)

One of the worst sins of the present — not just ours but any present — is its tendency to condescend toward the past, which is much easier to do when one doesn’t trouble to know the full context of that past or try to grasp the nature of its challenges as they presented themselves at the time.

— Wilfred M. McClay, Land of Hope: An Invitation to the Great American Story

Jay Leno used to do a regular schtick, “Jaywalking,” in which he would interview random persons on the street, often young ones, and ask them questions about American history, such as: “Who did America fight in the Revolutionary War?” “How many branches of the U.S. government are there?” “What year was the War of 1812?” Invariably, they could not answer the question, standing mute with Leno’s impertinent microphone pointed at their gaping mouths, or they gave a ridiculous answer.

As deflating as these performances were, it turns out that the state of American education is even worse than Leno documented. Not only does ignorance characterize so much of the citizenry, but Americans are now also imbibing, i.e., being taught, pernicious lies or partial truths about the founding and history of the United States from a tendentious, ideological, and solidly left-wing perspective.

This sorry state of affairs is documented in excruciating detail in Timothy S. Goeglein’s enlightening, depressing, and, ultimately, hopeful new book, Toward a More Perfect Union: The Moral and Cultural Case for Teaching the Great American Story. The distortion of history now routinely fed to elementary and high school students, as well as those attending hopelessly “woke” universities and colleges, has produced many young people who are “cynical, entitled, and aggrieved.” Continues Goeglein:

Rather than being thankful, they are indignant. Rather than proud, they feel ashamed. Rather than feeling free, they feel oppressed. Rather than wanting to fix America’s faults, they want to burn America down. Rather than asking what they can do for their country, they demand to know what their country can do for them—and the answer is increasingly to “cease to exist.”

We have created “a citizenry divorced both intellectually and emotionally from its heritage.” Further, “[w]hen we disassociate history—and memory—from facts, we are lost,” writes Goeglein, a former special assistant to President George W. Bush, a former Senate staffer, and, presently, vice president of external and government relations for Focus on the Family.

Our predicament is exemplified by the absurd, anti-historical 1619 Project of the New York Times, an initiative repudiated by many respected, liberal historians. It is being taught in roughly 4,500 schools nationwide. In a feat of historical and moral inversion, it maintains that the American Revolution was designed primarily to protect the institution of slavery from being destroyed by the British Empire. Such a one-sided view of history will alienate Americans from one another, given the dissolution of a common identity and love of country, and disregards those who struggled to make the Declaration of Independence a reality in spite of its obvious flaws, such as slavery.

On the matter of slavery, always a leading complaint against America’s founding, the Washington Post’s George Will has rightly observed that the founders’ Constitution “gave slavery no national validation. It left slavery solely a creature of state laws and therefore susceptible to the process that, in fact, occurred — the process of being regionally confined and put on a path to ultimate extinction. Secession was the South’s desperate response when it recognized this impending outcome that the Constitution had facilitated.”

So, it comes as no surprise that, as “a 2020 Pew Research study found a month before the presidential election, roughly eight in ten registered voters in both camps said their political disagreements with others were about core American values, with roughly nine in ten—liberal and conservative—worried [that] a victory by the other would lead to ‘lasting harm’ to the United States” [emphasis added]. We are now in a situation in which tribe is pitted against tribe, race against race, rich against poor, red against blue states.

We have succumbed to the “termites of self-loathing,” to use a term coined by Ben Stein. There is hardly a historic personage — Lincoln, Washington, Jefferson, Columbus, St. Junípero Serra — who is not vilified, “canceled,” and banished into outer darkness by woke activists and educators. One should be grateful that at least Frederick Douglass and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. are spared such treatment, given their devotion to American ideals in the Declaration of Independence, classical literature, and Scripture. They are just ignored.

Recently, a friend whose daughter attended one of the tonier prep schools in Washington, D.C., related that his conversations with her on U.S. and Western history were disappointing. She, and her friends, showed no “piety” toward her country or heritage.

It was an interesting word choice and recalled my own school days studying Virgil’s Aeneid, an epic poem written between 29 and 19 B.C. It tells the story of the Trojan Aeneas, who fled the destruction of his city, traveled to Italy, and would later become the ancestor of the Romans. I remember my Jesuit instructor lauding “pius Aeneas,” “pious” being the most used adjective throughout the poem. In following the will of the gods — he even left the captivating Dido in Carthage — Aeneas demonstrated “pietas,” a virtue in the eyes of Virgil and my teacher, in his devotion to family, country, and mission. Such piety is no longer encouraged in our educational institutions, or so it would seem.

What brought America to this sorry state? In the beginning there was the “Original Zinn” — Howard Zinn, that is, a Boston University professor of political science and “the godfather of the radical attack on America’s history,” as Goeglein outlines in a pivotal chapter of Toward a More Perfect Union. Zinn’s “epic screed,” A People’s History of the United States (1980), and his supplemental book for high schoolers, A Young People’s History of the United States (2007), have had an unparalleled impact on social studies teachers. The historian “refram[ed]” and “reimagin[ed]” facts to fit a Marxist critique of the U.S. and a Western civilization marred, claimed Zinn, “by the religion of popes, the government of kings, the frenzy for money.” For Zinn, “standards of historical analysis are merely ‘technical problems’ to be dismissed.”

“You wanna read a real history book?” Matt Damon’s titular character, Will, asks Robin Williams’ Dr. Sean Maguire in the movie Good Will Hunting (1997). “Read Howard Zinn’s People’s History of the United States. That book’ll f***ing knock you on your ass.” Indeed, it does. It also boggles the mind. Zinn claims that the nation “has been taken over by men [the founders] who have no respect for human rights or constitutional liberties.” Again, in service to ideology, Zinn does not believe in objective history as documented by Mary Grabar, Ph.D., a refugee of communist Yugoslavia, on whom Goeglein draws heavily.

Nikole Hannah-Jones, the main author of the 1619 Project, backtracked after respected historians critiqued her work. She claimed that the project was not about history but about “memory.” This is not historically grounded memory but memory saturated with ideology and politics. This is pure Zinn in methodology. Hence, noted historians such as Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Eugene Genovese, and Michael Kammen — hardly a crowd of right-wingers — criticized Zinn as a “polemicist, not a historian.”

“His ultimate goal is not a historical one but a political one,” writes Goeglein. “[H]e wanted to depict the United States as an illegitimate enterprise, one demanding a revolution.”

According to the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, today, only 18 percent of colleges require that students take a U.S. history or government class to graduate. Maybe that is a blessing, given what passes for “history” in today’s woke environment. Ultimately, however, this is devastating to national unity. Goeglein describes survey after survey that all indicate Americans’ ignorance of their rights under law and history. When the Constitution is taught, it is derided as being not radical enough in terms of the outcomes desired by left-of-center teachers and advocates.

Toward A More Perfect Union does not specify a political agenda for reform, although it does note efforts made by some governors to reign in educational bureaucracies on, say, critical race theory. It does make a plea for parents to make a concerted effort to teach and counsel their children on the history of the nation and to pay close attention to what their schools are teaching. It points to excellent resources available with which parents can educate themselves and their children on the complete story of American exceptionalism, not excluding the darker chapters. Parents who can afford the cost should look for alternatives to public schools that sacrifice true learning for the sake of ideology. “Classical” schools, home schooling, and parochial schools — all of which boomed during the COVID lockdowns — are possible options.

Parents who cannot afford private schools or who have special-needs children “must be extra vigilant and expect to receive the full wrath of Leftist activists if they stand up and demand that civics be taught while also standing against the indoctrination their children are receiving.” Specifically, they need to insist on the rights to inspect curricula, to opt out of the teaching of certain subjects, and to insist that controversial issues be discussed impartially. No easy tasks these.

Goeglein concludes:

[W]e must rededicate ourselves to the teaching of history—true, verifiable, factual history, with all its glories and tragedies. We need not fear to teach the ugly truths about America alongside the beautiful ones because America’s founding vision is pure and her ideals are noble. Our failures do not change that.

Toward a More Perfect Union makes a compelling case that the country’s future, as one nation, demands a reclamation of our educational system and a recovery of the authentic teaching of history and constitutional government rightly understood.",https://spectator.org/chinas-share-of-ukraine/,2023-01-07
Will Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine Spark the Next World War? - The American Spectator,"For years, Jonas Ohman, who founded the Blue/Yellow NGO after Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, believed the West considered Ukraine as “a nuisance.” He believed he understood the constant Russian threat to Ukraine, but the West under-appreciated the danger.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 sparked another “World War” and demonstrated the need to curb “an increasingly aggressive Russia,” Ohman told me. Ukraine has gone from being a nuisance to a shield.

“Roughly speaking, it’s go home or die,” Ohman said of Ukrainians in the Donbas and other parts of Ukraine under attack.

Ohman was in the Capitol last week to lobby members of Congress to keep sending aid so that his group and other NGOs can buy more equipment and weapons for Ukraine’s freedom fighters. His group, Ohman offered, can be more nimble and faster than the usual national security channels.

Blue/Yellow purchases helmets, night vision devices, medicine, vehicles, bulletproof vests, drones, and clothing — tools and gear vital for a pop-up civilian army — delivered by convoys originating from Lithuania, which the Swedish-born Ohman calls home. It’s a scrappy organization for civilians fighting to maintain control of their future.

After many missteps in other policy areas — stoking inflation, the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan — President Joe Biden is treading more carefully as he navigates a minefield.

His words have reflected the anger Americans feel watching as Russian troops have killed civilians and leveled cities and towns. Who did not agree with Biden when he said in Warsaw, Poland, in March that Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”?

Wednesday, Biden laid out his goals in the region. “We want to see a democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous Ukraine with the means to deter and defend itself against further aggression,” Biden wrote in a New York Times opinion piece.

At the same time, Biden offered, “We do not seek a war between NATO and Russia.” And he argued that the war “will only definitively end through diplomacy,” as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky himself has said. (READ MORE: The Theft of a Nation: Ukraine’s Fight for Existence)

Biden also pledged not to pressure Ukraine to make territorial concessions, as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger recently suggested. Good. Zelensky may choose to make concessions, but it is not in American interests to push for them.

Like many Americans, I thought that when Russia invaded, Ukraine would fold. I underestimated Zelensky, the Ukrainians, and the effect of people like Ohman. And so did Putin.

Russia-Ukraine: China and India Could End the War - The American Spectator,"China and India are now trying to distance themselves from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine, which commenced in February of this year. This is a powerful combination of two countries that have the standing, especially in partnership, to influence the Russian president in a way no other countries have.

On Friday, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India told Putin that “today’s era is not of war.” This low-key but pointed statement came a day after Putin acknowledged that President Xi Jinping of China had “questions and concerns” about the war in Ukraine. Some members of the mainstream media are predictably reading too much into Modi’s statement, saying that he is “assailing” Putin, even though the prime minister’s statement was relatively mild and stopped well short of a condemnation.

Nonetheless, this could be interpreted as the start of a shifting of an opinion that has previously been supportive of Putin: For nearly seven months, both China and India have hesitated to join the West in its outrage against the Kremlin. Russia, as the junior partner in the Russia–China relationship, is now the leading supplier of China’s oil — about 2 million barrels per day. Further, in August, Russia was reported to be India’s third-largest source of oil, after Iraq and, by a small margin, Saudi Arabia. In June, India’s oil imports from Russia reached 950,000 barrels per day, with Russia offering discounts in recent months.

China imports more than twice as much Russian oil as India. China would appear to be in a relatively stronger position than India; oil is a global commodity and sources of supply can be restructured. The war in Ukraine is detrimental to China’s strategic interest, especially to its massive export model, which allows it to amass foreign currency reserves that it uses for its own investment and for the development of countries that subscribe to the Belt and Road Initiative. A slowing Chinese economy, disruption from its massive COVID lockdown, a distressed and overbuilt real estate sector, and fears of a global recession (as expressed earlier this week by FedEx, which may be viewed as a bellwether or “lead steer” in the world economy) do not bode well for Beijing.

India, on the other hand, is currently also dependent upon Russia for its military equipment. As I have written in The American Spectator, nearly half of such current equipment is of Russian origin, with over 2,000 of the country’s T-72 tanks dating to the Soviet era. And with a 4,000-mile border to defend against Pakistan and China, India will be reliant on Russian arms for years to come.

Extensively sanctioned by Europe and the United States, failing in capturing Kiev, and suffering what appears to be a dramatic military reversal in the Kharkiv region of northeast Ukraine, Russia is seeing its economic and military misfortunes beginning to affect public opinion within Russia, with some public officials now calling for Putin’s impeachment. Allowing further disgrace and humiliation of Putin, in spite of legitimate Ukrainian cries for revenge, is not in the world’s best interest: The events of the 20th century demonstrated that Germany’s humiliating surrender terms at the end of World War I eventually led to a cataclysm. One can speculate that the use of a tactical nuclear weapon by Putin would assure his near universal status as a pariah, but who is to know the mind of an isolated Russian strongman, who has destroyed his country’s future for many years and knows he might be going down with it?

The time has come for Xi Jinping and Modi, acting in concert, to call for a summit of the two direct combatants, plus NATO and the U.S., and themselves — and some of the former Soviet republics in Central Asia, where both Russia and China have vested interests in the oil and gas sectors. Ukraine must also be made to realize that militarily ousting Russia from all Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine is an unreasonable operational objective that could prolong the war indefinitely and increase the risk that, out of spite and desperation, a nuclear weapon could be used.

NATO and the U.S. may not be enthused about having China and India inside the tent. After nearly seven months of a high-intensity conflict, however, economic sanctions, the supply of state-of-the-art artillery and other equipment, and diplomatic initiatives have not changed Putin’s course.

It would be highly problematic for Putin to decline such an invitation from a couple of his best friends. If he did, he would be met with shrieks of execration from friend and foe alike.

Support for Ukraine Does Not Come From ‘Current Thingism’ - The American Spectator,"Just as there are fundamental laws of nature, among which can be counted the laws of conservation of energy, mass, and linear momentum, so too are there fundamental laws of human nature, which may be said to include the law of conservation of hysteria. It was the literary critic Elaine Showalter, in her provocative 1997 study Hystories: Hysterical Epidemics and Modern Media, who demonstrated how a “constant cultural negotiation” takes place over the collective psychopathological “symptom pool as a whole and the legitimacy of its contents.” The “quantity of hysterical energy” in our shared symptom pool, Showalter convincingly argued, “does not decrease but flows into new channels and takes new names.” Thus, we find a more or less static quantum of hysteria distributed throughout the human population, which in different historical and cultural contexts will assume the form of various psychogenic or sociogenic disorders. Neurasthenia gives way to generalized anxiety and chronic fatigue syndromes; railway spine and shell shock are transmuted into trauma and stressor-related disorders; once-common nonorganic ailments like hysterical leg paralysis and la belle indifférence are replaced with updated conversion disorders; and iatrogenic contagions like multiple personality disorder cede the field to more au courant manifestations of dysphoria.

The same goes for the body politic, which is subject to a related law of conservation of public hysteria. Popular delusions, causes célèbres, moral panics, and identitarian conflicts come and go, borne along by fluctuating news cycles. There is something genuinely manic about our media environment, something mesmeric but deeply unsettling, always stirring us up and giving us fits. It is little wonder that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe labeled political commentators “the excitable ones.” “A constant flow of news invades life today,” wrote the Colombian philosopher Nicolás Gómez Dávila, “destroying the silence and peace of humble lives, without abolishing their tedium.” We are never short on partisan rancor, a new culture war is always in the offing, and there’s always an election, a landmark Supreme Court ruling, or an ambiguous police shooting to bring things right back to a fever pitch. With only so much room on the front pages, even in this era of infinite scrolling, and with our attention spans more and more attenuated, the Feiler faster thesis has been all but confirmed, as the increasing pace of modern life and the swift succession of news cycles become inextricably intertwined.

Recall how, a generation ago, the Satanic Panic, Band-Aid, and the Free Tibet campaign were omnipresent one minute and gone the next, replaced by novel conspiracy theories and new causes for humanitarian handwringing. One does wonder what happened to all those satanic cultists, though, or if they still have droughts and famines in the Horn of Africa and cultural genocide in Tibet, but time marches on I suppose. Recall how the relatively tranquil pre–9/11 salad days were dominated by the infamous tabloid coverage of the 2001 “Summer of the Shark,” during which shark attacks actually declined year-over-year. Within a few months, there were more pressing issues at hand than a few hungry Carcharhinidae in tropical waters. News stories, like thorns, pierce us acutely, fester for a while, then work their way back out again, soon to be forgotten. Kony 2012 and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign might seize the spotlight for a short time, but the depredations of the Lord’s Resistance Army and Boko Haram are soon largely consigned to oblivion outside of Uganda and Nigeria. We closely follow, blow by blow, the dramatic events of the 2011 First Libyan Civil War, at least until Muammar Gaddafi is sodomized and executed on camera by the Misrata militia, but the Second Libyan Civil War (2014–2020) is far too prolonged and complex, and there’s no obvious villain, so we find ourselves drawn instead to the horrors of the Syrian Civil War (with the possible exception of libertarian Gary “What’s Aleppo?” Johnson). The equally hellish Yemeni Civil War, the Central African Republic Civil War, the Myanmar Civil War, and any number of other ongoing conflicts are meanwhile relegated to lower rungs of the league table of international concern, while in February of 2022 Ukraine rockets instantly to the top.

We are all witting or unwitting participants in a never-ending cultural negotiation over what is worthy of our collective attention, however profoundly consequential or thoroughly idiotic it may be, a negotiation guided in no small part, of course, by the interests of the politico-media complex. The end result is our own particular zeitgeist, punctuated with what is increasingly being called the “Current Thing,” a term used to describe that heady admixture of current events and conventional idées reçues. Inevitably, there will be those who, as the well-worn meme has it, reflexively “support the current thing,” as well as those who reflexively oppose said current thing, which is hardly more impressive. There are even some individuals, I’m told, who form opinions based on reasoned judgment and the thoughtful consideration of relative merits — but enough about that dying breed.

*****

“Current Thingism,” if we must use such an infelicitous neologism, is itself hardly new, being part and parcel of modernity and its tendency towards presentism, that phenomenon described by the fin de siècle German sociologist Georg Simmel as “the temporal dissolution of everything substantial, absolute and eternal into the flow of things, into historical mutability, into merely psychological reality,” wherein “every moment is supposed to be taken to be so important as if life existed for its sake.” Such conditions make Current Thingism unavoidable, though the ubiquity of social media, media bias, and elite capture have obviously served as further catalysts. In an Aug. 8, 2022 essay in the American Conservative, “The Tyranny of the ‘Current Thing,’” Adam Ellwanger bemoaned the perfervid state of “Current Thingism,” blaming it for many of our present ills, given its tendency to elevate “one political concern over all the others, which justifies inaction on other matters that may, in fact, be more urgent.” The “monomaniacal focus on a particular issue,” like the novel coronavirus pandemic or the invasion of Ukraine, Ellwanger contends, serves to forge an artificial consensus and push the issue “beyond the realm of debate entirely.” Ellwanger does not go into how an undisputed Current Thing like SARS-CoV-2 can produce disparate consensuses in, say, Sweden, the United States, Australia, and China, or even in different parts of our federal system, but the point is well taken, and some consensuses, scientific, political, or otherwise, can blind us to the faulty reasoning we saw bear noxious fruit in the form of lockdowns, school closures, mandatory masking, and mRNA vaccine mandates.

It is a rather sad reflection of the fractured and dysfunctional state of our political life, though, that any broad consensus — like the 73 percent of American respondents agreeing that the United States should continue to support Ukraine in its existential struggle against Russia — is seen by some commentators as inherently suspicious. Ellwanger, for his part, insists that “the fact that so many of the self-professed defenders of Our Democracy are so adamantly devoted to the Current Thing calls their motives into question,” before suggesting to his readers: “The next time you see an American flying a Ukrainian flag, ask yourself: could they find the nation on a map?” This supermajority of poor, deluded American sheeple, unable to find Ukraine on a map, but brainwashed into supporting its cause, and incapable of having any other concerns about inflation or gas prices or border security — this is a pretty uncharitable characterization, and one which frankly raises concerns about the entire discourse surrounding Current Thingism, however receptive I would ordinarily be to the argument that constantly shifting, and all too often hysterical, media narratives are decidedly detrimental to the body politic.

At the very least, it should be noted that there are more than a million Americans of Ukrainian descent, the vast majority of whom are perfectly capable of finding the land of their forebears on a map, and who are unlikely to appreciate Russia’s predilection for setting up torture chambers in temporarily occupied Ukrainian towns, looting museums, abducting children, and launching cruise missiles and incendiary munitions straight into apartment blocks, hospitals, theaters, and playgrounds. They are likewise less than receptive, unlike some on the fringes of the American political spectrum, to Russian genocidal rhetoric about George Soros–funded Jewish Banderite Nazis, and invasion justifications predicated on the supposed existence of clandestine Ukrainian “bioweapons labs” breeding weaponized birds infected with “Slavic DNA-targeting” pathogens, or whatever nonsense the Russian Ministry of Defense is currently spouting. I can assure Professor Ellwanger that the members of our local Ukrainian-American cultural association, and the congregants at our local Slavic churches who have been tirelessly organizing rallies, public prayers, charity bake sales, benefit concerts, collections of millions of dollars worth of humanitarian supplies, and preparing accommodations for Ukrainian refugees, can both fly the blue and yellow Prapor Ukrainy and “find the nation on the map.” I suspect a great many other Americans who have become invested in this ongoing tragedy, to the point of taking the time to display their public support for Ukraine, have probably at some point come across the occasional article or news package giving them some notion of where Ukraine is (next to Russia).

We are free, all the same, to debate policy particulars relating to the war in Ukraine. Tucker Carlson, for one, regularly does so, though even he has apparently evolved from his earlier incendiary stance of “Why do I care what is going on in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia? I’m serious. Why shouldn’t I root for Russia? Which by the way I am” and “we should probably take the side of Russia if we have to choose between Russia and Ukraine” to the more measured position that what Putin is doing “in Ukraine — while I think historically significant, certainly significant to Ukrainians — is not more significant to me than what gas costs.” Carlson, like Ellwanger, presumably just maintains a different set of political priorities and can proceed accordingly.

That said, many of the complaints about Current Thingism, particularly in the Ukrainian arena, seem to stem from a certain ressentiment about the breadth and depth of the Western pro-Ukrainian consensus. There are admittedly some, like Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser under Trump, who are willing to go on The Mel K Show and proclaim the war criminal Vladimir Putin and the increasingly unhinged dipsomaniac Dmitry Medvedev to be “bold leaders who have everything at stake in terms of protecting their country,” and Volodymyr Zelensky to be “a foolish person, a dangerous fool,” or those like Thierry Baudet, a member of the Dutch House of Representatives, who has openly declared, “I hope Russia will win, I think it’s fantastic that someone like Putin exists.” Michael Weiss of New Lines Magazine put it best: “To be honest, I prefer this blunt confession to all the undercooked efforts by Putinistas on the far right and far left who deny they’re stooging for him or an outright Russian victory.” Others who are like-minded but more cautious, and less prepared to risk voicing similar or perhaps slightly milder sentiments in the public square, doubtless feel cowed by the current political environment and prefer to rage against the Current Thing as a form of displacement.

Regardless of one’s views, it seems impossible to gainsay that the war in Ukraine is a “historically significant” or even epochal event worthy of being a Current Thing, if we must call it that. It is the largest European conflict since the Second World War, and figures to grow rather than decrease in scale. Tens of thousands of soldiers have fallen in battle, thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been killed, millions of Ukrainian refugees have been uprooted, and hundreds of thousands of Russians have fled their increasingly despotic homeland. Entire cities have been flattened, priceless works of art have been destroyed or plundered, the Black Sea is saturated with sea mines, and Ukraine’s rich agricultural land is decimated and riddled with land mines and shrapnel. Nuclear power plants are caught in the crossfire, and bloodthirsty Russian nationalists are raising the grotesque specter of nuclear war. The conflict has caused mounting global energy and food insecurity, has prompted diplomatic realignments and the expansion of NATO, and has pitted radically different political and economic systems against each other in a Huntington-esque clash of civilizations. Are the people of Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and other countries who are caught up in all this, as they host millions of Ukrainian refugees while tirelessly supporting their beleaguered ally, themselves guilty of “Current Thingism”? Haven’t they heard about inflation? Maybe there were people in 1938 complaining that all this talk of the Anschluss and the Sudetenland was just Current Thingism detracting from more important matters like commodity prices and public budget deficits, but, ultimately, we should acknowledge that some things are Current Things for a very good reason, and that not every captivating news event is the Summer of the Shark or a cynical ploy to distract people from other worthy issues.

*****

There are two ways in which one might conceivably combat the phenomenon of “Current Thingism,” aside from simply grumbling about it. The first is to engage in news avoidance, which actually has increased markedly in recent years. (Maybe some people were inspired by Morrissey’s 2017 single “Spent the Day in Bed,” which urged listeners to “stop watching the news.”) There is also the option of becoming an unworldly gnostic Perfectus embracing trans-materialism, or a Buddhist ascetic practicing the 12 dhūtaguṇas, the better to shake off your earthly defilements. You could even practice sokushinbutsu and enter into a state of mummification while still alive, if you like, and then never have to deal with obnoxious newspaper headlines ever again. You could just succumb to taedium vitae, and disregard the Current Things since the universe will eventually experience heat death and achieve a state of maximum entropy anyway, rendering the course of human events an ultimately trifling matter. The possibilities are endless. Or, instead of calling people with allegedly misplaced priorities “NPCs” only interested in the “Current Thing,” you could engage in what used to be known as a “policy debate,” and work to challenge our collective idées fixes and replace them with your own set of Current Things. Elon Musk actually tried to do that recently, in his own idiosyncratic way, with his ludicrous, one-sided plan for “peace” (capitulation, rather) in Ukraine. He was then subjected to intense criticism in the marketplace of ideas, defended by his fanboys and pro-Russian elements, and when his Twitter poll came out differently than he hoped, he simply declared that it was all the work of nefarious bots. Not exactly Attic orators holding forth in the Athenian agora, but it is what it is, and we take what we can get.

Ukraine is evidently something of a special case, which has frustrated those like the Critic contributor Daniel Barnes, who in his Oct. 4 piece “Armenia’s Lonely Plight” lamented the “complete lack of an international response” to the clashes that took place between Armenia and Azerbaijan back in September, “despite the unmitigated aggression from one side” (Azerbaijan). “When there were reports of war crimes by Azerbaijan (white phosphorus use, torture and killing of prisoners, intentional targeting of historical monuments), nothing was done.” The West, Barnes notes, has supported Ukraine nearly to the hilt, but not hard-pressed Armenia, leading him to wonder: “Why has the West abandoned its principles now?” Why, at the risk of sounding flippant, is Armenia’s plight not a Current Thing? Anyone who has seen the dreadful footage of Azerbaijani soldiers callously executing a group of unarmed Armenian prisoners, or has read accounts of the grisly mutilations of dead female Armenian service members, realizes that this has proven to be a savage conflict altogether worthy of international attention.

Barnes should be congratulated for his attempt to elevate the tone, not just complaining about Current Thingism but educating his readers about the deep historical background and present state of a conflict that has indeed been unfairly eclipsed of late. It must be acknowledged, however, that there are reasons why a conflict or other newsworthy event might not attain the coveted status of global causes célèbre. The Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict provides a useful fact pattern in this respect. Here we have two nations that many Americans might legitimately struggle to find on a map — though if someone chooses to fly an Armenian flag, I would graciously assume that he or she probably can — but if they are able to do so, they will find some of the most bizarrely constructed borderlines in geopolitical history, products of the brutal First Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988–1994), an engagement marked by pogroms and war crimes perpetrated by each side and followed by an unstable, decades-long frozen conflict that was always bound to return with a vengeance. Unlike in Ukraine, the aggressor in the Armenian-Azerbaijani clashes is, according to international law, the aggrieved party, given that the Armenian enclave of Artsakh (formerly Nagorno-Karabakh) has never been recognized by any United Nations member states. The 2008 UN General Assembly Resolution 62/243, which called for the withdrawal of all Armenian forces from occupied territories of Azerbaijan, was passed over the objections of Russia, France, the United States, and the OSCE Minsk Group, and indicated a considerable level of support for Azerbaijan’s cause, if not necessarily its adopted methods.

Making matters worse for Armenia is its membership in the Russian-dominated Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). Unlike NATO, this is a largely useless intergovernmental organization, seeing as member states Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are routinely shelling each other, Kazakhstan has sought security guarantees from China rather than Russia while refusing to recognize Russia’s attempted “annexation” of Ukrainian oblasts, Kyrgyzstan just canceled the ironically titled “Indestructible Brotherhood-2022” CSTO joint military drills, and Armenia itself is complaining of the CSTO’s unwillingness to aid them in their fight against Azerbaijan. Effectively a Russian client state, with all the paltry benefits that entails, Armenia is simply unable to look west for meaningful support.

Azerbaijan, however, has played its cards rather better, biding its time, growing its economy and armed forces, allying itself with military heavyweights Turkey and Israel, and signing a July 2022 agreement with the EU to double natural gas deliveries to Europe in the near future. In “Armenia’s Lonely Plight,” Barnes complains that “now we are in bed with the dictatorship. Azerbaijan ranks near the bottom in all practical freedom rankings: freedom of the press, freedom of religion, governance et cetera. Yet, whilst we sanction those next to them on the list, we are friends with Azerbaijan.” Shouting into the geopolitical wind, Barnes demands to know “Why don’t we care?” and “Why has the West abandoned its principles now?” The answer, as he is no doubt aware, is simple: raison d’état. As Tucker Carlson argued, the Ukrainian invasion is “historically significant,” but so is the cost (or mere availability) of fossil fuel. European leaders realize this, and are willing to do business with a much more reliable, and slightly less violent, partner in the form of Azerbaijan’s Ilham Aliyev. So there you go — they are addressing two Current Things at once. Not so monomaniacal after all, though whether you approve on moral grounds of this exercise in Realpolitik is another matter altogether. Thus the lonely plight of Armenia has largely failed to make the cut, though we remain free to argue otherwise, and can and should do our best to raise awareness of the humanitarian toll of Azerbaijani aggression.

Sometimes a Current Thing is a matter of global and indeed epochal importance, entirely worthy of our attention. Sometimes it is a product of hysterical contagion, or cynical media bias, or even outright stupidity. And sometimes it can crowd out the marketplace of ideas, inhibiting debate. But Current Things will always come and go, subject to the law of conservation of hysteria, and it is up to all of us to distinguish between what is and is not worthwhile, to reject presentism and place events in their historical and cultural context, and to balance humanitarian idealism with skeptical realism in the best interests of national and international security. To merely decry “Current Thingism,” and to accuse one’s ideological opponents of being nothing more than servile “NPCs,” risks reducing crucial policy debates that affect millions of souls to the puerile level of meme-making. Facile argumentation only devalues our already debased cultural negotiations.

And with that, I think I can relieve myself of the obligation to write the words “the Current Thing” ever again.",https://spectator.org/dont-be-fooled-by-the-idea-of-china-intervening-in-ukraine/,2022-10-15
The Best Negotiated Putin-Ukraine Agreement I Can Come Up With - The American Spectator,"I begin with the premise that Putin is not a madman, neither insane nor crazy. If your politics requires you to deem otherwise, you cannot reach an agreement with him. Democrats like to believe that Trump and Putin both are insane dictators. By contrast, they perceive Joe Biden to be the epitome of measured contemplation. That says plenty.

I deem Putin to be sensible and logically motivated. Primarily, NATO has not admitted Russia but did accept a theocratic, dictator-driven regime in Recep Erdogan’s Turkey. Putin does not want an oppositional NATO stationed on his western flank, with NATO weapons and armed forces able to strike anything dynamic Russia tries to do. Is that unreasonable?

Putin has acted grievously by invading Ukraine, but his determined opposition to a NATO polity on his border is comprehensible. We Americans have made clear, almost from our founding, that we will not abide foreign countries coming to the Western Hemisphere to engage in mischief. We call it “The Monroe Doctrine.” By 1962 we still were ready to go to nuclear war to get Russian missiles out of Cuba.

(Most college students today would assume our “Monroe Doctrine” has something to do with Marilyn Monroe and her white dress over the New York subway sidewalk air vents. It is what it is. Tear down Teddy Roosevelt monuments, ban naming public schools for Abraham Lincoln. One of these days a bunch of AOC acolytes will start pneumatic-drilling and digging up the pavement of the FDR Drive and moving the cement somewhere. Really, that is the way to honor heroes in the future: skip the school namings, and let pigeons find somewhere else to see a man about a horse. Name highways and freeways for Columbus.)

In addition, Putin wants to be remembered as Putin the Great, akin to Russian historic dominant figures like Catherine the Great and Peter the Great. History has had others: Alexander the Great, André the Giant, Charlemagne (Charles the Great). Others of note have included Vlad the Impaler, Hans the Great, Philp the Fair, Charles the Bald, and Stan the Man. Putin has held various leadership positions the past twenty years: Russian President from 2000-2008 and 2012 until now, Prime Minister from 1999-2000 and 2008-2012. Initially, a guy like him has the goal of holding on, not getting assassinated or impeached-and-ousted. Soon, he sees he can hold on, so redirects his life foci on getting reelectedas often as possible. Then he starts aiming to stay in office even after he is termed-out. (Abu Mazen aka Mahmoud Abbas of the “Palestine Authority,” elected January 2005, now is in the 17th year of his five-year term.) Once they have been in power a long time, as Putin has, they begin thinking more about Wikipedia and legacy.

Russia expanded to an imposing empire during its Stalin-Khrushchev-Brezhnev USSR days. The empire crumbled under Gorbachev. I am happy it crumbled; Putin is not. He does not want to be remembered for losing Russia’s status to China. When states tried to break off from America in the mid-1800s, a Civil War erupted. There were lots of reasons for the Civil War, and almost all are extraneous to this discussion. But one factor — whether major or minor — is that the Union wanted the country to retain its maximized size, not to let states just walk away. That is the same reason California and New York each will not allow large conservative populations to break off from those rabidly progressive states today. It is the reason the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will not accede to split as have other over-sized circuits. (The Fifth, for example, split into a smaller Fifth Circuit and an Eleventh Circuit when it got too big.) The Union simply did not want a half dozen Dixie states breaking off if they could be militarily coerced into remaining part of the Union.

(Note to college kids, especially political science and American history majors: The “Union” was the “North.” “North” is the direction that is on top on most maps. They were for Lincoln and anti-slavery. The “South” was called “Dixie.” It also was called the “Confederacy.” TMI? LOL. “Dixie” has nothing to do with Dixie cups, and you still may drink from them without being expelled from college for systemic racism. Slavery existed in Dixie, also called the “South.” “South” is opposite of “North,” and it usually is on the bottom, but they are not literally living inside the ground. It also just-so-happens that South Dakota is in the North, and North Carolina is in the South. I will explain more about that another day. The other directions are “East” and “West.” “Eastward” sounds like Clint “Eastwood,” and he is to the right, so “East” is to the right. That means only one other side is left. So “West” is “left” on maps.)

Just as Lincoln went to war for five years to retain the South in the Union, Putin wants his empire back. He went to war to hold on to the Republic of Georgia. (College kids: That’s a different Georgia, not where the Atlanta Braves play and where peaches grow. That Georgia has the same name as our Georgia because they both are named for guys named George. It’s like how there is Charleston, West Virginia and Charleston, South Carolina because of kings named “Charles.”)

Putin has warred to take back Crimea, Georgia, and rebuild the empire. He always has wanted Ukraine, too. Putin carefully refrained from invading when George W. Bush or Donald Trump was President. Rather, he carefully engaged empire-building only when Obama and Biden presided. That is not the methodology of a madman but of a logical player. Similarly, he waited for Biden to be in office for an entire year so the invasion would not be seen as a frontal insult against Biden, as if to say “Trump left on Monday, and Biden came in on Tuesday, so I attacked on Tuesday.” Rather, Putin wanted to avoid being overtly insulting, which could have forced Biden into face-saving leadership. He further delayed another three or four weeks beyond a year — well after January 21, 2022 — for the Winter Olympics to play out. That way, universal opposition would not be staged while the entire world would focus at the same place at the same time. This all reflects measured contemplation.

The invasion is a terrible thing.

One response is to make it a million times worse by neoconservatives sending in American boys and adventurously trying to “nation-build.” Bad idea. Hamas and Hezbollah see democracy and free elections, and soon they are electing dictators while showing off their purple-inked fingers. The Arab Muslims of Gaza were bequeathed democracy, so they elected Hamas terrorists.

Better Idea: negotiate a deal that gives Putin and Zelensky each what he really wants and needs.

Here, Ukraine wants to live as a free, independent country. After many centuries of history, they have demonstrated entitlement to that. It would have been nice if they had skipped engaging in centuries of pogroms and anti-Jewish massacres, with some of the worst this past century when their nationalists assisted the German Nazi Einsatzgruppen.

As for Putin, he wants his empire back and wants NATO off his tail.

Ukraine needs somehow to enter into a promise they will never apply to join NATO, will never join NATO even if bequeathed membership, will remain neutral in any NATO-Russia conflicts. If they cannot make that undertaking, I don’t see how they get Putin to back off. By contrast, if they do, then just we gotta figure out how Ukraine remains independent — but also part of Putin’s empire.

I look at Canada. They are independent but are part of the United Kingdom. Here is their Royal Anthem. (And here is one of their finest anthem moments.) Despite their independence, the Canadians also have some kind of affiliation with the Brits. None of them endeavors to win plaudits for cuisine. (“Wanna do Italian or Chinese, or maybe French or Thai tonight? Naah, let’s eat British or Australian. Know where we can find a great Canada restaurant?” Never.)

Really, that cuts the deal. Russia and Putin have no interest in returning to communism anyway. Ukrainians and Russians speak similar languages, have similar cultures. Now that Ukraine has demonstrated to Putin that he cannot just roll over them, Putin may actually prefer getting done. But he absolutely has to emerge the winner. Dictators who lose get assassinated. Therefore, he has to paint any deal as his big win. Let him keep Ukraine out of NATO, add Ukraine to some kind of Russian equivalent of the UK, maybe with their own new anthem, “Take Me Out to the Hockey Rink,” and we all return to watching what else Biden and Pelosi can mess up while Kamala giggles and cackles.

Loss of Queen Leaves Deep Unease Across UK - The American Spectator,"Three months ago, colorful crowds caroused in the streets of London as the queen stepped onto the Buckingham Palace balcony to celebrate her 70th year on the throne. Today, the streets are quiet, grey, and bleak. A cloud of melancholy has settled on the United Kingdom, and with it, a palpable unease.

I visited Buckingham Palace the morning after we lost our queen. London’s air was thicker. The train carriages held quiet, puffy-eyed commuters reading morning papers in disbelief at a day the whole nation felt could never arrive. When we arrived in London, the station foyer lay still.

I walked up Whitehall — the center of the United Kingdom’s political power — as civil servants clothed in black talked in hushed voices. The Red Lion, a favored pub of London’s politicians, had removed the Union flags which usually adorn its bright exterior. It was empty.

Behind the iron gates of Downing Street, more crowds gathered as Jaguars prepared to carry the new prime minister — installed just two days earlier — the short distance to Parliament, where a special session sat for tributes to the late queen. A new prime minister would ordinarily take comfort from her counsel and seek solace in the stability she offered; Liz Truss is the first of 15 prime ministers since 1952 who cannot do so.

Along Whitehall, two men dressed in red tunics and mounted on horseback flanked the entrance to Horse Guards Parade. They belonged to what was, until last Thursday, known as the Queen’s Guard. I passed through the large archway into the graveled expanse of the parade ground where more mounted guards gathered in rows; tourists watched from behind a rope.

Drizzle dampened the yellow stones and pooled in shallow puddles. Even the jangle of horses’ reins, and the clatter of the guard’s armor, were muted. Pensively, tourists slipped phones out of their pockets, unsure whether to snap a photo of a postcard London scene.

I joined the crowds marching solemnly toward the palace. When we reached the Queen Victoria Memorial, a heavy rain began to fall. Only the snap of umbrellas opening briefly interrupted the silence. Many of us stood watching as others formed a line to lay flowers alongside the heap of wet flora lining the perimeter fence. At the front of the line, one woman hesitated — lilies drooping in the rain — as though she were unsure whether to place them or whether she even had a right to mourn this person whom she had never met, yet who was so intimately woven into her life. Her bundle joined the others, our nation’s tributes to our queen, whose loss has left us wondering who we are now.

Queen Elizabeth II was the United Kingdom’s final constant, an enduring connection to our past, and a cornerstone of our culture. In losing her, we have been loosed into the modern world and unpinned from our history. The monarchy endures, but the stability and continuity that she personally represented through the traditions her very longevity upheld have died with her. As inevitable as her one day passing has always been, somehow we were still unprepared.

As King Charles III steps into the role he has spent 73 years preparing for, it is difficult to envision the next era. Ostensibly, we will continue as we always have, carrying out justice in his name and appointing governments to serve him. And perhaps the history we once imagined belonged to the queen will continue through the monarchy itself. (READ MORE: The Prince of Wales Becomes a King)

The new king has begun by putting the United Kingdom’s union at the center of his purpose, reaffirming our nation’s relationship with itself. It is in clear continuity with his late mother’s seven decades of work, an attempt to reassure the nation that whilst the queen is lost, and we feel lost, our nation, and our constitutional monarchy, will endure.

The United Kingdom will take time to adapt from queen to king, but as the second Elizabethan era closes, the nation is left wondering what the United Kingdom, and the Commonwealth, will look like in the third Carolean age. For now, we are waiting in the hush, stricken dumb by the loss of the person whose life embodied tradition itself and whose death marks the end of the last enduring constant in public life.

This Offensive Will Not Stop With Ukraine - The American Spectator,"In 494 B.C., just as Biden was graduating from college, the region of Ionia was threatened by the Persians. They could not stand the fact that Ionia was populated by Greeks, and they hated the fact that they had a different religion and culture. Moreover, Ionia was located in a place they wanted. There is a shuddering parallel between this episode of history and Putin’s obsession with restarting the Soviet Union in 2022.

Faced with the imminent Persian invasion, Ionia asked the other Greek cities for cooperation, hoping that they would help to dissuade the Persian king or at least defend themselves once the war began. The response was as lukewarm as the soul of a Brussels bureaucrat: a good part of the Greek cities did not want to face such a dangerous power as Persia, a large group of intellectuals even publicly admired the despotic Persian form of government, and the rest of the Greek decision-makers chose to remain silent and look the other way. Of course, there were flowery statements from the Greeks in support of Ionia, very heartfelt and poetic, but nothing more. In the end, the Persians savagely annihilated the Ionians and destroyed and set fire to their cities while the Greeks devoted themselves, I suppose, to smashing their own monuments with their heads, thinking of the tourism the ruins would bring during the 20th century.

But, perceiving the weakness and division of Greece, the Persians were not satisfied with Ionia, but soon after, under King Darius’ command, Persia also attacked Greece, starting a bloody and endless succession of wars. Naturally, the Persian pretext was the predictable one: that Athens had supported Ionia in the conflict.

This Wednesday, Zelensky, who at times reminds me of the Hero played by Dustin Hoffman, addressed the Capitol trying to stir consciences and then some. He elicited a loud and emotional ovation and, I suspect, little else. The fear of nuclear conflict is rather like the fear the Greeks had of unleashing a war against the mighty Persians. In fact, they preferred to surrender Ionia rather than get into trouble. But the truth is that they had — I am bored of this quote — the dishonor, and then the war as well. I have a question for those who today play the nuclear anti-war card: what makes you think that looking the other way while Putin massacres Ukrainians will spare the West from nuclear war?

No, I am not looking forward to a nuclear holocaust. I have no desire to have to put on hazmat suits every time I go shopping with my family; after two years of pandemic, I feel an irrepressible need to be able to scratch the tip of my nose without anything getting in my way. But I note on both sides of the political spectrum an obsessive denial of the evidence. Even a good deal of conservatives are adamant that, however unjust the deaths of Ukrainians may be (if you didn’t cry with the video Zelensky screened on Capitol Hill you probably have no soul), the risk of a full-scale nuclear conflict is too high. I find it quite repugnant to value people’s right to live based on the risks of those who have a moral obligation to defend it. Again, take a look at Ionia and Athens. The Greeks didn’t want to take the risk. They sold Ionia out for ten more minutes of fake peace. (READ MORE: How Future Historians Will View Ukraine)

The West must stand with Zelensky on the battlefield. There are many ways to do so while minimizing the risk of nuclear war. It is time for intelligence, leadership, and talent. There are a million things we can still do to help the Ukrainians, and perhaps the first of them is not to livestream every damn secret operation we are going to conduct, including the delivery of weapons or aircraft. The delivery of the Polish planes to Ukraine was thwarted by the indiscretion of Josep Borrell, head of European Union Foreign Affairs, a guy who being Spanish, like me, doesn’t protect him from being an idiot. The operation was supposed to be secret, but he was overcome by the desire to appear at a press conference to tell the story and score a point or two. He screwed up the operation. In the same way that Biden’s verbal incontinence in anticipation of the White House’s plans for inaction encouraged Putin to throw himself headfirst into this war.

There is, definitely, a lot we should learn from all this. And also from Ionia. This offensive will not stop with Ukraine.",https://spectator.org/establishment-scholar-trust-irans-moderates-not-to-build-nukes/,2022-03-17
Ukraine-Russia: A Common Sense and Workable Proposal for Real Peace - The American Spectator,"There is no such thing as a perfect peace. Wars produce misery and destruction, resolve some dangers and problems, and create others. Those voices in the West who are urging Ukrainians to fight on to victory over Russia, or who are recommending Western moves — such as a no-fly zone — that will likely extend or widen the war are playing with fire. The “unconditional surrender” of Vladimir Putin and his trial as a war criminal is not a viable peace option, however emotionally satisfying it may sound. The best possible outcome of this war is for Ukraine to maintain its independence and most of its territorial integrity while meeting some of Russia’s demands for its non-alignment with Western powers.

Such a proposal has been put forth in Foreign Affairs by A. Wess Mitchell, who served as President Trump’s Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia from 2017 to 2019, and who has authored insightful books on history, diplomacy, grand strategy, and geopolitics. In 2016, Mitchell coauthored (with Jakub Grygiel) The Unquiet Frontier, which identified Russia as one of three Eurasian powers (China and Iran are the others) that are “revisionist” countries intent on overturning the U.S.-led maritime world order, and called Russia’s western border (which includes Ukraine) a “contested geopolitical fault line.” America’s key allies in that region, Mitchell wrote, were the Baltic states, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary (all NATO allies) — not Ukraine.

Two years later, Mitchell wrote The Grand Strategy of the Habsburg Empire, a brilliant study of Habsburg geopolitics that exemplified what he described as “an acute sense of the transience and fragility of all human accomplishment” and a “weary wisdom anchored in the humility that comes from the realization that geopolitical problems can rarely be solved, only managed.” The principal lesson that he derived from studying Habsburg foreign policy over several centuries is “an acceptance that the task of enlightened statecraft in all generations is to build the sturdiest bulwarks … against the old chaos of war and geopolitics, even if they last only for a season.”

Mitchell believes that while a peace settlement based on Ukrainian neutrality would carry risks, it is likely the best outcome of the current war. “The key to making neutrality work for Ukraine,” he writes, “is shaping it in a way that ensures that renunciation of NATO membership does not come at the expense of the country’s self-defense or its prospects for an economic and political future in the West.”

Looking to history, Mitchell notes that after the Napoleonic Wars, Switzerland and Belgium accepted neutral status, and after World War II, Finland and Austria were also neutral. Ukraine, he writes, could forge a “fortified neutrality” by maintaining a “strong military in a perpetual state of readiness.” Ukraine’s army — which has demonstrated an ability to inflict harm on the Russian invaders and slowed their advance — would need to be large, well-trained, and supplied with Western weapons. He suggests — though this may be a stumbling block to a peace settlement — that Ukraine could eventually join the European Union (EU). Mitchell rightly notes that the EU “is not an international security alliance” like NATO.

Mitchell’s proposed peace terms include accepting Russia’s control of Crimea and granting autonomy to Luhansk and Donetsk. He suggests that the U.S. and EU lift economic sanctions on Russia if Russia withdraws its military forces from all territories it has occupied during the war. He also proposes that Western powers provide “long-term reconstruction aid” so that the country can quickly recover from the devastation caused by Russia’s invasion.

Fortified neutrality, Mitchell argues, is a better option for Ukraine than absorption into the Russian empire, and it will only work if the West provides Ukraine with “weapons, money, and diplomatic support.”

Why would Putin accept such an arrangement? Because, as Mitchell points out, Russia has suffered unexpected setbacks in the war and has thus far proved “incapable of securing its objectives on the battlefield.” Mitchell’s proposal is also quite similar to what Russian spokesmen have said they would accept. And he believes such an arrangement can be successfully negotiated if a person trusted by both sides — he mentions Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett — assumes the task of mediator.

Mitchell makes clear, however, that Putin’s willingness to negotiate a settlement that maintains Ukraine’s independence will only last as long as he fails to achieve his military objectives at an acceptable cost. And that means that the Western powers should continue their economic sanctions against Russia and continue to provide weapons and supplies to Ukraine — just as the Soviet Union and China aided North Korea and North Vietnam against U.S. military forces, and just as the United States and some of its allies aided the Afghan rebels against the Soviet army.

What Mitchell is proposing is what Richard Nixon called “real peace.” Nixon, in his book by that name, described real peace as “a continuing process for managing and containing conflict between competing nations, competing systems, and competing international ambitions.” “Peace,” Nixon explained, “is not an end to conflict but rather a means of living with conflict, and once established it requires constant attention or it will not survive.” “Perfect peace,” Nixon continued, “… has no practical meaning in a world in which conflict among men is persistent and pervasive. If real peace is to exist, it must exist along with men’s ambitions, their pride, and their hatreds. A peace that fails to take these things into account will not last.” It is that kind of peace that is achievable in this current war.",https://spectator.org/germany-considers-new-missile-defense-system-as-war-continues-in-ukraine/,2022-03-20
Ukraine War Hawks’ Policy Proposals Don’t Match Their Rhetoric - The American Spectator,"“The war in Ukraine is … about right and wrong, freedom and justice, humanity and barbarism, and above all whose leadership will define the economic and political structure of the 21st century: democratic America and her allies in Europe and East Asia, or autocratic Russia and her Chinese patron,” writes Matthew Continetti in National Review. Writing in the Daily Independent, Boston College history professor Heather Cox Richardson opined that the outcome of the war in Ukraine will determine whether “an international rules-based order that has protected much of the world since World War II” will survive. The Eurasia Center’s Melinda Haring declared that “Zelenskyy and Biden are the undisputed leaders of the free world.” Former U.S. Ambassador to Poland Daniel Fried writes that Ukraine is “fighting for their freedom and ours.” Last month, former President George W. Bush told CNN that “Ukraine is the frontline in the struggle for freedom and democracy.” And David Frum writes in the Atlantic that Zelensky in his speech to Congress “recall[ed] Americans to themselves,” is helping to reverse 20 years of “democratic recession,” and is fighting for “all the rest of us — all the intended victims of Putin’s aggression.”

The rhetoric is soaring. The stakes are said to be great. The outcome of the Ukraine war is said to determine the struggle between freedom and autocracy. Ukraine, they say, is fighting not just for its own freedom but for ours, too. With so much at stake, what should America do?

And here is where the policies proposed fall short of the rhetoric. Not one of the war hawks noted above suggests that U.S. troops should fight on Ukraine’s side in this war that will supposedly determine whether the rules-based order that protects us survives. Not one of the war hawks suggests that NATO armed forces should join the war on Ukraine’s side, even though our freedom is on the line. In this war between “right and wrong, freedom and justice, humanity and barbarism,” Continetti proposes sending Ukraine more weaponry. To ensure the survival of the “rules-based international order” that protects our freedom, Heather Cox Richardson proposes more aid to Ukraine. Melinda Haring proposes more U.S. assistance to one of the “leaders of the free world.” Daniel Fried proposes to defend our freedom by sending more military aid to Ukraine. Bush 43, the architect of the endless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, does not propose sending U.S. troops to what he calls “the frontline of freedom and democracy,” just more aid. And Frum, one of the great cheerleaders for the disastrous Afghan and Iraqi wars, is not proposing to send American forces to the conflict, instead claiming that Trump supporters hate Zelensky and oppose more aid to Ukraine because Zelensky defied Trump.

Meanwhile, and more concerning, is the rhetoric used by the Biden administration to gain support for more aid to Ukraine. Biden and staffers have depicted the war as democracy versus autocracy and have pledged to support Ukraine until it achieves victory, even though privately doubting Ukraine’s ability to achieve outright victory. In effect, the Biden administration may be urging Ukraine to fight on in a war that it believes it cannot win.

Proposing more aid to Ukraine is reasonable, but irresponsible rhetoric, as we have learned, can have dangerous consequences. Bush 43 justified the endless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as part of his reckless policy to spread democracy in that region and throughout the world. Thousands of U.S. soldiers died and tens of thousands were wounded in that futile effort. Meanwhile David Frum and other neoconservatives portrayed the Global War on Terror as World War IV.

The many comparisons of Zelensky to Winston Churchill and Putin to Hitler are designed to revive the “lessons of Munich” and the “domino theory,” where Putin’s success in Ukraine would presumably mean the Baltic States, Moldova, and perhaps Poland would be next, and then Russian tanks would surge to the English Channel. Some might recall that it was the “lessons of Munich” and the “domino theory” that led to the disaster in Vietnam, which the “best and the brightest” war hawks (McNamara, Bundy, Rostow, Rusk, and others) assured us was a struggle between freedom and tyranny that required Americans to sacrifice. McNamara later admitted that the “best and the brightest” recognized early on that the war was unwinnable. Fifty-eight thousand dead American soldiers didn’t stop some of the “dominoes” from falling, but America survived and eventually won the Cold War without firing a shot under a president (Reagan) who used American power prudently and effectively to secure and advance the nation’s interests.

We are sometimes lectured that it is important for the United States to be on “the right side of history.” But there is no right side of history; there is just history. Someday the “history” of the Ukraine war may mark its origins in a decision by the United States and its allies in Europe to expand NATO eastward, thereby, in George Kennan’s prophetic words, “inflam[ing] the nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion.” “Expanding NATO,” Kennan said, “would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-Cold War era.” Nothing justifies Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but ignoring uncomfortable aspects of its origins will not make it any easier to resolve this terrible war.",https://spectator.org/gop-house-majority-put-brakes-on-ukraine-escalation/,2022-12-28
"Ukraine, Zelensky, Putin, and Armageddon: On the Limits of Sympathy - The American Spectator","The Putin-Ukraine thing is a mess. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky certainly seems a well-meaning guy, but Putin realistically is not a madman nor a Hitler.

Putin is complex. He is a murderer, for sure. His opponents get stabbed in West Europe with umbrellas that discharge fatal toxins. His enemies fall out of windows even when the windows are closed. But he still is no Hitler. Problems cannot be solved if not addressed fairly.

Western Europe and American mainstream media declare him “Hitler” and “insane,” but that does not make him so. Putin, having not received NATO membership, logically does not want NATO in his backyard, with European and American anti-aircraft weapons, backed potentially by whole NATO forces, stationed in Ukraine on his western border to shoot down his aircraft.

One also contemplates our Civil War. Slavery is despicable — obviously. Even so, if another country in the world employs slavery, should America go to war against them? If so, when will we be invading Saudi Arabia, other Arab Muslim countries, parts of Africa that still engage slavery, and such? The people of Dixie did not threaten the northern states, just wanted to break off and have their own states’ rights and slavery. Yet we went to war to stop them from seceding and to end slavery.

Putin saw his glorious Russian Empire collapse. Nothing about Mother Russia or its empire excites me. I spent much of my college years protesting against their persecution of Jews and demanding they let my people go. They gave the world the Gulag. And Stalin. And Lenin. And Trotsky. And Lavrenti Beria. And Genrikh Yagoda. And Khrushchev. And the Tsars. So I don’t miss that empire.

However, one fairly can grasp where Putin is coming from. He cannot fairly be called a “madman,” per se. Idi Amin was nuts. Muammar Khaddaffi was daffy. But Putin wants history to record that he was not the wuss on whose watch Russia crumbled. He wants a legacy like those of Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, and Others the Great who restored what Russia was. No one can hope to negotiate a mediated peace without understanding the other guy. Understanding him does not make him right but makes him comprehensible. That was Trump’s greatness with Putin: once you understand the guy, you know better how to handle him: “Okay, Putey-Wutey, I get it. But I can’t have you destroying buildings and invading countries without provocation. I can work with you a bit. We can reach an understanding. But I can’t have you conquering countries.”

Amid all this, we see the Holocaust’s lesson confirmed: Public sympathy, tears, public opinion gets you almost nowhere — unless you simply like to be pitied before being murdered. It is a lesson well conveyed in Henrik Ibsen’s 1882 theatrical masterpiece, Enemy of the People. You can have the “whole world” instagramming you and instacarting you and instawhatevering you — and end up dead if you are not armed to the teeth and ready to fight for your own for survival. That is the sad lesson Israel understands better than all others. Countries who watched six million Jews get rounded up, locked into ghettoes, cattle-carted to death camps, shot, butchered, gassed, cremated — all those countries now send representatives annually to lay wreaths for the six million and shed tears on signal. Even Germany lays an annual wreath. A very nice one.

Having had so many of their citizens assisting Hitler’s Einsatzgruppen in the 1940s, Ukraine would have gained for today by taking notice of Israel’s posture since its 1948 founding. Israel was born from an awareness that nothing better delays Armageddon than by preparing for it. Therefore, Israel’s Defense Forces are among the world’s best trained and armed. Their defense industries manufacture incredible weaponry. Thanks to both Russian and Ukrainian anti-Semitism — even after World War II — more than one million Jews have emigrated from the former USSR with acquired high-tech knowledge and skills to help Israel emerge as the “Start-Up Nation” and a national laboratory for innovation, both in civilian goods that make life more enjoyable and in military materiel that protects such life.

For example, Israel buys American weapons and then improves them, sharing their upgrades and technological advances with the U.S. Every so often, they capture Soviet (or post-1991) Russian arms in battle, and they reverse-engineer them, thereafter sharing that high-value knowledge with America’s Defense Department and industries. In the face of threatened annihilation, they destroyed Saddam Hussein’s Osirak nuclear reactor and killed his nuclear program. That act unexpectedly played a critical role years later in saving countless American forces during “Desert Storm” when we forced Saddam out of Kuwait. Israel has created defensive weapons like the Iron Dome that protect against unguided murderous rockets, and they now are finalizing development of “David’s Sling” and “Arrow 3,” both of which will protect against more advanced and precise aerial threats.

Ukraine had nuclear weapons when they emerged independent upon the fall of communism. Russian armaments happened to be stored on Ukrainian soil during the Warsaw Pact years. Ukraine gave up those weapons in return for “iron-clad guarantees” that others would converge to protect them if Russia ever struck. Iron-clad guarantees.

Well, there are no iron-clad guarantees in this arena. Governments change. A Nixon leaves, and a Carter arrives. A Reagan and Bush leave, and an Obama and Kerry arrive. A Trump-Pence leave, and a Biden-Kamala arrive. Weak American and European heads of government will not honor prior iron-clad guarantees when their populations, who lack any historical perspective or any book knowledge of deals and promises made, refuse to go to war. Nor does the neo-con approach work for America. It is folly to undertake “regime change” elsewhere. When George W. Bush spoke ridiculously of a supposed passion for peace and democracy that beats in every Arab Muslim’s heart, it was clear then and there that America was about to get into a whole heap of troubles in a Mideastern theater where even Iraqis and Iranians do not survive long. A beautiful Iran-Iraq War was in place, and they would have remained locked in internecine combat forever if just left alone. Bush did not know.

Public sympathy and wreaths from onlookers are a poor substitute for heavy weapons and trained armed forces ready to sacrifice all. The world sat by in the 1940s as Jews were mass-murdered. Franklin Roosevelt had authority from Congress to allow specific numbers of refugees from Hitler into our borders each year — immigration quotas. Yet the quotas never once were filled, not in any year of FDR’s reign. He even kept out Otto Frank and family, including their daughter, Anne. When the S.S. St. Louis set sail in 1939 for Havana from Hamburg, Germany, the international tragedy that ensued was extraordinary. Cuba would not honor entry visas it had authorized those 937 Jews, so Hitler’s thousand Jewish refugees suddenly had nowhere to debark safely. Though they were anchored only 90 miles from Florida, FDR sent the Coast Guard to turn them away from American waters. In the end, that “voyage of the damned” had to go back to Europe, and two-thirds of them died during the Shoah.

In similar terms, Britain then ruled over and occupied the land that later became Israel, and they would not allow ships of Jewish refugees from Hitler to enter Haifa harbor. The world knew and saw, sympathized and shed tears. In the end, it took a Jewish Underground — the Irgun, the Lechi, and the Haganah — to drive out the British. Twelve Irgun and Lechi fighters were captured and hanged by the Brits. They all knew the risks, but they also knew the limits of public sympathy and wreaths.

If President Joe Biden and the Europeans resurrect the dead Obama Iran deal from which former President Donald Trump wisely withdrew, Israel will not wait for sympathy and wreaths. Neither would we if, for example, Russia stationed deadly offensive weapons pointing at us from Havana. Israel knows what they must do and how they must act, if even alone. Ukraine’s situation — as beneficiary of public opinion and sympathy but mightily overpowered — points the way. The UN may declare a Wreath Boycott of Israel, but Israel will obliterate Iran if they have to. The Holy City of Qom will be nothing but holes. And the people of New York and Los Angeles had better realize that, when anti-American madmen like the Ayatollahs and Kim Jong-un decide to deliver their nuclear payloads, they just may target America’s biggest cities on the coasts before they risk attacking Israel. Because a country led by a Biden-Blinken-Kamala trio makes a tempting target of weak people who do not have the will or know how to fight, but Israel will go “Full Samson” and take the house down if ever so attacked.

Public sympathy and opinion does not cut it. Wreaths wither quickly. Now Ukraine learns, hopefully not too late.

We Must Help Ukraine in Every Possible Way - The American Spectator,"Wednesday

What the heck is going on? In the incredibly brave Ukrainian people we have a nation which will fight to the last man, to the last bullet, for its freedom. We have seen so many people we have helped who turn tail and run at the first sign of Bolshevik assault. Now, we have the brave Ukrainian men and women fighting the onslaught of the Red Army with a courage that the world rarely sees.

(And let’s not kid ourselves. Russia under Comrade Putin is as evil as Russia under Lenin. It saves a lot of fraud on our own brains to call them what they are: dictatorial Communists, only this time they use different names.)

So here we have the Ukrainians fighting with a courage not seen in Europe for a good 77 years. We in the USA have a vast armory of weapons we don’t use or use rarely. The Ukrainians are begging us for help in the form of materiel. We can give it to them and never miss it. And even if we did miss it, we can replace it very quickly.

It costs pennies. We have so far supposedly given the Ukraine about $2 billion worth of equipment and money. A man I spoke to last night said that would bankrupt America. That man could not be more wrong. The GDP of the United States is roughly $23 trillion. Two billion dollars is not even a rounding error. We waste that much on totally fake programs for “diversity” and “equal rights” every few months. To think that for $2 billion we can give Vladimir Putin a bloody nose is almost miraculous news. The Ukrainians deserve our help in every possible way. Money for Ukrainian freedom fighters is not waste. It is moral salvation for our fat, bloated America.

We see the Russians every day killing school children, raping random women then killing them, and bombing hospitals. There is literally no limit to their cruelty. We can help. We must help. And who cares if there is some waste? There is always waste in war.

We have for the first time since 1945 the chance to fight for freedom in Europe. President Biden did a great act by calling Putin a war criminal. Now, let’s follow up by sending meaningful quantities of weapons. Right now. No excuses. Let’s just do it.

Meanwhile, where are the “brave” women in Congress, keeping silent as innocent Ukrainian women are raped and murdered? How can “the squad” be so thoroughly evil? It’s Hitler’s birthday and I can guess that AOC is singing “Happy Birthday.”",https://spectator.org/how-future-historians-will-view-ukraine/,2022-04-21
Western Sanctimony Drives Global South Away From Supporting Ukraine - The American Spectator,"Surprised that governments across the so-called Global South aren’t interested in allied posturing over the Russo-Ukraine war? Imperious Western officials assumed they were leading the world against Moscow’s aggression, only to turn around and find no one behind them.

Reported the New York Times: “Instead of cleaving in two, the world has fragmented. A vast middle sees Moscow’s invasion as, primarily, a European and American problem. Rather than view it as an existential threat, these countries are largely focused on protecting their own interests amid the economic and geopolitical upheaval caused by the invasion.”

A new survey of global opinion suggests that the allies have lost much of the world to apathy and worse. Self-righteous and wokish Westerners just don’t have as much appeal to the rest of the world as they thought. Hostile opinions of Washington and Brussels are significantly undermining their objectives, including toward Russia.

The differences in opinion are significant. For instance, observed Ivan Krastev, of the Centre for Liberal Studies in Sofia, Bulgaria: “[W]hile a plurality of Americans and Europeans want Ukraine to win even if it means a longer war and economic hardship for themselves, most Chinese, Indians and Turks who expressed a view said they would prefer the war to stop as soon as possible — even if that means Ukraine giving up part of its territory.”

Even more noteworthy, many in the Global South lean Moscow’s way. Far from treating the Putin government as an enemy, Krastev reports, “Russia is seen either as an ‘ally’ or a ‘partner’ by 79 per cent of people in China (unsurprisingly). But the same is true for 80 per cent of Indians and 69 per cent of Turks.” Notably, Turkey is a member of NATO, and India is the hoped for great counterweight to China.

Actually, it’s hard to blame leaders and peoples in what used to be called the Third World for their skepticism. The U.S. and Europe treat every issue touching the West as vital to the entire planet, even universe, of immediate concern warranting conscription of other nations into the allied cause. As for interest in problems, even crises, elsewhere, not so much. Moreover, Western governments have turned hypocrisy into an art form: complaining of international injustices against them but regularly engaging in similar practices against others. For governments outside Europe and North America, allied violations of manifold promises not to expand NATO and use of Ukraine to fight an intensifying proxy war against Russia look other than disinterested support for a helpless victim. And then there is allied, especially U.S., war-making.

The Global South’s grievances are many. Remember how America and Europe rallied to the cause of the Democratic Republic of Congo, when it become the epicenter of a multi-sided conflict that killed an estimated 5.4 million people? Probably not. Neither does anyone in the developing world.

In fact, there was scant Western attention to a horrific conflict in which as many people died as during the Vietnam and Korean wars combined. Fervent American and European demands for action, as previously in the Balkans, were absent in the DRC’s case.

And then there are the Vietnam and Korean wars in which other people also died prodigiously. In the latter case at least something positive was attained, with South Koreans avoiding Kim Il-sung’s tyranny and eventually creating democracy out of the ruthless, sometimes murderous regime backed by the U.S. In Vietnam in the name of peace Washington visited years of horrific war upon the Vietnamese people, only to eventually depart leaving the entire country under communism. Whatever the merits of American policy — surely it would have been better never to have taken over France’s colonial position in Vietnam — one can understand why U.S. policy gained few friends elsewhere in the world.

A more recent, but equally horrid conflict, which did not much interest today’s American and European moral exemplars, was the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Perhaps a million people died, with Iran suffering the most. And blame was clear: Tehran was attacked by Saddam Hussein’s government in search of territorial booty. Rather like Russia, Baghdad gained ground initially, but soon was pushed back by Iranian counterattacks. Instead of helping the victims, Washington aided Iraq. That support, for Hussein’s aggressive war, is one reason that he later assumed the U.S. would not interfere with his invasion of Kuwait.

The Reagan administration had its reasons for supporting the cruel dictator against whom America later fought two wars — fear of Tehran’s new Islamist regime. Yet Washington’s willingness to help kill untold Iranians because it did not like their government, though a traditional and even understandable foreign policy objective, contrasts sharply with the moralisms now flooding forth from Washington and Brussels. Such unfettered hypocrisy is one reason most Africans, Asians, and South Americans see little reason to join the campaign against Russia. The West is against aggression, sometimes, and for it when seen as benefiting them.

Indeed, the last two decades have demonstrated that the U.S. and its allies are ever ready to bomb, invade, and occupy other nations to advance perceived Western interests. At least a million people have died in the conflicts broadly constituting the global war on terrorism, and that number almost certainly is low. Not all these deaths should be blamed on Washington, of course, but many, far too many, resulted from wars that were dishonest, stupid, and bungled — Iraq and Libya, certainly, as well as the years of nation-building in Afghanistan. There also is Yemen, in which the U.S. has empowered Saudi Arabia’s murderous crown prince to slaughter his neighbors for his own convenience.

Yet promiscuous U.S. and allied war-making with bombs and bullets is not all. Over the last three decades Washington has increasingly turned to economic war, attacking friends and foes alike. And American officials, especially, have shown little interest in the impact on the helpless and disadvantaged throughout the Global South.

For instance, in 2020 Congress came up with the curious theory that punishing the Syrian people by preventing them from rebuilding after a decade of civil war would force Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power. It was a mind-blowingly stupid policy but was avidly embraced by U.S. policymakers such as James Jeffrey, the “Never Trumper” who was unaccountably appointed to handle Syria policy and who violated his responsibility to the American people by misleading President Donald Trump about the number of U.S. troops in Syria to thwart the president’s desire to withdraw them. Jeffrey said his objective was to turn the country into a “quagmire” for Russia, ignoring the interests of the Syrian people. The “Caesar sanctions” have turned millions of distressed people into an impoverished means to Jeffrey’s end — a policy which, alas, has failed entirely.

Yet his callousness paled compared to that of then-UN ambassador (and later secretary of state) Madeleine Albright, long one of Washington’s most celebrated doyennes. Rarely was so much hubris and hypocrisy concentrated in one person. She said much to offend Americans as well as foreigners, but perhaps her most noted gaffe, meaning speaking an embarrassing truth, was her response to the question regarding the justification for sanctions on Iraq that allegedly had killed a half million children. Said Albright: “We think the price is worth it.” Although she later recognized the stupidity of that response, she regretted her carelessness, not cruelty, having insisted that she and others in the America’s foreign policy establishment saw further than the mere mortals living in the Global South.

Indeed, grievances against the West run deep when the U.S. and Europe attempt to pull moral rank. Colonialism, a grotesque afront to human dignity and life, was an ugly practice even by the British, and was much worse under others, especially Germany, Portugal, and Belgium.

There also are more pragmatic reasons that the Global South has not joined with Washington and Brussels. Oppressive governments, quite common throughout the developing world, are unlikely recruits for conflict being sold as authoritarianism against democracy. Even nominal democracies, such as India and Pakistan, object to allied hectoring.

Moreover, officials the world over see no reason to worry about a conflict that, for them, is beyond distant. The war simply poses no danger. Indeed, contended Krastev, other countries no longer see Moscow as threatening: “For countries such as India and Turkey, Russia has become like them, so they do not need to fear it.”

Finally, poor nations are loath to miss an opportunity to pick up energy supplies and perhaps other goods on the cheap. Moral grandstanding is cheap for rich countries which applaud themselves for their contributions to Ukraine. Even though the U.S. is functionally bankrupt, with the Congressional Budget Office recently reporting that over the last year alone estimates of this year’s deficit jumped by $426 billion, it still can borrow. Most nations are not so insulated from the world’s economic oscillations. China remains poor, with four times America’s population, despite possessing the world’s second largest economy. India and scores of Third World states are much worse off.

Although the Global South’s abstention from the allied cause has caused much wailing and gnashing of teeth in Washington and Brussels, there is nothing much they can do. Moral suasion obviously is kaput. Diplomatic pressure includes no meaningful stick. Threats of sanctions inflame resentment. Bribery might help, but there is no guarantee that “friends” so procured would stay bought. And Washington already is finding it difficult to win many of the same countries to its anti-China campaign.

Consider India, long seen by the U.S. as a potential ally against Beijing. New Delhi hosted the G-20 this year, but, according to Reuters: “India does not want the G20 to discuss additional sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine during New Delhi’s one-year presidency of the bloc, six senior Indian officials said on Wednesday, amid debate over how even to describe the conflict.” It turns out that the Modi government doesn’t even want to use the word “war,” preferring “crisis” or “challenge”!

India’s relationship with Moscow runs back to the Cold War, when the U.S. backed Pakistan. Russia long has been New Delhi’s chief armorer. And India hopes a friendly Moscow might help restrain China in a future confrontation. In contrast, concern for Ukraine and interest in the West’s support for Kyiv barely register with the Modi government.

If the U.S. and Europe can ruthlessly pursue their interests, with limited concern for the impact on others, they should not be surprised when the rest of the world acts likewise. Rather than bewail the failure of the Global South to follow allied dictates, Western nations need make a stronger case for more limited action — and address their own failings. President George H.W. Bush’s “What we say goes” era really never was, and certainly is now over. The U.S. must do better promoting its interests in the future.

What If Ukraine Wins Big? - The American Spectator,"Conventional wisdom has it that the Russo-Ukrainian War will devolve into a stalemate in the east and south, but conventional wisdom has proven wrong in so many cases that we should not be surprised if the unexpected happens again. Although it is considered unlikely, American planners should consider what might happen if the Russian army or significant parts of it collapse, and soldiers begin streaming toward the Russian border. On the surface, this might appear to be a great thing for Ukraine and the West, but it might be disastrous depending on how the Ukrainian government and its military handle such a situation.

The sudden and catastrophic collapse of armies that were initially thought to be formidable has happened twice in the last century. It is interesting to note that, in both cases, the beneficiary of that collapse was not prepared for what happened and did not handle the situation well. The French collapse in 1940 at the hands of the German Wehrmacht surprised the Germans as much as the rest of the world. It happened so precipitously that Hitler and his General Staff suspected a trap, and stopped the advance of the Blitzkrieg short of the French coast, allowing the British evacuation of Dunkirk. Many historians believe that the war on the Western Front would have ended had the British army been trapped and destroyed, allowing World War II in that part of the world to become a Russo-German regional conflict. The actual result was eventually disastrous for Germany.

More recently, the combined Arab armies that threatened Israel in 1967 appeared to be an overwhelming threat to the existence of the Jewish state. In the ensuing rout, the Israelis exceeded their own modest hopes of mere survival. As the Egyptian army collapsed, Israeli forces overran all of the Sinai Peninsula to the Suez Canal and occupied the Gaza Strip. The unexpected entry of Jordan and the subsequent crushing of Arab armies on the eastern front garnered Israel the West Bank and the Golan Heights. Although these victories gave Israel an effective security buffer, it was not prepared to govern the teaming Arab populations of the West Bank and Gaza; that problem has been the root of much of the trouble in the Middle East to this day.

Both situations are eerily similar to that of the Ukrainian conflict today. The pre-war French army was considered the best equipped in the world. The combined armies of the Arabs far outnumbered the Israelis and were supplied with the best equipment that the former Soviet Union could provide while the Israelis made do with the Western surplus. However, the French and Arab forces were rotten to the core. Their troops were ill-prepared for the kind of war they would fight, and their leadership ranged from poor to abysmal while they faced highly motivated and well-led opponents. The only difference is that both the Germans and Israelis struck first and gained immediate air superiority while the Russians initiated the present conflict albeit without gaining control of the air.

Signs of a possible Russian collapse should be disturbing to Moscow. Troops abandon their armored vehicles at the first hint of Iranian drones or Javelin missiles. In some cases, soldiers are sabotaging their own vehicles to avoid going into danger areas. Unlike World War II, there is no NKVD political police waiting behind the lines to shoot or hang stragglers and deserters. Intercepted cell traffic reveals low morale and a distrust of leadership. Many of the documented war crimes indicate a lack of discipline rather than official Russian guidance. In addition, draft-age young men are fleeing Russia in droves in an attempt to avoid conscription. This situation will be exacerbated as Western weapons continue to pour in and the Russian firepower advantage decreases.

There are three potential scenarios for a possible Russian collapse, and two of them are bad from an American point of view. The best scenario is one where Russian forces retreat into the motherland and the Ukrainian government declares victory while warning Moscow to stay away.

The second scenario is more dangerous. It would involve a Russian collapse on one or more fronts but not all. In this case, the Ukrainian government might make a conscious decision to occupy Russian territory as a bargaining chip to trade for occupied Ukrainian land. The danger here is that Putin might use the situation as ammunition for his argument that Ukraine truly is an existential threat to Mother Russia, giving him an excuse to call up reserves and potentially use nuclear weapons. In addition, having Ukrainian troops on Russian soil would detract from its victim status among Western nations and the American public.

A third and more problematic case would be one where Ukrainian forces pursue their opponents into Russia without the permission of the government in Kyiv. This would signal a breakdown of civilian control of its military, rendering Ukrainian democracy suspect; it would entail all the dangers implicit in the second case and could potentially make Ukraine responsible for any reprisals that occur on Russian soil. Some of the forces involved might include the pop-up militias which were welcomed by Kyiv during the crisis but which may become hard to control. Ukraine’s possession of the moral high ground would be severely damaged, and the conflict might spin hopelessly out of control.

As improbable as these situations appear now, much stranger things have happened in war. The U.S. government would be well advised to have diplomatic and military responses for such eventualities. Whatever happens, we will be involved whether we like it or not.

Winter Amid Ukraine Drone War - The American Spectator,"It seems as though the only people who aren’t bored with the war in Ukraine are the Russians and the Ukrainians. Too many Americans don’t understand that wars aren’t entertainment.

The European Union is trying to convince itself that it can put a price cap on Russian oil by prohibiting insurers from writing insurance for oil cargoes that exceed the price. Russia, and its oil buyers such as China, have ships that can sail without Lloyds of London’s coverage.

All that means is that if the EU doesn’t buy Russia’s oil (and gas, which is nearly cut off thanks to the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines) the EU will have a very cold winter because it has, for decades, been dumb enough to become dependent on Russian oil and gas supplies.

Here in the States, we have a number of idiots, such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who pretend to be conservatives and who insist that we shouldn’t send any more aid to Ukraine. Isolationists, as I have explained before, aren’t conservatives. This particular bunch doesn’t understand that Ukraine is fighting a war that is consuming Russia’s military forces and proportionately diminishing Russia’s threat to the West. Continued support for Ukraine is in our national security interest. Cutting off that support is in Russia’s interest.

Back in the real world, Ukraine is still fighting for its freedom at an enormous cost. But Russia is paying a high price, too. According to a recent report by the Kyiv Independent, Ukraine claims that more than 90,000 Russian soldiers have been killed there. The cost to Ukraine, in civilian and military lives, must be higher.

There hasn’t been a real prospect for peace in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has indicated as recently as Friday that he would consider some arrangement that recognizes — i.e., surrenders — the lands in Ukraine’s east that Russia falsely annexed over the past 10 months.

President Joe Biden has said he’d negotiate peace but only if the Russian forces withdrew first. Biden’s supposed forcefulness is, as usual, undercut by his cabinet. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has admitted to negotiations with Russia out of fear it might use nuclear weapons.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky demands that Russia withdraw entirely from Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia seized and then annexed in 2014. He has to say that because anything else would amount to surrender.

And now winter is here. In Kyiv and Mariupol — two cities almost at opposite ends of Ukraine — the average high in January will be 30 degrees Fahrenheit and the average low will be 20 degrees Fahrenheit. It’s going to be a long, cold winter in which the war will probably slow and adapt to the weather.

Part of that adaptation will probably be the increased use of drone aircraft (UAVs), unmanned surface vessels (USVs), and submarine drones (UUVs).

The Russians are reportedly bombing, shelling, and attacking every bit of Ukraine’s electrical grid that they can locate with UAVs. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has been crippled, as have been many other generation plants and transmission stations. Putin means to kill Ukrainian civilians by freezing them.

The Russians are reportedly running out of the Iranian “suicide drones” that they have been using to knock out power plants. They may also be running short on artillery shells and aerial bombs.

According to a Nov. 22 U.K. intelligence release, Russia has launched hundreds of armed UAVs — including Iranian “suicide drones” — since September and most of the UAVs have been neutralized. No “suicide drone” attacks have, according to that report, occurred since Nov. 17, indicating that Russian supplies of cruise missiles and suicide drones have run out. The report also said that Russia can procure more from overseas sources — presumably Iran and North Korea — faster than they can produce more themselves.

U.S. arms stockpiles are also running low. The Pentagon is finding contractors willing to produce more systems and ammunition for them, but resuming production will take time and a lot of money. Other NATO nations, which have been far slower in providing arms to Ukraine — other than the U.K. — seem unable or unwilling to spend much to help Ukraine.

Since Ukrainian missiles sank the Moskva, the flagship of the Russian Black Sea fleet, in April, that fleet has effectively been neutralized in fear of attacks on its ships. (READ MORE from Jed Babbin: Sinking the Moskva)

The Russians seem unable to deal with Ukraine’s USVs and UUVs, which are being used to attack Russian ships and shore facilities. Reports indicate that nine Ukrainian UAVs and seven USVs — and possibly British-built UUVs — struck the Sevastopol naval base on Oct. 29, causing an unknown amount of damage to Russian ships, including at least one frigate. The Russians claim to have destroyed four USVs.

A previous USV attack on Oct. 18 was on the Russian naval base and oil terminal at Novorossiysk. It apparently caused little damage. The Novorossiysk base on the Black Sea was previously thought to be out of the range of Ukrainian weapons. The Russians are trying to build an effective defense against the Ukrainian drones. Their technology, according to one expert I spoke to, isn’t close to being able to deal with USVs, UUVs, and UAVs, especially at the same time.

The boldness of these Ukrainian attacks on Russia’s surface fleet and naval bases is another huge setback for Russia, adding to the effects of Ukrainian army forces driving Russians out of Kherson and other areas the Russians claim to have annexed. What the Russians are hoping for is to take advantage of the West’s tiredness and lack of resolve to force a “land for peace” deal with Ukraine.

As this column has repeatedly said, any land for peace deal would only delay — not deter or end — Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. There won’t be peace in Ukraine unless one side is convinced it is going to lose the war. It is up to us to support Ukraine while it fights for freedom and whittles away at Russia’s military power.",https://spectator.org/keep-fighting-ukraine-you-will-prevail/,2022-12-06
A Deadly Waiting Game in Ukraine - The American Spectator,"The invasion of Ukraine, as with many other wars in modern Russian history, has followed a familiar pattern. First, the much-lauded Russian Armed Forces stumbles into a damaging and humiliating debacle characterized by operational inflexibility and failures of coordination. Then, the Russians reconstitute themselves: Assets are reinforced, plans are redrawn from scratch, and commanders who have proven themselves to be useless are fired. Occasionally, entirely different approaches to warfare are invented or resuscitated. All of this leads to round two, which Russia frequently wins.

This theme played out most famously on the Eastern Front in the Second World War, as well as in the Winter War against Finland a few years prior. More recently, the First Chechen War ended in disaster for Moscow in 1996 but was followed by a decisive Russian victory in the Second Chechen War three years later. Sometimes the learning experience takes a while: The tsar’s troops were so badly beaten in the 1905 Russo–Japanese War that it set off a revolution at home, but their sons returned four decades later and swept the Japanese out of Manchuria.

Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has now undergone such a necessary recalibration. When the Russian army began its attack along four separate axes in February, the plan was clearly to rout the Ukrainian military with as few shots fired as possible. When it quickly became evident that no rout was forthcoming, the attack derailed into a mess of abandoned vehicles and traffic jams.

After an awkward lull in the fighting, the Russians withdrew and changed both their axis of advance and their tactics. In an approach reminiscent of the Western Front in the First World War, Russian attacks in the Donbas now open with massive artillery barrages designed to maul fortifications, followed by quick but cautious infantry assaults aimed at small and defensible gains rather than vast breakthroughs or encirclements. The result has been a brutal, grinding second phase to the war, with Russia making slow and steady gains.

Moscow has further recalibrated on a different level of the conflict. Just as Russian military planners counted on a rapid collapse of the Ukrainian army’s organized resistance, so too did Russia’s leaders gamble that NATO and the EU would offer only a tepid and disjointed response. Ukraine’s swift defeat could then be presented to the rest of Europe as a fait accompli, and any subsequent reprisals would be light.

With this plan long since invalidated, Russia has changed tack. Its strategy is no longer to awe Europe and the U.S., but to outlast them. The invading Russian troops may not be as motivated or as numerous as the defending Ukrainians, but what they do have is “10 to 15 times more” artillery than Ukraine, according to a top Kyiv official last month. Other officials have claimed that Russia fires 60,000 shells per day, an order of magnitude more than Ukraine.

The artillery gap could continue to widen. Russia enjoys a large domestic arms production industry and favorable supply lines to the front. Ukraine had little in the way of an arms industry to begin with, and now it has neither enough functioning factories nor enough workers to staff them. To make matters worse, its supply lines and depots are exposed to constant Russian shelling.

Ukraine’s deficits in production capability should, in theory, be filled in by its supporters in NATO. But deliveries thus far have failed to keep pace with expenditure. The latest U.S. military aid package to Ukraine, announced last week, features 1,000 “precision” 155-mm rounds. The previous package, announced mid-June, included 36,000 standard rounds. Altogether, the artillery ammunition that the U.S. has sent Ukraine in the span of a month could sustain Ukraine’s rate of fire for no more than a week, or Russia’s rate for less than a day.

What NATO Can Afford

Why isn’t more help coming, faster? This question gets to the heart of Russia’s new strategy. Moscow is betting that gas prices, recession, voter dissatisfaction, and the threat of China will all make NATO leaders think twice before giving away more equipment to its opponent.

Indeed, sending what the Ukrainians need would be a momentous task: Kyiv believes that it requires 1,000 155-mm howitzers, 500 tanks, 300 MLRS, 2,000 armored vehicles, and 1,000 drones to achieve “heavy weapons parity” with Russia. For reference, that is more howitzers than the U.S. has deployed in its own active armed forces. Delivering even a portion of this equipment, and providing the copious amounts of training necessary to use and maintain it, would be by far the most ambitious military aid project in history.

And then there would still be the question of supplying ammunition to these weapon systems. Despite America’s huge military budget, artillery is not as central to U.S. military doctrine as it is to Russian doctrine, and so the U.S. maintains quite a small ammo stockpile. For the whole of 2019, the U.S. Army allocated funds to purchase around 150,000 conventional 155-mm shells. The order was seen at the time as an “eye-popping” nine-fold increase over a previous plan to purchase only 16,000 shells — yet in the context of the Ukraine war, it would’ve lasted roughly three days at Russia’s rate of expenditure. A disturbing possibility is that the dwindling of U.S. ammunition aid to Ukraine may be best explained not by stinginess, but by a genuine depletion of American ammo reserves.

That is not to say that the U.S. has hollowed out its own armed forces to support Ukraine. Again, artillery plays a smaller role in American doctrine than in Russian doctrine, and NATO easily overmatches Russia in areas such as air and naval power. But fighters are not being supplied to Ukraine for fear of escalation; and even if they were to be sent, there would be no means to maintain them and no trained pilots to operate them.

If the war drags on — as it almost certainly will — NATO will not be able to sustain the kind of aid that Ukraine requires without some kind of partial mobilization of workers into wartime production. This would be a politically damaging move, at home but also abroad, where Russia and China are looking for any excuse to accuse the West of reckless escalation. It would also be an inadvisable allocation of production at a time when much of Europe is tipping into double-digit inflation. (READ MORE: China’s Share of Ukraine)

Ultimately, NATO’s willingness to sacrifice for Ukraine has found its limits. With Finland and Sweden on the verge of becoming members, rearmament happening among previously inert countries like Germany, and serious weakness in the Russian economy, the alliance does not expect imminent further westward expansion by Moscow. Losing Ukraine to Russia would be a humanitarian disaster and a blow to democratic prestige, but not an existential danger to Washington or Brussels. NATO can afford to lose the war, even if Ukraine cannot.

Kyiv or Bust

The calculus is a bit different on the other side of the war. It is something of an axiom among Russia watchers that President Vladimir Putin’s domestic popularity is shaped first and foremost by his cultivated strongman image. His highest-ever approval ratings were in 2008, when Russia crushed Georgia in a five-day war, and 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea.

But Putin’s image is also a proxy for the current Russian regime as a whole. During the turmoil of the 1990s, the Russian state and economy came under the de facto control of two factions: the oligarchs, who accumulated vast wealth by buying up former Soviet assets; and the siloviki, men with backgrounds in the army, law enforcement, or the intelligence agencies.

Putin’s greatest political accomplishment has been the taming of the once-invincible oligarchs through methods ranging from sidelining to assassination. The current Russian state could be described as a securocracy — rule by siloviki — with Putin, an alum of the Soviet KGB, as its face.

Hence, the current government derives its legitimacy from its ability to assert Russia’s sovereignty and to project the power of its state through the military and other means. Any outcome short of a major victory in Ukraine risks undermining the entire regime. With businesses shuttering, incomes falling, and restaurants running out of potatoes, Putin would have nothing else with which to justify his continued hold onto power.

A defeated Russia would tip perilously toward regime change. By Putin’s own reckoning, such a transformation would be inevitably followed by the undermining of national sovereignty and possibly even the dismemberment of Russia at the hands of NATO. Needless to say, Moscow will accept no outcome other than the subjugation of Ukraine, or at least a substantial portion of it.

China, for its part, believes in a Russian victory almost as much as Russia does. No doubt Beijing only wishes that it could have happened in days or weeks instead of months.

The duration and intensity of both the war and the sanctions on Russia have helped to spur a global economic downturn, in which China stands to suffer the most from out of any major power. It has been struggling to cool down an out-of-control real estate market, which, if forced to deleverage by a recession, could cause a worldwide economic crisis. In general, growth is slowing and cracks in the country’s traditional financial infrastructure are beginning to appear, as evidenced by recent bank runs at multiple small regional banks.

Some onlookers have used these facts to argue that the leadership of the Communist Party must be running out of patience with Putin and may soon pressure him to accede to an unfavorable negotiated peace. But it is more likely that China believes that a Russian loss would only make things much worse. Most of the sanctions currently in place would probably stay in place, and so the economic benefits would be marginal.

More importantly, while NATO has seemingly regained its sense of purpose thanks to Putin’s invasion, allowing Russia to lose would only further galvanize the Western alliance. Beijing is convinced that the U.S. wishes to cripple China and sees Russia as a vital impediment to Washington’s plans. A defeated Russia and a rejuvenated NATO would be President Xi Jinping’s worst nightmare.

Beijing has plenty of other concerns as well. The People’s Republic shares a gigantic border with its northern neighbor and has no desire to see nuclear-armed Russia undergo serious unrest or revolution. China must also contend with its dangerous reliance on foreign food and energy, usually imported by sea. A close relationship with Russia acts as insurance in case of open conflict with the West, offering access to safer overland imports.

The U.S. and most of Europe, by contrast, have far fewer reasons to stick with Ukraine to the bitter end. There is, of course, the shared belief in democracy and international rule of law. In better times, that would have been enough. But with a seemingly once-in-a-generation economic crisis in progress, more concrete cost and benefit calculations have taken precedence.

The Dilemma

Russia will more than likely win its war against Ukraine if events proceed on their current trajectory. As aforementioned, such an outcome would not be too materially damaging for the United States or Europe; indeed, Russia would be sure to emerge in much worse shape than any country in NATO (barring perhaps Germany).

Nonetheless, should the United States and NATO recommit to ensuring Ukrainian victory, Putin is still far from unbeatable. But defeating him will be costly.

The West could begin to provide Ukraine with air support, which would entail flying sorties with NATO jets and NATO pilots. The riskiness of such an escalation has led most commentators to rule it out as a possibility from day one of the war, and for good reason.

The alternative, as previously described, is for America (and maybe France, the U.K., or Germany) to act as Ukraine’s artillery munitions factory. This would do less to heighten tensions but would entail some mobilization of resources away from civilian goods production. Such a move would be difficult to justify to voters worried about the economy.

If it picks either option, NATO must be prepared for a long war against the Russians. Certainly, it would not end this year, and perhaps not even the next. Some analysts have suggested that Russia could deploy tactical nuclear weapons if it feels that it cannot win. What is more likely, at least at first, is that Russia would begin mass conscription. What the Russian Armed Forces have deployed so far in Ukraine — probably around 300,000 troops in total — is a fraction of the manpower that it is capable of summoning in a desperate situation. Putin has so far refused to initiate mobilization on account of the instability it would cause, but his thinking is certain to change if the alternative is a lost war.

Dealing with China, on the other hand, is entirely about how much economic hurt America and its allies would be willing to endure. Despite launching aircraft carriers and spy campaigns, the Communist Party is well aware that it is not yet strong enough to make a move on Taiwan. Instead, it threads the needle in Ukraine, supporting Russia rhetorically but not materially, mostly complying with sanctions in some areas but keeping Russia’s economy afloat in others. Beijing appears to be confident that Putin’s waiting game in Ukraine will eventually win out against NATO and that China’s own strength will eclipse America’s in the Pacific in due time. Given this, Russia’s biggest ally is keen to sit on the sidelines and bide its time.

If the West wants to force China to officially take a side, it must be willing to expand sanctions beyond Russia. Vague threats are insufficient. Now, while China is still dependent on America and on EU countries for vital aspects of high-tech manufacturing, will be the best opportunity to obtain concessions for the foreseeable future.

But leaders in Washington are afraid, perhaps rightly, that Beijing would sooner plunge the world into a depression than appear weak and lose Russia as a partner. With the midterm elections approaching and Americans citing inflation as their top issue by a huge margin, few political leaders in the U.S. are particularly eager to start a trade war.

If Ukraine is to be saved, its allies and supporters must be prepared to make more and greater political, economic, and military sacrifices that they are under no obligation to make. In the absence of such sacrifices, Putin will win his war. Not because of any particularly impressive leadership, tactics, or technology — but because he is willing to go to round two, and the West is not.",https://spectator.org/a-deadly-waiting-game-in-ukraine/,2022-07-12

China’s Share of Ukraine - The American Spectator,"Xi Jinping’s China, which is Vladimir Putin’s silent partner in Ukraine, is penetrating global finance, agriculture, energy, and government systems in order to amass data on a hitherto unknown scale.

Machine learning — which is well short of real artificial intelligence — has to be based on massive databases from which computers can learn and predict what the next set of data should be.

We know, for example, that China is gathering DNA data on millions of people, including Americans, for its own reasons. It is entirely possible that the DNA of a virus can be “tuned” to be deadly to one racial or ethnic group and not another. The Chinese may have such research into bioweapons well under way.

Simpler data gathering, and espionage, can be accomplished by many routes. We’ve known since the 2003 “Titan Rain” Chinese computer attacks on American networks of China’s deeply penetrating and endless attempts to infiltrate U.S. government-connected computer systems, such as those of intelligence, military, and military contractors. These attacks come hundreds or thousands of times each day.

We spend billions each year trying to guard against cyberattacks by China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Sometimes our defenses are sufficient, and sometimes they are not.

China’s efforts to gather data take many more forms and can penetrate to any level, grand or trivial.

On February 4, in Beijing, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping stood together on the opening day of the Chinese Winter Olympics. They announced a new strategic partnership between the two regimes.

In a joint statement, the two leaders said, “Friendship between the two States has no limits, there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation,” promising to work against the United States and supporting each other on Ukraine and Taiwan. Putin probably shared with Xi his plans for the invasion of Ukraine.

Xi is Putin’s silent partner in the Ukraine war.

A friend of mine has a young teenage son. He bought his son a fairly expensive Chinese-made drone, produced by a company called Da-Jiang Innovations (DJI). They took the drone to a large private area they often visit and flew it, taking videos with the drone’s camera.

A couple of weeks later, my friend checked out the DJI website. On it, he found some of the videos he and his son took. DJI, through its “AeroScope” program, gathers real-time information from DJI’s drones, which include both the recorded videos and the location of the drone operator. What happened to my friend is happening to Ukrainian forces fighting against the Russian invasion.

Ukraine has been using several types of drones to spot Russian forces and direct its own to counter them. Many of those drones were made in the U.S., Turkey, and China.

The Chinese drones are products of DJI. As a result, the Ukrainians believe, China is sharing intelligence information with the Russians that helps said Russians locate the Ukrainian drone operators. That data sharing gives the Russian forces an enormous tactical advantage in combat.

In March, Ukrainian Minister of Digital Information Mykhailo Fedorov wrote DJI’s chairman asking him to block AeroSpace from tracking any of his company’s drones that were purchased and activated in Ukraine. (Why he unwisely limited his request to only some drones in Ukraine is a mystery.) In response, DJI halted drone sales to both Russia and Ukraine and said it “abhorred” the use of drones in combat.

There is no reason to believe China has halted its information sharing with Russia because, as Putin and Xi have stated, their alliance is unlimited.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine continues with fighting concentrated in the eastern Donbas region. Russia’s defense ministry claimed that missile strikes in western Ukraine killed up to 80 Polish fighters who were trying to keep the flow of Western weaponry going into Ukraine. In Ukraine’s north, Russia has renewed its strikes on Kyiv, possibly trying to get lucky and kill Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky or at least further disrupt the functioning of Ukraine’s government.

Ukrainian forces are, as usual, outgunned. Russian artillery — which can be spotted by Ukrainian air forces, including drones — may be countered, in some degree, by the arrival of long-delayed U.S. multiple launch rockets. Whatever the result, both sides are continuing to lose troops at a steady and alarming rate.

A recent Washington Post report said that Western experts expect Russia will soon exhaust its military capabilities in the Donbas region. That’s possible, but Russia will not give up on Putin’s ambition to conquer Ukraine. If Russian forces exhaust their current capabilities, Putin might slow his campaign and regroup. He will continue to spend whatever it takes to reach his goal.

For Putin, a direct Chinese intervention, such as sending troops to fight with the Russians in Ukraine, would be a blow to Putin’s prestige that he can’t afford. It’s highly unlikely that China will intervene directly in the Ukraine war, but it will continue to intervene indirectly as it possibly has with its drones.

Russia, with China’s help, will continue its cyberwar against Ukraine. Though Russia has its own considerable cyberwar capabilities, China can — and will — aid its cyberespionage effort by, for example, penetrating Ukraine’s cellphone networks.

Putin’s alliance with Xi should be among President Joe Biden’s major concerns, but it evidently is not. That evidence is, in part, shown by Congress’s inattention to building up our forces in order to counter China’s in the Indo-Pacific region, which obviously includes Taiwan.

In a recent interview, Indo-Pacific Command’s boss, Adm. John Aquilino, contested congressional Democrats’ inattention to what he needs to counter China. They provided him with more assets such as an increase in the number of littoral combat ships, which are neither survivable in combat nor among Aquilino’s greatest needs.

Meanwhile, Biden and his cabinet, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, are more concerned with the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade.

As this column has stated before, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is the war that ended peace. Lithuania is playing with fire by enforcing sanctions against Russian shipments passing through Lithuanian land to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. By doing so, Lithuania, a NATO member, is putting itself at the top of Putin’s attack list. Meanwhile, Russia has moved nuclear-capable missiles into Belarus, which borders Ukraine.

At the same time, Xi’s military is preparing for its conquest of Taiwan.

Our military planners used to be intent on preparing for a two-front war. But we no longer have the capability of fighting such a war. Biden’s profound weakness lies in making war more likely in Europe, in Taiwan, and with Iran. He is rendering our military a shambles.",https://spectator.org/category/blog/,2022-06-28

A few days ago, in the newly liberated city of Balakliya, members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine recorded themselves removing Russian propaganda from a downtown billboard. Tearing away the signage bearing a demonstrably false slogan — “We are with Russia! One people!” — the soldiers thereby revealed the previous layer of the billboard, featuring a dashing portrait of the Ukrainian national poet Taras Hryhorovych Shevchenko alongside a passage from his 1845 poem “Kavkaz.” One of them proudly, and quite eloquently, proceeded to declaim the lines familiar to all patriotic Ukrainians:

Keep fighting — you will prevail

God helps you in your fight

For fame and freedom march with you

And right is on your side

The memorably pithy line “Boritesya — Poborete,” “keep fighting — you will prevail” has long been one of Ukraine’s rallying cries, providing the name of an influential political magazine founded in 1920 by the historian and statesman Mykhailo Hrushevsky, appearing on banners affixed to the Independence Square monument during the Maidan Uprising of late 2013, and subsequently emblazoned on billboards and murals throughout the nation. It seems that the Balakliya billboard was partially defaced at some point by Russian occupiers, with Shevchenko’s youthful face scoured away in a failed attempt at damnatio memoriae. The words themselves, however, were left untouched, permitting the poem to resound as clearly as ever, at a time when a beleaguered Ukraine once again contends with a Russian campaign of vicious repression, ethnic cleansing, and historical negationism.

We can be sure that Shevchenko would be proud of his countrymen. Ukrainians have indeed kept fighting, and prevailing, with right on their side, for more than 200 days now, stymying and then repelling the Russian assaults on Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy, defending in depth in the Donbas, making steady progress in the south towards temporarily occupied Kherson, and, most recently, reclaiming vast swathes of territory around Kharkiv during the battle of the Oskil River. Ukraine’s stunningly successful Kharkiv counteroffensive, a true coup de main reminiscent of the Miracle on the Vistula or the Yom Kippur War, has served to turn the tide of the war, demoralizing the routed Russian invaders, who were obliged to leave behind immense stockpiles of materiel, not to mention their invariably squalid pigsty-bivouacs. The Russian grip on the temporarily occupied portions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, and even the Crimean peninsula itself, no longer seems quite as vicelike, though there remains a great deal of work left to be done. Humiliated on the battlefield, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s terrorist regime has remained true to character, launching missile strikes against apartment blocks, thermal power stations, and other civilian targets in a fit of pique. What is undeniable is that the Ukrainians, while having proved capable of stout defense when armed with Soviet-era weapons, can now achieve decisive victories over their adversaries, equipped as they now are with state-of-the-art NATO-supplied armaments.

Ukraine’s performance in this war, which began back in 2014 and entered a new and far bloodier phase on Feb. 24, 2022, has served to dispel any number of myths. Those who denied Ukraine’s status as a “real” country must reckon with a defiant people unprecedentedly unified in their heroic resistance to the invading horde. Those who considered the conflict a mere “Ukrainian civil war,” or even more idiotically an “intra-Slavic dispute,” a phrase that makes me want to spit every time I am unfortunate enough to come across it, must acknowledge Russia’s transparently genocidal intent, as propagandists like Vladislav Ugolnyi rant psychotically about “the biological annihilation of Ukrainians” and how “Russians cannot somehow be united with subhumans,” while Sergei Mardan urges Russian forces to “burn [Ukrainian] homes and send them to Gulags, in our good old tradition.” Those who considered the Russian Federation to possess the second most powerful military on the planet must realize by now that Muscovite forces are more adept at committing war crimes, flattening residential districts, and looting washing machines, laptops, and instant noodles than achieving military faits accomplis, relying as they increasingly do on private military companies like the ChVK Wagner organization, while searching out fresh cannon fodder and future sunflower fertilizer in the form of “undesirables” previously residing in psychiatric hospitals, prisons, and homeless encampments. Then there are those, typically far to the left and right, the Dirtbag Left, the tankies, and the extremely online anime-avi alt-right — though there are admittedly some more mainstream voices among them — who bizarrely look upon Putin’s regime not as the mafia-operated gas-station-cum-open-air-madhouse it has become, but instead as some kind of moral exemplar, either of anti-colonialism (of all things) or of some sort of supposedly deeply spiritual anti-Western Russkiy-integralism. It would behoove them to acknowledge the grotesque crimes against humanity that Russian forces have committed thus far, as well as those soon to be uncovered in recently liberated regions, crimes incited by a pathetic, degenerate, ressentiment-filled ruscist ideology. And, finally, it ought to register among those soi-disant realists, who continue to urge Kyiv to concede territory in the interests of an imagined, and likely spurious, peace with Moscow, just how much rides on what can no longer be disinterestedly viewed as mere lines on a map.

We have had ample opportunity, over the last eight years, to come to understand what it means to languish under ruscist occupation. In Crimea, we see the widespread persecution, dispossession, and extrajudicial executions of Tatars, Ukrainian Catholics, Ukrainian Orthodox, and other ethnic and religious minorities. The gifted Ukrainian writer and journalist Stanislav Aseyev, who spent more than two and a half years unlawfully imprisoned in a Donetsk facility for “exceptionally dangerous persons,” has documented in his deeply disturbing book In Isolation: Dispatches from Occupied Donbas (recently published in translation by Harvard University’s Ukrainian Research Institute) the “social and psychological transformations,” the “apathy and hopelessness” that characterize the Russian-backed sham polities known as the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic, both authoritarian breakaway banana republics that occupy the same grim, oppressive twilight state as Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Transnistria.

Those portions of Ukraine that tragically fell under Russian control as a result of the 2022 invasion likewise swiftly discovered what it means to belong to the so-called Russkiy mir, the “Russian World.” As Alexey, a 34-year-old Ukrainian born and raised in temporarily occupied Nova Kakhovka, near Kherson, told WarTranslated, “I don’t want this damned ‘Russian world,’” a nightmarish universe in which communication and internet access are severely restricted, in which Russia Federal Security Service (FSB) agents drag dissidents into basements in the very same manner as their Soviet NKVD predecessors, in which a normal existence is utterly impossible. To be forcibly incorporated into the “Russian World” is to be made not a citizen, not even a subject, really, but rather a vassal ruled by a distant oligarchic kleptocracy parasitically dependent on the resources and cannon fodder that captive provinces and peoples can provide. As journalist Kamil Galeev has astutely put it: “Moscow is the city built around a princely court and living off prince’s expenses. Its prosperity results from its central status in the imperial system. Moscow is uniquely expensive to feed. That’s why its colonies are so destitute.” And that is precisely why Moscow would like another colony to bleed dry.

Perhaps this will change someday, though the logic of Russian history is hardly reassuring. Deputies of 18 districts in Moscow and Saint Petersburg are said to have signed statements demanding Putin’s resignation, on the grounds of having undertaken actions “detrimental to the future of Russia and its citizens,” which if anything is an extreme understatement. The oligarchs and the siloviki securocrats must sense that a change is coming, given that at least eight prominent businessmen have died in recent months under decidedly unusual circumstances, and, as journalist Andrey Pertsev observed in July:

An influential businessman from Vladimir Putin’s entourage, Yevgeny Prigozhin, harshly criticised St Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov, although such a situation had been impossible earlier due to unspoken rules within the power vertical. Prior to that, the Secretary of the General Council of United Russia, Andrey Turchak, and the Chairman of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, had argued in public. Conflicts among high-profile politicians and the siloviki are a sign of the collapse of the old system and its body of laws and rules. The elite are fumbling around in search of the outlines of an emerging new order, and it is already clear that the creation of such an order will be preceded by inter-elite wars and repressions.

It is safe to say that, even if Putin’s regime comes to a premature end, owing in part to his insane Ukrainian misadventure — pardon me, “special operation” — under no foreseeable circumstance do you want anything to do with the ersatz “Russian World,” described by Orhan Dragaš as little more than “a worthless inscription on a safe that contains hundreds of billions stolen in Russia and around the world.” It is this legitimately sick, twisted world of destitution, stifled dissent, extrajudicial killings, and institutionalized thievery that Ukraine escaped by dint of the Orange Revolution and Maidan Uprising and against which it is now obliged to fight with all its might.

After the staggering Ukrainian military successes in the Kharkiv Oblast were met with a barrage of Russian missiles cynically and brutally directed solely at civilian targets, President Volodymyr Zelensky responded with one of his finest and most trenchant speeches:

Do you still believe that we are one people? Do you still think that you can frighten, crush, and bend us into submission? You really understand nothing? You don’t realize who we are? What we are for? What we are about? Read my lips: No gas or no you? No you. No lights or no you? No you. Cold, hunger, darkness, and thirst — for us these are less frightening and less deadly than your friendship and brotherhood. But history will arrange everything. And we will have gas, electricity, water, and food — and we won’t have you.

Russia may have proven incapable of achieving a military fait accompli, but, come what may, Ukraine has done just that. Ukrainian independence is now a fait accompli. Ukrainian dignity is now a fait accompli. Ukraine’s rejection of the dismal, murderous Russkiy mir is now a fait accompli. History has indeed arranged that, history that is being made before our very eyes.

Ukrainians, with the vital assistance of their allies in Europe, the United States, and across the globe, have accomplished all this in the face of the eliminationist efforts of Russians from Putin, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, and Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev on down to those soldiers, mercenaries, and Kadyrovites actually filling the mass graves in Mariupol, Bucha, and elsewhere. They have also accomplished all this notwithstanding the attitudes of those morally inverted commentators and policymakers in the West who would happily have consigned untold numbers of Ukrainians to the death or, at best, the living death offered by the “Russian World.” It has been made abundantly clear that Ukraine will keep fighting, and prevailing, with right on its side, and that, as we witnessed in Balakliya, no amount of mendacious propaganda can obscure that for long.",https://spectator.org/category/blog/spectator-a-m/,2022-09-14
Moscow’s Strategy in Ukraine Puts Russian Soldiers Through Putin’s Meat Grinder - The American Spectator,"According to reports from the front lines in Bakhmut, Russia is losing a significant number of troops to take the strategically insignificant Ukrainian city. Yet Russian President Vladimir Putin says everything is going according to plan. Unfortunately, he may be right.

Bakhmut, a city in Donetsk Oblast, has been under attack since August, and Russia has slowly advanced as Ukrainian troops have doggedly contested every foot of ground. The Kremlin has been characteristically quiet about casualties, but an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky estimates that Russia may have lost up to 20,000 troops in the axis between Bakhmut and nearby Russian-occupied Soledar. This is a heavy price to pay for a city that has no significant strategic value.

Nevertheless, on Sunday Putin said: “The dynamics are positive. Everything is developing within the plan of the Defense Ministry and the General Staff. And I hope that our fighters will please us more than once again with the results of their combat work.”

One could dismiss this statement as the usual totalitarian messaging, where everything is always positive, the regime is always right, and the supreme leader is working from an inscrutable plan that mere mortals have no hope of understanding. Trust us, comrades, Putin is saying. Forget those body bags; final victory is assured.

But in some respects, Putin is right. Despite thousands of lost lives, Russia still holds significant amounts of Ukrainian territory. Occupation forces are busy forcibly integrating the subject populations into Moscow’s alternative reality. And at the front lines, Russia seems to be engaging in a calculated effort to weaken Ukraine through attrition warfare.

The siege of Bakhmut is like a scaled-down version of the 1916 Battle of Verdun. In that battle — the longest of World War I at 11 months — German strategists calculated that the French would commit any troops necessary to hold the symbolically important city. By seizing key fortifications on the edge of the town, the Germans invited the French to mount counterattacks that would devastate their forces while the Kaiser’s troops enjoyed the relative advantage of the defense.

Ultimately, Verdun did not work out to Germany’s advantage. Both sides suffered over 350,000 casualties — slightly more on the French side, but nothing like the lopsided casualty count that Chief of the German General Staff General Erich von Falkenhayn had expected. The battle cost him his job.

Russian military leadership had a shakeup last week as well. Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov took command from Sergey Surovikin, who had commanded since October and now will act as Gerasimov’s deputy. But, unlike Verdun, this may not signal a change in Russia’s approach to the war.

The numbers weigh in Moscow’s favor. American estimates indicate that each side has likely suffered equal casualties. But even if Kyiv is doing somewhat better at minimizing losses, Russia has a deeper mobilization base with three times the population of Ukraine. And Putin is more than happy to empty his prisons, pay for Wagner Group mercenaries, enforce harsh conscription, and generally treat his troops as cannon fodder. Putin does not seem to mind bleeding Russia if it also means bleeding Ukraine.

This dynamic is evident in Bakhmut. “When we kill five out of 10 of their soldiers at once, they are replenished again to 10 over the course of several hours,” said Ukrainian deputy battalion commander Andriy Kryshchenko. Russian troops can maintain a combat tempo that the Ukrainians can’t match. (RELATED: Can Russia Outlast Ukraine?)

The Ukrainian troops are more motivated than the Russians, better trained, better equipped, and have a moral cause that is recognized and supported by the free world. But the leveling effect of urban warfare can dampen these advantages. Whether the Ukrainians can hold Bakhmut is questionable. The city itself has no strategic importance other than the symbolism attached to it. It won’t decide the conflict either way. But to the extent Ukrainian leaders feel it must be held, they will continue to pay the price.

This underscores the importance of restoring maneuver to the Ukrainian war. Recent discussions of weapons shipments to Ukraine — such as British Challenger 2 tanks, German-made Leopard 2 tanks from Poland and perhaps Finland, and American armored Bradley infantry fighting vehicles — show that Western awareness of Kyiv’s need to focus less on relentless urban warfare and more on retaking the vast tracts of occupied territory annexed by Russia. The Ukrainians have demonstrated their ability to seize and hold ground on the northern and southern flanks of the occupied zone. If these new weapons are available later in the spring, after the muddy season — rasputitsa or “the season of bad roads” in Russian — fades and mobility becomes easier, Ukraine may be able to mount the kind of offensive operations it needs to both liberate the occupied areas and demonstrate a healthy return on Western investment of arms and equipment. (RELATED: West Plans to Send Ukraine Modern Tanks)

But until then, the Bakhmut meat grinder continues, according to plan.

"On Chanukah, My Appendix, and the High Kohen - The American Spectator","Chanukah is celebrated this year from Sunday night, Dec. 18, through Monday, Dec. 26, at sunset, corresponding to the Hebrew calendar days of 25 Kislev through 2 Tevet.

Chanukah is so interesting, isn’t it? It’s the easiest of all our Jewish holidays to celebrate. No construction of an outdoor home, as we do on Sukkot, with wood beams and rooftops lined with bamboo sticks (East Coast) or palm fronds (West Coast). No need to fast for 25 hours as we do on Tisha B’Av and Yom Kippur, or to attend services for six or 10-plus hours as we do respectively on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. No need to turn the kitchen upside down, schlep pots and pans and flatware and dishes to and from the basement (East Coast) or the garage (West Coast) or the kids’ bathtub, and then to line almost everything in the kitchen in aluminum foil as we do on Passover. All you have to do is light a candle or two or nine. You sing a song or two (America) or eight or 10 (Israel), and you wonder for a week whether any of the carols they play in the mall can be adapted with Hebrew lyrics. Perhaps you even contemplate that you never met anyone who made a dreidel out of clay, although the plastic ones may one day be banned in California.

Chanukah is fascinating because, since it is so incredibly easy, more American Jews “celebrate it” than they do any other Jewish holiday. The most assimilated, Hellenized, Judaically ignorant, and self-mocking Jew or pseudo-Jew can stop three minutes per year for Chanukah. Intermarried Doug Emhoff and his Kamala celebrate the message of Matisyahu the Hasmonean, high Kohen, whose sons fought the Hellenist assimilationists to liberate the Beit HaMikdash (Holy Temple), by lighting a candle in a menorah for the White House public relations team. In the Emhoff-Kamala background: a Christmas tree the size of Goliath, with more Christmas regalia on the Emhoff-Kamala mantle above the fireplace. So, anyone apparently can “do Chanukah.” Even non-Jews. All it takes is a few candles and a match. That still leaves plenty of time for Christmas dinner (for assimilated Jews like Elena Kagan and Emhoff, at a Chinese non-kosher restaurant), yule logs, Santa, Christmas breakfast, opening Christmas presents, and Christmas lunch.

In part, with everyone else in America centering their mall shopping, their amusement-park visiting, and even their television-watching on “the other winter holiday,” assimilated American Jews do not want to miss out on the winter wonderland. So, they have an Adam Sandler Chanukah, where two non-Jews together make a “fine looking Jew” and the 25 percent bloodline of a famous non-Jewish actor is “not too shabby.”

Well, here’s my Chanukah reminiscence. All in a rabbi’s life.

Back in 2006, I was hospitalized with an “Appendicitis for the Ages.” If you ever wondered how bad it really is if your appendix actually starts leaking before they take it out, wonder no more. It is pretty, pretty, pretty bad. By the time my wife forced me into the car at 3 a.m. — the earliest hours of the morning that, for some reason, we call “the middle of the night” — I quietly knew this was bad. We got to the hospital. It did not take long for the emergency room people to realize that, in the words of the triage expert: “Wow, Rabbi, this emergency room typically is jam-packed with people who have sniffles and coughs. Tonight, for the first time in weeks, thanks to you, we finally have a real life-or-death emergency here in the emergency room!” I was honored.

I ended up in a bit of peril and was stuck in the hospital for several days. They soon told me that the hospital had these very sweet and kind undergraduate volunteers from a nearby Christian Bible college who would come by to help with the patients, “Good Samaritans” trying to assist in little ways without inadvertently killing anyone.

After several days spent supine, I was itching to resume walking, and they assigned this incredibly darling guy to help me ambulate. He was so amazingly excited to learn that he, a Christian Bible student, had been assigned to a Bible-learned full-fledged Orthodox rabbi with a yarmulka who actually was studied in the book that this fellow called the “Old Testament” (but that we Jews call the “Torah,” the “Chumash,” the “Pentateuch,” the “Five Books of Moses,” or the “Artscroll with the blue cover”). As he started walking alongside me down the hall, he thanked me profusely for giving him the opportunity to bless a rabbi. He explained that G-d said to Abraham in Genesis (B’reishit) 12:3 that He will bless those who bless Abraham’s children, so this nice guy always had wanted so much to bless any Jew. And now, he got himself a bonus — double points: an Orthodox rabbi.

So, we walked and schmoozed. And then he asked me a question whose Judaic erudition, coming from a fellow at a Christian Bible college, actually quite impressed me: “Rabbi, have you ever heard of Matisyahu? I am absolutely fixated on Matisyahu and would like to know all I can about him.”

I was so impressed. As it says on the Chanukah dreidel acrostic: Ness Gadol Haya Poh — A Great Miracle Happened Here. So I told him all about Matisyahu:

“Matisyahu was the Kohen Gadol — the High Priest — of the Jewish People…”

Suddenly, my volunteer helper interrupted me: “Did you say that Matisyahu is the High Priest of the Jewish People?”

“Yes,” I answered, “what you would call the ‘High Priest,’ or, as we prefer to say, the ‘Kohen Gadol.’ In a way, you might say he was a king without a crown.”

“Please continue,” he eagerly urged me. “Wow! Matisyahu was like a king without a crown! I can hardly wait to tell my dormitory friends!”

I was bemused but continued:

“Well, Matisyahu was based in Israel, in a city called Modi’in. We Jews were under Greek domination, and they had conquered our land and defiled our Beit HaMikdash, the Holy Temple on Mount Zion in Jerusalem. And now they were coercing us, at pain of death, to abandon our Torah laws and values. In an incident that is probably the most famous and retold event in Matisyahu’s entire life, it is said that the local Greek occupation forces compelled all the local Jews to gather at a central location, where the leading Greek official demanded that some Jew in the group eat a piece of forbidden pork or ham or bacon. One of those pig foods. As you know from Bible college, we Jews are forbidden from eating pig.

“Well, one Jewish guy in the group apparently was looking to advance his status with the Greeks, so he stepped forward and proudly proclaimed that he would eat it. And, at that juncture, Matisyahu stepped forward, unsheathed a long sword, and he slew the guy dead.” (READ MORE from Dov Fischer: The Chanukah of Fools)

My helper stopped in his tracks. We were two-thirds of the way down the hall. “Matisyahu had a sword? He used the sword? Matisyahu killed a guy with a sword? Just for eating a piece of pork?”

I nodded affirmatively. “Yep. That’s Matisyahu.” I explained the context. “We Jews are quite peaceful and do not go around slaying people, nor do we even stop other people at the supermarket (East Coast — Key Food; West Coast — Ralphs; St. Louis — Schnucks; Louisville — Winn-Dixie; everywhere else — Piggly Wiggly) to stop them from buying Oscar Mayer sausages. Rather, this was a moment in time when the Jewish people faced utter destruction, and we were on the brink of not only physical catastrophe but spiritual destruction. It was not about a single guy eating non-kosher food but about a defiant apostate signaling publicly to the Greeks that all the Jews could be terrorized into abandoning our G-d and Torah, into abandoning not only our kosher laws but all of Judaism. It was a moment in time, in a different context from today.”

Our walk came to an end. I was feeling pretty tired by now, but my new Friend for a Day was utterly breathless: “I cannot thank you enough, Rabbi. I will always remember this walk — as long as I live. I thought I knew a bunch about Matisyahu, but wait until I tell my friends that Matisyahu killed people with a sword, especially Jews who eat pork or ham. Wow!”

I injected that he should be aware that Matisyahu planted the seeds that led to Jewish freedom and the Chanukah miracle. He had five grown sons. The most famous, Yehudah HaMaccabee — Judah the Maccabee — was the hero who ultimately led the revolt that drove the Greeks out of Israel, liberated the Holy Temple from Greek desecration, and revived the daily lighting of the menorah in the Temple. It was that rekindling, when there was not enough kindling oil to last more than a day, that led to the great miracle of Chanukah, as only a single day’s supply of oil sustained eight days, enough time for more sacred oil to be produced in accordance with Judaic law.

He paused and asked, “Did you just say, Rabbi, that Matisyahu has five fully grown sons, and one of them freed Israel from the Greeks and caused Israeli independence?”

I was back at my bed, quite exhausted from my first walk since the surgery, and I think I nodded affirmatively. He was such a sweet fellow, and we wished each other well.

That night my wife, Ellen of blessed memory, visited me at the hospital after her long day of work. I told her about this really nice guy from a Christian Bible college, about our walk and our conversation. She started giggling in the infectious way that only she could. Once she started, I could not but laugh hysterically, too. She always did that to me. And then I caught my breath and asked her, “El, what exactly are we laughing about?”

She then asked me: “Dov, you are so enthralled with the music of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, MBD, Safam, and Garth Brooks that you never follow other popular music. You don’t realize there is a pretty popular reggae singer out there named ‘Matisyahu,’ right?”

“Nope, Ellen. Never heard of him.”

“Well,” she said. “Now that Bible college has heard of him — and, oh, have they!”",https://spectator.org/category/politics/a-further-perspective/,2022-12-20
"Questions for the Washington Uniparty on Ukraine, One Year Later - The American Spectator","President Joe Biden’s surprise visit to Ukrainian premier Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv earlier this week was an unmistakable sign of solidarity with Ukraine on the one-year anniversary of Russian kingpin Vladimir Putin’s reckless, unjust invasion. To the extent Biden’s aim was to send such a symbolic message to Moscow and its allies, he succeeded.

Unfortunately, Biden’s trip, especially seen in concert with recent similar actions such as Zelensky’s December speech before a joint session of Congress and even Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-KY) sartorial choice to wear a Ukrainian flag-colored necktie to Biden’s State of the Union address earlier this month, raises a number of discomfiting questions about the Washington, D.C., uniparty’s seemingly interminable commitment to prolonging this Eastern European quagmire. On the one-year anniversary of the culmination of Europe’s first extended land war since World War II, here are some pressing questions for establishment politicians from both major political parties.

No. 1: What is the meaning of “as long as it takes”? In Kyiv, Biden reiterated that the U.S. “will remain with Ukraine as long as it takes.” This presumably entails both a moral and, more relevant, fiscal commitment — indeed, Biden promised a new tranche of military aid to Ukraine, on top of the $113 billion in aid U.S. taxpayers dispensed with in 2022, and on top of recently announced top-tier materiel such as Patriot missile defense systems. But items such as Patriot missile defense systems and M142 HIMARS rocket launchers don’t grow on trees; resources are necessarily scarce, and each additional item we ship off into a proxy war against a nuclear-armed hegemon necessarily depletes our own military arsenal. Furthermore, America is massively indebted with soaring annual budget deficits. And Chinese President Xi Jinping surely grins as America strips bare our military and ships off the parts to Europe, not Asia. So how long is “as long as it takes” — and, related, do we simply not care at all about the costs?

No. 2: Is the U.S. national interest in the conflict synonymous with Ukraine’s national interest? The bipartisan foreign policy establishment’s absolutist stand with Ukraine — at seemingly all costs, “as long as it takes,” and so forth — implicitly conflates the national interests of the U.S. and Ukraine. After all, if the U.S. is that existentially committed to Ukrainian “victory” — whatever precisely that entails, and however Zelensky defines it — then it follows that our national interest in the conflict is precisely coterminous with Ukraine’s own national interest. But although there is strong overlap, this is simply not the case; the national interests are not coterminous. Ukraine’s national interest is indeed the maximalist stance Zelensky espouses — namely, refusal to countenance yielding even a square foot of territory in the Donbas (or Crimea). The U.S. national interest, by contrast, is definitely served by Zelensky’s remaining in power in Kyiv and not being toppled for an Alexander Lukashenko–style Moscow puppet; crucially, however, there is exceedingly little (if any) U.S. interest in where the exact national boundary lines are drawn in eastern Ukraine, where the population is often closely divided between ethnic Ukrainians and ethnic Russians. The crude post-Soviet dissolution boundaries in this part of the world are not akin to Moses descending Mount Sinai with the Word of God.

No. 3: Is the U.S. fearful of all-out war with Russia? Russia is the country with the single most confirmed nuclear weapons in the entire world: 6,255, as of 2021. (The U.S. was second, with 5,550 at that time.) As Zelensky sometimes flirts with openly calling for World War III, and continually endeavors to drag NATO — and thus, the U.S. — further into the conflict, does the prospect of cataclysmic nuclear war with Russia not cross the minds of the Washington uniparty and bipartisan foreign policy “blob”? That fear, if anything, should be exacerbated by Putin’s de facto withdrawal of Russia, over the past week, from the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START). Putin (loathsomely) speculates fairly openly about deploying nuclear weapons — all while the U.S., as well as European nations such as Germany and Poland, ship off increasingly sophisticated materiel. Is no one here interested in de-escalation and avoiding what Biden not-so-reassuringly referred to last October as nuclear “Armageddon”?

No. 4: Has the U.S. learned anything about “endless wars”? The American public is naturally war-weary after decades of failed regime change wars and moralistic nation-building crusade boondoggles. There is simply no political appetite right now for a dramatically prolonged military engagement — especially one in Europe, while our actual top geopolitical threat, China, flies spy balloons over our continent unimpeded and tests nuclear-capable hypersonic missiles around the world. The Washington uniparty’s desire for escalation in Eastern Europe may aid rapacious Beltway defense contractors, but it is manifestly contrary to the expressed interests of the American people, who would rather our elected officials focus instead on our own porous southern border with Mexico. In every way, the Biden administration’s current approach is “America Last,” not “America First.”

No. 5: What is the U.S.’s long-term plan to deal with Russia? It is unclear at best whether anyone in a foreign policy decision-making capacity has given a second of thought to what U.S.-Russian relations might possibly look like when this war is finally over. At this rate, and absent a course correction toward de-escalation and direct mediated negotiation between the warring parties, Moscow will loathe America and Europe after the conflict even more than they did prior to the conflict’s onset. But given that China, and not Russia, is this century’s dominant threat to America, a shrewder and more forward-looking approach to the conflict would at least lay the groundwork for possibly peeling Russia away from China and slightly closer to the Western sphere of influence after the war is over. Unfortunately, there is thus far no reason to believe this has a chance.

Political leaders of both parties should be asked these important questions. The stakes, as Biden’s “Armageddon” slip of the tongue inadvertently revealed, could not possibly be higher.

Recovering a More Perfect Union: A Rebuke of the 1619 Project - The American Spectator,"Toward a More Perfect Union: The Moral and Cultural Case for Teaching the Great American Story

By Timothy S. Goeglein

(Fidelis Publishing, 208 pages, $26)

One of the worst sins of the present — not just ours but any present — is its tendency to condescend toward the past, which is much easier to do when one doesn’t trouble to know the full context of that past or try to grasp the nature of its challenges as they presented themselves at the time.

— Wilfred M. McClay, Land of Hope: An Invitation to the Great American Story

Jay Leno used to do a regular schtick, “Jaywalking,” in which he would interview random persons on the street, often young ones, and ask them questions about American history, such as: “Who did America fight in the Revolutionary War?” “How many branches of the U.S. government are there?” “What year was the War of 1812?” Invariably, they could not answer the question, standing mute with Leno’s impertinent microphone pointed at their gaping mouths, or they gave a ridiculous answer.

As deflating as these performances were, it turns out that the state of American education is even worse than Leno documented. Not only does ignorance characterize so much of the citizenry, but Americans are now also imbibing, i.e., being taught, pernicious lies or partial truths about the founding and history of the United States from a tendentious, ideological, and solidly left-wing perspective.

This sorry state of affairs is documented in excruciating detail in Timothy S. Goeglein’s enlightening, depressing, and, ultimately, hopeful new book, Toward a More Perfect Union: The Moral and Cultural Case for Teaching the Great American Story. The distortion of history now routinely fed to elementary and high school students, as well as those attending hopelessly “woke” universities and colleges, has produced many young people who are “cynical, entitled, and aggrieved.” Continues Goeglein:

Rather than being thankful, they are indignant. Rather than proud, they feel ashamed. Rather than feeling free, they feel oppressed. Rather than wanting to fix America’s faults, they want to burn America down. Rather than asking what they can do for their country, they demand to know what their country can do for them—and the answer is increasingly to “cease to exist.”

We have created “a citizenry divorced both intellectually and emotionally from its heritage.” Further, “[w]hen we disassociate history—and memory—from facts, we are lost,” writes Goeglein, a former special assistant to President George W. Bush, a former Senate staffer, and, presently, vice president of external and government relations for Focus on the Family.

Our predicament is exemplified by the absurd, anti-historical 1619 Project of the New York Times, an initiative repudiated by many respected, liberal historians. It is being taught in roughly 4,500 schools nationwide. In a feat of historical and moral inversion, it maintains that the American Revolution was designed primarily to protect the institution of slavery from being destroyed by the British Empire. Such a one-sided view of history will alienate Americans from one another, given the dissolution of a common identity and love of country, and disregards those who struggled to make the Declaration of Independence a reality in spite of its obvious flaws, such as slavery.

On the matter of slavery, always a leading complaint against America’s founding, the Washington Post’s George Will has rightly observed that the founders’ Constitution “gave slavery no national validation. It left slavery solely a creature of state laws and therefore susceptible to the process that, in fact, occurred — the process of being regionally confined and put on a path to ultimate extinction. Secession was the South’s desperate response when it recognized this impending outcome that the Constitution had facilitated.”

So, it comes as no surprise that, as “a 2020 Pew Research study found a month before the presidential election, roughly eight in ten registered voters in both camps said their political disagreements with others were about core American values, with roughly nine in ten—liberal and conservative—worried [that] a victory by the other would lead to ‘lasting harm’ to the United States” [emphasis added]. We are now in a situation in which tribe is pitted against tribe, race against race, rich against poor, red against blue states.

We have succumbed to the “termites of self-loathing,” to use a term coined by Ben Stein. There is hardly a historic personage — Lincoln, Washington, Jefferson, Columbus, St. Junípero Serra — who is not vilified, “canceled,” and banished into outer darkness by woke activists and educators. One should be grateful that at least Frederick Douglass and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. are spared such treatment, given their devotion to American ideals in the Declaration of Independence, classical literature, and Scripture. They are just ignored.

Recently, a friend whose daughter attended one of the tonier prep schools in Washington, D.C., related that his conversations with her on U.S. and Western history were disappointing. She, and her friends, showed no “piety” toward her country or heritage.

It was an interesting word choice and recalled my own school days studying Virgil’s Aeneid, an epic poem written between 29 and 19 B.C. It tells the story of the Trojan Aeneas, who fled the destruction of his city, traveled to Italy, and would later become the ancestor of the Romans. I remember my Jesuit instructor lauding “pius Aeneas,” “pious” being the most used adjective throughout the poem. In following the will of the gods — he even left the captivating Dido in Carthage — Aeneas demonstrated “pietas,” a virtue in the eyes of Virgil and my teacher, in his devotion to family, country, and mission. Such piety is no longer encouraged in our educational institutions, or so it would seem.

What brought America to this sorry state? In the beginning there was the “Original Zinn” — Howard Zinn, that is, a Boston University professor of political science and “the godfather of the radical attack on America’s history,” as Goeglein outlines in a pivotal chapter of Toward a More Perfect Union. Zinn’s “epic screed,” A People’s History of the United States (1980), and his supplemental book for high schoolers, A Young People’s History of the United States (2007), have had an unparalleled impact on social studies teachers. The historian “refram[ed]” and “reimagin[ed]” facts to fit a Marxist critique of the U.S. and a Western civilization marred, claimed Zinn, “by the religion of popes, the government of kings, the frenzy for money.” For Zinn, “standards of historical analysis are merely ‘technical problems’ to be dismissed.”

“You wanna read a real history book?” Matt Damon’s titular character, Will, asks Robin Williams’ Dr. Sean Maguire in the movie Good Will Hunting (1997). “Read Howard Zinn’s People’s History of the United States. That book’ll f***ing knock you on your ass.” Indeed, it does. It also boggles the mind. Zinn claims that the nation “has been taken over by men [the founders] who have no respect for human rights or constitutional liberties.” Again, in service to ideology, Zinn does not believe in objective history as documented by Mary Grabar, Ph.D., a refugee of communist Yugoslavia, on whom Goeglein draws heavily.

Nikole Hannah-Jones, the main author of the 1619 Project, backtracked after respected historians critiqued her work. She claimed that the project was not about history but about “memory.” This is not historically grounded memory but memory saturated with ideology and politics. This is pure Zinn in methodology. Hence, noted historians such as Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Eugene Genovese, and Michael Kammen — hardly a crowd of right-wingers — criticized Zinn as a “polemicist, not a historian.”

“His ultimate goal is not a historical one but a political one,” writes Goeglein. “[H]e wanted to depict the United States as an illegitimate enterprise, one demanding a revolution.”

According to the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, today, only 18 percent of colleges require that students take a U.S. history or government class to graduate. Maybe that is a blessing, given what passes for “history” in today’s woke environment. Ultimately, however, this is devastating to national unity. Goeglein describes survey after survey that all indicate Americans’ ignorance of their rights under law and history. When the Constitution is taught, it is derided as being not radical enough in terms of the outcomes desired by left-of-center teachers and advocates.

Toward A More Perfect Union does not specify a political agenda for reform, although it does note efforts made by some governors to reign in educational bureaucracies on, say, critical race theory. It does make a plea for parents to make a concerted effort to teach and counsel their children on the history of the nation and to pay close attention to what their schools are teaching. It points to excellent resources available with which parents can educate themselves and their children on the complete story of American exceptionalism, not excluding the darker chapters. Parents who can afford the cost should look for alternatives to public schools that sacrifice true learning for the sake of ideology. “Classical” schools, home schooling, and parochial schools — all of which boomed during the COVID lockdowns — are possible options.

Parents who cannot afford private schools or who have special-needs children “must be extra vigilant and expect to receive the full wrath of Leftist activists if they stand up and demand that civics be taught while also standing against the indoctrination their children are receiving.” Specifically, they need to insist on the rights to inspect curricula, to opt out of the teaching of certain subjects, and to insist that controversial issues be discussed impartially. No easy tasks these.

Goeglein concludes:

[W]e must rededicate ourselves to the teaching of history—true, verifiable, factual history, with all its glories and tragedies. We need not fear to teach the ugly truths about America alongside the beautiful ones because America’s founding vision is pure and her ideals are noble. Our failures do not change that.

Toward a More Perfect Union makes a compelling case that the country’s future, as one nation, demands a reclamation of our educational system and a recovery of the authentic teaching of history and constitutional government rightly understood.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/at-large/,2023-01-07
Republicans Should Slowly Back Away From Ukraine - The American Spectator,"This is not an anti-Ukraine column and it certainly isn’t a pro-Russia column. What it really amounts to is a pro-life column, and particularly a pro-American people column.

And it begins with a recognition that the majority of Americans are pro-Ukraine. Most surveys show that as a people we are disgusted by Russia’s invasion of its neighbor and the atrocities committed there, and most of us want the Ukrainians to win that war.

Most of us would also like to see a world where Russia was run by someone less conniving, less brutal, and more interested in cooperation with the rest of Europe than Vladimir Putin. It’s pretty clear that he’s the bad guy here. For whatever provocations might have been dangled in front of his face, and there have surely been some, launching an offensive war against a sovereign country was a far more savage response than could ever have been warranted.

So all of that has been said. But as the last column in this space noted, this Russia–Ukraine war has outlived its usefulness, and it’s going to become an albatross around the necks of its supporters. Some of those people are Republicans, and they’re going to need to quietly back away from the unquestioning support with billions of dollars we don’t have for the meat grinder in Eastern Europe.

Yes, we want Ukraine to win. What does that look like? Apparently, according to Joe Biden — echoed now by the uber-predictable warmonger John Bolton — the Washington establishment is committed to the idea that winning the Russia–Ukraine war entails regime change in Moscow.

This is something that Hitler and Napoleon couldn’t pull off. Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelenskyy will?

“Why the angst? There is no long-term prospect for peace and security in Europe without regime change in Russia,” Bolton says.

Well, the angst is that Russia has the world’s largest nuclear weapons stockpile, and Putin keeps threatening to use it. If that doesn’t give you angst, you probably shouldn’t be involved in making decisions of this magnitude.

Do I believe Putin will use nuclear weapons against Ukraine or the West? No. Am I absolutely positive in that belief? Also, no.

A good rule is to take your enemies seriously when they say things. Even Joe Biden tells the truth from time to time, though his people often walk back his statements when he does. So when Vladimir Putin says he will drop the hot rocks as part of his war effort, it shouldn’t be discounted as a possibility.

And if he thinks nukes are a valid option to prosecute an offensive war, what do you think he’d say to the idea that we’ll take him out?

If Putin is the megalomaniac our elites continue to paint him as, the only prudent assumption is that he would use nukes to stay in power.

John Bolton does not represent the thinking of the majority of Republican voters. We tend to be a fairly bellicose lot, and on balance we’re willing to send in the troops. But most of us have learned, thanks to the abject failure of our globalist projects in Afghanistan and Iraq, to temper that jingoistic instinct — and watching the woke and vaxxed Biden military turn into a hyper-expensive health plan for the trans crowd has taken a major toll on our interest in deploying it to foreign shores.

Which is the direction this thing seems to be going. Every other day Biden is firing off checks for more billions to support the Ukrainians, without a whole hell of a lot of accountability behind the destination of that cash. We already know Ukraine is the laundromat for the globalist gang, and particularly the Biden crime family. It’s impossible not to realize the certainty a great deal of that aid is being stolen.

And should the war escalate, we’re going to eventually come to a choice.

Putin says he’s going to call up and send in 300,000 reserve troops to press an offensive in Ukraine. The problem is that his front-line divisions, the best and brightest who spearheaded the invasion, have mostly been worn to the nub by the Ukrainians using a lot of American surplus gear based on 20- to 30-year-old technology. There is zero reason to believe the 300,000 replacements, fresh out of boot camp, are anything other than cannon fodder.

Of course, the Ukrainians are pretty beat up, too. They’ve got to be more or less at the end of their rope as a cohesive army after their own losses. And there are nowhere near as many reserves Zelenskyy can call up. Though Ukraine is currently on the offensive in Kharkiv and Kherson and might well retake much of those territories. Russia has annexed four of the Donbas regions in eastern Ukraine; the West has rejected the announcements.

Some 12 million Ukrainians have already hit the road as refugees from the war. More are going to leave. The rest of Europe, already in the midst of a massive energy crunch and economic nosedive, isn’t in the best condition to take them in.

Worse, in 2021 Ukraine harvested some 32 million tons of wheat. This year it will harvest 19 million tons. Next year the estimate has it that no more than seven to 10 million tons will be harvested. That country is the bread basket of Europe, but it’s hard to farm effectively in a war zone.

The war will likely fall into a stalemate this winter. If Bolton is correct that there are forces inside Russia willing to move on Putin because the war has gone badly, then Putin will seek to break that stalemate. Either there will be peace talks and a negotiated settlement or things will escalate because he can’t afford for Ukraine to be his Vietnam (or Afghanistan, perhaps more pointedly in both Russia’s case and ours).

Which means nuclear weapons.

And what’s worse is that of late, Putin is not as bellicose as our own government. (READ MORE from Scott McKay: Consequences, Consequences Everywhere)

When Elon Musk tweeted a few days ago the outline of a peace settlement, one which was probably friendlier to Russia than Ukraine and the West would or should agree to, the Russians responded favorably. Ukraine’s leaders reacted with vituperation. And Zelenskyy is now saying he’ll sit at the peace table, but not until Putin is removed.

Nobody really believes Zelenskyy speaks alone. He says what he’s told to say by our government. And that means Vladimir Putin must believe that it’s American policy not to end this war until he is deposed or dead.

Ask yourself this: is the territorial integrity of Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO, worth the loss of an American city to a nuclear strike? If you’re a Republican member of Congress, would you support such a price to be paid?

This is not running from a bully. We’ve proved over the past six months that we could bloody Putin’s nose and leave him staggering. To date the Ukraine war has been a brilliant success from an American military standpoint — we’ve essentially unloaded second-line gear on a proxy and watched them wear out the largest army in Europe.

If the war were to end today, we would have won it decisively. Almost regardless of what settlement is made.

The great Chinese military philosopher Sun Tzu is said to have advised, “Build your opponent a golden bridge to retreat across.” A wise American leadership would be building that golden bridge for Putin, not openly plotting his downfall. Sun Tzu warned an opponent with his feet in the river will fight to the death.

When this war escalates, as it likely will without efforts made at building the golden bridge, the politics will turn in both Europe and America. They’ll turn ugly. Should Putin, his power and life threatened by loose talk of regime change, opt to use nukes, an armageddon beckons. No American interests in this war justify such a risk.

We’re less than five weeks from the midterm elections, which seem every bit as existential as the Ukraine mess could be, and the issues on the table cut decisively for the GOP. There is no reason to raise this war up to the public’s conscience as an electoral issue now.

But when the midterms are over, the Republican majority which I predict will arise in both houses of Congress will need to act as a brake to both the Biden administration’s words and actions, and it must serve as a limiting force to escalation of this conflict.

A twofold goal should guide our actions. We should seek a negotiated settlement to the Ukraine war preserving as much territorial integrity as possible for the Ukrainians, and we should offer up a denial of Ukrainian entry into NATO as a consideration for ending that war — something we can do, since we’ve already set a precedent that we would supply Ukraine with military aid as needed if they’re attacked. But if there are areas of the Donbas where the populace actually does want to join Russia, letting those go rather than seeing the war escalate is a sensible decision. Perhaps Putin would be willing to buy Ukraine out of those areas.

And second, given the instability of the Russian energy supply to Europe, the interruption of which by the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines has made clear regardless of who the culprit may have been, it should be American policy that a far larger percentage of the natural gas supplied to Europe than currently flows should come from the United States. We’ve spent more than $65 billion to back the Ukrainians in the war; we should be paid back at a profit by selling LNG to the Europeans.

And this should become Republican policy vis-à-vis Russia and Ukraine. Not regime change in Moscow à la John Bolton’s demand. Lest we forget, our record in installing friendly potentates to replace the ones we depose is not the best, and what comes after Putin could be someone even more unstable, more hostile to America, and quite likely in bed with the Chinese. If that should happen, Russia then becomes North Korea on steroids.

And let’s not doubt that possibility, particularly given the propensity, as Barack Obama noted, of Joe Biden to “f**k things up.”",https://spectator.org/category/politics/china-watch/,2022-10-07
Russia-Ukraine: China and India Could End the War - The American Spectator,"China and India are now trying to distance themselves from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine, which commenced in February of this year. This is a powerful combination of two countries that have the standing, especially in partnership, to influence the Russian president in a way no other countries have.

On Friday, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India told Putin that “today’s era is not of war.” This low-key but pointed statement came a day after Putin acknowledged that President Xi Jinping of China had “questions and concerns” about the war in Ukraine. Some members of the mainstream media are predictably reading too much into Modi’s statement, saying that he is “assailing” Putin, even though the prime minister’s statement was relatively mild and stopped well short of a condemnation.

Nonetheless, this could be interpreted as the start of a shifting of an opinion that has previously been supportive of Putin: For nearly seven months, both China and India have hesitated to join the West in its outrage against the Kremlin. Russia, as the junior partner in the Russia–China relationship, is now the leading supplier of China’s oil — about 2 million barrels per day. Further, in August, Russia was reported to be India’s third-largest source of oil, after Iraq and, by a small margin, Saudi Arabia. In June, India’s oil imports from Russia reached 950,000 barrels per day, with Russia offering discounts in recent months.

China imports more than twice as much Russian oil as India. China would appear to be in a relatively stronger position than India; oil is a global commodity and sources of supply can be restructured. The war in Ukraine is detrimental to China’s strategic interest, especially to its massive export model, which allows it to amass foreign currency reserves that it uses for its own investment and for the development of countries that subscribe to the Belt and Road Initiative. A slowing Chinese economy, disruption from its massive COVID lockdown, a distressed and overbuilt real estate sector, and fears of a global recession (as expressed earlier this week by FedEx, which may be viewed as a bellwether or “lead steer” in the world economy) do not bode well for Beijing.

India, on the other hand, is currently also dependent upon Russia for its military equipment. As I have written in The American Spectator, nearly half of such current equipment is of Russian origin, with over 2,000 of the country’s T-72 tanks dating to the Soviet era. And with a 4,000-mile border to defend against Pakistan and China, India will be reliant on Russian arms for years to come.

Extensively sanctioned by Europe and the United States, failing in capturing Kiev, and suffering what appears to be a dramatic military reversal in the Kharkiv region of northeast Ukraine, Russia is seeing its economic and military misfortunes beginning to affect public opinion within Russia, with some public officials now calling for Putin’s impeachment. Allowing further disgrace and humiliation of Putin, in spite of legitimate Ukrainian cries for revenge, is not in the world’s best interest: The events of the 20th century demonstrated that Germany’s humiliating surrender terms at the end of World War I eventually led to a cataclysm. One can speculate that the use of a tactical nuclear weapon by Putin would assure his near universal status as a pariah, but who is to know the mind of an isolated Russian strongman, who has destroyed his country’s future for many years and knows he might be going down with it?

The time has come for Xi Jinping and Modi, acting in concert, to call for a summit of the two direct combatants, plus NATO and the U.S., and themselves — and some of the former Soviet republics in Central Asia, where both Russia and China have vested interests in the oil and gas sectors. Ukraine must also be made to realize that militarily ousting Russia from all Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine is an unreasonable operational objective that could prolong the war indefinitely and increase the risk that, out of spite and desperation, a nuclear weapon could be used.

NATO and the U.S. may not be enthused about having China and India inside the tent. After nearly seven months of a high-intensity conflict, however, economic sanctions, the supply of state-of-the-art artillery and other equipment, and diplomatic initiatives have not changed Putin’s course.

It would be highly problematic for Putin to decline such an invitation from a couple of his best friends. If he did, he would be met with shrieks of execration from friend and foe alike.

The Battle for UK’s Premiership Continues - The American Spectator,"Ever since U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation on July 7 amid waves of scandals and resignations, the question of who will succeed him has swirled. Conservative candidate Tom Tugendhat describes the contentious election as “a battle of ideas that is actually going to determine the future of our country.” The current field of candidates sees Conservative MPs Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Minister of State for Trade Policy Penny Mordaunt as the clear frontrunners in the nomination process. The conservative rivals continue to focus on issues facing Britons, including the unpredictable future of the nation’s economy, post-Brexit trading relations, and commitment in the Ukraine conflict.

The 1922 Committee, a group of conservative members of parliament who organize and manage the Conservative Party’s leadership elections, announced the rules of the leadership the moment Johnson announced his resignation. Under the newly amended Conservative Party Constitution, Boris Johnson is ineligible to run due to his resignation, thus beginning the first phase of the process for leadership change. The party is currently in the second phase of the leadership election, the nomination process, where the rules require candidates to gain 30 endorsements from party members and a series of votes occurs, eliminating candidates with the fewest endorsements until two candidates remain. Once the 1922 Committee announces who the two candidates are, the final stage of campaigning amongst Tory and Conservative members begins. The winner must receive over 50 percent of the vote from the party’s general membership to serve as prime minister.

The nomination process for the leadership election was approved on July 11, beginning the search to find Johnson’s successor. The current field of contenders has shrunk as the committee has eliminated candidates. On Thursday morning, Attorney General of England and Wales Sulla Braverman was disqualified from the race after ending up in last place with only 27 endorsements in the second round of voting. The elimination process has now made the race tighter between Sunak and Mordaunt, who are currently neck to neck in polls as the top choices for Johnson’s successor.

Mordaunt, MP for Portsmouth North and minister of state for trade policy, is seen as the most prominent choice to succeed Boris Johnson. In a YouGov poll, Mordaunt was in first place with 27 percent support of Tories, while Sunak came in third with 13 percent support. Mordaunt has framed her campaign around her status as a pro-Brexit and pro-change candidate in order to distance herself from Johnson and accumulate additional support. While polls may seem optimistic for Mordaunt, she has received backlash amongst party’s members, especially from David Frost, a member of the House of Lords, who called Mordaunt’s Brexit credentials weak: “If Brexit is going to be safe it’s going to need a few things … I would worry, on the basis on what I’ve seen, that we wouldn’t necessarily get that from Penny.” The MP sees the future of the party’s agenda as focusing on “low tax, a small state, and personal responsibility,” saying that this will revive a “sense of self” in the Conservative Party and nation.

Sunak, MP for Richmond (York) and former Chancellor of the Exchequer, is also considered one of the top choices for leader. Sunak continues to accentuate his position of chancellor of the exchequer, framing his actions to cut interest rates and pass a 30 billion pound stimulus package as helping Britain’s economy during the COVID-19 pandemic to gain support. Despite his current lead in the nomination process, Sunak’s recent popularity fell due to the revelations of his wealthy wife’s tax status that allowed her to avoid paying taxes on overseas income. In his Twitter announcement declaring his candidacy for the party leadership, Sunak said, “ Let’s restore trust, rebuild the economy and reunite the country.”

The 2022 Conservative Party Leadership Election comes at a crucial time for the U.K., as it faces a potential new recession along with record–high inflation, resulting in lower consumer confidence and families struggling to make ends meet. The U.K. continues to be one of Ukraine’s strongest supporters in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian conflict. The Conservative Party announced it would continue its support for Ukraine despite the party’s leadership change. The ongoing struggle with the post-Brexit trade negotiations is also becoming a major issue for the nation’s economic opportunities across Europe.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/europe/,2022-07-16
Triangular Diplomacy: A Different Strategy for the Ukraine Crisis - The American Spectator,"The year is 1905. Great Britain is the “holder” of the balance of power in Europe by virtue of its financial strength, insular position, unmatched sea power, and continental allies. Russia, which had been the focus of British strategy during the “great game” rivalry in Europe and Asia, is mired in a no-win war against Japan and suffering revolution at home. Germany is rising — a growing continental power that took to the sea to challenge the global preeminence of Great Britain. Britain’s strategic dilemma was how to simultaneously deal with a declining Russia and a rising Germany.

Thomas F. Lynch III, a distinguished research fellow at the National Defense University’s Institute for National Strategic Studies, an adjunct professor of national security studies at Georgetown, and the editor of Strategic Assessment 2020: Into a New Era of Great Power Competition, suggests that Great Britain’s approach to its early-20th-century strategic dilemma can serve as a model for the United States’ current efforts to deal with a declining Russia and a rising China.

His essay, “America’s Great-Power Challenge: Managing Russia’s Decline and China’s Rise,” is featured on the website of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a foreign policy think tank founded in the 1950s by the great geopolitical thinker Robert Strausz-Hupe. Lynch contends that the United States today faces a challenge not unlike that faced by the British in 1905. Russia today is mired in what up to now has been a no-win war in Ukraine, just as it was in 1904–1905 against Japan. China today, like Germany in 1905, is a continental power that has taken to the sea to challenge America’s global leadership. In 1905, Britain, instead of celebrating Russia’s decline after 50-odd years of geopolitical rivalry known as the “great game,” understood that a weakened Russia no longer threatened British interests but could still serve as a check upon the rising power of Germany. As Lynch puts it, “British strategy needed Russia to remain a battered but intact European land power rival to Berlin’s east as a check on growing German colonial and naval ambitions.” And British leaders — prodded by U.S. officials — also recognized that a Russian collapse “could leave a power vacuum across northern East Asia that Tokyo would rapidly fill.”

As Lynch notes, British strategy did not prevent war, but Germany fought a debilitating two-front war until the Bolsheviks seized power and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. By that time, the United States entered the conflict and shifted the power balance against Germany, which resulted in Germany’s defeat.

The United States after World War II engaged in a 45-year struggle with Soviet Russia known as the Cold War. The Soviet collapse in 1989–1991 ended that rivalry, just as Russia’s decline in the early 20th century ended the “great game” with Great Britain. In achieving victory in the Cold War, the United States benefited from the Nixon administration’s “triangular diplomacy,” which positioned America geopolitically closer to both China and Russia than those Eurasian continental powers were to each other.

Current U.S. policy, Lynch believes, is attempting to further weaken Russia in its war in Ukraine while simultaneously dealing with China’s aggressive rise in the Indo-Pacific. “Choices made in Washington now,” he writes, “will help determine the long-term geostrategic impact” of today’s great power rivalries. China, Lynch writes, is today’s Germany of 1905. China, not Russia, has the intent and wherewithal to “reshape [the] international order.” The United States, which holds a global position similar to that of 1905 Great Britain, should pursue policies aimed at “driving a wedge” between China and Russia. “Russia and China,” he continues, “share short-term antagonism toward the United States, but Moscow remains sensitive to subtle but evident signaling from Beijing that it views Moscow as a future junior partner in a ‘Pax-Sinica.’” American policy, he writes, “can reinforce natural Russian geostrategic wariness by reminding Moscow of its vulnerability to Chinese exploitation while showing prudence and justly resolving Moscow’s political-military mess-making in eastern Europe.”

This sort of British-style “triangular diplomacy” is not currently popular in the Biden administration or among the popular press, which are serving as practical supporters and cheerleaders for a Russian defeat in Ukraine. American policy over the course of three decades has done very little to “drive a wedge” between Beijing and Moscow. It is time to recognize once again that U.S. security depends on the geopolitical pluralism of Eurasia, and U.S. policy should conform to that security requirement.

This does not mean “giving in” to Russian aggression in Ukraine, but it does mean, in Lynch’s words, that American policymakers need “to work with Kyiv and coalition partners to balance the consequences demanded of Russia for its transgressions in Ukraine with temperance that manages Moscow’s decline to limit the risk of chaotic instability across Eurasia and minimize Chinese relative power gains.”

“History,” as Lynch notes, “does not repeat, but it frequently rhymes when a reasoned template is carefully applied.” For Lynch, that reasoned template for U.S. policymakers is to recognize, as Great Britain did in 1905, which of two great power rivals poses the greater threat and to adjust policies to prioritize that threat.

Support for Ukraine Does Not Come From ‘Current Thingism’",https://spectator.org/category/politics/free-market/,2022-12-31
Ukraine: To Liberate or Not to Liberate? - The American Spectator,"In a perceptive essay published in the Winter 1995 issue of Dissent, just war theorist Michael Walzer questioned the morality of nonintervention-as-absolute policy on the part of nations having the wherewithal to prevent gross evil.[1] To intervene or not intervene, Walzer acknowledged, should always be a difficult and disquieting question. The use of force in other nations should always generate hesitation and anxiety. At the same time, what worried Walzer was the tendency of governments and leaders to make decisions regarding intervention based chiefly on their political standing at home rather than the suffering and oppression of men, women, and children who are the direct victims of war. Walzer questioned whether onlooking nations are justified in only “ameliorating” the effects of siege and bombardment, for example, bringing food, temporary shelter, or medical supplies — rather than actually helping to “alter power relations on the ground” and directly interfering with the actual siege and bombardment.

At the time that he penned his essay, Walzer had in mind the U.S. experience in Somalia, the European experience in Bosnia, and the tragedy of unbounded butchery in Rwanda, the wounds of which were quite fresh. When should the world’s agents and powers merely watch and protest? And when should they protest and then intervene?

The backdrop against which Walzer was writing was, of course, very different from that of our day. In our day, a superpower (Russia) has attacked a former Soviet satellite state (Ukraine) out of imperial lust and pretension. It thereby has violated Ukraine’s territorial integrity and the inviolability of its borders which were affirmed through the 1994 Budapest Memorandum by Ukraine, the U.S., Great Britain, and Russia herself. And it continues presently to wage a wholly unjust war against Ukraine, violating all conventions of war in the process. The signatories of the memorandum, it needs emphasizing, were pledged to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.[2]

But 2022 is the not the first time since 1994 that Ukraine’s borders have been breached by the threat of military force. Russia violated the stipulations of the memorandum with its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its waging war via Russian proxy forces in Ukraine’s eastern regions. By one estimate, since 2014 (but before the current war began), more than 13,000 Ukrainian lives have been offered along with roughly two million people being driven from their homes.

As of June 23, 2022, according the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the war has claimed roughly 4,700 civilian lives, with over 5,800 injured. But this does not include the weeks-long siege of the port city of Mariupol, whose mayor has said that more than 10,000 civilians died, with the possibility that the death toll is as high as 20,000. Russian forces were said to have brought mobile cremation equipment into the city to dispose of the thousands of bodies that had “carpeted” the streets. And, of course, nearly seven million Ukrainians have been displaced as refugees. According to Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, approximately 6,500 Ukrainian soldiers have been taken prisoner, while an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that about 200 soldiers are being killed each day. (This state of affairs does not even include the hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens who have been deported to Russia.) With Russian advances in — and from — Eastern Ukraine, this dismal pattern can only be expected to continue.

In examining “the politics of rescue,” Michael Walzer acknowledged that the Cold War provided “appropriate moral and political terms” guiding governments when and where they must “act effectively abroad.” In the aftermath of the Cold War, nothing equivalent has been in place. In 2022, we find ourselves confronted with the reality of a new Cold War (or, the reemergence of an old one) and the need to make moral and political judgments in light of not only terrorism but political aggression, barbarism, and tyranny. Three decades after the supposed Cold War’s end, Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran are deepening their ties against the U.S. and its allies, with numerous Middle Eastern countries plagued with conflict and jihadist violence in Africa seemingly unabated.[3] In our day, it is a sad truth that the only war Western nations — affluent, comfortable, and morally dull — are willing to wage is a sheltered conflict — one that is absent a clear will to win. China, of course, is watching closely, and taking notes. Taiwan will be the West’s next major geopolitical crisis.

The presumption against coercive intervention must always be strong, as Walzer has reminded us, and there are important reasons for that presumption. We should be guided by an abiding opposition to imperial politics, willing to tolerate other imperfect and less democratic forms of governing. And yet, as Walzer cautions, nonintervention is not an absolute moral rule, even when by nature intervention is complex, messy, and susceptible to unjust intentions. Sometimes what is going on in other lands and among other people-groups should not be tolerated by the community of nations. Even when intervening can be wrongly (or inadequately) justified, humanitarian and military intervention — and the two almost always must go hand in hand — may be morally necessary “whenever cruelty and suffering are extreme.” The aim of intervention, alas, is “profoundly negative” in character. That is, nations and governments can do things to their own people or to other people-groups that quite simply are inhumane and must not be tolerated. Thus, human beings and governments, on occasion, are required — because of human dignity — to put a stop to actions and events that shock the conscience of humankind. The agent of last resort, alas, is “anyone [or any coalition of nations] near enough and strong enough to stop what needs stopping.” This includes — even when Western nations greatly fear a war’s escalation — inhibiting totalitarian regimes that have nuclear capability.

There are some who argue that Western nations have no political or “legal” obligation to participate in the fight against Russian forces in Ukraine. Legality aside, whether Western nations have a moral obligation to offer military aid to Ukraine is a different matter. Why, we may ask, should the United States care so much about Ukraine, a country 5,000 miles away? One important reason is that U.S. officials told the Ukrainians in 1994 that the United States would care when they helped negotiate the Budapest Memorandum on security assurances. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the meantime, has decided that Ukraine actually does not have the right to exist as a state any longer; he has decided to exert military force to bring the country back under Russian rule.[4] We in the West forget Putin’s promise that if Ukraine were to enter NATO, there would be no more Ukraine.[5] (READ MORE: Will Ukraine Survive Putin?)

Putin’s goal is to destroy Ukraine’s infrastructure, disorient or dispel its 44 million citizens, and wage war on the West. As of this writing, Russian controls roughly 20 percent of Ukrainian territory, with Russian “re-education” and granting of Russian passports already underway in regions of Ukraine that have fallen.[6] No one believes that this massive injustice will be confined to Eastern Ukraine. For years, Putin has talked openly of expansion, and more recently he acknowledged Ukraine to be the first step. And indeed, in recent weeks, one Russian general announced his nation’s intent to occupy the Transnistria region of Moldova, which borders both Ukraine and Romania.[7]

Putin, we need reminding, is committed to undoing 1991. He is committed to ending the international system that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. Hence, the war in Ukraine was inevitable, for it represents a war against the West. Moreover, the embarrassment of Ukraine’s early resistance in the war has but one effect: namely, to increase the conflict and strengthen Putin’s resolve; there can be no negotiation. As supreme evidence thereof, several missile strikes were launched on Kyiv from Russian aircraft over the Caspian Sea on early Sunday, June 26, coming on the opening day of the G-7 summit in south Germany. Russian tactics will continue to be unrelenting and barbaric, even when particular “pauses” appear to characterize the overall conflict.[8] The question is whether the West has the will to respond to such atrocity.

Western nations — with the U.S. in the lead — are hereby being confronted with a moral reality: Should an entire nation that has been promised assurances of its “sovereignty” and “territorial integrity” be denied the right to decide its future? And should that denial, which during the war thus far has been accompanied by all manner of war crimes, matter to us? Indeed, it should matter — to us and to everyone, and shame on those nations that cannot sympathize with Ukraine’s plight. President Zelensky has accurately framed the issue confronting us at present: we are at the moment when the world must decide whether brute force will triumph. The war is important, for it mirrors the values of democratic self-government over against totalitarian rule. The stakes, then, are high.

As Russia’s war against Ukraine evolves, Europe’s leaders give evidence of being divided on the stakes at hand. While France, Germany, Austria, and Italy in relative terms downplay Russia’s threat to NATO and wrestle with the economic effects of the war, former Eastern bloc nations such as Poland and the Baltic states, having suffered historically and more recently from Russian imperialist expansion, see Ukraine as a harbinger of future developments by Moscow.[9] From their perspective, Ukraine is the “front line” in a wider war against the West.[10] And they should know; after all, they have suffered egregiously in recent history as a result of Soviet–Russian imperialism. Eastern European states well recognize, unlike the West, that a world without war is but mere fantasy. Ukraine is simply the latest reminder.

Several European leaders have floated the idea of giving Putin an “off-ramp” for the purpose of de-escalation. Correlatively, France’s President Emmanuel Macron has publicly and unwisely stated that Russia should not be “humiliated.” Italy’s prime minister — in recent days forced to resign — and former prime minister have suggested autonomy for Crimea and Donbas, while former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has suggested something similar. Responding to such suggestions that Ukraine should cede territory in exchange for peace, Zelensky compared these to attempts to appease Nazi Germany in 1938. He does not overstate the matter.[11] And recently addressing the Ukrainian Parliament, Polish President Andrzej Duda stated that only Ukraine should decide any terms of peace with Moscow, while at the same time calling for a complete removal of Russian troops. If our aim is to save Ukrainian lives and honor Ukraine’s “sovereignty” and “territorial integrity,” then Western nations must arm Ukraine with every weapon needed to undermine Russian forces and prevent brute force from prevailing. If we learned anything from the Cold War, it taught us that we must oppose socio-political evil, fighting for the most basic of human freedoms. Those challenges confront us more than ever today, given the imperialist pretensions of Moscow, Beijing, Pyongyang, Tehran, and beyond, and given the West’s tragic commitment to appeasement since the Cold War’s assumed end.

On May 15 NATO’s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stated, “Ukraine can win this war” — Stoltenberg’s strongest statement since the war’s commencement. In order for such a scenario to be realized, however, much must happen in the meantime. At issue is not Ukraine’s resolve; that much has been demonstrated over the last five months. Rather, what is needed is the West’s resolve to assist Ukraine by any and all means necessary. This must occur in terms of the addition of strategic weaponry (for example, long-range, multiple-launch rocket systems and air-defense systems,[12] drones,[13] and armored vehicles), replenishment of ammunition, intelligence, and training — not to mention Ukraine’s immediate and ongoing need to repair its railways, roads, and bridges faster than Russia can destroy them. And it must occur against the backdrop of Moscow’s persistent nuclear saber-rattling.[14] Up to now, the U.S. and NATO members have erred on the side of caution. We may be helping Ukraine to survive, but can we help her win? Time is not on Ukraine’s side, and the war is taking a toll on Europe, with two prime ministers stepping down in recent days and significant economic hardship on the way.

Biden’s reasons for hesitating to involve the U.S. in the war are ill-founded at best and unprincipled at worst. Chief among these is the fear of the war’s escalation. A moral response to this fear is twofold: (1) fear of doing the right thing — i.e., protecting the innocent and defenseless — demonstrates a lack of concern for our fellow man; (2) correlatively, that fear only emboldens dictators to escalate further. If the U.S. and its Western allies are too frightened to intervene, Putin can continue his barbaric provocation.

Ukraine’s resolve notwithstanding, Putin’s war is bound to get uglier. Given Russia’s advances in the eastern region of Ukraine, how much longer Ukraine can hold back Russian aggression depends on the immediate delivery of strategic military hardware — especially the Military Auxiliary Radio System, as Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov has made quite clear. Putin’s grip on power and his future depend on the war’s outcome. The Russian dictator has crossed the Rubicon; there is no turning back. In the mold of dictators past and present, he will double down in terms of repression and brutality. We only delude ourselves in the West to think otherwise.

Speaking in Tokyo in late May at a meeting of Indo-Pacific region leaders, Biden said that the U.S. would defend Taiwan militarily if China attempted to take it by force. Asked if, after declining to send troops to Ukraine (aside from special forces authorized to protect the U.S. Embassy), the U.S. would involve itself directly in Taiwan, the president responded, yes we would. Under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, we agreed to provide Taiwan with a means of military defense, although the act was silent with regard to the U.S.’s direct role. Here we might ask if the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which was signed by the U.S., does not also commit us to safeguard Ukrainian freedom in much the same way that the Taiwan Relations Act does. Why would one agreement be binding — a moral obligation, if you will — and the other not?

Responses to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by the U.S. and Great Britain, the two significant signatories to the Budapest Memorandum, have often been ambivalent. Both nations have ruled out direct intervention, out of fear of war with Russia. The result of this ambivalence is twofold: it has the effect of emboldening Putin and it means that Ukraine is left to its own to fight a nuclear-equipped aggressor. Russia’s assault on Ukraine is a wake-up call to the West. This is a war that Ukraine did not choose. Bereft of allies since 1994, Ukraine became an easy target of Moscow, as the last decade has made abundantly clear. Clearly, Ukrainians have every right to feel betrayed, given the assurances of the Budapest Memorandum. The inability of this pact to deter one of four security guarantors from military aggression is catastrophic. Given this grotesque violation, it behooves the U.S to keep its word, both providing direct military assistance to Ukraine and urging its European partners to do the same.

A June 14 opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal accurately depicted a familiar U.S. pattern — what the author called “midway measures” in which the U.S. initiates an involvement in a conflict but fails to commit itself to the goal of winning that conflict. Afghanistan, Korea, and Vietnam, of course, come to mind. What the U.S. lacks is the moral will to follow through on its commitments and ensure the defeat of the totalitarian threat. The lesson for America’s adversaries is quite clear: persist long enough and the U.S. will not take the costly but necessary steps to win. As Sergey Karaganov, the aforementioned adviser to Putin, has stated, “I … know from the history of American nuclear strategy that the U.S. is unlikely to defend Europe with nuclear weapons.”

No one wants the U.S to be the world’s policeman. And geopolitical reality confirms that no one — not even the United States — can undertake such a role. In economic terms, a “division of labor” is necessary. The prudent use of American power and influence in the context of international crises will often be to press other nations to do their share of the work. Nevertheless, because “to whom much has been given much will be required,” the U.S. will not infrequently need to take the initiative. And on occasion, hopefully the rare occasion, “we should help pay for and even add soldiers to an intervention initiated by somebody else.” Why? For the simple reason that in many cases, nothing at all will be done unless we are prepared to play a leading role, whether that is political, financial, or military.

To intervene or not to intervene? Walzer is right: this should always be a hard question and we need not fully abandon a presumption against intervention. Nevertheless, the moral position is to honor the exceptions to non-intervention — i.e., in those cases in which evil must be stopped and where tyranny rages. Walzer writes: “The vast numbers of murdered people; the men, women, and children dying of disease and famine willfully caused or easily preventable; the masses of desperate refugees — none of these are served by reciting high-minded principles.” Indeed, the massacre and rape of a civilian population are acts of barbarism that invite us — no, require us — to override the presumption against direct, coercive intervention in other nations. “High-minded principles” in public speeches indeed are not enough. As it presently applies to the war in Ukraine, what is abundantly clear is that if we withhold from this besieged nation what it urgently needs, Ukraine will be no more. People are perishing as we hesitate.

It is true that the norm is not to intervene in other countries. And it is true, at least arguably so, that the U.S. does not have a good record more recently in this regard. Moreover, it is true that, among Western nations, governments tend toward non-intervention in our day, for better or worse. But for the sake of those who truly are victims of oppressive tyranny, imperialist zeal, and unspeakable horror and bloodshed, those who urgently need outside help, the burden lies on the shoulders of those nations which have the wherewithal to provide that help. Recall Walzer’s words: the agent of last resort is “anyone near enough and strong enough to stop what needs stopping.” Moreover, “all states have an interest in global stability and even in global humanity, and in the case of wealthy and powerful states like ours, this interest is seconded by obligation.” As one dissident Russian journalist recently reminded us, an open society cannot dictate to rogue states how to live, but it should — it must — be able to prevent aggression like the invasion (and intended obliteration) of Ukraine.[15]

Zelensky has described Russia as “the biggest terrorist organization in the world” and the war crimes committed since the war’s inception suggest that this is no exaggeration. Do relatively free nations have a responsibility — both politically and morally — to impede and punish terrorists (as well as terrorist regimes) when and where they perpetrate their evil in the community of nations? Previous generations were resolute in their response: terror must be thwarted. Thwarting terror, it goes without saying, requires that we take risks — risks that were shown during the height of the Cold War to be morally and politically justified (they averted the nuclear totalitarian threat), and risks that are not only politically necessary but morally obligatory on behalf of fellow human beings who are suffering egregiously. Some risks are worth taking; one of them involves rescuing an innocent people from unjust assault and annihilation.

In the end, Walzer warned, those who pay “the moral price of silence and callousness” will eventually have to pay “the political price of turmoil and lawlessness nearer home.” How long, we need to ask ourselves, will decency survive here at home if we cannot display it to the truly needy in the global community? And to those whom we promised — in 1994 — the integrity of their national borders?

Walzer frames our present responsibilities succinctly: “It is not enough to wait until the tyrants … have done their filthy work and then rush food and medicine to the ragged survivors. Whenever the filthy work can be stopped, it should be stopped. And if not by us, the supposedly decent people of this world, then by whom?”

Indeed, if not by “the supposedly decent people of this world,” then by whom?

[2] The assurances of sovereignty and territorial integrity played a key role in persuading the Ukrainian government to give up what, at the time, amounted to the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal.

[3] This means, at the most basic level, that U.S. foreign policy will need to change.

[4] On Sunday, July 24, speaking at an Arab League Summit in Cairo, Egypt, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated: “We are determined to help the people of eastern Ukraine to liberate themselves from the burden of this absolutely unacceptable regime.”

[5] As early as 1997, Sergey Karaganov, former Kremlin advisor and current advisor to Putin, has predicted war should NATO expand and include Ukraine within its orbit. Karaganov has for years argued that Western dominance is now at an end.

[6] In recent days, the Kremlin has ordered referenda to approve the annexation of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia by September 15.

[7] In a July 24 CNN interview, Moldova’s prime minister, Natalia Gavrilița, said that her nation fears an invasion by Russia — for reasons that are quite obvious: Moldova borders Ukraine on the southwest; since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Moldova has never been truly free from Russian influence and, economically, it is one of Europe’s poorest nations (currently experiencing a 32 percent inflation rate).

[8] By one estimate, 670 square kilometers (260 square miles) of land have been taken over by Russians forces in eastern Ukraine; around 80,000 buildings have been destroyed or damaged, including 799 hospitals and 2102 schools (among these, two universities), with an estimated damage to Ukraine’s infrastructure by Russian forces of over $100 billion.

[9] As evidence of this conviction, according to one estimate, Estonia, Latvia, and Poland, all countries bordering either Ukraine or Russia, have pledged at least 0.4 percent of their GDP in aid to Ukraine since Jan. 24 while the U.S., as of May 10, has pledged 0.22 percent of its GDP in aid to Ukraine.

[10] Polish President Andrzej Duda, who has visited Ukraine twice since the war’s outbreak and who speaks regularly with Ukrainian President Zelensky, states the matter bluntly: “this is a war on civilization. This is about a war for the defense of Europe.”

[11] In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Zelensky insisted that any ceasefire would only encourage a wider conflict: “Freezing the conflict with the Russian Federation means a pause that gives the Russian Federation a break for rest.”

[12] Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, addressed the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, July 20, to request more defensive weapons, noting, “We would have answers if we had air-defense systems.”

[13] For example, Iran, as of mid-July, is preparing to send to Russia hundreds of sophisticated drones; at the very least, we must reciprocate.

[14] On Saturday, June 25, Putin met with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and stated that within several months Russia would be delivering to Belarus missile systems capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear warheads.

Western Sanctimony Drives Global South Away From Supporting Ukraine - The American Spectator,"Surprised that governments across the so-called Global South aren’t interested in allied posturing over the Russo-Ukraine war? Imperious Western officials assumed they were leading the world against Moscow’s aggression, only to turn around and find no one behind them.

Reported the New York Times: “Instead of cleaving in two, the world has fragmented. A vast middle sees Moscow’s invasion as, primarily, a European and American problem. Rather than view it as an existential threat, these countries are largely focused on protecting their own interests amid the economic and geopolitical upheaval caused by the invasion.”

A new survey of global opinion suggests that the allies have lost much of the world to apathy and worse. Self-righteous and wokish Westerners just don’t have as much appeal to the rest of the world as they thought. Hostile opinions of Washington and Brussels are significantly undermining their objectives, including toward Russia.

The differences in opinion are significant. For instance, observed Ivan Krastev, of the Centre for Liberal Studies in Sofia, Bulgaria: “[W]hile a plurality of Americans and Europeans want Ukraine to win even if it means a longer war and economic hardship for themselves, most Chinese, Indians and Turks who expressed a view said they would prefer the war to stop as soon as possible — even if that means Ukraine giving up part of its territory.”

Even more noteworthy, many in the Global South lean Moscow’s way. Far from treating the Putin government as an enemy, Krastev reports, “Russia is seen either as an ‘ally’ or a ‘partner’ by 79 per cent of people in China (unsurprisingly). But the same is true for 80 per cent of Indians and 69 per cent of Turks.” Notably, Turkey is a member of NATO, and India is the hoped for great counterweight to China.

Actually, it’s hard to blame leaders and peoples in what used to be called the Third World for their skepticism. The U.S. and Europe treat every issue touching the West as vital to the entire planet, even universe, of immediate concern warranting conscription of other nations into the allied cause. As for interest in problems, even crises, elsewhere, not so much. Moreover, Western governments have turned hypocrisy into an art form: complaining of international injustices against them but regularly engaging in similar practices against others. For governments outside Europe and North America, allied violations of manifold promises not to expand NATO and use of Ukraine to fight an intensifying proxy war against Russia look other than disinterested support for a helpless victim. And then there is allied, especially U.S., war-making.

The Global South’s grievances are many. Remember how America and Europe rallied to the cause of the Democratic Republic of Congo, when it become the epicenter of a multi-sided conflict that killed an estimated 5.4 million people? Probably not. Neither does anyone in the developing world.

In fact, there was scant Western attention to a horrific conflict in which as many people died as during the Vietnam and Korean wars combined. Fervent American and European demands for action, as previously in the Balkans, were absent in the DRC’s case.

And then there are the Vietnam and Korean wars in which other people also died prodigiously. In the latter case at least something positive was attained, with South Koreans avoiding Kim Il-sung’s tyranny and eventually creating democracy out of the ruthless, sometimes murderous regime backed by the U.S. In Vietnam in the name of peace Washington visited years of horrific war upon the Vietnamese people, only to eventually depart leaving the entire country under communism. Whatever the merits of American policy — surely it would have been better never to have taken over France’s colonial position in Vietnam — one can understand why U.S. policy gained few friends elsewhere in the world.

A more recent, but equally horrid conflict, which did not much interest today’s American and European moral exemplars, was the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Perhaps a million people died, with Iran suffering the most. And blame was clear: Tehran was attacked by Saddam Hussein’s government in search of territorial booty. Rather like Russia, Baghdad gained ground initially, but soon was pushed back by Iranian counterattacks. Instead of helping the victims, Washington aided Iraq. That support, for Hussein’s aggressive war, is one reason that he later assumed the U.S. would not interfere with his invasion of Kuwait.

The Reagan administration had its reasons for supporting the cruel dictator against whom America later fought two wars — fear of Tehran’s new Islamist regime. Yet Washington’s willingness to help kill untold Iranians because it did not like their government, though a traditional and even understandable foreign policy objective, contrasts sharply with the moralisms now flooding forth from Washington and Brussels. Such unfettered hypocrisy is one reason most Africans, Asians, and South Americans see little reason to join the campaign against Russia. The West is against aggression, sometimes, and for it when seen as benefiting them.

Indeed, the last two decades have demonstrated that the U.S. and its allies are ever ready to bomb, invade, and occupy other nations to advance perceived Western interests. At least a million people have died in the conflicts broadly constituting the global war on terrorism, and that number almost certainly is low. Not all these deaths should be blamed on Washington, of course, but many, far too many, resulted from wars that were dishonest, stupid, and bungled — Iraq and Libya, certainly, as well as the years of nation-building in Afghanistan. There also is Yemen, in which the U.S. has empowered Saudi Arabia’s murderous crown prince to slaughter his neighbors for his own convenience.

Yet promiscuous U.S. and allied war-making with bombs and bullets is not all. Over the last three decades Washington has increasingly turned to economic war, attacking friends and foes alike. And American officials, especially, have shown little interest in the impact on the helpless and disadvantaged throughout the Global South.

For instance, in 2020 Congress came up with the curious theory that punishing the Syrian people by preventing them from rebuilding after a decade of civil war would force Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power. It was a mind-blowingly stupid policy but was avidly embraced by U.S. policymakers such as James Jeffrey, the “Never Trumper” who was unaccountably appointed to handle Syria policy and who violated his responsibility to the American people by misleading President Donald Trump about the number of U.S. troops in Syria to thwart the president’s desire to withdraw them. Jeffrey said his objective was to turn the country into a “quagmire” for Russia, ignoring the interests of the Syrian people. The “Caesar sanctions” have turned millions of distressed people into an impoverished means to Jeffrey’s end — a policy which, alas, has failed entirely.

Yet his callousness paled compared to that of then-UN ambassador (and later secretary of state) Madeleine Albright, long one of Washington’s most celebrated doyennes. Rarely was so much hubris and hypocrisy concentrated in one person. She said much to offend Americans as well as foreigners, but perhaps her most noted gaffe, meaning speaking an embarrassing truth, was her response to the question regarding the justification for sanctions on Iraq that allegedly had killed a half million children. Said Albright: “We think the price is worth it.” Although she later recognized the stupidity of that response, she regretted her carelessness, not cruelty, having insisted that she and others in the America’s foreign policy establishment saw further than the mere mortals living in the Global South.

Indeed, grievances against the West run deep when the U.S. and Europe attempt to pull moral rank. Colonialism, a grotesque afront to human dignity and life, was an ugly practice even by the British, and was much worse under others, especially Germany, Portugal, and Belgium.

There also are more pragmatic reasons that the Global South has not joined with Washington and Brussels. Oppressive governments, quite common throughout the developing world, are unlikely recruits for conflict being sold as authoritarianism against democracy. Even nominal democracies, such as India and Pakistan, object to allied hectoring.

Moreover, officials the world over see no reason to worry about a conflict that, for them, is beyond distant. The war simply poses no danger. Indeed, contended Krastev, other countries no longer see Moscow as threatening: “For countries such as India and Turkey, Russia has become like them, so they do not need to fear it.”

Finally, poor nations are loath to miss an opportunity to pick up energy supplies and perhaps other goods on the cheap. Moral grandstanding is cheap for rich countries which applaud themselves for their contributions to Ukraine. Even though the U.S. is functionally bankrupt, with the Congressional Budget Office recently reporting that over the last year alone estimates of this year’s deficit jumped by $426 billion, it still can borrow. Most nations are not so insulated from the world’s economic oscillations. China remains poor, with four times America’s population, despite possessing the world’s second largest economy. India and scores of Third World states are much worse off.

Although the Global South’s abstention from the allied cause has caused much wailing and gnashing of teeth in Washington and Brussels, there is nothing much they can do. Moral suasion obviously is kaput. Diplomatic pressure includes no meaningful stick. Threats of sanctions inflame resentment. Bribery might help, but there is no guarantee that “friends” so procured would stay bought. And Washington already is finding it difficult to win many of the same countries to its anti-China campaign.

Consider India, long seen by the U.S. as a potential ally against Beijing. New Delhi hosted the G-20 this year, but, according to Reuters: “India does not want the G20 to discuss additional sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine during New Delhi’s one-year presidency of the bloc, six senior Indian officials said on Wednesday, amid debate over how even to describe the conflict.” It turns out that the Modi government doesn’t even want to use the word “war,” preferring “crisis” or “challenge”!

India’s relationship with Moscow runs back to the Cold War, when the U.S. backed Pakistan. Russia long has been New Delhi’s chief armorer. And India hopes a friendly Moscow might help restrain China in a future confrontation. In contrast, concern for Ukraine and interest in the West’s support for Kyiv barely register with the Modi government.

If the U.S. and Europe can ruthlessly pursue their interests, with limited concern for the impact on others, they should not be surprised when the rest of the world acts likewise. Rather than bewail the failure of the Global South to follow allied dictates, Western nations need make a stronger case for more limited action — and address their own failings. President George H.W. Bush’s “What we say goes” era really never was, and certainly is now over. The U.S. must do better promoting its interests in the future.

Why Ukrainian Refugees Are Different From Third-World Migrants - The American Spectator,"After the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, Ukrainian refugees arriving in Poland reacted with delight and even shock to the warmth of their reception. “We have everything, really everything, even too much stuff. The people here are amazing, so generous, we didn’t expect so much sympathy,” one refugee said, while another added: “It is unbelievable how much they help. They give us everything they have.” Poles were also pleasantly impressed by themselves: “I never thought we had this in us. Nobody knew we could be mobilized like this.” Another Pole said: “In this critical situation, we gathered together and, really, I don’t know anyone who is not helping.”

Nor were the Poles alone in their generous response to Ukrainian migrants. Bulgarians, Danes, Greeks, Hungarians, Italians, Moldovans, Romanians, Swiss, and others responded similarly. An early March report found that “The number of Berliners offering to help has been so great that volunteers are being turned away.” Cyprus “warmly welcomed 6,000 Ukrainian refugees and provided freezing weather so they feel at home.” Americans supported immigration from Ukraine as they had no other group since 1939 and taxpayers sent nearly $1 billion to aid refugees with housing, English language instruction, and trauma support services. Japan opened its doors to foreigners as never before.

Heartwarming as these responses are, coming from all sides of the political spectrum, they hide a subtle danger. Advocates of multiculturalism and open borders have widely seized on the Ukrainian example to argue that any less generous response to migrants from Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia constitutes racism, xenophobia, or “Islamophobia.” While little noted at this moment of intense focus on Ukrainians, after the current crisis ends and non-Western migrants return to the spotlight, that line of reasoning will certainly prominently emerge and become a force. Now is the time to prepare for the coming assault on borders and laws by recognizing the danger it poses and readying a counterargument.

“Ukrainians Always Came First”

Poland in the past year has responded very differently to two large bodies of migrants on its eastern borders.

In late 2021, an estimated 15,000 migrants, mostly from the Middle East, flew legally to Belarus where the authorities bussed them to the Polish border and encouraged or sometimes even forced them across it as a way of putting pressure on the European Union. Poles responded severely, patrolling the zone with 13,000 security personnel and deploying tear gas water cannons, drones, infrared cameras, and helicopters. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, emotionally pronounced that “This border is sacred. The border of the Polish state is not just a line on the map. Generations of Poles shed their blood for this border.” His government passed a law enabling it to ignore the asylum claims of illegal migrants and to repel them forcibly out of the country, multiple times if need be. The Polish government continues to send away would-be illegal migrants and is building a €350 million 200-kilometer-long 5½-meter-high steel wall at its Belarus border.

Just a few months later, Warsaw responded to Putin’s invasion in exactly the opposite way. On the day of the invasion itself, Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kamiński announced that “Anyone fleeing from bombs, from Russian rifles, can count on the support of the Polish state.” Although the number of Ukrainian refugees involved, over 3.5 million, is over 200 times greater than the migrants in Belarus, the Polish government and people welcomed this traumatized population and stood resolutely with them against Putin.

Indeed, the government allowed in refugees lacking papers and quickly passed legislation giving Ukrainians access to health care, education, and free rides on the state-run railways, as well as a daily allowance to Poles hosting Ukrainians in their homes. Warsaw’s population increased by nearly 20 percent in a matter of weeks, yet the city continued to function and spirits remained high. A month into the war, Poland had no refugee camps, due to an outpouring of aid from charities, businesses, individuals, and local governments.

“All those fleeing Putin’s bombs are welcome in Europe” announced President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. In an unprecedented move, the European Union activated the “temporary protection mechanism” that gives Ukrainian refugees the right to live and work for at least one and up to three years in all 27 member states, along with assurances of housing, healthcare, and education. The EU also came up with a novel way for Ukrainians to spend €300 worth of their currency, the hryvnia. Bus, train, and airline companies moved Ukrainians gratis to farther countries to relieve Ukraine’s immediate neighbors from shouldering the entire refugee burden.

Non-Westerners, however, tell a different story. Claiming to be turned out of shelters to make way for Ukrainians, an Afghan in Germany concluded that “The Ukrainians are first-class refugees and we are only second-class.” Najeeb, an interpreter formerly working for the U.S. government in Afghanistan, asked, “Ukraine’s people can go freely to European countries, but where do we flee?” The same Polish authorities who welcome Ukrainians wouldn’t even “offer us a glass of water,” protested a Syrian. Africans complained that “the Ukrainians always came first, even though we Africans would be there for days, sometimes three days with no food. Everyone was just exhausted. Any time Ukrainians came, they told us to go back [home]. They were shouting at us, ‘go back.’”

Migrant experiences in Calais, France, on the English Channel, made for an especially vivid contrast. One report found that “Hours after arriving in Calais, [a young Ukrainian mother] and her child were welcomed by British immigration officials and put on a bus headed for the United Kingdom. Years after arriving in Calais, [Ahmed, a 41-year-old man from South Sudan] remained stuck. ‘They’re European,’ Ahmed said of the Ukrainian refugees, rolling up the sleeves of his hoodie and pointing at his skin. ‘Africa — that’s different.’” The report finds that non-Europeans fill tent camps while the authorities house Ukrainians in a hostel on the beach. Another report from Calais tells of Ukrainians being welcomed by the town’s mayor and provided with free lodging and a meal of roast chicken and chocolate mousse, treats unimaginable for non-Western migrants.

“Blue Eyes and Blond Hair”

Confronted with this gap, politicians and journalists offered awkward and embarrassing explanations.

Ukraine’s former deputy chief prosecutor, David Sakvarelidze led the way with his comment that watching the situation in Ukraine is “very emotional for me because I see European people with blue eyes and blond hair being killed … every day.” Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov observed that Ukrainians “are Europeans,” adding that “These people are intelligent, they are educated people … This is not the refugee wave we have been used to, people we were not sure about their identity, people with unclear pasts, who could have been even terrorists. In other words, there is not a single European country now which is afraid of the current wave of refugees.”

Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi likewise noted a “great difference” between the Ukrainians coming to Greece and the migrants from farther away: “Ukrainian refugees are experiencing war in a country that borders the European Union,” while many other migrants enter the bloc “illegally” and “7 out of 10 [of the latter] are deemed not to be refugees” by the Greek government. A spokesman for Éric Zemmour, then a candidate for president of France, focused on excluding Muslim migrants, explained that he “differentiates between displaced European and Christian Ukrainian refugees and economic migrants from the Arab-Muslim world.”

Journalists ran with this implicit theme of European superiority:

Charlie D’Agata, a CBS News senior foreign correspondent: Kyiv “isn’t a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan, that has seen conflict raging for decades. This is a relatively civilized, relatively European – I have to choose those words carefully, too — city, one where you wouldn’t expect that, or hope that it’s going to happen.”

Daniel Hannan, a prominent British journalist: “They seem so like us. That is what makes it so shocking. Ukraine is a European country. Its people watch Netflix and have Instagram accounts, vote in free elections and read uncensored newspapers. War is no longer something visited upon impoverished and remote populations. It can happen to anyone.”

Lucy Watson, an ITV reporter: “Now the unthinkable has happened to them. And this is not a developing, third world nation; this is Europe!”

Peter Dobbie, an Al Jazeera English anchor: “What’s compelling is just looking at them, the way they’re dressed. These are prosperous … middle-class people, these are not obviously refugees trying to get away from areas in the Middle East that are still in a big state of war. These are not people trying to get away from areas in North Africa. They look like any European family that you would live next door to.”

Phillipe Corbé, a French journalist: “We’re not talking here about Syrians who flee the bombing of the Putin-backed Syrian regime, we’re talking about Europeans taking off in cars that look like our cars, to save their lives.”

Ulysse Gosset, French journalist: “We are in the 21st century, in a European city, and cruise missile are fired as though we were in Iraq or Afghanistan — imagine that!”

It bears noting that such comments made up an infinitesimal percentage of the commentary about Ukrainian refugees. Nonetheless, they stand out for their candor; how many more observers think like them but are discreet?

“Orientalist and Racist Implications”

This combination of contrasting receptions and inept explanations spurred accusations of bias, bigotry, discrimination, and “orientalism.” For example, the Washington Post hammered unrelentingly away at this point in article after article.

Abigail Hauslohner: “President Biden’s aggressive push to admit up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees has generated resentment among those clamoring for his administration to help extract the tens of thousands of Afghan citizens desperate to escape Taliban rule.”

Chico Harlan and Piotr Zakowiecki: They quote a Polish woman who asks, “Ukrainians are considered war refugees and Yemenis are considered migrants. Why? What is the difference?”

Dan Rosenzweig-Ziff et al.: “While Europe is relatively united in its desire to help Ukrainians, some have questioned why similar temporary protection was not offered to fleeing Afghans, for instance, or to assist other asylum seekers reaching Europe’s shores.”

Isaac Stanley-Becker et al: “As the scale of the crisis became clear, European leaders forged [a] political consensus absent from prior humanitarian disasters, setting aside procedures still being used to block other asylum seekers in a discrepancy shaped by race, geography and geopolitics.”

Marc Stern: “Countries [in Europe] that just a few years ago rose up in protest over the arrival of migrants fleeing wars and extremism in the Middle East and North Africa are suddenly welcoming hundreds of thousands of refugees.”

Rick Noack: “whereas prior waves of refugees and migrants faced lengthy and often unsuccessful asylum procedures, European governments have rushed to bend and suspend existing rules to host Ukrainians. While others paid smugglers to cross the Mediterranean, European railway companies have waived ticket fees for Ukrainian refugees.”

Sarah Dadouch: “People in crisis-ridden countries such as Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq have been angered by some media coverage painting the Ukrainian conflict as wholly different from the bloodshed experienced in their own countries.”

Sarah Ellison and Travis M. Andrews: They quote critics who denounce “Orientalist concepts of ‘civilization’” and “the casual racism.”

In a similar spirit, the New York Times reported that empathy for Ukrainians “was tinged with bitterness” from those Middle Easterners who saw Poles and other Westerners “taking a more compassionate stance toward the Ukrainians than they had in recent years toward Arab and Muslim migrants trying desperately to reach safety on Europe’s shores.” The Economist noted that “Many Europeans feel more comfortable welcoming large numbers of Ukrainians than they do Syrians or Afghans” and deemed racism “surely a factor” accounting for this difference.

And so it went. The Arab and Middle Eastern Journalists Association, a U.S. organization, rejected “orientalist and racist implications” that any population or country is “uncivilized,” saying these “dehumanize” non-Westerners. Moustafa Bayoumi, an American academic, bemoaned that providing refuge “based on factors such as physical proximity or skin color,” or sympathy only for those “who look like us or pray like us” reflects “narrow, ignorant nationalism.”

In Israel, the immigration and absorption minister, Pnina Tamano-Shata, who is of Ethiopian origins, called out colleagues for the “hypocrisy of white people” regarding the government’s treatment of refugees from Ukraine versus those from Ethiopia.

A Nigerian in Athens added, “I hear people say, ‘All lives matter,’ but no, they don’t all matter the same. Black lives matter less.” Ayo Sogunro, a Nigerian writer, tweeted that he “Can’t get it out of my head that Europe cried about a ‘migrant crisis’ in 2015 against 1.4m refugees fleeing war in Syria and yet quickly absorbed some 2m Ukrainians within days, complete with flags and piano music. Europe never had a migrant crisis. It has a racism crisis.”

“Everyone in Need”

Such criticisms have a clear purpose: to make Westerners feel guilty, and thereby turn the Ukrainian experience into the template for the whole world. All migrants, without exception, must be welcomed as those from Ukraine.

Thus did Qatar’s Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani thunder about Ukrainians faring better than Syrians, Palestinians, Libyans, Iraqis, and Afghans, then demand that the Ukraine crisis serve as “a wake-up call” for Middle East issues to be handled “with the same level of commitment.” President Emmanuel Macron of France made the same point more obliquely, pointing out how “This crisis reminds some around the table who showed less solidarity when the migratory pressure came from other borders of Europe that it is good Europe is totally supportive and responsible together.”

Academics like Lamis Abdelaaty of Syracuse University, a specialist on political responses to refugees, concurred. “The very welcoming response to Ukrainians is wonderful to observe. My hope is that this sort of response will be carried over to other refugee groups who are fleeing very similar situations and who are equally worthy of our compassion and our assistance. Hopefully, this moment will really lead people to critically reflect on why it is that they think some people are worthy of protection, and others are not.”

ReliefWeb, a service provided by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, immediately hailed the treatment of Ukrainian refugees as “how the international refugee protection regime should work.” In its view, countries should keep their borders open to those fleeing wars and conflict; unnecessary identity and security checks are avoided; those fleeing warfare are not penalized for arriving without valid identity and travel documents; detention measures are not used; refugees are able to freely join family members in other countries; and communities and their leaders welcome refugees with generosity and solidarity.

This sounds reasonable enough until one recalls that in UN-speak, refugee includes virtually all migrants, so its appeal refers to most anyone beyond his country’s borders.

Immigrant advocacy groups predictably jumped on this bandwagon. As the Washington Post sympathetically reported, they “applaud the more welcoming treatment of Ukrainians, yet they want to see others be granted the same degree of humanity.” Their statements repeated this same point in varying words:

Andy Hewett of the UK’s Refugee Council: “There is no difference between the risks facing Ukrainian refugees and the risks facing refugees from other conflict zones across the world. And the response from the U.K. government needs to be consistent. They can’t have an open door for one group, and at the same time, be slamming the door shut on another group.”

François Guennoc of L’Auberge des Migrants: “It is great to see all this being put in place [for Ukrainians]. But we would like everyone fleeing war to be treated like this.… A refugee is a refugee. There should be no discrimination.”

Jenny Yang of World Relief: “Without a doubt, we need to resettle large numbers of Ukrainians through various means, but I hope our commitment to Ukrainians also deepens our commitment to other groups of refugees who are in need of protection.”

Nikolai Posner of Utopia 56: the difference in reception is “goodwill versus mistreatment.”

Judith Sunderland of Human Rights Watch: the “tremendous empathy and solidarity [for Ukrainians] should stretch to everyone in need.”

Note the wording: “everyone in need.” This defines a potentially limitless group of people. Stated semantically, refugee = asylum seeker = migrant = everyone in need.

These statements signal the extent of what migrant-advocating politicians, international institutions, non-governmental organizations, intellectuals, and activists have in mind. One example: were these new rules applied to Melilla and Ceuta, two Spanish enclaves in Morocco, anyone who reaches Morocco could walk into one or other of them, be sent no questions asked and gratis to the Spanish mainland, receive financial, housing, educational, and medical benefits, and remain for years or forever.

If a faster, more efficient way exists to collapse Europe and Western civilization, I cannot think of it.

Explaining the Difference

Focusing uniquely on bias, however, ignores a multitude of reasons that explain the difference in the reception given to Ukrainian and non-Western migrants:

Refugees vs. economic migrants: Ukrainians are plainly fleeing war while non-Westerners mostly seek a better life. Ukrainians on the move primarily include females and those males under 16 or over 60 (Ukraine’s government bans males between those ages from leaving the country); non-Westerners are largely the opposite — military-age males — with precious few women, children, and elderly. In the mass migration of 2015, for example, 73 percent of the migrants were male and 42 percent were between 18 and 34. (These numbers include 17 percent migrants from Europe, so the non-Western percentage is appreciably higher.) Nor it is just demographics; that non-Westerners rarely stop in the first EU country they enter, as the Dublin Regulation requires, but keep traveling to such favored destinations as Germany and Sweden, confirms their economic motivations.

Reluctance vs. eagerness: Ukrainians leave home under duress and see their exile as emergency and temporary, not as permanent settlement. Indeed, so many of them return home that Poland on some days sees more Ukrainians leave than arrive, leading to long wait times at the border. A mother with five children in tow said: “Every European country gave us free food, free shelter. We owe them so much and are so grateful. But we want to go home.” A young woman left her grandmother in Italy, explaining that “Every day my grandmother is trying to convince us to stay, but it’s hard to live in a foreign country without our money, without work. People don’t want to be refugees. We don’t want to start a new life abroad. I want to be in my place, my country. All that we have in our lives is there.” Or, in the words of a tearful 70-year-old Ukrainian: “We want to go home. A foreign land will always be foreign. We thank everyone in different countries, but we will always want to go home. As soon as the bombing stops, we will go back.” In contrast, non-Westerners voluntarily leave their homelands, sometimes with festive send-offs, and hope to settle permanently in the West.

Proximity vs. distance: Ukrainians are geographic neighbors or near-neighbors. Their hosts may have visited Ukraine, know people there, speak a similar language, or have other links. This gives them a personal interest in Ukraine of a sort usually lacking in remote places. As the Scottish economist Adam Smith pointed out in 1817, if a humane European has no personal connections to China, he would “be willing to sacrifice the lives of a hundred millions of his brethren” in China rather than lose a finger of his own. Coming generally from further away, non-Westerners win less sympathy.

Solidarity vs. discord: Westerners share a political commonality with Ukrainians, an instant and emotional connection to the suffering of an innocent people. Kurds and Somalis may have comparable stories but these remain largely obscure to Westerners. The extreme moral ambiguity of a country like Syria exacerbates this indifference.

Invasion vs. domestic issues: The outpouring of concern for Ukrainians calls to mind a similar response to Kuwaitis’ plight in 1990-91; in each case, a bellicose larger power invaded and tried to swallow its neighbor. These cases — and possible future ones concerning Taiwan, Bahrain, or Israel — inspire far more sympathy than the more widespread problems of civil unrest and tyranny.

Self-interest vs. indifference: In Putin, the West shares an enemy with Ukraine and urgently wants him defeated before he can cause further tragedy. A Polish foreign policy specialist notes the “wide understanding that Ukrainians are fighting not only for themselves but for our goals. Putin’s aspirations don’t end in Ukraine.… If he succeeds in Ukraine, he will go farther.” While Western governments will argue for security interests in a place like Somalia or Iraq, few citizens feel much concern when countries are not democracies.

Viable skills vs. unemployability: Ukrainians have greater economic capabilities than most non-Western migrants, making them more likely to become productive members of society, and not welfare recipients. This, obviously, enhances their welcome.

Work vs. welfare: Ukrainians voiced a strong work ethic along with a sense of work’s dignity. In the simple eloquence of a 42-year-old disabled painter, “I do not want to be a burden. I want to continue earning my living, so I can contribute money to the war effort, and eventually rebuild my life in Ukraine.” Many non-Western migrants, to the contrary, prefer to live as wards of the state, in some notorious cases with multiple wives and large numbers of children.

Good citizenship vs. criminality: At the time of writing, 5.8 million Ukrainians had left their country; a diligent search through media in several languages finds not a single report of a crime wave. In contrast, the non-Western migrants have not only vastly increased the crime rates wherever they go, but they have even devised novel forms of criminality that require new names, such as grooming gangs, taharrush (mass sexual assault), and förnedringsrån (humiliation robberies).

Moderation vs. Islamism: Ukraine harbors no home-grown groups of jihadis or other Islamists. Its small Muslim population has not engaged in violence or other forms of supremacy in the name of Islam, contrary to so many Muslim migrants. (To the extent that jihad exists in Ukraine, it consists mainly of foreigners coming to battle with or against Russian forces.)

Cultural similarity vs. difference: Peoples seek those similar to themselves, making cultural proclivities a powerful force. Ukrainians share a civilization with other Westerners, from ancient Rome and the Christian religion to linguistic similarities and the Enlightenment. In contrast, many non-Westerners retain hostile attitudes toward Western civilization.

Assimilation vs. separatism: Ukrainians see themselves as similar to their neighbors, unlike many non-Western migrants, especially Muslims, who set up their own communities. Macron calls this “Islamist separatism.” Western hosts can rest assured that Ukrainians and their progeny will not burn police cars, blast out their Eastern Orthodox services over loudspeakers, march for Hamas, or behead a teacher who displayed a cartoon in class.

Limited vs unlimited numbers: Pre-invasion Ukraine had a population of 44 million; were even every Ukrainian to leave and move to (non-Russian) Europe and North America, this could readily be absorbed by a population of about 900 million. As Africa’s population grows from 1.4 billion to an estimated 4 billion in 2100, it can overwhelm and even replace Westerners.

In sum, the contrast is stark. On the one side stand the Ukrainians, a neighboring people of limited size and similar culture, language, religion, and skills fleeing an external, genocidal assault. On the other, peoples of alien cultures, alien languages, often a historically rival religion, harboring various forms of hostility, arriving in huge numbers without permission for their personal economic self-betterment despite a generally low level of skills.

Looking Ahead

This analysis leads to three conclusions. First, it is unsurprising that Western responses to Ukrainian and non-Western migrants vary as widely as do the two groups themselves and should not prompt embarrassment. Race and religion undeniably play some role in the West’s differing reactions, but multiple other factors of greater importance explain the easier acceptance of Ukrainian migrants. Rather than flagellate themselves for welcoming Ukrainians, Europeans and Americans ought to take pride in this munificence.

Second, the reception accorded Ukrainian refugees cannot become the template for all migrants from all places in all circumstances at all times. To remind, it is truly exceptional: Ukrainians can enter foreign countries without documents where, thanks to the EU’s “temporary protection mechanism,” they do not end up in refugee camps but have automatic access to housing, health care, and education. They can access free bus, train, and airline transportation. They can spend €300 worth of their home currency. Such privileges must not become the standard for all foreigners, premised on the false idea that a migrant is a migrant, and that all should be treated alike, regardless of culture, language, religion, and skills, regardless of legal status, numbers, motives, and ideology. Distinctions must continue to be made. To succumb to pressures that return Europe to its lawless immigration of 2015-16, when anyone from anywhere could enter, is to invite chaos and the collapse of Western civilization.

Third, the Ukraine crisis points to the need for thinking in terms of cultural zones, each of which accepts its own peoples. Middle Easterners and Africans generally should stay in their own regions, Europeans in theirs. What could be more natural? Middle Easterners who seek a better life can look to their Arab and Muslim brethren, not the West; and the same goes for Africans. It is as absurd for Kurds to seek refuge in Germany and Somalis in Sweden as it is for Ukrainians to seek refuge in the United Arab Emirates (which ended visa-free travel for Ukrainians days after the war started).[1] Rather, Middle Easterners can seek refuge in Saudi Arabia and other rich, stable countries. Africans can do so in Gabon or South Africa. And so on, around the world. The surge in Ukrainian refugees has revealed as no other event since World War II that the West is the natural refuge for its own peoples, not for those of the entire world.

Winter Amid Ukraine Drone War - The American Spectator,"It seems as though the only people who aren’t bored with the war in Ukraine are the Russians and the Ukrainians. Too many Americans don’t understand that wars aren’t entertainment.

The European Union is trying to convince itself that it can put a price cap on Russian oil by prohibiting insurers from writing insurance for oil cargoes that exceed the price. Russia, and its oil buyers such as China, have ships that can sail without Lloyds of London’s coverage.

All that means is that if the EU doesn’t buy Russia’s oil (and gas, which is nearly cut off thanks to the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines) the EU will have a very cold winter because it has, for decades, been dumb enough to become dependent on Russian oil and gas supplies.

Here in the States, we have a number of idiots, such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who pretend to be conservatives and who insist that we shouldn’t send any more aid to Ukraine. Isolationists, as I have explained before, aren’t conservatives. This particular bunch doesn’t understand that Ukraine is fighting a war that is consuming Russia’s military forces and proportionately diminishing Russia’s threat to the West. Continued support for Ukraine is in our national security interest. Cutting off that support is in Russia’s interest.

Back in the real world, Ukraine is still fighting for its freedom at an enormous cost. But Russia is paying a high price, too. According to a recent report by the Kyiv Independent, Ukraine claims that more than 90,000 Russian soldiers have been killed there. The cost to Ukraine, in civilian and military lives, must be higher.

There hasn’t been a real prospect for peace in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has indicated as recently as Friday that he would consider some arrangement that recognizes — i.e., surrenders — the lands in Ukraine’s east that Russia falsely annexed over the past 10 months.

President Joe Biden has said he’d negotiate peace but only if the Russian forces withdrew first. Biden’s supposed forcefulness is, as usual, undercut by his cabinet. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has admitted to negotiations with Russia out of fear it might use nuclear weapons.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky demands that Russia withdraw entirely from Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia seized and then annexed in 2014. He has to say that because anything else would amount to surrender.

And now winter is here. In Kyiv and Mariupol — two cities almost at opposite ends of Ukraine — the average high in January will be 30 degrees Fahrenheit and the average low will be 20 degrees Fahrenheit. It’s going to be a long, cold winter in which the war will probably slow and adapt to the weather.

Part of that adaptation will probably be the increased use of drone aircraft (UAVs), unmanned surface vessels (USVs), and submarine drones (UUVs).

The Russians are reportedly bombing, shelling, and attacking every bit of Ukraine’s electrical grid that they can locate with UAVs. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has been crippled, as have been many other generation plants and transmission stations. Putin means to kill Ukrainian civilians by freezing them.

The Russians are reportedly running out of the Iranian “suicide drones” that they have been using to knock out power plants. They may also be running short on artillery shells and aerial bombs.

According to a Nov. 22 U.K. intelligence release, Russia has launched hundreds of armed UAVs — including Iranian “suicide drones” — since September and most of the UAVs have been neutralized. No “suicide drone” attacks have, according to that report, occurred since Nov. 17, indicating that Russian supplies of cruise missiles and suicide drones have run out. The report also said that Russia can procure more from overseas sources — presumably Iran and North Korea — faster than they can produce more themselves.

U.S. arms stockpiles are also running low. The Pentagon is finding contractors willing to produce more systems and ammunition for them, but resuming production will take time and a lot of money. Other NATO nations, which have been far slower in providing arms to Ukraine — other than the U.K. — seem unable or unwilling to spend much to help Ukraine.

Since Ukrainian missiles sank the Moskva, the flagship of the Russian Black Sea fleet, in April, that fleet has effectively been neutralized in fear of attacks on its ships. (READ MORE from Jed Babbin: Sinking the Moskva)

The Russians seem unable to deal with Ukraine’s USVs and UUVs, which are being used to attack Russian ships and shore facilities. Reports indicate that nine Ukrainian UAVs and seven USVs — and possibly British-built UUVs — struck the Sevastopol naval base on Oct. 29, causing an unknown amount of damage to Russian ships, including at least one frigate. The Russians claim to have destroyed four USVs.

A previous USV attack on Oct. 18 was on the Russian naval base and oil terminal at Novorossiysk. It apparently caused little damage. The Novorossiysk base on the Black Sea was previously thought to be out of the range of Ukrainian weapons. The Russians are trying to build an effective defense against the Ukrainian drones. Their technology, according to one expert I spoke to, isn’t close to being able to deal with USVs, UUVs, and UAVs, especially at the same time.

The boldness of these Ukrainian attacks on Russia’s surface fleet and naval bases is another huge setback for Russia, adding to the effects of Ukrainian army forces driving Russians out of Kherson and other areas the Russians claim to have annexed. What the Russians are hoping for is to take advantage of the West’s tiredness and lack of resolve to force a “land for peace” deal with Ukraine.

As this column has repeatedly said, any land for peace deal would only delay — not deter or end — Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. There won’t be peace in Ukraine unless one side is convinced it is going to lose the war. It is up to us to support Ukraine while it fights for freedom and whittles away at Russia’s military power.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/ukraine-under-assault/,2022-12-06
