An Open Call for Commentary on China - The American Spectator,"I’ve always had a fascination with the interaction between the U.S. and Chinese economies, but my understanding has its limits. As I read article after article commenting on how perilously perched on the Chinese our economy has become, I can’t help but wonder, isn’t that the point of free markets? To encounter this sort of danger?

But then again, isn’t this threat the result of a state-controlled currency (to use a Ron Paul-ism, unsound money)? But doesn’t this risk allow us to reach greater economic heights?

I have little understanding of economics, but those in the know, please fill my comment thread. I’ll salvage the thoughtful and insightful comments for readers.",https://spectator.org/11994_open-call-commentary-china/,2008-01-28
Re: China Commentary - The American Spectator,"Here’s some unconventional wisdom, J.P. The way I see it, the free market bargain falls apart — stops being rational — if the Chinese are able to liberalize their markets strongly enough to fully participate in the international market without liberalizing their politics. The best way to do this, in my analysis, is to delink social policy from political policy.

How? China can grow progressively more ‘permissive’ when it comes to ‘personal freedoms’ by transfering the goods of that permissiveness away from the incentive structure of a liberal political system and into the incentive structure of a liberal economic system. If they succeed — and I strongly suggest that they’ve started to already — the Chinese will change the rational calculus that goes into the market theory of liberalization. Why trade with partners that will remain political opponents indefinitely? Why invest trust and risk into a trade regime they dominate? China will also be able to take away the use of markets as an American pressure point on domestic political liberty (democratization, Tibet, human rights).

None of this augurs particularly well for the US, but it all hinges on the ability of China to become what I’ve called elsewhere a pink police state — a politically despotic regime that grants its subjects broader and deeper access to pleasure-related economic and social goods in exchange for letting its absolute rule go absolutely unchallenged.",https://spectator.org/11999_re-china-commentary/,2008-01-28

China Launches Scud Missile at U.S. Economy - The American Spectator,"Metaphorically, of course. After suggesting that the U.S. needed to do more to prove the security of the bonds being held by Beijing, China now has taken aim at the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency. Reports the New York Times:

In another indication that China is growing increasingly concerned about holding huge dollar reserves, the head of its central bank has called for the eventual creation of a new international currency reserve to replace the dollar.

In a paper released Monday, Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People’s Bank of China, said a new currency reserve system controlled by the International Monetary Fund could prove more stable and economically viable.

A new system is necessary, he said, because the global economic crisis has revealed the “inherent vulnerabilities and systemic risks in the existing international monetary system.”

While few analysts believe that the dollar will be replaced as the world’s dominant foreign exchange reserve anytime soon, the proposal suggests that China is preparing to assume a more influential role in the world. Russia recently made a similar proposal.

China’s bold idea, released more than a week before world leaders are to gather in London for an economic summit meeting, also indicates that Beijing is worried that its huge dollar-denominated foreign reserves could lose significant value in coming years.

China has the world’s largest foreign exchange reserves, valued at nearly $2 trillion, with more than half of those holdings estimated to be made up of United States Treasuries and other dollar-denominated bonds.",https://spectator.org/17991_china-seeks-its-pound-flesh/,2009-03-24

China Military Power - 2006 - The American Spectator,"DoD sent the new report on Chinese Military Power to the Hill today. (The best report on it is in WSJ). It’s much like last year’s (see Showdown for the full discussion) but has a few new items of considerable significance.

One of the points I’ve been arguing is that we can derive China’s intents from the capabilities it is acquiring in its hell-for-leather military buildup. The new report contains as direct a proof as I could imagine. Here’s the money quote from Lt. Gen. Liu Yazhou, deputy political commissar of the PLA Air Force:

“When a nation grows strong enough, it practices hegemony. The sole purpose of power is to pursue even greater power…Geography is destiny…when a country begins to rise, it should first set itself in an invincible position.”

"Good for China, Good for the World? - The American Spectator","Last month, the People’s Republic of China celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of its brutal and inhumane one-child policy. Human rights groups have documented the widespread abuses of forced abortions and sterilizations, and in several provinces authorities have even been known to monitor women’s menstrual cycles and contraceptive use.

Yet, as the Copenhagen conference on climate change has captured much of the world’s attention these last few weeks, we have heard increasing and increasingly troubling calls for Chinese-style population control measures to be adopted by the rest of the world.

In fact, human rights groups and scholars have been calling attention to the widespread suffering of Chinese women for at least two decades. Despite such revelations, the Obama administration asked for $50 million to fund the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the organization whose cooperation in this monstrous policy earned its defunding by the Bush administration. Last weekend’s massive omnibus spending bill actually added an additional $5 million for the UNFPA, for a total of $55 million, and another $648.5 million for international “family planning” programs.

Even more incredibly, Zhao Baige, vice-minister of China’s National Population and Family Planning Commission, was warmly received in Copenhagen when she claimed that her nation’s population control program had resulted in 400 million fewer births.

Read that again. Four hundred million human beings are not alive today because of the aggressive abortion and contraception regime in the world’s most populous country. That is almost 25% more than the entire population of the United States!

The impact of this draconian program is felt far beyond the violence inflicted on millions of individual women. It is also grossly deforming China’s population pyramid, with increasingly drastic results.

In 1970, the average Chinese person was only 19.7 years old. In just forty years, the average age of the Chinese population has nearly doubled to its current 34 years. This trend will continue to accelerate, and, by the year 2050, the average Chinese person will be 51 years old.

Currently, every 100 people of working age in China support thirteen retired people. By 2050, the same 100 workers will be supporting 46 retirees. More than fifteen percent of the Chinese population is aged 60 or older now, and the government is already defaulting on pension payments and struggling to keep up with medical coverage for the elderly, causing protests by retirees across the country over the past several years. The Chinese economy is also beginning to falter due to a shortage of workers, and many factories cannot fill the jobs they need to continue functioning.

As always, the children will bear the consequences of their government’s bad decisions. Because each couple is only allowed one child, in many cases that child may eventually have to support six elderly people — two parents and two sets of grandparents.

Significantly, hundreds of Chinese schools are closing annually, because the number of babies born in the country has declined more than 30 percent over the past two decades. In response to the growing number of elderly, savvy entrepreneurs are converting these schools into old people’s homes.

The demographic problem is exacerbated by the fact that, since 1985, nearly fifty million more girls than boys have been aborted before birth and murdered shortly after birth due to the propensity of the Chinese, like the people of many developing countries, to value boys more. This has led to a huge excess of unmarried men, which in turn has caused a huge upswing in what the Chinese delicately call “hooliganism.”

Many people are utterly blind to both the inhumane and coercive nature of the Chinese population control program and its dreadful and worsening demographic effects. Despite the fact that the Chinese themselves are acutely aware of its problems, they are recommending that their policies be exported to the rest of the world in order to mitigate “climate change.”

Earlier this month, Diane Francis, writing for Canada’s leading newspaper the National Post, asserted that “The whole world needs to adopt China’s one-child policy.… A planetary law, such as China’s one-child policy, is the only way to reverse the disastrous global birthrate currently, which is one million births every four days.”

Francis is grossly exaggerating her numbers of course, as most population control advocates are in the habit of doing. Her hypocrisy — she has one more child than she proposes the rest of the world be allowed to have — is also a common trait of those who, if left unchallenged, would control every aspect of people’s lives.

That such views are now commonplace among the elites meeting in Copenhagen should trouble us greatly. These Controllers ignore unprecedented and troubling demographic trends in their relentless and thoughtless drive to winnow out the most helpless of human beings for the supposed benefit of the rest of us. This “benefit” is to take the form of more sustainable population levels, the failure of which to achieve will surely have disastrous consequences for the world and its inhabitants. And when the science that is supposed to demonstrate the certainty of this inevitable environmental and human catastrophe is called into question, as it has been with the recent “Climategate” scandal, the Controllers only shout louder about the need to do something!

We now know what this “something” is: both economically debilitating transfers of wealth from functioning economies to dysfunctional ones, and finding ways to eliminate as many inconvenient children — that is, other people’s children — as possible.

For decades, many have wondered why these elites have been reticent regarding programs we thought they would never tolerate in North America and Europe. Some have even been called racists for supporting the elimination of millions of Asian and African babies while demanding “reproductive freedom” for white women.

It is not that they are racist. That is, they do not just hate people of color — they may actually hate humanity itself.",https://spectator.org/21028_difference-between-us-and-china/,2009-12-18
China's Balance Sheet - The American Spectator,"While the petulant remarks of Russia’s PM Vladimir Putin blaming the United States for the global financial crisis drew the most attention at the annual World Economic Forum last week, it was Wen Jiabao, Prime Minister of China, whose statement and subsequent European trip carried the most economic and political weight. Stung by the criticism of then Secretary of the Treasury-designate Timothy Geithner’s written response to a Senate committee question that the Chinese Government manipulated the value of the “renminbi,” PM Wen launched a sharp counterattack.

Wen lectured that the West had allowed its financial institutions to be not properly restrained and that this had brought about a broad economic culture of “low savings and high consumption” (his words). It was quite obvious that Geithner’s attack on China’s policy of high savings and convenient currency valuation had hit a very sore spot in the Chinese official psyche.

The American treasury secretary’s objection is very simple. The Beijing government, he says, purposely has kept the official value of their currency from 15 to 40% below what would be a free exchange rate. On top of that, the Chinese bureaucracy has encouraged a program of both private and official savings to such an extent that it runs counter to a modern state’s responsibility to seek participation in a regime of a fair balance of trade. China reportedly has foreign currency reserves of $2 trillion.

The Chinese exporters are said to sell their goods at artificially low prices, thus enabling them to outbid American and other Western firms. The charge of excessive savings is a bit harder to evaluate for it is based on very different philosophies of private, corporate and governmental wealth accrual.

The Chinese view credit as a short-term device and credit debt as something that always should be restrained. The Western view is that credit is part and parcel of economic life and that credit debt is — or should be — related to an “acceptable” percentage of gross domestic product in the national case or income and savings/liquid assets in the personal.

The fact is that the Chinese system has enabled the U.S. to pursue its predilection for growth through borrowing, at least in regard to the Chinese government purchase of U.S. Treasury securities. The Chinese now hold approximately $700 billion in marketable and non-marketable American bills, bonds and notes. Interestingly, that amount is $200 billion more than it was in January ’08. The current figure can be compared to the approximate $2.4 trillion of U.S. paper held by all the rest of the world’s nations combined.

While the purchase of U.S. government securities by China clearly has made a considerable amount of capital available to the U.S. Treasury, there are many American officials and academics who now place a portion of the blame for the current economic crisis on Beijing’s appetite for increasing its holdings invested in the United States and other Western debt markets.

Obviously the Chinese are unapologetic for their actions and consider the U.S. quite churlish in this complaint. To charge the Chinese with anything less than prudent financial management is perceived by Beijing to be the height of economic jealousy, to say nothing of capitalistic sour grapes.

The fact is that China, like other Asian nations, is built for export. Of course it cannot count indefinitely on the seemingly insatiable demand for its products to continue. Eventually China will have to turn inward and increase its domestic consumption. To accomplish this it will have to make credit far more available to its private sector. This is what Washington — clearly not the best example of running a free market economy — is pushing so hard for Beijing to do.

The Chinese point to an intent to spend about $600 billion over the next two years as part of their own economic stimulus program. Their objective is to maintain growth at over 8% a year. Central planning in Beijing apparently views a high growth rate as required to preserve socio-economic order without resorting to the US/UK model of building consumer spending on the “never-never,” the popular British term for credit dependency.

As annoying as Tim Geithner’s remarks about China’s currency manipulations may have been, the truth is that China eventually will have to invest more of its ample savings in itself, build a legitimate self-sustaining economy, and accept its products competing internationally at fair market value. Protectionism doesn’t work for long in any form in a globalized world. This is something that must be remembered by Washington as well as Beijing.",https://spectator.org/2168_china-mix/,2009-02-06
China's Long March on Human Rights - The American Spectator,"Despite Beijing’s promise that this summer’s Olympic Games would lead the People’s Republic of China to better live up to its name, the human rights situation has deteriorated. Freedom House warns that the recent crackdown in Tibet “is part of a larger pattern of government repression as the Olympics approach.”

The organization points to “Harassment and detention of human rights defenders,” including several activists who were advocating that the PRC improve its behavior. The Beijing government also has tightened its already stringent web controls. Human rights activist Hu Jia was put on trial for alleged subversion because of his Internet writings.

Moreover, Freedom House reports, “Increased restrictions on private religious practice,” particularly evangelical house churches. The organization rates China as “Not Free” with a bottom-scoring 7 in political rights and near bottom rating of 6 in civil liberties.

The bad news is obvious. But there is good news, hard as that might seem to believe. We should remember what China was like when it really was Communist China.

Jean-Louis Margolin of the University of Provence wrote in The Black Book of Communism that, even excluding casualties from the country’s civil war, “it is clear that there were between 6 million and 10 million deaths as a direct result of the Communist actions, including hundreds of thousands of Tibetans. In addition, tens of millions of ‘counterrevolutionaries’ passed long periods of their lives inside the prison system, with perhaps 20 million dying there. To that total should be added the staggering number of deaths during the ill-named Great Leap Forward — estimates range from 20 million to 43 million dead for the years 1959-1961 — all victims of a famine caused by the misguided projects of a single man, Mao Zedong, and his criminal obstinacy in refusing to admit his mistake and to allow measures to be taken to rectify the disastrous effects.”

Today’s China is not Mao Zedong’s China. The deaths in the recent Tibet crackdown as well as the crushing of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, while horrid and tragic, were of a very different magnitude.

This year’s Olympics will not be a replay of the 1936 Berlin Games, because the PRC is not Nazi Germany. Perversely, China’s latest repressions reveal a country far freer than two decades ago.

THAT PROGRESS DOESN’T, however, mean the West should be complacent about Beijing’s human rights practices or hosting of the Games or have any illusions about just how bad things are.

True, the State Department recently removed the PRC from the list of the top ten human rights abusers, but only because Chinese officials have agreed to a dialogue over their practices. Thankfully, the Department didn’t pull any other punches, which makes its latest survey depressing reading indeed.

We read, for starters, that the PRC’s “overall human rights record remained poor.” Jonathan Farrar, acting assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights, and labor, explained at a press conference that in China “the democratic political reform has not kept pace” with the economic changes.

That’s putting it mildly. Some of the “serious human rights abuses” detailed in the Report include “extrajudicial killings, torture, and coerced confessions of prisoners, and the use of forced labor, including prison labor. The government continued to monitor, harass, detain, arrest, and imprison journalists, writers, activists, and defense lawyers and their families, many of whom were seeking to exercise their rights under law.”

The courts remain under government control, with little due process. Religious liberty is restricted. Moreover, “The government continued its coercive birth limitation policy, in some cases resulting in forced abortion and sterilization.”

The State Department assessment spends 37 pages detailing Chinese misbehavior. The starting point is the failure to respect “the integrity of the Person.” According to the Department, with or without trial, some Chinese are subjected to the “arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life.”

Activists, ranging from human rights campaigners to angry farmers, sometimes just disappear. Those imprisoned often face “torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment,” including sexual abuse.

The government routinely uses house arrest as a “nonjudicial punishment and control measure against dissidents, former political prisoners, family members of political prisoners, petitioners, underground religious figures, and others it deemed politically sensitive.”

Although the authorities claim to hold no political prisoners, the State Department finds that claim laughable. The Report explains, “Tens of thousands of political prisoners remained incarcerated, some in prisons and others in reeducation-through-labor camps or administrative detention.”

Naturally, the government monitors all forms of communication and “generally did not respect” the free speech rights of citizens, academic freedom at universities, or right of association by most anyone — and insists on strict controls on the Internet.

Political freedoms also are de minimis. Village elections are allowed, but do not undermine the iron grip of China’s one-party state. “Corruption remained an endemic problem,” notes the Department, which “plagued courts, law enforcement agencies, and other government agencies.”

Moreover, “in practice workers were not free to organize or join unions of their own choosing.” Collective bargaining exists in theory rather than in reality; there is no legally-guaranteed right to strike.

Chinese rule is particularly harsh in Tibet, which helps explain the recent unrest. In contrast, Beijing largely respected the rights of residents of Hong Kong and Macau, though neither territory has implemented robust democratic rule.

THIS IS A RECORD that has gone from worse to bad. That the PRC has escaped its former Maoist madness is laudable but the country’s present condition is disappointing and tragic and doesn’t have to remain that way.

The PRC’s current repressive condition presents two challenges: one for China’s elites and one for the rest of the world.

China’s rulers have yet to learn that a government has no more fundamental duty than to respect the lives and liberties of its citizens. The issue goes beyond basic morality. If China aspires to global leadership — and it does — then it will have to demonstrate that it is worthy of the world’s trust. That will occur only when the PRC acts in the interests of the Chinese people rather Communist Party apparatchiks.

Many people in the West look at the suffering of the Chinese people and advocate all kinds of actions by our governments: from a boycott of the Olympics to economic sanctions to treating China as an enemy. These “solutions” range from the merely bad to the truly awful, but they also miss the most important point.

The most effective thing Washington can do about China’s human rights atrocities is to publicize them, as through the latest State Department report. Citizens of the West can act too. We can organizing letter-writing campaigns, protests, and boycotts; refuse to shut up about Chinese misbehavior; and counter brutal repression by denying it the shelter of euphemism.

The Olympic Games and assorted celebrations should be used as an opportunity to highlight human rights violations. And those going to the Olympics should look at their time there as an opportunity to meet Chinese citizens and tell them the truth about Western freedoms, in the great hope that these will one day be Chinese freedoms as well.",https://spectator.org/34167_chinas-next-decade/,2008-03-26
China's No. 1 - The American Spectator,"“Secure property in hand leads to peace in mind,” said Mencius, an ancient Chinese philosopher, when asked how to manage a country.

The central government of China, facing a daunting task of building a harmonious society and developing the country in a balanced way, issued the No. 1 Central Document, its first major policy directive of the year, on the eve of the New Chinese Year. The document is unprecedented in its concern for land rights, and the degree of detail it devotes to specific mandates to protect the land rights of the 700 million rural Chinese.

This document is Beijing’s strongest response yet to the disturbing fact that farmers’ individual land rights remain insecure a quarter-century after the breakup of the collective farms, discouraging investment in land improvements and facilitating rampant land expropriations and irresponsible urban development.

Insecurity of farmers’ land rights slows agricultural development and greatly affects farmers’ peace of mind. In the first nine months of 2006, 17,000 cases of “massive rural incidents” (often violent protests) were officially reported, involving about 400,000 farmers. Land grievances were their top complaint.

With the widening gap between rural and urban development, more than 200 million farmers have migrated to cities, especially to developed coastal areas, seeking a better livelihood. Still other forms of upheaval result from this growing “floating population,” as just witnessed in the toxic combination of natural disaster and transportation paralysis.

For the most part, the central government is actually not to blame for farmers’ insecurity and a lagging agricultural sector. A series of national laws have been adopted to strengthen farmers’ land rights since the 1990s.

The problem lies with local implementation: farmers’ land rights are illegally “readjusted” away based on household population changes, reassigned to “outside developers,” or taken by the cadres and sold for enormous profit to non-agricultural users. In a kind of double whammy, local governments exercise virtually unfettered power to expropriate farmlands for urban biased development, with grossly insufficient compensation to the farmers.

AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, most of the tremendous wealth generated by China’s reforms over the past three decades has not flowed into the countryside. The official rural-urban income ratio has worsened to 1:3.28, even without considering many social benefits available only in cities. Without secure property rights that would encourage them to make long-term and productivity-enhancing investments in land, many farmers choose working in developed cities.

One does not need to look far for counter-examples: after Japan, South Korea and Taiwan completed their post-war land reforms and ensured the security of farmers’ land rights. Their rural economies roared ahead, resulting in a prosperous countryside that has helped moderate mass migration to cities, spreading it over two or more generations.

The 2008 Central Document now sends a powerful signal of change, assuring farmers’ land rights in an unusually extensive and forceful way. Highlights include:

* Local governments and collective cadres must strictly implement legal rules on prohibiting readjustment and taking-back of farmers’ land rights for selling them to non-villager developers.

* No land expropriations by local governments will be approved unless and until all procedural safeguards are satisfied, compensation is deemed adequate and fully delivered to the hands of affected farmers, and a social security safety-net is in place.

* Land rights certificates, which are the ultimate proof and documentation of land rights, must be issued to every farm household.

* For the first time, the Central Document calls for establishing a rural land rights registration system that provides further assurance and security to farmers.

THE IMPLEMENTATION of these policies will meet considerable local resistance, and it will require determination and ingenuity to pull it off. Beijing will have to put teeth in the policy. Political careers of local officials should be tied closely with their implementation of these pro-farmer initiatives. Serious consequences should be imposed, including removal from official posts, fines, civil or even criminal liabilities.

Last summer, several Ministries launched a joint campaign to inspect and rectify rural land violations. More than a thousand local officials were sanctioned over a three-month period as a result.

There should also be independent and comprehensive monitoring of local progress. Relying on self-reports from local governments on matters like this has been proven grossly inadequate. Sending independent inspection teams to the field will generate essential first-hand information, but it is not practical to have inspection teams everywhere.

The World Bank, my colleagues and I at the Rural Development Institute, and others have applied another useful approach to such monitoring of farmers’ land rights — including large-scale sample surveys — over the past decade. A further option is to create channels, such as telephone hotlines, by which farmers can instantly report violations as they occur. News media and grassroots NGOs should be encouraged to monitor and report freely.

Finally, in the medium term, an accessible and reasonably independent judicial system needs to be established along with legal aid services for farmers. Local courts can hardly serve as an impartial forum to address farmers’ complaints at present, because they are largely appointed and funded by local governments that are often the wrongdoers in land disputes. This link must be severed.

Meanwhile, legal professionals should be encouraged to provide independent legal aid services to aggrieved farmers, to at least partially mitigate the present judicial failure.

The clear implication of this powerful new document is that Beijing finally means business on securing land rights in farmers’ hands. Grassroots development and “peace in mind” should follow.

China's South America - The American Spectator,"Americans are suffering a new psychological disorder: news-induced political numbness. It’s not the return of Jimmy Carter’s “malaise.” Despite the steady stream of Congressional absurdities and conservatives’ growing impatience with the president, we’re doing pretty well for a nation at war. But the incessant 24/7 television-newspaper-Internet barrage has caused people to tune the world out instead of reserving energy to think about the events that must be the focus of our attention. All of us, especially the White House, desperately want a break to rest and recuperate. But that’s not an option. Times are tough, and we just have to keep going.

Our economy is booming, but each of us — and every business — is suffering from the high cost of gasoline. We’re suffering the results the enviro-whackos have imposed, without a new oil refinery or nuclear power plant in decades, without offshore drilling, and without opening the Alaskan National Wildlife Reserve to oil exploration. But offshore drilling there will be, because Cuba has agreed to Chinese oil and gas drilling in the Florida Strait. Just about fifty miles off Key West, China will be doing what American companies can’t. It’s all part of a larger plan by the self-styled Simon Bolivar of the 21st century, Hugo Chavez. If we don’t start interfering with Hugo Chavez’s plans, we might as well sell our cars and buy bicycles.

None of the worst in the Western Hemisphere — from Vicente Fox to Nicaragua’s Danny Ortega now starring in Nicaragua’s Sandinista Revival — seem bad enough to be worthy of a disparaging word or two from the White House. Chavez is emboldened by the lack of response. Chavez recently visited Iran to stand with the mullahs and warn that oil shipments — we get about 18 percent of our oil from Venezuela — would be interrupted if America hits the Iranian nuclear facilities. He’s done everything he can think of to provoke us, from replacing the Soviet Union as Castro’s bankroller to allying himself with China. He’s working hard to create a “Bolivarian axis” of anti-American governments in Central and South America, and China is the immediate beneficiary.

A few weeks ago, Chavez met with his hero, Castro, and the newly elected Evo Morales of Bolivia to talk about how they can combine their influence to America’s disadvantage. Chavez, for all his crude bluster, is neither ignorant nor lacking in savvy. He knows that China is the number two oil importer in the world, and that the Hu Jintao government is pressing every advantage it can find to tie up oil supplies around the world. And, he knows, China periodically tests American resolve. The last time China engaged in such a test, an American Navy EP-3 Orion was forced down on Hainan Island and the crew held hostage for a week to China’s demand for an apology from President Bush. With Chavez’s and Castro’s help, China is testing Mr. Bush again.

Our offshore oil drilling is stuck somewhere in the late 1960s. Since then nary a new well has been drilled, and not a new refinery built. Under contract with Castro, the Chinese government will be drilling for oil and gas in the Florida Straits as well as northwest of Cuba in the Gulf of Mexico.

Cuba has the right to sell oil drilling rights in its waters and China has the right to buy them just as much as it has the right to agree with India on oil exploration and to build refineries in Indonesia or, for that matter, in Venezuela. But here we have to draw a line, and make clear to both China and Chavez that the line cannot be crossed.

The Saudis made oil a weapon in their 1973 oil embargo. Chavez is fond of threatening us with cutting off oil shipments suddenly. To do so now would do what the Saudis tried to do: to so damage our economy that we would surrender our allies or our interests. China or Iran could easily tie a Venezuelan decision to ship the oil meant for America to China with military or terrorist action elsewhere. Chavez and his allies in Iran and China should be made to understand that if oil is used as a weapon, the response we make will be with every other weapon — military or economic — we choose in response to such an attack.

Chavez’s aggressive anti-Americanism and growing military power is losing him many likely allies. Peru, Mexico and others in the area are very nervous about his ambitions, and that we can use to advantage. Central and South America aren’t our protectorates, but we can — and should — increase our trade and military assistance to Venezuela’s neighbors. Chavez should be told in plain terms that, after Castro, Cuba will be made free one way or the other and that any Venezuelan interference would be met with force.

The second answer to Chavez’s ambitions has to be directed to his newfound allies in Iran and China. They must be made to understand that the Monroe Doctrine is still in effect, and we have a new derivation of the action it entitles us to. Call it the Commercial Corollary.

Those who engage in trade with Venezuela should be free to do so only as long as they limit their activities to commercial trade. Those who — such as China — often insert military personnel in commercial activities will not be permitted to do so in Venezuela or anywhere else in the hemisphere. We should be looking closely at China’s operations in the Panama Canal Zone.

Castro has, for decades, welcomed terrorists of many stripes into Cuba. The Irish Republican Army, at the height of its terrorist activities, had a base in Havana that helped arm and train terrorists throughout the northern half of South America. Should terrorist bases arise in Venezuela, or if Iran or China choose to use it as a base of operations overtly or covertly, we will forcibly end their presence there.

Mr. Chavez should take less comfort from the oil weapon he believes protects him from American response. Should he choose suddenly to cut off the oil he supplies to us, our economy would suffer tremendous damage. His provocations of America have, so far, not been responded to in kind. That will not always be the case.

Obama Cyberwar Memo Leaked Ahead of China Summit - The American Spectator,"With his third major scoop in as many days, The Guardian’s Glenn Greenwald reports that the president has aggressively solicited targets for cyber-attack from his intelligence chiefs in an effort to advance American interests worldwide:

Barack Obama has ordered his senior national security and intelligence officials to draw up a list of potential overseas targets for US cyber-attacks, a top secret presidential directive obtained by the Guardian reveals.

The 18-page Presidential Policy Directive 20, issued in October last year but never published, states that what it calls Offensive Cyber Effects Operations (OCEO) “can offer unique and unconventional capabilities to advance US national objectives around the world with little or no warning to the adversary or target and with potential effects ranging from subtle to severely damaging”. …

The directive’s publication comes as the president plans to confront his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at a summit in California on Friday over alleged Chinese attacks on western targets.

Even before the publication of the directive, Beijing had hit back against US criticism, with a senior official claiming to have “mountains of data” on American cyber-attacks he claimed were every bit as serious as those China was accused of having carried out against the US.",https://spectator.org/40499_china-wins/,2013-06-07
China's War on Netizens - The American Spectator,"Deng Xiaopeng, reformist leader of the Chinese Communist Party at the end of the 20th century, justified Internet censorship with a famous metaphor: “If you open the window for fresh air, you have to expect some flies to blow in.”

The Chinese government believes that these dissenting, web-based “flies” are poised to upset the political and social stability of the country, as demonstrated by web activism during the Arab Spring. This fear has led to a myriad of regulations resulting in the blocking of websites, the monitoring of citizens’ internet access, and the policing of blog content.

In 2000, the Ministry of Public Security initiated the Golden Shield Project to strike a balance between gaining economic benefits from the information age and shielding its citizens from the seeds of discord. The result: China has the most sophisticated Internet censorship program in the world, and has imprisoned the largest number of cyber-dissidents of any country.

This week, China’s highest court released the rules for punishing online slander. Messages forwarded more than 500 times or read more than 5,000 times can earn the offender up to three years in prison. In order to combat “malicious rumor-mongering,” the police have detained hundreds of microbloggers for spreading false claims.

The Chinese government employs an internet police force of more than 30,000 people, according to The Guardian. Under the purview of the propaganda department, these workers are tasked with anonymously guiding discussion on public bulletin boards.

Yet China’s internet policing apparatus is tenuous. In July, the crash of a high-speed train in China lead to a burst of Internet usage that overloaded the government controls. This year, the number of Internet users in China surpassed the 100 million mark. Judging by this, it is likely that China’s perception of Internet control is only skin deep, or should we say “screen deep.”

Netizens are the latest victims of heavy-handed central planning—this Marxist tendency to draw arbitrary lines as tiny corrections to market uncertainty.

The Trouble in China Should Be of Little Moment to Us - The American Spectator,"Hmm. Time to put on my economist’s hat again.

There is a worldwide turmoil about a slowdown in the Chinese economy. Because of noticeably tepid growth in manufacturing in the People’s Republic, there has been a dramatic, even phenomenal drop in the Shanghai Market. Twice in one week it dropped so far so fast that the circuit breakers put in to prevent a total wipeout popped and closed the markets early. On one day they closed within half an hour of opening on a tidal wave of selling.

The U.S. stock markets, in some weird sympathy with China, also went down fast, although nowhere near as much as China, but still by a whopping six plus percent in just one week.

The newspapers and Internet are filled with gloomy tidings, but do they make sense?

I cannot predict the short term movements of markets and I don’t pretend to be able to. But I can count, and this is what I count.

United States exports to the PRC are roughly $125 billion per annum. That sounds like a lot but the total output of the U.S. economy is roughly $18 TRILLION. That means U.S. exports to China are far less than one percent of GDP. But it gets much better.

No one thinks all of our exports to China will stop. If things got truly terrible, exports might fall by 20 percent to roughly $100 billion. That would be a matter of a change of about $25 billion or roughly one tenth of one percent. That is far less than a rounding error in tallying national output. This is a blip compared with any decent-sized business sector in this country. It is just nothing. But it’s made U.S. markets lose roughly $1.5 trillion in value.

Now, there may be other factors at work here. Maybe wealthy Chinese are selling U.S. stocks to raise money to cover debts in China. Or something else.

But I know stock market traders and if there is one thing they love, it’s fear. Fear lets them sell short. Fear lets them pile on in the sell side with all kinds of clever trades. If they can get the media to help them sell fear, all the better for them.

And, again, I may have missed something. I often do. But from my little vantage point in rainy California what I see is that a big thing in China realistically might not account for a lot in the USA. Again, I may have missed some secret sauce here, but I see mainly traders feasting like vultures on fear that may be justified in Shanghai but might not mean much in St. Louis. Our economy is strong and if it falls, it won’t be because of trouble in China.

Fear makes for bad digestion. Maybe just have a milkshake and watch a movie and forget about China for today.",https://spectator.org/42186_chinas-balance-sheet/,2016-01-08

Paulson on China's Gradualism - The American Spectator,"Earlier today, I attended a speech and Q&A held at the Heritage Foundation featuring Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who focused on ongoing economic talks between the U.S. and China. Much of his discussion revolved around currency valuation and intellectual property rights, with Paulson making the argument that ""we agree on principles"" with the Chinese, but they are ""proponents of gradualism"" while the U.S. wants to see China make changes more rapidly. ""A big part of our discussion really centers around timing,"" he said.

Paulson touted some progress the U.S. has made with China, including a commercial air agreement that will lead to more flights between the two countries, an increase in quotas on American businesses, and a removal of caps on investment.

One of the major causes of the widening trade deficit between the U.S. and China (other than the undervalued Yuan) is the relatively high savings rate of the Chinese people, and relatively low rate of consumption. The problem, Paulson said, is that because China has a limited financial services sector, the Chinese put their money in banks for virtually no interest (actually negative interest if you factor in inflation). If more financial isntruments were available, it would help reduce ""precautionary savings"" and increase consumption.

Paulson said when U.S. negotiators make the case to their Chinese counterparts to allow the nation's currency to reflect its actual value, they tell the Chinese, ""It's very difficult to have a market economy without market price signals."" He said the Chinese understand this in principle, but feel they need to maintain more control over their currency.

Asked about intellectual property, Paulson said, ""I very much believe that they take it seriously"" and that they were putting the legal infrastructure in place to deal with the problem. But again, it's a matter of timing.

Overall, I thought Paulson's presentation was worthwhile, but I remain much more skeptical about Chinese intentions. What he calls gradualism, I call intransigence.",https://spectator.org/44040_chinas-no-1/,2007-06-05

A Deal With China Is a Loss for America - The American Spectator,"At a recent dinner for a group of high-ranking military officers at an undisclosed location in the bucolic American countryside, I cautioned the generals to prepare for the president to make a deal with China on trade. Many nodded but were skeptical. Why would the president unilaterally end a trade war that has been so successful against a country that he, and many of his most ardent supporters, believe is America’s number one geopolitical rival?

I explained that the president is a transactional leader who favors short-term solutions over longer-term strategic considerations. This in itself is not bad. In fact, it was one of the reasons not only why I voted for the Trump in 2016 (and will vote for him again in 2020) but also why I so loudly defended this president to fellow Republicans who despised him. Yet foreign and trade policy is not a one-size-fits-all solution. And, with China, if the United States cedes an inch of ground on trade, China’s leaders will turn that inch into a mile — ensuring that Beijing will yet again keep pace with (and possibly ultimately defeat) America in the great strategic competition between Beijing and Washington.

It now appears that such a trade deal with China is at hand. I am, unfortunately, reminded of Winston Churchill’s famous quote that you “cannot make a deal with a tiger when your head is in its mouth.” For years, America’s head has been in China’s mouth. All we can do is resist China’s bite. The president, however, appears poised to surrender to China.

Short-Termism Rears Its Ugly Head Again

The problem is that the president’s need for short-term deals will not have the intended effect on the long-term Sino-American strategic competition. Rather than ameliorating the rising tide of hostility between the two economic and military juggernauts, a deal, such as the tentative one that the Trump administration is crafting with Beijing, will weaken the United States in the long term and will allow for Beijing to continue its long march to world preeminence.

After all, Trump’s tariffs and overall pressure campaign against China has been working. We can see how it has fundamentally weakened China’s economy (and therefore its autarkic political system). Whether speaking about the obvious Hong Kong protests that threaten to fundamentally destabilize China’s tenuous political system or the severe crackdown on Muslim Uighurs and Evangelical Christian populations, Beijing is worried about American-induced political disharmony. The disharmony is being exacerbated by the trade war.

Meanwhile, China’s economy continues its rapid slowdown. Some of this is simply because China is transitioning from an old world-type manufacturing economy with a high-savings rate into a post-industrial, consumption economy with a higher debt load. But Trump’s trade war is intensifying the decline — and putting the proverbial squeeze on those communist leaders in Beijing, who have spent decades in an unremitting economic war against the United States.

The proposed trade talks are set to create a multi-phase trade deal that will not only settle the matter of the agriculture trade issues but also will address the issue of technology transfers from the West to China and Beijing’s ongoing effort to pilfer intellectual property from the West. Of course, the first phase of this deal redounds to agriculture. And this is the tell-tale sign that the potential deal is first and foremost political. President Trump has weakened himself politically with his tough trade stance on China. By targeting agricultural products, Trump has put a core contingent of his eclectic voting base — American farmers — in financial peril. Also, the ongoing trade war risks undermining the stock market (which the president continues to use as the most reliable measuring stick for the efficacy of his economic policies).

Ending the trade war in this way, then, likely ensures that the president will win reelection. Good for him (and for America — at least for now). Trump is certainly not the first president to use an international deal, whether on trade or diplomacy, as a means of boosting his reelection chances. Yet the overall impact must be assessed beyond the short-term political or economic boost. For if the long-standing issues between China and the United States were truly defined by agricultural trade problems, then a coterie of American policy analysts, including this author, over the last several decades would not have tried sounding the alarm about Chinese strategic intentions. In fact, America is enduring much more than a mere trade war with China. Instead, we are experiencing a quasi-war that encompasses all aspects of civilization — and the United States, until Trump’s insightful trade war was initiated, was losing.

It’s All About High-Tech

Fact is, any deal reached with China will not be final. Even on an issue that the Chinese are willing to make a deal on — such as in the agricultural sector — Beijing will inevitably find ways to cheat, thereby harming American workers and the economy. What’s more, the biggest problems we face, technology transfer and intellectual property theft, are being pushed back in the negotiations to the second round. (How much does one wish to bet that there will be no second round once the initial deal about agricultural trade is made?)

It is in the arena of advanced technology that the future of the world will be decided. This was an area in which, until recently, the United States had an unquestioned advantage. Over the years, though, Beijing (and other countries) have worked assiduously to undermine this advantage. Quantum technology is being rapidly developed in China. Even American technology firms, such as Google, are excited about uprooting their existing operations in the United States and moving to China — where they will be forced to hand over highly sensitive trade secrets and to partner with Chinese state-owned enterprises, as well as to hire Chinese engineers — all so that Beijing can build up its indigenous capacity and eventually create competitors to U.S. tech firms like Google. China doesn’t want to “partner” with more advanced Western firms. They want access to those firms’ advanced technology and trade practices so China can steal them and then use them against the West.

But, this is all too long-term for America’s corporate leaders to consider. In the near term they, like President Trump, would benefit from a trade deal with China. So all other considerations must be ignored in favor of either the quarterly bottom line for corporations or the biennial and quadrennial election results for American politicians.

China doesn’t care about agriculture insofar as it can safely import such products from overseas. Beijing is concerned about better competing with the United States at the strategic level — and that can only be done with a sufficient level of indigenous high-tech capabilities. The trade war, though focused on manufacturing and agricultural sectors, also impacted the willingness of all Western firms to operate safely in China. Even the National Basketball Association was impacted. The prospect of a deal will only encourage Western firms to reengage with China in the same pernicious ways that they had previously done before President Trump heroically stood firm against Chinese perfidy.

No Deals, Mr. President!

I agree with David Goldman: the president likely secured his reelection with the move toward a trade deal. But without a long-term understanding — and plan — for resisting Chinese IP theft and illicit tech transfers to China — the United States will inevitably become just another middle power in an increasingly Chinese-dominated world. President Trump must insist that China cease its ongoing technology war upon the United States before any kind of deal is agreed to. He must also advocate for Congress to make technology transfers illegal under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Then, the president should order America’s clandestine services to wage an unremitting cyber campaign against any Chinese entity that seeks to target, steal, or destroy American intellectual property.

President Trump: any short-term benefits that may be gleaned from negotiating with China on trade may equal a long-term strategic defeat for the United States in the ongoing struggle for supremacy between Beijing and Washington.

Until an American leader does comprehend this fact, American workers will continue to lose their livelihoods (thereby gutting the United States of once-vital middle-class communities), the American economy will lose billions of dollars to China, and the United States will become a subordinate power to China’s growing global power.

The United States is in the exact same spot that it was in 1947, when President Harry Truman was faced with the prospect of the growing Soviet threat. His initial inclination was to ignore the Soviet provocations for fear of having to wage another bloody world war. But Truman became convinced that, if he did not set the tone of resistance to the totalitarian threat the West faced, the Reds would sweep the world and not even the United States would be safe from the global revolution. Truman crafted the policies that became a bedrock for the great ideological struggle against Soviet communism.

Today, Trump must engage in a similar action to save the American republic from certain destruction in this new quasi-war with Red China. Time is not on America’s side, though. The president must act — swiftly and boldly — to stave off defeat.

Abandoning Deterrence Bit by Quantum: China Is Indeed Moving at Hypersonic Speed - The American Spectator,"President Biden is still campaigning for his $1.2 trillion “infrastructure” bill and his $3.5 trillion absurdly-labeled “build back better” bill that would transform our nation and its economy into something only a socialist could love. And he continues to insist that the $3.5 trillion legislation has “zero cost” because it will be “paid for” with tax increases.

All of Biden’s proposed federal spending porn has one common theme: nothing is to be spent on the defense of the United States.

At this moment in time, there are Chinese and Russian developments we cannot ignore. They can, if we do nothing about them, lead to our inability to deter either China or Russia from their aggression against us and our allies.

First are the Chinese and Russian tests (and Russian deployment) of hypersonic weapons. Second is the China’s enormous lead in quantum computing.

Russian President Vladimir Putin first announced their “Avengard” hypersonic boost-glide weapon in 2018 and claimed to deploy it in 2019. Last August, China reportedly tested its new hypersonic boost-glide weapons twice, to the surprise of our intelligence community (“IC”).

(It seems as if the IC is surprised by virtually every such event, so it’s time to ask what are we getting for the $80+ billion we spend on it each year. But that’s for another day.)

Hypersonic “boost-glide” weapons are launched by missile and then glide through a low earth orbit to their target. We can detect any such launches by virtue of our Space-Based Infrared Satellite constellation. “SBIRS” can detect the launch and warn us of it, but because the “glide” half of the boost-glide weapon can be guided off its ballistic track, we can’t track it.

One reason we may be unable to track them is called “plasma stealth.” If the skin on a hypersonic vehicle is electrically charged, at least in theory a “plasma” — superheated gas — forms around the warhead and blocks radar from tracking it. One expert I spoke to last March said that “plasma stealth” may be more theoretical than real. But, then again, it might be a reality.

There are other major problems. Russia claims its hypersonic weapons can travel at Mach 20, about 15,000 miles per hour, the speed of an ICBM. China’s are no slower. That means the time to determine where it will hit, analyze the threat, and decide on a response can be as short as fifteen minutes.

With or without “plasma stealth” we have no defense against Russian or Chinese hypersonic weapons. Moreover, our own competing hypersonic weapon systems are still being developed and are probably decades away from deployment.

There is a huge gap between what Russia and China are doing and what we’re trying to do.

So what, in practical terms, are we doing? In a recent interview by the Washington Times, Gen. David Thompson — deputy commander of our new Space Force — had a lot to say, but his words lacked substance. Thompson said, among other things, that China looks at what we do in space to replicate it. That seems contrary to China’s rapid development of hypersonic weapons.

Thompson said, “It’s very critical that we accelerate, not just to keep pace, but to stay ahead of the threat of the capabilities the Chinese are provided.… We’ve put some processes and organizations in place to do that, and they’re demonstrating early on the ability to do so.” Thompson is right that we have to accelerate our development and the defense acquisition processes, but all he’s promising to do will take years — maybe decades — to accomplish.

But the Defense Department is too busy planning to deal with the imaginary climate change threat to deal with that issue.

We can’t wait for decades to create a defense to hypersonic nuclear-capable weapons and to produce our own. We need a crash effort, modeled after the World War Two “Manhattan Project” that resulted in the fast development and deployment of our first nuclear weapons. That effort will certainly cost billions, perhaps trillions of dollars. But unlike Biden’s “build back better” nonsense, that effort would actually help secure America’s defenses with productive work.

It can be done, but it clearly won’t be with Biden in the White House. As bad, or worse, is the Chinese lead in quantum computing.

Quantum computing is a fascinating science. It goes far beyond the capabilities of the fastest computers that process the ones and zeros of binary language. If it is made to work — and it will be soon — it will be a huge step toward real artificial intelligence.

Our fastest computers’ speed is now measured in “terraflops,” the ability to do one million-million (ten to the twelfth power) computations per second. That is unimaginably fast. But quantum computing goes exponentially faster. It isn’t limited by the current computer logic that digests one bit at a time. It enables a machine to interpolate and combine the ones and zeros — “bits” — to perform computation with “qubits” which are based on the probability of the state of the data being fed to it.

My very imperfect understanding of quantum computing tells me that, for example, we read individual words that form sentences. Quantum computing — if the human mind were capable of it — would read whole paragraphs or pages instantly because the mind could jumble enormous amounts of words, accurately predict what follows them, and process them all in far less time than it takes to think about it.

Because it operates so quickly, quantum computing is much more secure than any current computer-based communication. China first used quantum computing — using entangled photons — to make the first secure video call to one of its satellites in 2017. (Photons are minuscule “particles” or waves that carry electromagnetic energy but have no mass.) At that point it was clear China leads us, and probably the world, in quantum computing.

China’s quantum computing has as many uses as do current technology computers. They would process data in every facet of human life. Here, too, we’re playing catch-up but aren’t pushing nearly as hard as we should.

Last Monday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki refused to comment on China’s hypersonic missile tests, but she said the United States welcomes “stiff competition,” while proclaiming that the Biden administration does “not want that competition to veer into conflict.” As if wishing made it so.

China and Russia regard space as a warfighting domain. Our three-year old Space Force is supposed to meet that challenge, but how can it when the Biden team won’t give it the means to do so, and when the Space Force commanders aren’t apparently focused on their mission?

It’s not that we are doing nothing. The Air Force is developing hypersonic weapons and many commercial companies, including IBM and Google, are making major advances in quantum computing. But more, much more, must be done.

During the latter part of the 1950s, the United States was spurred into meeting the Soviet Union’s challenge in space by the 1959 launch of the Sputnik satellite and by the 1961 launch of the first man in space. We raced to do it, spending billions of dollars in the process. Closing the “missile gap” and winning the “space race” were enough to give us parity with, or in some cases superiority to, our adversaries’ capabilities.

In today’s politics, there is no one talking about the “hypersonic missile gap” or “quantum computing gap.” Both are critical to national defense. It’s time to kill the idea of spending trillions of dollars for more social welfare plans and talk about how we catch up to the threats we face that can — and soon will — render our strategy of deterrence a nullity.",https://spectator.org/44875_china-meets-subprime/,2021-10-25
Abraham Accords March On While Saudi Arabia Drifts to China - The American Spectator,"The Biden administration barrels full steam ahead on its quest to seal a deal with Iran. It already is willing to concede sanctions relief, as reported by the Wall Street Journal and confirmed (in a word salad) by the State Department. The Biden administration wants to clinch “all of the JCPOA and nothing but the JCPOA,” while it ignores positions shared by House and Senate members, as well as Israel, that a deal with Iran should be more holistic and address Iran’s ballistic missiles and support for terrorism. House Republicans, with former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s blessing, have introduced a bill that would put former President Trump’s “maximum pressure” sanctions into legislation and would require the approval of Congress for any Iran deal.

Meanwhile, the State Department (kind of) admitted it was wrong on the Houthis, calling Iran’s support to them “significant” and “lethal,” saying that it is State Department’s “greatest fear” that Houthis could kill Americans, and admitting that there is no indication that Iran wants to play a constructive role in peace negotiations with Yemen. But the Biden administration continues to pressure Saudi Arabia on a Yemen deal and keeps the Houthis off of the Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO) list, while Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia continue.

While we await the full sticker shock of the Iran deal, there is some good news. The Abraham Accords, brokered by the Trump administration, continue to yield cooperation amongst the signatories. But the casualty of the Biden administration’s quest for an Iran deal is Saudi Arabia, which shows signs that it drifting towards a more reliable patron: China.

The Abraham Accords are producing even more partnerships in high tech. Group 42, an Emirati company specializing in cloud computing and artificial intelligence, is partnering with Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. in a big data and artificial intelligence joint venture called Presight.AI for public safety and health applications. Group 42 will also set up a research and development center in Israel. This follows earlier reports that Israeli nonprofit Start-Up Nation Central is partnering with UAE’s newly minted ambassador to Israel to set up a joint task force to explore possibilities for the two countries to innovate together. The Abu Dhabi Investment Office also launched in Israel to court Israeli companies to do business in the Emirates. Israel is also in preliminary talks with the UAE to purchase solar power, while Israel and Bahrain signed a $3 million deal to consult with each other on water technology.

In defense, the Israel and the UAE have shared intelligence on Hezbollah’s cyber warfare. Israel and Emirati fighter planes joined Greece and the air forces of five other countries in Greece’s Inihos aerial exercise. But perhaps the most significant development is that the UAE joined the Israel–Greece–Cyprus summit, originally established in 2016. This summit serves to balance against not only Iranian but also Turkish aggression in the region. Some argue that the UAE sees Turkey as an even greater rival than Iran, even in Yemen, Syria, Libya, and Qatar. A new 20-year, $1.65 billion Israeli arms deal with Greece has enabled Israel to more than recoup its lost arms deals with Turkey since Erdoğan took power and has also given the Israeli air force a place to train, which it had in pre-Islamist Turkey.

In tourism, Abu Dhabi air carrier Etihad Airways began flying to Tel Aviv, with Etihad executive Amina Taher delivering a warm welcome in Hebrew. Bahrain’s Gulf Air announced that it will begin flights to Israel in early June, and Morocco and Israel will begin direct flights after Ramadan. Israel and Bahrain have agreed to establish a COVID-19 vaccination passport system, where vaccinated people of one country can travel to another without restrictions. A new kosher kitchen in Dubai will produce over 2,000 kosher meals for the Emirates airline, and also for hotels and events.

In diplomacy, Bahrain appointed its ambassador to Israel, and Sudan officially annulled its 1958 law that prohibited diplomatic and business relations with Israel.

Israel’s Sheba Medical Center and Bahrain’s Salmaniya Medical Complex also signed an exchange and collaboration agreement. Israel and the UAE are close to reaching agreement on a tax treaty. Israel and Morocco signed a deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars encompassing food and agriculture, chemicals, and other industries. Israeli food company Mehadrin will grow avocados in Morocco soon.

U.S. pushes Saudi Arabia toward China

While Israel’s relationships with the UAE, Bahrain, and others are taking off, Democratic pressure is driving Saudi Arabia away. Like any Saudi leader should, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) is busy trying to deter Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. A few years back, MBS promised to protect his people from Iran, saying, “If Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we would follow suit as soon as possible.”

But House and Senate Democrats view Saudi strength as more problematic than Iran’s growing hegemony. Several Democrats have introduced legislation that would end arms sales to Saudi Arabia in the event that it has circumvented the (International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to construct a nuclear facility or if it received assistance in constructing an enrichment or reprocessing facility on its own territory. This follows a increasingly long list of anti-Saudi measures from the Biden administration: the prohibition of sales of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia, the removal of Patriot missiles from Saudi Arabia, the as-yet-unsubstantiated accusation that MBS orchestrated the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the jarring emphasis on Saudi’s human rights record, the allowance of Houthi extortion to get Saudi Arabia to provide Yemen with oil products, the obsession with Saudi Arabia brokering a peace deal with Yemen, and the de-listing of the Houthis from the FTO list.

Saudi Arabia may be reaching the point where it can no longer rely on its strategic partnership with the United States. It is growing even closer to China, as the Gulf is now primed to do. In a recent phone call with China’s President Xi Jinping, MBS called Xi a “trusted brother” (it’s unlikely at this point that he could say the same of President Biden). On the call, MBS agreed to fuse Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 Plan with China’s Belt and Road Initiative, while Xi promised to push Chinese–Saudi relations “to a new level.” The two leaders discussed partnerships in technology, energy, and trade. This follows a promise by Saudi Aramco to make China its highest-priority client for the next 50 years. A recent report had indicated that China’s imports of Saudi oil have increased 8.8 percent from last year. Saudi Aramco has had its installations attacked by Houthi terrorists several times in the past months.

The Abraham Accords continue, but the Biden administration will undermine their growth by estranging Saudi Arabia. While Saudi Arabia is reportedly in talks with Israel, the UAE and Bahrain to form a defensive alliance against Iran, this can all be undermined by counterproductive U.S. pressure. The Biden administration should change course and leverage its traditional allies to pursue a durable Middle East peace rather than a deal with Iran that will be disastrous for the U.S. and the region.",https://spectator.org/46369_great-firewall-china/,2021-04-26
Who Lost China? - The American Spectator,"The subtitle of John Delury’s Agents of Subversion suggests that the book has two main themes: the fate of CIA operative John Downey, who was captured and held captive for decades after his plane was shot down over Manchuria during a resupply mission to covert agents in China; and the nature and extent of the CIA’s covert war in China following World War II. It turns out, however, that Downey’s fate is mostly the backdrop for Delury’s critical assessments of American postwar policy in China and its later policy in Vietnam — assessments that, though sometimes valid and insightful, at times cross over to a portrayal of moral equivalency between the United States and the communist regimes in China and North Vietnam.

Delury’s tale, to be sure, is a cautionary one about post–World War II American hubris in international affairs — a hubris that led to repeated postwar policy failures in Asia. But it is a largely one-sided tale — of U.S. blunders and malfeasance committed mostly, according to Delury, by American anti-communists. Delury condemns those on the American right who supported America’s wartime ally Chiang Kai-shek in the Chinese Civil War and lauds those on the American left who were anti-Chiang and, in some cases, pro–Mao Zedong. He gives a pass to “China Hands” such as Owen Lattimore, John Paton Davies, John Stewart Service, John King Fairbank, and John Carter Vincent who urged the Truman administration to abandon Chiang and the Nationalists and to reach some sort of accommodation with Mao’s Communists. Delury briefly mentions their association with the far-left Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR) and Amerasia magazine (and the notorious Amerasia spy case, which involved the stealing and publication of classified U.S. intelligence reports) but saves his fiercest criticism for David Nelson Rowe, Alfred Kohlberg, and other “right-wing” supporters of Chiang. The fact that the China Hands’ assessments of Mao and the Communists were seriously flawed counts for very little with Delury.

And Delury draws a straight line from anti-communist support for Chiang and the Nationalists to what he characterizes as the totalitarian repression of the Red Scare led by the Left’s perennial demon Sen. Joseph McCarthy and other conservative anti-communists. Delury seems to believe, like many on the left, that domestic anti-communism posed a greater threat to America than did the communists who infiltrated the U.S. government during the Roosevelt–Truman years. The fact that communist “agents of subversion,” to borrow from Delury’s title, operated at high levels in the U.S. State Department, Treasury Department, War Department, Office of Strategic Services (OSS), and the White House, again, counts for very little with Delury.

Delury, who teaches Chinese Studies at Yonsei University, applauds the American liberals who sought to nurture a so-called “Third Force” in China as a better alternative to Chiang’s Nationalists and Mao’s Communists, but he also acknowledges that this idea was a delusion that in the end sapped support for Chiang while doing very little to undermine Mao. The harsh reality that Delury never directly deals with is that the U.S. eventually abandoned a wartime ally who helped to defeat Japan and did nothing to prevent a Communist takeover of China. Well, almost nothing.

The United States, as Delury recounts in the book, launched a series of covert operations into China during China’s Civil War, the Korean War, and subsequent years — all of which failed and some of which led to the capture, imprisonment, and sometimes death of American spies and military personnel, including the capture and imprisonment of John Downey, a young CIA agent who graduated from Yale University in 1951. In fact, Yale graduates are all over this book, since the CIA recruited the “best and the brightest” from America’s best colleges and universities.

The U.S. covert war against China was part of the larger Cold War against international communism. U.S. strategists and policymakers believed that in the nuclear age, it was safer and perhaps more effective to wage political, psychological, subversive warfare against our communist enemies. As Delury notes, this was an aspect of the original containment doctrine explained by George F. Kennan in his famous “X” article in Foreign Affairs. Kennan, as the State Department’s director of policy planning, helped formulate the strategy of political, psychological, subversive warfare. Perhaps the biggest proponent of such warfare was the American political philosopher James Burnham, who had worked for the OSS during World War II and thereafter consulted with the CIA in the immediate postwar years. Curiously, Delury makes no mention of Burnham, who is said to have had a hand in the successful covert effort to overthrow Mohammad Mosaddegh in Iran and reinstall Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to power.

Delury does, however, write about Kennan, Hans Morgenthau, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Hannah Arendt, foreign-policy “realists” who are the real heroes of this book. He credits them for recognizing the failures of American hubris in China and, later, in Vietnam. These writers, Delury claims, “grappled with the contradiction between the idealism of America’s liberal vision on the one hand, and the realities of geopolitics, risk of hubris, and danger of repression on the other.” They were realists who preached restraint. They understood the limits of American power.

Kennan began distancing himself from containment soon after he wrote the “X” article, in response to Walter Lippmann’s realist critique of the doctrine. Morgenthau, the author of the realists’ bible Politics Among Nations: A Struggle for Power and Peace, became an outspoken critic of America’s overextended foreign policy, especially during the Vietnam War. Niebuhr attempted to reconcile Christianity with foreign-policy realism. Arendt worried that U.S. imperialism could translate into repression at home. They, of course, had the luxury of criticizing U.S. policy without being responsible for conducting actual policy.

In the end, it took President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, two foreign-policy realists, to improve relations with China and negotiate Downey’s freedom. But Delury balances his praise of Nixon and Kissinger with condemnation of Nixon for the “sins” of Watergate, which he traces to the covert mindset of American policymakers. And he warns that the U.S. may be once again abandoning realism and “reverting to Cold War patterns of covert subversion” in its approach to China today. But most of today’s realists acknowledge that China poses a much greater threat to U.S. security today than it did in the immediate postwar years. And the United States is confronted today with China’s global geopolitical challenge, in part, because of the failed China and Asia policies of the Truman administration. That, not Delury’s anti-anti-communism, is the real answer to the question: Who lost China?",https://spectator.org/46964_chinas-south-america/,2022-12-07
America’s Bull in a China Shop - The American Spectator,"America’s bull is loose in the China shop. President Trump has set in place a confrontation with China over that nation’s trade infractions. The shop’s elite patrons are in paroxysms, while Main Street presses their nose to the glass to watch the show. That two groups could see such different things in the same occurrence is the crux of American politics today.

The Chinese have a long heritage as merchants. Found across Asia and the world, they run businesses from the smallest street stalls to the largest conglomerates.

For decades now, China’s Communist Party has taken a mercantilist approach, tapping into their nation’s predilection. They have thereby generated the capital no other communist nation has ever been able to raise. By doing so, they have transformed the former embodiment of global impoverishment into the epitome of successful development.

Along the way, the world’s undiscerning shoppers have enjoyed the bargains but ignored the consequences. Both were equally clear: Cheap goods in large quantities and unscrupulous business practices. The world focused on the former and ignored the latter. Trump has done the opposite.

This has been the Trump trade agenda writ large: Taking a contrarian position to the prevailing elite approach that welcomed foreign exports in unlimited quantities. Pursued everywhere, nowhere has Trump advanced his contrarian position more forcefully than with China.

Following China’s backtracking from a deal that promised détente in the nations’ trade relationship, President Trump has begun putting in place actions likely to escalate the conflict. Tariffs on hundreds of billions in Chinese exports are due to increase significantly. Additional tariffs on hundreds of billions more are promised to follow. Restrictions on Chinese telecom giant Huawei are in place, and a response aimed at currency manipulation — a practice China has unabashedly pursued — appears in the works.

As with all wars, they comprise casualties and assets. The first casualties of Trump’s China trade war were America’s elites. They have benefited greatly from our former trade relationship with China —inequitable though it was. They would like very much to continue to do so. As a result, although they ostensibly lament the obvious inequities, they tacitly support the status quo. They want the bull out of their China shop.

Trump also has his assets in this trade conflict. The American economy is fundamentally strong. Perhaps stronger still is his case against China. China’s numerous transgressions are well and long known — not just here, but globally — despite having never faced a serious challenge before.

For decades, Main Street America has felt the effect of the elite’s prevailing trade approach. Elites therefore cannot directly oppose Trump in attacking China; they are left only with the cursory response that they would pursue it in a better way — despite never having bothered to do so.

China’s mercantilist approach is nothing new. In Asia, Japan, and then Korea, earlier used this developmental approach. In America, a different segment of Main Street suffered each time.

The economic throwback of mercantilism seems quaint to America’s elites — its beneficiaries — but cruel to its victims — Main Streets. Undoubtedly, the elite’s perception would have been very different had China been flooding America’s markets with lawyers instead of leggings.

America is democratic to a fault. Today’s elite brands it demagogic. However, it predates America’s revolutionary origin. After, Tocqueville eloquently documented it. We have a long-held love of satirizing the elite — from the Three Stooges running roughshod through a mansion, to the Marx Brothers demolishing an opera.

For Main Street, Trump has imbued America’s innate love of such high jinks with a sense of high justice: “It is about time.” There is no little element of payback here. This is why Trump has bulled into so many china shops — NAFTA, trade with the EU and Japan, immigration — not just China. And, why so many have enjoyed watching him go.

There is a fundamental misunderstanding in American politics. The elite believe Main Street cannot see there is a bull in the china shop, or do not understand the damage he will cause. For Main Street’s part, they see and understand perfectly — and it is precisely where they want him. The real issue separating elites from Main Streets is not about where the bull is, but whose ox is being gored.",https://spectator.org/48381_how-invest-china/,2019-06-14
"As Its Population Surpasses China’s, India’s Economic Power Rises - The American Spectator","According to the United Nations, India’s population of 1.4 billion is expected to surpass China’s in the next three months. This development is due in part to the one-child policy of former Chinese Communist Party Chairman Deng Xiaoping.

Doubtless, there will be celebration and hype in New Delhi over leading the world by this measure. As I have written in The American Spectator, this year India is hosting the G20, which will give the country an opportunity to present its major accomplishments in recent decades. It may now command more attention as the world’s most populous nation.

There is currently no shortage of good economic news in India, whose growth rate for fiscal year 2024 is projected at 6 percent by the World Economic Forum, the largest of any major economy. The country has now overtaken the United Kingdom as the world’s fifth-largest economy, with 2022 GDP forecasted at $3.5 trillion, according to the German data firm Statista. Not only that, Morgan Stanley, the U.S. investment bank, is predicting that India will be the third-largest economy in the world by 2027, overtaking both Germany and Japan. Granted, GDP is only one measure of a country’s performance — workforce quality, condition of the environment, education standards, and rural access and poverty are other metrics to consider. Nonetheless, we should expect India to be hosting the G20 from a position that conveys strength.

While these economic developments are indeed favorable, there are major structural issues and constraints for the Indian economy to address.

First, the manufacturing sector has not performed up to expectations since Make In India became an official policy of the government in 2014. This sector constitutes only 23 percent of the country’s GDP, based on the most recently available CIA estimate. In 2020, McKinsey & Company estimated that India needs to create 90 million non-farm jobs by 2030 in order to meet the demands of a youthful population and absorb migration from agriculture. In its assessment, this would require 8 percent to 8.5 percent annual GDP growth for a decade. India’s technology sector is unlikely to accomplish this, as the information technology and business process management sectors employ only 4.9 million people, according to Statista. According to the most recently available CIA estimates, agriculture employs 47 percent of the workforce, but constitutes only 15 percent of GDP — and is maxed out at that proportion from the fragmentation of holdings, aquifer depletion, and the use of land for industrialization.

Insufficient investment in the construction of infrastructure, which constitutes only 3 percent of GDP, is cited as contributing to a weak manufacturing sector. Further, there is a shortage of International Organization for Standardization — and British Standards Institution — certified manufacturers in India. In addition, and as I have written for Gateway House, the Indian Council on Global Relations, there is a lack of credit and performance risk insurance for Small and Medium Enterprises (known as SMEs), which could stimulate manufacturing.

Second, the defense sector of India is the third-largest in the world after the U.S. and China, with a budget for the 2023 fiscal year of $54 billion — with increasing emphasis on local manufacturing. Other estimates are higher, as they include pensions. With a combined border of 4,000 miles with Pakistan and China, belligerent countries with whom India has fought five wars since independence in 1947 (including the Kargil War of 1999), there is not much chance of reallocating the defense budget. The defense budget is about four times that of the budget for agriculture for fiscal year 2023.

Third, the increased assimilation of women into the workforce would have a beneficial effect on both human rights as well as the Indian economy. Several years ago, McKinsey estimated that enhanced gender equality could increase the country’s GDP by $770 billion by 2025. Moreover, the consulting firm points out that the work of women represents 18 percent of GDP. This is said to be among the lowest in the world, with only 25 percent of the labor force being female.

Finally, rising economic power raises the question of India’s future role in international affairs: Should India be a global or regional power? There are differing views on this in the country and Western capitals. The West would like India to align itself more explicitly and aggressively, and India’s participation in the QUAD and Malabar maritime exercises in the western Pacific are certainly examples. However, India’s reliance on Russia as its main supplier of military hardware and its transactional approach to buying discounted oil from Russia underscore the present and historical importance of Russia and, previously, the Soviet Union. (I have recently written in The American Spectator on India’s hesitation to aggressively criticize Russia.) Further, in India, there is the view that global power status is not practical, as it would limit the focus and resources for the domestic priorities of education, public health, infrastructure, manufacturing, agriculture, and social services.

India indeed has much to celebrate as it hosts the G20 this year. Realizing its full economic potential will likely depend upon how it increases the scale of its manufacturing sector and brings more women into the workforce.

Countering China’s Belligerence - The American Spectator,"There should be no doubt that the People’s Republic of China is the leading geostrategic adversary of the West, in both economic and military terms. President Biden, who is no stranger to matters Chinese, and his administration must recognize that the status quo policy toward China — the so-called pivot to Asia, the enhancement of alliances with regional partners such as India, Japan, and Australia, and the transactional approach focusing on the trade imbalance — is clearly not enough. It is not working.

Remarkably, China has emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic economically even stronger than before. While the U.S. and Europe continue to suffer from what the International Monetary Fund (IMF) characterized the worst recession since the Great Depression, China, which instituted a brutal lockdown on a scale that Western democracies could never contemplate, is estimated by the IMF to record lowered but nonetheless remarkable GDP growth of 7.9 percent in 2021. Even in 2020, China posted an estimated 2.3 percent GDP growth rate for the entire year.

As also reported in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week, citing United Nations figures, China has become the leading destination for foreign direct investment (FDI), replacing the U.S., which suffered a drop of almost 50 percent in 2020. Doubtless, the downturn in FDI for the U.S. is a reflection on the country’s inability to manage a pandemic as well as other nations that have fared better, and it is likely a result of perceived heightened political risk associated with the turmoil and corrosive behavior and carnage in Washington. With the Biden administration issuing orders to overturn policies of the Trump years, there is unquestionably even more uncertainty for foreign investors who assess U.S. regulatory risk.

China has not suffered serious consequences for its deliberate silence on COVID-19, allowing it to be transmitted via international flights in and out of Wuhan although domestic ones had been suspended, and persecuting medical professionals who gave warnings. It has not paid a price for its sinister behavior in what has been called the worst global health crisis since the Spanish Flu of 1918.

While major multinational corporations are wise to rethink their China political risk, operating and investment exposure, and their supply chains, recalibration will take much time. Sourcing changes of major companies do not occur with the click of a mouse. The U.S. cannot expect much support from Europe, either, as it is also well known that Europe accords commercial ties a higher priority than security, and its colonial heritage seems to inhibit confrontational instincts.

Given that China emerged from the COVID-19 crisis virtually unscathed compared to West, we can expect not only gloating from Beijing but also an even more aggressive and emboldened foreign policy. The world has seen the militarization of the South China Sea; the Belt and Road Initiative, which embraces about 70 countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe under the rules, command, and control of Beijing; the suppression of Hong Kong; the Uighurs in China’s Xinjiang province denounced as genocide by the Trump administration; the bullying of India with pressure on the borders of Kashmir’s Ladakh region and Doklam to the east; the recent escalation of belligerence over Taiwan; and increased emphasis on infiltration through cyber technology.

What provocation China will commit next is an unknown. But the current architecture of U.S. relations with Asian partners, intelligence sharing, and joint naval maneuvers has neither contained China nor moderated its behavior. The maxim of reinforcing success and abandoning failure would seem to apply: it is delusional to think that U.S. foreign policy toward China is what it should be. The State Department of the Biden administration needs to do some major out-of-the-box thinking, to use a hideous cliché. But in view of President Xi Jinping’s liberal remarks at Davos this week, delivered like a professor of governance, one fears that the Left will gush and be conned to embrace the People’s Republic once again.

A country with much at stake as regards China is India, which has endured Chinese aggression on its frontiers for years and lost an embarrassing war with China in 1962. The Indian and Chinese navies compete for influence in the Indian Ocean, where both countries wish to protect the oil sea lanes they depend upon. Resentment in India over China as the suspected origin of COVID-19 has turned public opinion against China, as it has in the United States.

To counter China, the U.S. and India can leverage their technology assets. India’s software industry may rival that of the United States. Regarded as the Silicon Valley of India, Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) is a major technology hub for software development. Indian IT experts may be found in the CEO or senior management ranks of Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook, and in the U.S. venture capital industry. Recently, Tata Consultancy Services, with a market capitalization of nearly $170 billion, has overtaken Accenture as the largest IT firm in the world. Further, the Indian space program, led by the Indian Space Research Organisation in Bengaluru, has the capability to execute lunar probes as well as an interplanetary mission to orbit Mars.

The U.S. and India have enjoyed excellent relations that include four U.S. administrations and three Indian ones, and both countries are deeply troubled by the ascent of China as a strategic challenge. As I have written in The American Spectator, a next-generation U.S.–India relationship could encompass technology collaboration to assure the integrity of 5G networks, cyber defense and offense, and platforms for space warfare.

There are novel ideas to contemplate beyond the current state of play with the U.S. and India’s strategic partnership, which in military terms include the sale of aircraft, development of joint ventures to manufacture Apache attack helicopters, the F/A-18 and F-16, encryption-sharing for intelligence purposes, logistics support, and joint naval maneuvers. The time has come to consider technology partnerships. A next-generation U.S.–India partnership will put China on notice.

Biden Gets China and Russia All Wrong - The American Spectator,"Biden is dangerously confused about China and Russia. I am not talking about Biden’s confusion about the countries’ names, which, given his tendency to forget and mix up simple facts, is entirely possible. Behind recent statements from Biden about China and Russia’s relationships with the U.S. lies a more serious concern. Biden misunderstands the basic facts about the two countries and lays out a foolish strategy, which could fundamentally harm the United States.

When asked which country is the biggest threat to America earlier this week, Biden replied that Russia is the biggest threat, and China is the biggest competitor. For him, the two are categorically different: one is a major threat and the other is merely a competitor. But who are our competitors? We compete with our democratic allies, such as Canada, the UK, Germany, and France. In Biden’s view, China belongs to this group — except it is larger. This is a very dangerous view for America. China under the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) dictatorship is not a country we just compete with. China is much more dangerous than Russia.

Russia ended its communist dictatorship in the early 1990s and has embarked on its democratization process since then. While the process is difficult, Russia is no longer under communism. Now Russia has a multi-party system: about four major parties have members in the federal parliament with one dominant party (United Russia). Russian’s democratization has suffered serious backsliding during Putin’s reign. But opposition parties do exist. For example, the Russian Communist Party is the largest rival of United Russia.

The Russian court system is heavily influenced by Putin’s government. But at least in one known case — the 2012 Pussy Riot case — the court released a political protester against Putin’s will. Political protests are part of daily life in Russa. In Moscow’s Red Square, many street actors play Lenin, Stalin, and even Putin, and give all sorts of speeches. Press freedom is severely limited and independent media organizations are scarce and constantly harassed. Russia’s Press Freedom Score is 49 (1=free, and 100=not free) and ranked 149th out of 180 countries. Russia’s Political Freedom Score is 20 (1=completely not free; 100=completely free).

Economically, Russia is weak and small. Its GDP is $4 trillion (purchasing power parity, or PPP, adjusted, the U.S.’s is $19 trillion). In terms of economic freedom, Russia is ranked 94th out of 180 countries and is considered “moderately free.”

China, on the other hand, is under communist dictatorship. The Chinese Communist Party monopolizes all the political powers. The court system is completely controlled by the CCP. All the judges are appointed by the CCP. There are no opposition parties in China. There has not been a single case in which judges defied the CCP in their rulings. Anyone who criticizes the CCP will be harshly punished. An ID card and security check are required to enter Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. Numerous policemen and security guards, in uniform or plainclothes, patrol the square and swiftly arrest anyone who appears to be a Falun Gong practitioner or a Shangfang petitioner (groups that are mistreated by the government and seek justice). There is no press freedom: China’s Press Freedom Score is 78 and ranked 177th out of 180 countries. China’s Political Freedom Score is 10 (0=completely not free; 100=completely free).

Economically, China is huge and strong: Its GDP is $25 trillion (PPP adjusted), the largest in the world. In terms of economic freedom, China is ranked 103rd out of 180 countries and is in the group of “mostly unfree”.

In sum, Russia is an infant democracy ruled by a charismatic strongman, with some opposition, limited press freedom, a court system under heavy political influence, and a weak and small economy. China is a communist dictatorship with no opposition, no free press, a CCP-appointed court system, and a huge, powerful, and expanding economy, of which the CCP controls about 60 percent and uses the funds lavishly with little checks and balances to influence the world, especially the United States.

Below is a table that compares China and Russia:

It is very clear that, in every aspect, compared to Russia, China’s ruling party is more dictatorial, Chinese people enjoy less freedom, and China has more resources to expand globally. If both countries spend the same share of its GDP on influencing America, China would outspend Russia by about 6 to 1. If both countries employ the same percentage of its people to collect intelligence from the U.S., China would send 10 times more spies to the U.S. than Russia would. If the U.S. allocates the same percentage of its people to counter China’s espionage, every U.S. agent would face four spies from China!

While I do not want to downplay Putin’s damage to Russia’s infant democracy or Russia’s threat to the U.S., it is beyond any doubt that communist China poses a much bigger threat than Russia.

As a senior adviser at the U.S. National Security Agency commented when comparing the threat posed by the two countries, “Russia is the hurricane…. China is climate change.”

If communist China is a worse offender of human rights and the rule of law than Russia, why is China viewed more positively than the latter in general? The short answer is that the CCP has been spending a huge amount of money to promote a false positive image of China and to bribe politicians, academics, and elites worldwide to sing along with the CCP.

So why does Biden downplay the threat by China? I think he either does not understand the political and economic systems of China, or he purposely misleads America for his private gain — or both.

Biden’s Dangerous Imbalance on China and Taiwan - The American Spectator,"Elbridge Colby, one of the country’s leading national security experts and the author of The Strategy of Denial: American Defense in an Age of Great Power Conflict, has written an important article on the Foreign Affairs website that reveals the gap between the Biden administration’s rhetorical commitment to defending Taiwan and the resources devoted to Taiwan’s defense. Colby’s piece is measured, respectful, and fair, but it constitutes a damning indictment of Biden’s Taiwan policy for its failure to close the “Lippmann Gap.”

In 1943, in the midst of the Second World War, journalist Walter Lippmann wrote U.S. Foreign Policy: Shield of the Republic, in which he argued that an effective foreign policy “consists in bringing into balance, with a comfortable surplus of power in reserve, the nation’s commitments and the nation’s power.” Statesmanship, he explained, involves achieving and maintaining this balance. The United States, Lippmann wrote, “must maintain its objectives and its power in equilibrium, its purposes within its means and its means equal to its purposes, its commitments related to its resources and its resources adequate to its commitments.” Unless U.S. statesmen bring ends and means into balance, they “will follow a course that leads to disaster.” Lippmann concluded the book by exhorting our nation’s leaders to “know our interests and what they require of us” and to “know our limitations.” It is only then, he wrote, quoting our first president, George Washington, that “we may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by justice, shall counsel.”

In his Foreign Affairs piece, Colby does not mention Lippmann or his book, but what scholars have called the “Lippmann Gap” pervades Colby’s analysis of what’s wrong with Biden’s Taiwan policy. Colby notes that members of the Biden administration — including the president himself — have rhetorically strengthened our commitment to the defense of Taiwan. “Given its public statements and strategies,” Colby writes, “it would make sense for Washington to be behaving as though the United States might well be on the verge of major war with a nuclear-armed superpower rival.” But the Biden administration’s actual policies, he writes, “so far appear to be unequal to the urgency and scale of the threat China poses.” We are not backing up our rhetoric “with the degree of effort and focus needed to be ready to defeat a Chinese assault on Taiwan.”

Colby quotes several high-level Biden administration officials — including the president — about the “acute” threat China poses to Taiwan and our commitment to its defense. “But here is the rub,” Colby explains: “[T]he Biden administration’s actions to field a military that could actually deny a Chinese invasion of Taiwan do not appear to match its rhetoric.” There is a “gap between the words and actions” of the administration. That gap involves insufficient defense spending — Biden’s budget request for fiscal year 2023 was set below the inflation rate, and, although Congress added to it, it still falls short of what is necessary according to the National Defense Strategy.

The gap also involves inadequacy “in developing and fielding the capabilities required to defeat an invasion” of Taiwan. The Biden administration has failed to redirect sufficient military resources to the Indo-Pacific region, even as it pours resources into the Ukraine war and signals its intention to increase resources to the Middle East. “[T]he overall deployment and positioning of U.S. forces,” Colby warns, “is not enough to address the worsening military balance with respect to Taiwan.” And the administration has failed to press our allies in other regions, such as Europe and the Middle East, to assume a larger share of the defense burden. (READ MORE from Francis P. Sempa: We Are Now in the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis)

The result, Colby concludes (echoing Lippmann), is a “fundamental mismatch between the administration’s stated goals and assessment of the threat and what it appears to be doing to address it.” In other words, our stated commitment to Taiwan and the resources required to support that commitment are out of balance. And this Lippmann Gap is growing every day, even as Chinese warships and warplanes effectively blockaded Taiwan during the past several days. China announced that those military drills are ending but stated that “training and war preparation” would continue.

Colby knows, as Lippmann did, that tough rhetoric is meaningless unless it is backed by sufficient resources. He writes that “[t]he United States and its allies are now approaching or perhaps already facing a window of vulnerability over Taiwan.” He urges the Biden administration to take swift and sharp action to close the gap between our commitment to Taiwan and our resources in the region because to continue down the path we are now taking is “a recipe for disaster.”",https://spectator.org/54661_chinas-war-netizens/,2022-08-12
Democrats Refuse to Learn From the Failure of Engagement With China - The American Spectator,"The timing couldn’t have been better. Democratic Party foreign-policy “expert” Joseph Nye, who served in the Carter, Clinton, and Obama administrations and who teaches at Harvard University, wrote an article in Project Syndicate extolling the virtues of post–Cold War engagement of China and praising the Biden administration’s competitive-engagement approach to China.

Meanwhile, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow and historian Frank Dikötter, who teaches at the University of Hong Kong, has written China After Mao: The Rise of a Superpower, to be released later this month, which shatters the “China illusion” upon which engagement was based.

Nye attempts to defend presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush against charges that their optimism about China’s eventual political liberalization was naïve. Nye asserts that Clinton and Bush “realized that Cold War-style containment of China would be impossible … because other countries would not have gone along with it.” Clinton and Bush, he writes, were right in trying to “coax China to contribute to global public goods and institutions by acting as … ‘a responsible stakeholder.’” “In the first decade of this century,” Nye claims, “China was still moving toward greater openness, moderation, and pluralization.” It was only when current President Xi Jinping came to power, Nye writes, that hopes for a successful engagement policy were dashed. But Nye insists that Biden is right to “not foreclose the possibility of more benign future scenarios” with China.

Dikötter, the author of important books on Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, spent a decade in China conducting research in then-open archives and had access to the diaries of Li Rui, who served as Mao’s personal secretary and later was a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Committee. Dikötter shows that after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, CCP leaders never wavered from exerting exclusive political control over the country, and they erected an “entrenched dictatorship” and a “sprawling security apparatus” before Xi came to power. All of Mao’s successors, including the reformist Deng Xiaoping, were committed to state control of the economy and a Leninist–Maoist party dictatorship. There would be no Chinese Gorbachev in command in Beijing.

Dikötter writes that all of the common Western assumptions about the “era of Reform and Opening Up” in China — assumptions obviously still held by Nye — were wrong. And those wrongheaded assumptions led Western political leaders and businessmen to help fuel China’s economic and military rise. The policy of engagement was sold to the West as the best way to move China in the direction of political moderation and liberalization. It was a policy underpinned by what Nye famously calls “soft power.” It didn’t work, but that didn’t translate to a change in U.S. policy, even after Xi rose to power and publicly promoted his “China Dream” — the goal of China replacing the United States as the world’s leading power.

It is no surprise that Nye clings to the supposed efficacy of “soft power” — a term upon which he has built his reputation as a foreign-policy expert. But this is the same Joseph Nye who in his last book — Do Morals Matter?: Presidents and Foreign Policy from FDR to Trump — rates the foreign policies of Clinton, Carter, and Obama over those of Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, and George H.W. Bush.

That judgment is not just biased and wrong — it is preposterous.

The China engagers like Nye — and he is far from alone here — are the policymakers and “experts” that have placed us in our current predicament with China. You reap what you sow. Engagement failed, and, as Frank Dikötter shows, it never had a chance of success as long as the CCP was in power. That failure has led to what is perhaps the greatest foreign-policy challenge of our history. And, unfortunately, the Biden administration is staffed with people who think like Nye.",https://spectator.org/55097_cool-war-china/,2022-11-04
Biden Pushes Our Gulf Allies Toward China - The American Spectator,"Last week, while toothlessly condemning Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia, the Biden administration also called on U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and Oman to support “diplomatic efforts” to end the Yemeni Civil War. This followed several Houthi drone and missile operations, including one on Saudi oil facilities earlier this month that drove the price of oil to over $70 a barrel.

Encouraging diplomacy against terrorists is the latest in a series of efforts by the Biden administration to distance the U.S. from its traditional Gulf allies. Since taking office, the Biden administration has put under review previously negotiated arms sales to UAE and Saudi Arabia, suspended sale of “offensive weapons” to Saudi Arabia (whatever that means), removed the Houthis from the designated Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) list, issued visa restrictions on 76 Saudis, and made a concerted effort to marginalize Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) in response to the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. Now the administration seeks to renegotiate a nuclear deal with Iran.

If these weren’t enough reasons to drive away our Gulf allies away, China adds a few more. In recent years, China has been ramping up relations with the Gulf states, namely in the fields of nuclear power, drone technology, and various infrastructure projects. China is now well poised to capitalize on these connections at our expense. In fact, at least four Chinese companies doing business in the Gulf have serious national security implications for the United States: China National Nuclear Corporation, Huawei, CRRC Corporation, and China State Construction Engineering Corporation. The Trump administration found that these companies, among others, have links to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), and banned Americans from investing in them.

Drones and Nuclear Technology

The Biden administration’s stonewalling of arms sales may result in increased Chinese drone sales to the Gulf. According to one U.S. analyst, “China has been selling the hell out of its drones” to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and Saudi Arabia has used these drones in its war against the Houthis in Yemen. In summer 2018, Saudi Arabia confirmed that China was building a drone factory in Saudi Arabia. Cooperation between the Gulf and China on drones will only increase if we continue to refuse to sell arms to our allies.

Saudi Arabia may also compensate being fleeced by the United States by increasing its cooperation with China in nuclear technology. In September 2020, the Guardian surfaced a confidential report by the PLA-linked China National Nuclear Corporation, the Beijing Research Institute of Uranium Geology, and the Saudi Geological Survey stating that Saudi Arabia now has likely mined enough uranium (with Chinese assistance) to make nuclear fuel. The month before, the Wall Street Journal reported that China assisted Saudi Arabia in making a facility in northwest Saudi Arabia for extracting uranium yellowcake.

Infrastructure

Growing U.S. pressure on the Gulf could accelerate growing Chinese investment in Gulf infrastructure. Several of these arrangements are potential national security concerns as they involve big data, artificial intelligence, and companies tied to the PLA.

Huawei . Despite its efforts, the Trump administration was unable to prevent PLA-linked Huawei from making inroads into the Gulf. The Biden administration will lose any leverage to slow Huawei in the Gulf if the administration continues to needlessly pressure and distance itself from the Gulf states. In January, Huawei stated that it would open its largest store outside China in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In May 2020, Oman signed a memorandum of understanding with Huawei “in the field of artificial intelligence, electronic cloud and fifth-generation 5G Internet applications.” As of March 2020, the company stc Bahrain provided half of Bahrain’s population with Huawei’s 5G network, and Zain KSA, a Saudi telecommunications company, contracted with Huawei to provide a 5G network in October 2019.

Rail . In August 2020, UAE’s Etihad Rail signed a deal with PLA-linked CRRC Corporation to triple the number of wagons in its fleet. This followed an announcement in January 2020 that Khalifa University, Etihad Rail, and CRRC Qingdao Sifang were forming the China–UAE Rail Transit Technologies R&D Center in Abu Dhabi, “which will focus on new technologies in rail transit industry, especially in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), big data and new composite materials for railway applications.” In January 2019, Saudi Arabia signed a $10.6 billion contract with China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation for the “Landbridge Project,” which will connect Saudi Arabia’s west and east coasts via rail.

Ports . Growing Chinese activity in Middle East ports should be a cause for concern for the Biden administration, especially given the location of our troops and materiel in the region. As part of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China has targeted the top two ports in the Middle East: Dubai’s Jebel Ali and Saudi Arabia’s Jeddah Islamic ports. For now, the Chinese have stayed away from the third-largest port (Salala in Oman) because of a recent deal struck between Oman and the United States.

In January, Dubai’s DP World and China’s Zhejiang China Commodity City Group (CCC) launched Yiwu Market UAE in Jebel Ali. Yiwu UAE is a 200,000-square-meter wholesale and retail market that will partner with the Yiwu Market in China “to allow Chinese goods to enter Dubai expeditiously at competitive costs for seamless distribution across the Middle East, Africa, the Mediterranean and Europe.” This is the latest development in a $3.4 billion BRI deal signed in April 2019, which included a $2.4 billion “Trader’s Market” for Chinese products (of which the Yiwu Market UAE is a part) and a $1 billion “Vegetable Basket” Silk Road way station for food importation and processing.

Urban planning . Saudi Arabia is courting Chinese investment for its new high-tech city Neom, which “once completed in 2025, is expected to become the largest city entirely managed by artificial intelligence.” It is not beyond the stretch of imagination that Dubai will be courting Chinese investment in its newly launched Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan as well. In June 2020, the PLA-linked China State Construction Engineering Corporation Middle East completed a $220 million infrastructure upgrade project for Dubai’s roads and pipelines.

Energy . Shanghai Electric, along with Saudi ACWA Power, will develop a $564 million solar farm in Dubai. China’s JinkoSolar Holding, along with Japan’s Marubeni Corp., is building the Noor Abu Dhabi solar power plant. In December 2019, CCP-owned State Grid Corp. purchased 49 percent of Oman’s power grid. That followed news in September 2019 that State Grid Corp. and Abu Dhabi will look into the feasibility of energy projects including in clean energy and underground cables to connect the emirates and the UAE with other Gulf countries.

In efforts to ingratiate itself to Tehran, the Biden administration is willing to fundamentally change our relationships with our Gulf allies. This will be a strategic blunder, as hostile actors like China will fill the void. The Biden administration should shift course in the interest of our national security. Continuing arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, mending fences with MBS, strengthening trade with and investment in the Gulf, and pursuing a foreign policy of realpolitik in the region is the Biden administration’s best bet in keeping Chinese influence at bay and promoting peace in the region.",https://spectator.org/64437_liberal-silence-china/,2021-03-15
Biden Has Already Lost on China - The American Spectator,"Joe Biden will lose the election on China. America is a divided nation on seemingly every issue, but increasingly unified in opposition to China. But because Biden cannot join this unity of opposition, he is ceding this lopsided issue to President Trump.

For America, coronavirus has crystallized years of bad Chinese behavior. Almost 100,000 deaths, 1.7 million cases, 39 million lost jobs, and a locked-down nation have brought back to mind all China’s committed, but overlooked, sins.

Last week, the administration delivered to Congress a 16-page letter, which dispassionately outlined China’s past and ongoing transgressions. It puts them into three main categories: China’s challenges to America’s economy, security, and values. It also makes clear that, in contrast with previous administrations, China’s behavior will no longer be accepted: “The Administration’s approach to the PRC reflects a fundamental reevaluation of how the United States understands and responds to the leaders of the world’s most populous country and second largest national economy.”

Negative as the White House letter is, it may be less so than the American people’s feelings about China. A February Gallup poll (conducted 2/3-16) found Americans had a 33 to 67 percent favorable/unfavorable view of China. That yawning negative 34 percent gap was double Gallup’sFebruary 2019’s negative 16 percent.

A Pew poll in March (conducted 3/3-29) found an even larger negative gap of negative 40 percent. China’s favorability had fallen to just 26 percent, while its unfavorability stayed at two-thirds (66 percent).

Both polls recorded their highest negatives ever on China. Significantly, both occurred months ago. Since then, coronavirus has only worsened in America and globally, and China’s known role in it has only increased.

Congress did not need a White House letter to see which way the wind was blowing on China. Just last week, the Senate unanimously approved legislation to de-list companies (Chinese) from U.S. security exchanges if they do not allow U.S. review of their audits; it also saw bipartisan legislation introduced aimed at actions that could result from China’s upcoming imposition of tougher rule in Hong Kong. Recently, it had unanimously approved legislation addressing China’s oppression of its Uyghur minorities.

Amidst this swelling consensus, is Biden’s unique dissonance. It constitutes a perilously unique threat to his campaign. Biden is prevented from joining America’s growing animosity toward China, while Trump is more than able and willing to do so.

It is hard to label any from Biden’s hit parade of gaffes his worst — just wait a day and another entrant joins the litany — but the one with the biggest ramifications is his cavalier dismissal of China. Just a year ago in Iowa, Biden stated, “China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man. I mean, you know, they’re not bad folks, folks. But guess what? They’re not competition for us.”

Breathtaking then, Biden’s remarks are mind-boggling now. Patently wrong, they could not be more out of step with America’s sentiment or resentment. They also keep Biden from stepping up on China now.

To do so, he would have to explain away what no one could understand then. And the person least able to explain anything is Joe Biden.

The second reason Biden cannot criticize China now is that he strategically cannot afford to. Biden needs to keep his campaign’s focus (such as it is) on Trump. By joining America in shifting the focus onto China, he not only puts himself on the hook (via his earlier China jaw-dropper), he lets Trump off it.

The economy serves as case in point for Biden’s problem. Before coronavirus’s impact, the economy was Trump’s reelection résumé. Coronavirus’s economic hit finally gives Biden an opening to criticize what he heretofore could not touch. But criticism of China for coronavirus now means absolving Trump for the current downturn.

There is a common quip about untouchable issues in American politics being “motherhood and apple pie” — you cannot oppose them. So, politicians unite on these, because they must, and hasten to others to show their differences.

Biden’s biggest problem is that his biggest difference with Trump is also one he has with America: China. Biden is blocked from the most unifying and important issue in American politics. Make no mistake: Trump knows it full well. The letter he sent to Congress was really meant for Biden. All Biden can do is read it and weep.",https://spectator.org/64711_can-chinas-authoritarians-keep-economic-miracle-going/,2020-05-25
Biden Must Go All In Against China’s Tech Industry - The American Spectator,"This week, the Biden administration launched its newest offensive against China’s semiconductor market by blacklisting at least 30 Chinese companies, including top memory-chip manufacturer Yangtze Memory Technologies. The move came following the expiration of the 60-day window for the entities to comply with U.S. end-use verification checks.

However, there is no cause to celebrate yet. On the same day that the new sanctions were announced, Reuters broke the alarming news that the U.S. would be removing several Chinese entities from the export blacklist as a sign of cooperation between the two countries. Sanctioning some companies while leaving out others underscores a serious problem with the current administration’s track record with the PRC: the lack of effective enforcement of its competitive policies. As the PRC’s aggressive posture escalates, this administration must recognize China’s threat to both the international order and American hegemony and thus reorient its strategy to challenge Beijing’s militancy.

The Biden Administration Is Holding Back Its Enforcement Action

Since taking office, President Joe Biden has struggled between competing and engaging with Beijing. This is not to say that Biden is simply appeasing Beijing’s malign activities. Alongside the CHIPS Act, the White House has sanctioned numerous Chinese companies and officials, passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, called for stronger relations with its Indo-Pacific allies, and kept some of the Trump-era tariffs and export controls.

However, the administration is hindering the damage it could do to the PRC by not thoroughly enforcing its sanctions on Beijing. For example, Reuters found that over 300 export licenses worth $103 billion were given to suppliers of two blacklisted Chinese tech giants, Huawei and the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Beijing’s main chip manufacturer, despite the Biden administration’s recent attempts to clamp down on Chinese tech.

Even more troubling is the fact that the Bureau of Industry and Security, which is responsible for enforcing export controls on sanctioned entities, denied less than 1 percent of licenses for the two companies from 2020 to 2021, according to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

The Biden Administration Continues to Trust China Despite Having Every Reason to Not

Furthermore, Biden’s recent semiconductor sanctions, while laudable, are undermined by his misplaced trust in Beijing. While about 30 Chinese companies were added to the Entity List, at least 26 other corporations and individuals were absolved from further inspection by the Bureau of Industry and Security. According to Reuters, a U.S. official said that the decision was made “thanks to greater willingness from the Chinese government to permit U.S. site visits,” meaning that exporters “will no longer have to conduct additional due diligence before sending goods to the Chinese entities.”

Removing Chinese companies from export controls is unfortunately not a new phenomenon for this administration. Chip manufacturer Nanchang O-Film Tech and tech giant Xiaomi were removed from the Entity List under Biden’s watch despite their ties to the Chinese military and to human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Even the Bureau of Industry and Security’s October restrictions announcement stated that nine entities would be removed from any export-controls list.

As former Bureau of Industry and Security analyst Nazak Nikakhtar warned before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, China is “notorious for falsifying records and diverting exports of controlled items to unauthorized end users within the PRC,” meaning that American tech could be sent off to the People’s Liberation Army and the Bureau of Industry and Security would have no idea. Yet, the current chief of the Bureau of Industry and Security, Alan Estevez, commended the PRC for being “forthcoming” and having a “change of attitude” regarding end-use checks, while Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo encouraged further exports to Beijing to promote greater “connectivity with the Chinese people.”

Biden’s Approach to China Is Marked by Internal Contradictions

The rhetoric and actions of the administration do not signal a commitment to blunting Beijing’s technical dominance. Instead, they reveal internal contradictions that continue to plague Biden’s China policy. When peeling back the headlines, Biden’s competitive streak and tech campaign is a mixed bag. The policies are good but lack effective enforcement to do any long-term damage. Raimondo and Estevez should not be lulled into a false sense of security by Beijing’s promises. As Forbes international tech writer Roslyn Layton put it, “The Chinese government is a world-class force for cheating and promise-breaking.” But why does the administration continue with these half measures instead of going all in against Beijing? The self-sabotaging could be because the president believes that the U.S. can engage with China on “transnational challenges” like climate change and the pandemic.

Perhaps the framing of the U.S.–China dynamic accounts for Biden’s off-balance approach. In last October’s National Security Strategy, the Biden team designated China as the strongest challenger to the international system instead of couching the PRC as a direct threat to America. This framework ignores Beijing’s true nature as a ruthless, genocidal, imperialist regime that the U.S. should be challenging. This administration instead rewards its adversary through export-controls removal, undermining its entire strategy. Biden needs to keep the pressure on Beijing and attack China’s hold on the global tech market with everything he has. There can be no half measures taken when protecting America’s national security interests.

Biden Plays Geopolitics With China and Russia — And Loses - The American Spectator,"Stephen Kotkin, Princeton professor, historian, and author of two magnificent volumes on Stalin (with a third planned), appeared recently on the Hoover Institution program GoodFellows with British historian Niall Ferguson, former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster, economist John Cochrane, and host Bill Whalen to discuss China, Russia, and the current world crisis. Kotkin conveyed insights on the nature of the Chinese and Russian regimes and the evolving war in Ukraine. It is well worth your time to watch, listen, and learn.

Kotkin began by bluntly stating the challenge we face in confronting China: “We’ve never had an economy this large run by a political system this opaque.” The Chinese regime is Leninist to its core, exercising a monopoly of political power in a country of more than 1 billion people. And it has been that way, Kotkin said, since Mao Zedong seized power in 1949. Western statesmen and businessmen, and some scholars, deluded themselves into believing that post-Mao China was evolving toward a pluralistic political society. Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leaders have studied Mikhail Gorbachev’s fall in the Soviet Union, he said. Don’t expect a Chinese Gorbachev to emerge in this opaque political system.

The CCP, Kotkin continued, is not motivated by economics. Its legitimacy does not depend on economic growth but, rather, on its control of the levers of power — a huge security apparatus that specializes in surveillance, control, and political repression. China’s remarkable economic growth since the 1980s, he explained, resulted from the hard work of the Chinese people in engaging in “market behavior” that the CCP tolerated but never really lost control over. So, the CCP created “special economic zones” where market economics thrived, but never outside of the watchful eyes of the party. This market activity encouraged the United States, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other free-market countries to trade with and invest in China. Productivity boomed. The standards of living for tens of millions of Chinese citizens greatly improved. The CCP did not cause this economic growth but hijacked it to serve the ends of the party — and took credit for it. And then it used it to become a military superpower.

Kotkin acknowledged that, at least in the 1970s and 1980s, there was a geopolitical component to the West’s embrace of China — exploiting the Sino-Soviet split to help undermine Soviet power. But after the Cold War ended, economics, or what Edward Luttwak called “geoeconomics,” replaced geopolitics as the motivation for the West’s continued engagement with China. The West, including the United States, took a geopolitical holiday and helped fuel China’s remarkable economic (and military) growth.

Kotkin applauded the Trump administration’s recognition that unrestricted engagement with China was folly. On the other hand, Kotkin said that the Biden administration plays geopolitics with a plus-30 handicap, with respect not only to China but also to Russia. Kotkin described Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime as a “praetorian guard” of 30,000–50,000 members who flourish even when the country suffers. It is similar to the old Soviet nomenklatura. Putin understands, according to Kotkin, that suppressing political alternatives is the key to staying in power, and he will likely be able to do that even if the war in Ukraine continues to go badly for Russia. Putin’s mistake in Ukraine was attempting to change the regime and install a pro-Russian regime on the cheap — similar to what the George W. Bush administration tried to do in Iraq. (READ MORE from Francis P. Sempa: Elbridge Colby Has It Right on Taiwan and Ukraine)

Putin (and U.S. President Joe Biden) underestimated the bravery and valor of the Ukrainian people, Kotkin said, and Ukrainian valor and Russian atrocities have thus far kept the West united in support of Ukraine. But, in the long run, Russian resources will likely enable Russia to hold on to some Ukrainian territory. Russia is inflicting terrible damage on Ukraine’s infrastructure (energy, transportation, and communication). Kotkin said that Ukraine’s definition of “victory” should not be our definition, and he suggested that the most realistic outcome of the war will be an armistice with compromises made on both sides.

Kotkin understands that in formulating policies to deal with the current world crises in Europe and the Far East, history is an indispensable guide. If only the Biden administration understood this, too, then America would be better prepared and equipped to successfully meet these geopolitical challenges.",https://spectator.org/65511_obama-kerry-talk-while-china-flexes-its-missile-muscle/,2022-11-18
Big Time China Whore Bailed Out Biden in Iowa - The American Spectator,"Hunter Biden’s business associates used the term “China Inc.” as a generic phrase to describe the Chinese system of enterprise that holds the door open for Americans with useful knowledge or influence. As is becoming more and more obvious, Hunter Biden was peddling influence.

If China Inc. has an all-time MVP, however, that award belongs to a man who came to China rich with knowledge and traded that knowledge for major dollars. In January 2020, that same man gave some of those dollars to a struggling Joe Biden. As the Politico headline phrased it, Bernard Schwartz was one of “the big donors bankrolling Biden onslaught in Iowa.”

Chairman of BLS Investments, the “Democratic megadonor” Schwartz made a six-figure donation to the super PAC Unite the Country. That PAC went on to spend $5 million just in Iowa. Its goal was to convince Democrats “skeptical of Biden’s weak fundraising in the presidential race” that Biden could win.

Although there is no obvious link between Hunter Biden and Schwartz, Schwartz had to see in the Bidens a continuation of the reckless and borderline treasonous legacy he helped establish during the Clinton presidency. In 1994, the ever-ambitious Schwartz, then chairman of Loral, shifted his area of interest from the defense industry to telecommunications, specifically a cellular satellite network. Not coincidentally, he was about to get interested in politics.

After the massacre of pro-democracy students in Tiananmen Square in 1989, Congress passed a law suspending the licensing of exports of certain items to China, including U.S.-origin commercial satellites for launch on Chinese vehicles.

To waive these suspensions, the president was obliged to report to Congress on a case-by-case basis that it was in the national interest to do so. By 1994, when Schwartz was seeking his own waivers, he had a good idea how to ease potential White House resistance.

In the early summer of 1994, Schwartz made a soft-money contribution to the DNC in the amount of $100,000. In two months, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown would be leading a major “presidential business development mission” to the People’s Republic, and Schwartz wanted to make damn sure he was on board. Once in China, Brown publicly praised Loral’s Globalstar cellular telephone system before an audience of Chinese telecommunications officials. Soon afterwards, Loral nabbed a $250 million cellular phone deal with the Ministry of Telecommunications.

Money talked. Before this election cycle was over Schwartz would officially donate more than $630,000 in soft money to the DNC, 50 times what he had given in the last presidential election. No Democrat gave more. In February 1996 Schwartz’s money mattered. The Clintons needed to feed the TV ad beast that resurrected their hope to regain the White House after a disastrous midterm election.

According to the New York Times, February 1996 represented a moment of keen impasse between warring forces within the Clinton administration. With his generous support, Schwartz surely was hoping to breach the enemy’s defenses.

The enemy in this case was his own Pentagon and intelligence community. Much to Schwartz’s frustration, they were standing firm on the question of commercial satellites. Given the vital technology contained therein, much of it secret, they had convinced Secretary of State Warren Christopher in October 1995 to keep the satellites on the so-called “munitions list,” an inventory of the nation’s most sensitive military and intelligence-gathering equipment.

Almost immediately, Deputy National Security Adviser Sandy Berger had begun plotting to undermine Christopher. A trade lawyer by profession, Berger had no real foreign policy experience before taking the job. According to the Times, critics described Berger as “the point man for the White House’s China policy.”

Still, despite Berger’s machinations, and the president’s obvious support, the serious professionals within State and Defense Departments were resisting the wholesale transfer of licensing authority for these satellites to the Commerce Department. Once moved to Commerce, the military feared it would lose veto power over exports.

On February 6, 1996, Chinese arms dealer turned satellite mogul Wang Jun came to Washington. It was an only-in-America kind of moment. Wang Jun, who had cut arms deals with Chinese allies in places like Libya, Iran, Serbia, Iraq, and Afghanistan, now found himself at a cordial private coffee with — of all people — the president of the United States.

Clinton pal Charlie Trie had greased the Wang Jun meeting with a $50,000 payment. To the president’s humble credit, as the Senate’s Thompson Committee would later report, he did admit that the meeting with the PLA arms dealer, Wang Jun, was “clearly inappropriate.”

The president did not apologize, however, for signing waivers for four more satellite launches by Chinese rockets on that same February day. The president approved these waivers despite reports the month before that China continued to export nuclear technology to Pakistan and missiles to Iran, the latter deal Wang Jun was suspected of brokering.

Just a week or so after Wang Jun’s excellent Washington adventure, a Chinese Long March 3B rocket carrying the Loral-built Intelsat 708 satellite crashed just after liftoff and killed or injured at least 60 people in a nearby village. This was the third Long March failure in the last three years involving U.S.-built satellite payloads.

The Pentagon welcomed the news. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the People’s Republic had emerged as America’s most serious potential enemy. American technical advice was making Chinese missile-rattling more than an empty threat. And yet in their relentless drive to raise money, the Clintons were fully prepared to broker that advice.

In March 1996, Berger managed to finesse a compromise that sent satellite control to the fatally corrupt Ron Brown at Commerce and cost the Pentagon its veto power. After reviewing thousands of pages of documents, the Times “found no indication that Mr. Christopher was personally involved in the president’s decision.”

In a likely show of contempt for both the president and of democracy in general, the People’s Republic of China celebrated the decision by lobbing a few ballistic missiles into Taiwanese waters during Taiwan’s March democratic elections.

Indifferent to the fate of Taiwan, and feeling confident about his relationship with the president, Schwartz up and dispatched a Loral-led review team to China to assess the February 1996 failure of the Long March 3B rocket and suggest refinements. The House Cox Committee would later describe Schwartz’s actions as “an unlicensed defense service for the PRC that resulted in the improvement of the reliability of the PRC’s military rockets and ballistic missiles.”

So serious was the offense that in 1998 the Criminal Division of the Justice Department launched an investigation. Incredibly, while the investigation was in process, Berger, now national security adviser, sent a memo to the president urging him to “waive the legislative restriction on the export to China of the communications satellites and related equipment for the Space Systems/Loral (SS/L) Chinasat 8 project.”

This waiver would present a huge problem for the prosecution. Berger admitted as much: “Justice believes that a jury would not convict once it learned that the president had found SS/L’s Chinasat 8 project to be in the national interest.” But Berger was not about to let that stop him: “We will take the firm position that this waiver does not exonerate or in any way prejudge SS/L with respect to its prior unauthorized transfers to China.” Berger was blowing smoke, and he knew it. A waiver would make prosecution all but impossible.

The president could only issue a waiver, however, if it served America’s “national interest.” Berger made an almost comically specious case that it did, arguing satellite technology would give remote Chinese villagers access “to people and ideas in democratic societies.” During these misbegotten years, one trembles at what the villagers might have learned about American democracy.

For its part, Loral had no greater cause than its own bottom line. “If a decision is not forthcoming in the next day or so, we stand to lose the contract,” Loral lobbyist Thomas Ross wrote Berger. “In fact, even if the decision is favorable, we will lose substantial amounts of money with each passing day.”

So much for the national interest. Ross then added the kicker, sure to win the president’s heart. “Bernard Schwartz had intended to raise this issue with you at the Blair dinner, but missed you in the crowd.” Schwartz knew he had a friend in the White House. The president approved the waiver, and the prosecution came to naught.

During his first term President Clinton faced strong resistance from the genuine liberals within the administration and at least token resistance from the media. In the margin of a December 1995 document, for example, senior adviser George Stephanopoulos scrawled a vulgar note strongly criticizing the president’s China policy. The Times did do a series of hard-hitting articles on China, albeit after Clinton’s reelection was secured.

That resistance has disappeared. If proof were needed, that same Stephanopoulos failed to question Joe Biden about the story dominating the news the day of ABC’s Town Hall — Hunter’s influence-peddling in Ukraine and China. Schwartz used to be an outlier among his fellow Democrats. Now he’s the norm. Now they are all China whores, and the media are their pimps.

Blizzard From Red China Blows Across the Video-Gaming Community - The American Spectator,"International video game giant Activision-Blizzard has been caught in a veritable storm of bad press after a decision was made this week to suspend a professional player and tournament winner of its digital card game Hearthstone.

Chung “Blitzchung” Ng Wai, a Hong Kong native, had participated in an interview with two Taiwanese hosts after a tournament match during which he donned a mask and said, “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.” Blizzard laid the hammer on Blitzchung, who was banned for a year and forced to hand over his tournament earnings. Even more shockingly, the video game giant also fired both reporters who conducted the interview, despite their lack of participation in anything having to do with protesting China’s treatment of Hong Kong.

Of course, this sparked immediate outrage from the gaming community. Reddit, a locus of the Blizzard fandom, second perhaps only to the official forums, had multiple threads on the subject reach the front page, with hundreds of thousands of people disavowing Blizzard’s behavior. Even now, it remains awash in anti-Chinese and Blizzard-related memes.

Longtime fans of the company’s games boycotted in anger, vowing to never play Activison-Blizzard games ever again and deleting their accounts. Longtime Hearthstone professional player and caster Brian Kibler quit an upcoming convention called BlizzCon. U.S. Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) publicly shamed the company on Twitter. And a Norwegian parliament member, Grunde Almeland, sent the company a letter warning it may not be welcome to host tournaments in the country unless it reverses its decision to blitz Blitzchung.

It’s good to see that this despicable display united both sides of the political aisle. The cowardly assault on free speech in Hong Kong by the communist Chinese government has finally brought bipartisanship back to the Swamp.

Blizzard “justified” its ruling in an announcement on October 8, 2019. But the company’s strange behavior at this point escalated. Shortly afterwards, its Reddit page became invitation-only. Players reported being banned for more than 1,000 years on Blizzard forums. A coach for another Blizzard game, Overwatch, was told to delete a tweet criticizing the treatment of Blitzchung. A company that offered to reimburse Blitzchung’s winnings and offered him a spot in its own game, Gods Unchained, came under undisclosed cyberattacks.

The most egregious aspect of the whole sordid episode is that Blizzard caved and offered an apology — to the Chinese. On the Chinese social network website Weibo — which is heavily censored by its oppressive government — Blizzard’s Chinese Hearthstone account released a statement apologizing for the behavior of Blitzchung and stating that “we will always respect and defend the pride of our country.”

Such behavior only goes to show how far companies are falling over themselves to appease President Xi Jingping and his communist censorial cronies. It should come as no surprise that Chinese gaming giant Tencent owns about 5 percent of Activision-Blizzard stock. Caving to the demands of the Chinese is part of its modus operandi. Blizzard refers to its tournaments and broadcasts in Taiwan as “Chinese Taipei,” after all, words coming straight from the playbook of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). It certainly feels as though Blizzard is bowing to censors of an oppressive regime, if not outright imitating its practices, all to refrain from upsetting the communist apple cart.

Perhaps you aren’t an avid video game player, and this whole situation seems irrelevant to you. But countless U.S. companies are doing the same thing to maintain access to the Chinese market. How about tech giant Google, which you no doubt use in some form of your daily life? It worked with China to enact censored internet search engines. Apple, another U.S. tech giant, removed a protester-friendly app in an attempt to shut down gatherings not approved by the Chinese government. And how about the National Basketball Association, which offered a tepid apology after executives, including Commissioner (or Comrade?) Adam Silver, got on their knees to grovel to the Chinese.

Unfortunately or fortunately (depending on your perspective) for companies “lowering their ideals of freedom to suck on the warm teat of China,” as South Park so elegantly put it in a recent episode called “Band in China” (which, fittingly, got the show banned and scrubbed from the Chinese internet), people are noticing. American companies are no longer able to get away with supporting the oppressive regime that is waiting for the moment to crush the freedom movement bubbling in Hong Kong.

Corporations can no longer stand idly by, pretending to be independent actors, unaware of the mass human rights violations perpetuated by the PRC, just to make a quick buck. Public anger, boycotts, and mockery are all being employed to rattle these cowardly companies. Good news: this pushback appears to be working. We should never compromise our American ideals for the sake of a dictatorial government directly opposed to everything the United States stands for.

Braving the China Seas - The American Spectator,"It’s called the “South China Sea” and China wants everyone to recognize it just that way. There is no question in Beijing’s official mind that this body of water is entirely within Chinese sovereignty. The problem is that Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Taiwan all have claims to a portion of that immense body of water by virtue of the fact that portions of their countries are bordered by that sea. This is to say nothing of the competing claims over the Paracel and Spratly Islands. The Chinese attitude is that these are all spurious claims and only they — and their navy and air force — can lawfully operate on, in, and above these, up till now, international waters. Everyone else should get their permission. By the way, this assertion is now extended to include the East China Sea, much to the consternation of Japan.

Admiral Robert Willard, commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific, in most diplomatic terms characterized the increasingly assertive Chinese claims to these waters and islands in the region as “generating increasing concern broadly across the region and require address.” When you have the firepower available to Admiral Willard you can afford to speak that softly. An Indian Navy official wishing to remain anonymous responded to a Chinese warship’s demand that an Indian assault vessel visiting Vietnam identify itself. He put the matter in more stark terms: “Any navy in the world has full freedom to transit through these waters or high seas [South China Sea]. For any country to proclaim ownership or question the right of passage by any other nation is unacceptable.”

The Vietnamese were furious over the incident but allowed foreign diplomats to muster the appropriate aggressive tone without comment from Hanoi. There was no question in Vietnamese diplomatic circles that what had happened was a clear challenge by the Chinese not only to New Delhi and Hanoi but to all who enter their pond without notification.

The American/Chinese military exchanges are very carefully managed and Admiral Willard’s attendance at the Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Beijing was noteworthy as the first military bilateral contact on an upper level since China suspended such meetings in January 2011 after U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. During this carefully maintained and ostentatious non-contact, there has been a flurry of Chinese publicity over its defense capability.

Beijing’s space program along with its shore-based, anti-ship intermediate missile development has brought significant comment. A prototype of an advanced stealth jet fighter has been rolled out. Most importantly, the beginning of sea trials was announced for the now reconstructed Soviet era aircraft carrier obtained from Ukraine in 2007. Supposedly this remodeled ship will be the centerpiece of a blue water Chinese Navy battle group within several years.

The PLA Navy has used every occasion to utilize the American call for “transparency” to boost its own profile. As quoted nearly a year ago, Tang Jianqun, a military expert at the China Institute of International Studies, said, “For China, transparency means transparency of strategy, not of operational detail.” Frankly, some would say that is an overly convenient definition.

Countering the Chinese attempt to dominate the whole of the South China Sea is Vietnam’s decision to reopen the Cam Ranh Bay base to foreign naval vessels. Engineering efforts with Russian aid began this past summer to accommodate visiting ships. It’s rumored in Hanoi that this means visits by both Russian and U.S. vessels. There’s been no public announcement, but the Chinese naval intelligence attachés certainly can catch the drift.

Meanwhile the economic aspects of China’s ambitions in the South China Sea proceed apace. Continuing conflict exists over the various areas of oil and gas deposits. Fishing rights and key trade routes are also high on the list of contested issues. In addition to these very important economic matters is the highly strategic value to China of the control of this immense body of water that borders so much of its mainland. Of course the same could be said about the other countries in this multi-party contest; but such arguments do not register with Beijing at all.

Since the end of the war with Japan in 1945 the United States Navy and its allies have maintained a de facto authority over the Pacific. China has given notice that it does not accept any sense of this Pax Americana and implicitly intends to challenge the concept through its declared naval buildup. The result of this is that the other nations of the South and East China Seas have to take into strategic consideration existing and future Chinese ambitions even while deferring to the traditional predominant role of the U.S. Navy.

In other words, the South and East Asian nations are asking themselves, “Will the big dog of today still be the big dog tomorrow? And how far away is tomorrow?”",https://spectator.org/6739_chinas-nukes/,2011-09-16
Korea’s BTS Defeats China’s PC Warriors - The American Spectator,"T he South Korean K-pop group BTS rules the music world. It’s not my schtick, but that apparently means I am almost alone. Most of humankind understands it is not wise to challenge BTS’s followers, as angry Chinese social media mavens found after criticizing the seven young South Koreans for not celebrating the PRC for having attempted to subjugate the Republic of Korea and deliver it to the vicious misrule of Kim Il-Sung.

It should surprise no one, even Chinese, that South Koreans look more favorably on American than Chinese intervention in the Korean War. On June 25, North Korea’s Kim, chosen by occupying Soviets to create another oppressive satellite state under their control, launched an invasion of the ROK. That triggered three and a half years of war.

Most of the peninsula was ravaged. Both national capitals were wrecked. Seoul changed hands four times. Millions of people were killed. Millions more were injured. Additional millions were displaced. The impact of that horrid war lingers seven decades later, with a divided peninsula, heavily armed border, lurid war threats, and divided families.

All this goes back to self-proclaimed “Great Leader” Kim’s visions of grandeur and conquest.

Left alone he would have prevailed. Over the last seven decades the people of south as well as north on the Korean peninsula would have lived under one of the most oppressive tyrannies on Earth. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was a horror even by communist standards, outstripped only by Albania, perhaps, in the degree of conformity and submissiveness demanded by rulers acting as gods. And Kim was determined to inflict his selfish grandiosity on all Koreans.

That did not happen only because U.S. President Harry S. Truman reacted by sending desperately ill-prepared American forces into battle. The Korean peninsula did not much matter to the U.S. directly — before 1945 Washington had never concerned itself with which “whale” was in control of the “shrimp,” as Korea and its neighbors had been known. Once dominated by China, the peninsula became a Japanese prize of war, only to be detached by the victors after Tokyo’s 1945 defeat. Bordered by communist giants the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China, the peninsula almost seemed indefensible.

Washington, however, had helped set up the combustible environment: dividing the peninsula, establishing a combative authoritarian as president of the ROK, refusing to provide the South’s military with heavy weapons, and withdrawing America’s garrison in the face of an aggressive Kim backed by the Soviet and Chinese regimes.

Having done much to bring catastrophe down upon South Koreans, the U.S. could not honorably stand by.

Once America was involved, liberation of North Korea beckoned. Don’t just push the aggressor back across an artificial border when he faced total defeat. Instead, why not end Kim’s vicious misrule entirely?

The answer, it turned out, was Mao Zedong’s fear, not entirely unfounded, of allowing the U.S. military on its border. After all, Republicans, at least, were dedicated to rolling back the Chinese Revolution. Unfortunately, since Washington refused to recognize the PRC, which had displaced the American-backed Nationalists led by Chiang Kai-shek, there was no communication between the two governments. One could imagine an agreement for an allied halt, whether at the old border along the 38th parallel or a new line further north, such as between the peninsula’s narrow neck from Pyongyang to Wonsan. Leaving even a smaller North Korean buffer state might have foreclosed Chinese intervention.

Alas, the U.S. and its allies instead drove toward the Yalu and were attacked by hundreds of thousands of Chinese “volunteers” sent by Mao. The war did not end at Christmas 1950, as Gen. Douglas MacArthur had promised, but ran another two and a half bloody years, until July 1953. Although Beijing’s attempt to force South Koreans under Kim’s ultimately suffocating totalitarian system failed, death and destruction continued mercilessly. It is impossible for any South Korean to view Chinese intervention as a positive.

Thus, when BTS received the Korea Society’s James A. Van Fleet Award, named after the commander of the U.S. and United Nations forces during most of the Korean War, the group naturally lauded the shared sacrifice of American and South Korean military personnel. It was their loss that allowed the singers and the rest of their countrymen and women to live in what has become a free and prosperous society.

But Chinese nationalists erupted against BTS, decrying the group’s failure to also applaud the PRC’s soldiers, who sought to kill, capture, and enslave South Koreans a couple generations ago. (What should the musicians have said? “We thank the PRC and its armed forces for having attempted to prevent us from gaining the liberty and opportunity to do what we love and makes us happy. How grand that they cared enough to kill so many members of our grandparents’ generation and destroy so much of the country in which we live! Why, they almost prevented us from being born.”) There were even Chinese calls to boycott the boy band.

It turns out that few people, Chinese included, paid any attention to the latest nationalistic nonsense. Certainly, there was no noticeable impact on the group’s sales, as it managed to simultaneously capture the No. 1 and 2 spots on America’s pop charts. Attorney S. Nathan Park observed, “China’s media offensive against the kings of K-pop barely lasted two days. Global Times quietly deleted some of its articles criticizing BTS, and the negativity against the group in Chinese social media also faded quickly.” People’s failure to heed such a foolish, self-serving complaint demonstrates cynicism toward and even hatred of the PRC’s increasingly totalitarian politics.

China still draws admiration for its recent development and increasing economic successes. But no one truly respects or praises President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party as they take the PRC backward in history toward the inglorious murderous Maoist past. The world must wonder, what next? An international Cultural Revolution against anyone who does not venerate Xi’s image and thought? The latest Pew Research Center survey documents a veritable collapse in China’s international favorable ratings.

Although the short-lived attack on BTS cannot be blamed on the Xi government, the underlying rabid, thoughtless, and imperialistic nationalism well illustrates Beijing’s current approach to its neighbors. China’s over-the-top response to South Korean participation in America’s THAAD missile defense system led to a wholesale reconsideration of Seoul’s relationship with the PRC. The BTS incident, despite its abortive nature, is likely to reinforce South Korean concerns about its large and potentially threatening neighbor.

Seoul is right to be wary about the danger of being dragged into U.S.–China disputes of little importance to the ROK. Nevertheless, South Korea has good reason to broadly align with its neighbors and America to constrain Chinese ambitions. Xi Jinping’s rule threatens human liberty well beyond the PRC’s borders. The BTS furor offers a helpful reminder that countries and peoples within China’s reach, such as the South, should be prepared to respond in their own defense.

California Takeout: When China Enjoyed Free Rein in the Clinton ’90s - The American Spectator,"El Monte, CA

Since my first investigative piece on China’s commercial and intelligence operations in March 1995[1], I had published a half-dozen magazine-length articles in The American Spectator that exposed China’s U.S. networks. Some of these involved Chinese intelligence operations to fund the political campaigns of Bill Clinton. Others focused on Chinese investments on Wall Street or money-laundering. I became fascinated by the sheer number of Chinese front companies I was starting to unearth in Southern California. Many of them were engaged in real estate investing, and turned out to be secret bolt holes for the Princelings, the wealthy children and relatives of top Communist Party officials. Others were not-so-secretly stealing U.S. military technology.[2]

I was flying out to Los Angeles several times a year, staying in Marina del Rey so I could roller blade along the beach up to the Santa Monica pier in between my visits to the area I began calling “El Monte Central.” This was a cluster of suburban sprawl homes, office buildings, and strip malls ten miles east of Los Angeles on either side of the Santa Monica-San Bernardino freeway.

Soon I discovered something that was impossible to know unless you were actually on the ground. As I scoured the lobby directory at one nondescript office building, 9300 Flair Drive in El Monte, I found a half-dozen companies with offices on the sixth floor. But when I went up the elevator, more than forty companies had actually hung shingles on those same office suites. They had names such as Affirm Well Management, Bo Cheng International, Chang Da International, Chinauto, Guanxin Enterprise (USA), Hailicheng Trading (USA), Hairui International (USA), Hongteng International Corp., Jintime Comfort, Lirong (USA), Pan-China Investment, Plenty Fame (USA), Sang International Trading Ltd., and Xin Yu International.

Later, when I went to the Los Angeles County Clerk’s office in Norwalk and examined the corporate registry (yes, by hand), I found that fifty-five of them operated out of a single suite, which turned out to be the law office of two Chinese-American attorneys. None of these companies had listed phone numbers, which of course was odd if they were engaged in legitimate trade.

During these trips, I would regularly drive down to Long Beach to share my findings with “Lee,” a source at U.S. Customs. Lee’s main portfolio was arms smuggling, and he was actively chasing Chinese companies helping the Iranians to buy parts for their aging F-14 fleet from U.S. surplus and counterfeit parts manufacturers. But he was also watching the Chinese efforts to buy high grade aerospace components and production gear. I showed him my latest list of suspected People’s Liberation Army front companies and their local addresses. He chuckled when he saw it was 8-pages long.

“You’ve been busy,” he said.

Many of these companies had interlocking directors, I explained. One entity would be engaged in some form of import-export on behalf of the PLA, while another would be buying local real estate, apparently with the proceeds.

He got midway through the list and whistled.

“You’ve got to be kidding me.”

“What’d you find?”

“What do you know about these guys, Beta First, in Cerritos?” he said.

I explained that I found them through Dun & Bradstreet as a U.S. subsidiary of China North Industries, NORINCO, one of Communist China’s largest arms exporters. They claimed to be an optical-goods wholesaler.[3]

“Their office suite is located directly over the CIA liaison station to the Lockheed Skunk Works,” he said. “The Agency pukes are on the ground floor, the Chinese just above.”

He made a circular motion with his hands, as if operating an old-fashioned hand drill.

“Of course, the Chinese would never think of spying on the CIA.”

“I’m sure it never occurred to them,” I said.

Nor, apparently, had it ever occurred to the CIA that they had been made.

*****

NORINCO was not the only notorious PLA arms exporter doing business openly in the United States. One of my favorites was the Chinese Aerospace Technology Import-Export Company, CATIC. They were the ones who had purchased sophisticated production equipment from the B-1 bomber plant in Columbus, Ohio, a deal that formed my introduction to Chinese operations in the United States, ended my career with Time magazine, and landed me a new home in the conservative media.

For one story that appeared in The American Spectator in 1997, I interviewed Wang Meng, a CATIC official in Connecticut, after the company became embroiled in a dispute over purchasing F-14 production equipment from Northrop Grumman. “I don’t know what equipment was actually purchased,” he insisted. When told that Northrop Grumman had identified him as the purchaser, he fumbled: “I don’t know who put my signature there.” Finally, he said he was just following instructions from his head office. “I deal mainly in offsets and subcontracts for our exports to the United States.”

“What kind of exports?” I asked.

“Mainly fishing rods.”[4]

The more I learned about CATIC’s operations in the United States, the more I was fascinated. They had purchased production gear from aerospace plants in Maryland and Ohio, and owned real estate and dozens of front companies in California. What were they really up to? Was CATIC just an innocent aerospace company, legitimately buying parts and equipment from U.S. suppliers? If so, why all the corporate shenanigans and apparent efforts to mislead, disguise, and confuse?

I spent nearly two days at the Los Angeles county clerk’s office in Norwalk, combing through real estate records, corporate registries, mortgages and loans, searching for every company and property that might be remotely related to CATIC and its owners. I spent another full day in the L.A. courthouse downtown, looking up property tax payments, and sifting through civil and criminal court cases involving CATIC and related companies. I set up a data base on CATIC corporate officers and searched for other companies they owned under their own names. And then I tracked the officers of those new companies and their holdings.

I found some 40 CATIC companies, all with interlocking ownership and corporate boards, run by a half dozen PRC officials who rotated in and out of California. Just to confuse anyone trying to track them down, they regularly inverted their Chinese names, so that a last name search would not reveal the connections. Some of them also used Americanized forms of their names interchangeably with the Chinese names, just to add to the confusion. For instance, Michael D. Q. Li, listed as Manager of CATIC (USA) Inc., appeared as the U.S. agent of a CATIC front company, Tal Industries, under the name of as Quang Li. The only way of connecting the two was through the chance discovery of a shipping document made out in Quang Li’s name that gave me the name of a freight forwarder in El Segundo, California. A call to that company made it clear that Michael D.Q. Li and Quang Li were one and the same. Rare are the journalists or news outlets that do that type of investigative work anymore.

My story on the CATIC network, called “California Takeout,” received its name from my chance discovery of the eating habits of CATIC officers, which I parodied in the opening paragraphs. Arriving at 9645 Telstar Avenue in El Monte one day at lunch hour, I asked to interview CATIC president Mingqi Zhao. Katie de Sena, the dragon lady who doubled as receptionist, Notary Public, and Foil Extraordinaire, informed me he was not available. I insisted on waiting, causing her anger to rise almost as high as the piled coils of her graying hair, until an office worker came in carrying Chinese takeout from a nearby Panda Express.

“I hava Mista Zhao lunch,” he announced gaily as the door shut behind him.

The smoke rose from the piles of Ms. De Sena’s hair as she glowered at me.

“He owe me six dolla sevny-five,” the fellow said.

The lunch menu gave me an idea. I made mental notes of the office layout and, when it was clear that Mr. Zhao was not going to see me no matter how longer I hung out in his reception area, I went downstairs. After the glass door fell shut behind me, I turned around to take pictures of the building. I made sure I was directly in front of the security camera, and faced the main entry. What the security camera couldn’t detect was the slight angle of my camera.

*****

When I got back to my hotel I grabbed a quick dinner and went to sleep early, setting my alarm for 3 a.m. I reckoned it wouldn’t take more than a half hour to drive the thirty miles back to El Monte on the freeway in the dead of night. I was right.

I had located the service entrance earlier on, and sure enough, a blue dumpster had been pulled outside at the end of the day, awaiting the early morning trash collection. I drove a few blocks past the building. When I was certain that no one was out walking and no office windows were still lit, I turned around and parked right next to the dumpster. As far as I could tell, there were no security cameras here.

The dumpster was full, and luckily, a quick survey with my flashlight showed that all the garbage had been bagged. I leaned into it and started hauling out bags, leaving behind those that appeared to be filled with actual garbage. I settled on a half dozen large white plastic garbage bags that were mostly filled with papers. My heart pounding, I threw them into the trunk of my rental car and slowly drove out of the neighborhood. A car was coming toward me from the freeway exit. Had they seen anything? Had there been a security camera by the dumpster I had missed? I was prepared to just keep on driving if challenged, unless by the police. After all, according to the law whatever you threw in the trash in a public area was no longer personal or corporate property. Dumpster diving was fair game.

Thirty minutes later I arrived back at my hotel and started examining my haul in the covered (and thankfully, open air) parking garage. The first bags contained the leftovers from Mr. Zhao’s Panda Express takeout — hence the title I chose for my story. Mixed in with the dripping Sichuan hot sauce and leftover rice and dumplings, I found a treasure trove of corporate documents. Some of them had been torn hastily, but the pages still stuck together so it was easy to reassemble them. CATIC had not yet discovered the virtues of office shredders. They would soon.[5]

For several hours I reassembled documents with scotch tape, wiping them with paper towels. From that early morning foray, I learned where CATIC banked. I learned about secret real estate investment deals. I learned about a broader network of companies I had never heard of before, owned by CATIC officers.

But most remarkable were the shipping documents I found amidst Mr. Zhao’s Sichuan chicken. That very afternoon, a previously unknown CATIC front company called TAL Industries booked space through a local Chinese shipping agent to send a special consignment to the CATIC home offices in China. The contents? Military-grade GPS systems, made by Trimble Navigation in Sunnyvale, CA. The TAL booking request was signed by Mingqi Zhao, who as it turned out was president of both CATIC and TAL.

I shared those documents with my Customs source in Long Beach. He was familiar with the shipper. “They are a bad apple. We’ve subpoenaed them countless times.” But the GPS system had been decontrolled by the Clinton administration so his hands were tied.

In the end, I turned over my voluminous files on CATIC and hundreds of other Chinese front companies operating in the United States to Representative Christopher Cox (R, CA), who had been named to head a special commission to investigate Chinese espionage operations, and testified in closed session before his bipartisan panel.

The Cox commission, as it came to be known, finished its work on December 30, 1998, and immediately submitted its three volume report to the White House, which did nothing.

I remain convinced to this day that had the United States government acted at that time to curtail Chinese communist high-tech espionage and the high-tech trade, we could have delayed by a good twenty years the dramatic advances in Chinese military technology we are now having to confront today.

Canada’s China Appeasers: The Institute for Peace and Diplomacy - The American Spectator,"The featured article on the National Interest on Sunday called for an end to America’s “securitized competition” with China. It is written by Pounyan Kimiayjan and Johnsen Romero of the Institute for Peace & Diplomacy (IPD), which describes itself as “a non-profit and non-partisan North American international affairs think tank operating in the United States and Canada dedicated to promoting dialogue, diplomacy, prudent realism, and military restraint,” which are, according to IPD, “the four cornerstones of sustainable peace.”

Kimiayjan and Romero in their National Interest piece fault the United States for responding to China’s rise as an economic power with a policy of “securitization,” consisting of a military build-up in the region and a strategy of constructing regional alliances to contain China. They accuse Washington of “overstating security as the framework for competing with Beijing,” neglecting “multilateral economic arrangements in the region,” and failing to understand that the U.S.-China rivalry is principally a geo-economic, rather than a geopolitical, competition. And they cite a recent IPD “white paper” that calls on the U.S. to cease viewing the U.S.-China rivalry “from a militarist prism.”

IPD is largely a Canadian operation. Most of the members of its advisory board are Canadian scholars. And most of IPD’s work centers on promoting better relations between Canada and China.

The “white paper” referenced by the authors is titled “On the Brink: Averting a New Cold War Between Washington and Beijing,” and its authors are Johnsen Romero, Arta Moeini, and Christopher Mott. It appeared on the IPD website on November 15, 2021. The paper highlights “the role of securitization in projecting the false reality of a new Cold War” and emphasizes the notion that “geo-economic imperatives . . . underlie and precipitate” the U.S.-China rivalry. It mostly blames the United States for framing the competition as “an all-or-nothing ideological struggle” and “using nostalgically the rhetoric of a ‘new Cold War.’” It approvingly quotes former U.S. diplomat Chas Freeman who described Washington’s approach as “a distillation of American militarism” which provides “a rationale for unbounded defense spending.” The paper also accuses Washington of engaging in “artificial threat inflation,” and views China’s military build-up as defensive and intended for “domestic security” not foreign intervention and international force projection.

The United States, according to the IPD paper, has “over-securitized” the U.S.-China relationship due to “the prevailing climate of bellicosity in U.S. strategy toward China,” and is “obsessed” with Taiwan. Meanwhile, the authors write, “China’s strategic objectives appear more defensive and ‘near abroad’ than truly global in nature.” America’s bellicose policy and its tendency to “totalize every dispute” with Beijing, the paper warns, may cause China to “retaliate” by becoming more aggressive and hawkish. In other words, Chinese aggression is America’s fault.

Instead of containing or confronting China, the authors of the white paper recommend that Washington should give China “the recognition it desires” and treat it “as America’s equal while listening to and addressing China’s legitimate concerns.” Washington policymakers, the paper argues, should approach China with “targeted engagement and smart diplomacy” to “facilitate mutual understanding and clarify expectations in areas of contention and disagreement and to identify the . . . areas of shared interests . . . and common threats.” And America should “lessen its footprint in Asia and remain safely out of sight while assuaging Chinese worries about ‘containment.’”

There are uncomfortable echoes here of the 1970s detente policy, especially as practiced by the Ford and Carter administrations. We saw how that worked out — the Soviet Union attained strategic nuclear parity (and superiority in land-based missiles), developed a theoretical first-strike nuclear capability due to U.S. restraint, and went on a global geopolitical offensive until stopped by the Reagan administration’s more confrontational approach. Let’s not go down that path again. China’s aggressive moves in the South China Sea, its construction of a blue-water navy, its Belt and Road Initiative, and its increasingly hostile rhetoric are signs not of a satiated defensive regional power, but rather of an aspiring global hegemon.

The IPD’s website hosts other articles urging Canada’s leaders to adopt a more independent (from Washington) foreign policy so as not to further harm relations with China. The IPD, in other words, promotes appeasement of China’s Communist Party. It is not unlike the many “peace” organizations during the first Cold War that sought to ease international tensions by accommodating the rise of Soviet power. Some people — even smart people — never learn.",https://spectator.org/__trashed-2/,2022-01-18
Carbons Emissions in China: Is This the Time? - The American Spectator,"The climate change police have been rounding up the usual suspects this week, and states are starting to pull apart the new EPA regulations that aim to reduce carbon emissions in the U.S.

At most, these plans are expected to reduce global carbon emissions by a grand total of 4 percent by 2020, according to the Wall Street Journal. Experts admit that American efforts will be completely eclipsed by the developing world, but others counter that the ultimate goal of this complex regulatory mountain is to set an example for poorer countries, especially China. Reported the Journal:

“No matter what your view of climate change, these [U.S.] reductions will be dwarfed by increased emissions in other parts of the world,” said Stephen Eule, a vice president at the Institute for 21st Century Energy, part of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Connie Hedegaard, commissioner for climate action in the European Commission, which sets laws for the 28 countries of the EU, said the Obama administration announcement “is more than symbolic—it is a step that the rest of the world has been waiting for.” However, the U.S. proposal could spur China to be more aggressive in tackling emissions, she added. “Until now, they could be laid back and say that as long as the U.S. wasn’t moving, why should they? I hope this will inspire China” to act.

I think we should all be good stewards of the earth, and I hope that the United States of America always leads the world in all that is virtuous, lovely, and otherwise noble, but the following seems a bit more relevant to the discussion on China:

China’s Christians were celebrating their own community’s survival as much as anything else this Easter. The government decided to conduct a spring cleaning of Christian churches this year that culminated in the bulldozing of a large Protestant church.

Political dissidents in China continue to disappear without warning, then turn up again months or years later with horrifying prison stories and a sudden passion for being completely apolitical.

China is twenty-five years out from the Tiananmen Square massacre today. Twenty-five years ago, young Chinese were shot down fighting for government reforms China still doesn’t have.

China and Russia have been strengthening their ties of late, and leaders signed a deal last month that makes China Russia’s second largest market for natural gas.

Chinese continues to make aggressive moves in the South China Sea over territorial disputes that make Asia nervous; Vietnam and the Philippines in particular want international mediation.

With all this in mind, should carbon emissions really be the absolute top diplomatic priority with China?

China is determined to become an economic powerhouse, and its leaders have shown that they will do what is necessary to achieve that goal. They weren’t terribly interested in green technology—until they started selling solar panels to the U.S. Likewise, China will probably decide to curb its carbon emissions when and if its leaders find it economically advantageous. Until then, I question whether this issue is really where we should be putting our resources.",https://spectator.org/a-china-story-bob-woodward-chose-not-to-tell/,2014-06-05

Chairman of Disney for Ambassador to China? - The American Spectator,"Bob Iger, executive chairman of Disney, is reportedly “at the top of President-elect Joe Biden’s wish list” for several key ambassadorship positions, including the U.S. mission in China.

Such a pick would be an inversion of norms on Biden’s part. The allotment of ambassadorships in recent years has followed an unspoken set of rules: “difficult” assignments such as Russia or Saudi Arabia are given to career diplomats and political appointees with relevant experience, while cushy positions in places like Europe or New Zealand are given as rewards to prominent financial backers and bundlers.

The appointment to Beijing, not quite as high-stakes as Baghdad (at least not yet) but not a glorified vacation either, usually goes to an older or retired statesman. Iger is no diplomat and hardly a statesman, but he is one hell of a financial backer — to the tune of $250,000 straight into the coffers of the Biden Victory Fund.

A quarter of a million is a substantial amount, to be sure, but also a wise investment for someone like Iger. China was the second-largest market in the world for Disney movies in 2019 and may emerge from the pandemic bigger than America. Disney also has sprawling operations within China itself, and was bringing in $1 billion in yearly revenue from its Shanghai Disneyland park alone before the coronavirus hit.

Disney’s cooperation with Chinese authorities affects its entire production process. Its live-action remake of Mulan this year, panned by critics and activists alike on both sides of the Pacific, was filmed in the same province where China is conducting its ongoing detention of millions of Uighurs. To add insult to injury, the movie thanks the Chinese government in its credits.

Bob Iger is the most powerful person at Disney. He’s also the company’s biggest individual shareholder. As of July of this year, he holds a whopping 1,150,138 Disney shares, worth close to $200 million at current valuation. That’s over a quarter of his net worth, against which a $250,000 donation seems like a drop in the bucket. A 1 percent rise in Disney’s market capitalization would reward his generosity 10 times over.

To his (and Biden’s) credit, Iger is not clueless about his potential host country, like so many other bundler-ambassadors are. He personally oversaw the creation of the Shanghai Disneyland and fondly reminisces about it in his memoir, in which he describes the “constant balancing act” of tailoring an iconic American brand to Chinese sensibilities. He no doubt knows, and has worked with, some of China’s most powerful executives and politicians, and would be at home from day one. But is a chummy relationship with China’s rulers, who cheer on American decline at every turn, really what the U.S. needs at this moment in history?

At the end of the day, Iger’s unconventional background and financial interests may make him too risky of a pick even for Biden — at least one would hope so. Yet even the fact that he is being seriously considered is an unpromising sign of the incoming administration’s China policy, and signals to Beijing that Biden intends to keep the gloves on and the money flowing.",https://spectator.org/canadas-china-appeasers-the-institute-for-peace-and-diplomacy/,2020-12-19
China’s Very Good Year - The American Spectator,"The Year of the Rat, 2020, began poorly for China. Hong Kong was in an uproar, and its protesters were enjoying international sympathy. The Communist Party’s policies toward Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang were being widely condemned as excessive, even genocidal. Consumers, particularly in America, had begun to boycott Chinese goods in the backlash over pro-China censorship by the NBA, Blizzard Entertainment, and other ostensibly American companies. Tariffs had precipitated a dramatic decline in Chinese exports to the United States. The world had woken up to the Communist Party’s hegemonic ambitions, and it seemed that a pushback had begun under American leadership.

The ensuing eleven months have proven to be a disaster: for those who have lost their lives or livelihoods to COVID-19 and government incompetence, for those whose freedoms are being wrested away across the West and the world, for trust in public institutions and global bodies like the World Health Organization, and for unity here in the United States, where the mail-in election has turned into a fiasco like none other. And 2020 has also been a disaster for the global response to the Communist Party, which has, through a mix of brute force and opportunism, maneuvered into a stronger position than ever.

China and its communist bureaucrats have had a very good year.

Such an end to 2020 would have seemed absurd as the world watched the coronavirus tear through Wuhan in January and February. Cases were doubling every week, and despite Beijing’s staid demeanor about the whole situation, apocalyptic scenes of hazmat-suited officials and of patients lying in overcrowded hospital hallways were going viral online. The timing could not have been worse: it was Chinese New Year, and tens of millions were on the move into, out of, and through Wuhan, a hub city at the heart of the world’s largest high-speed rail network. Even as other countries began announcing dozens of cases, all eyes were on Wuhan as the official death toll shot past one thousand in early February and then three thousand in March.

As the Communist Party’s resources were being tested, so was its ideology. The story of Li Wenliang, the whistleblower doctor who was reprimanded by local authorities for “spreading rumors” about a viral outbreak and who later died of the coronavirus on February 7, became a lightning rod for criticism of the communist system’s repressiveness, incompetence, and emphasis on conformity.

All of this criticism was well-deserved, and indeed the communist government has the blood of many Britons, Americans, and Indians, in addition to Chinese, on its hands: it took over a month, from the first case of COVID-19 being identified on December 8, 2019, to the introduction of screening measures on January 14, 2020, for Wuhan officials to respond to the outbreak. China’s bureaucrats either denied or downplayed the risk of human-to-human transmission until the country’s Health Commission finally acknowledged reality on January 20. Had the situation been made clear to the world at least a few weeks prior, strict border controls might have spared many countries the worst of the pandemic.

But in a decisive twist of fate, China crushed its own outbreak even as it infected the rest of the world. The crackdown was brutal: videos emerged of Wuhan officials welding shut the apartment doors of infected citizens to keep them contained. But it seemed to work. Since mid-March, the country has declared virtually no new cases of coronavirus outside of international travelers. In the United States, meanwhile, case numbers continue to dominate headlines as states stumble through ruinous cycles of lockdowns. Whether China is truly virus-free or has merely ceased reporting the real numbers is almost beside the point: the factories are working again, and the party has, with the support of Western media, put on a clean face for the rest of the world.

In sum, the course of the pandemic has been a decisive, and wholly undeserved, success for the Communist Party on several fronts.

In American politics, the virus gave the Biden campaign and the media establishment a cudgel with which to clobber President Trump and to push for unacceptable curtailments of civil liberty. A Beijing-backed Biden takeover of the White House would place Chinese influence in the upper echelons of the American government, on top of removing Trump’s adversarial administration. Suppose that a President Biden “listened to the experts” and backed further indefinite lockdowns with the full force of federal mandate. Between that and an end to the trade war, Xi Jinping and his Standing Committee would be popping open baijiu to celebrate the end of American global leadership.

The pandemic has also allowed China to implicitly promote its authoritarian system as a viable alternative to America’s own. The Chinese government has been quick to praise its own decisiveness, while skeptics accuse it of fudging the case numbers. In either case, an authoritarian system — whether through its executive power or its ability to lie to its own citizens and the world — allowed China to reboot its manufacturing only two or three months after it had shut down. Its economy in 2021 is expected to be 10 percent larger than it was in 2019, while America’s economy suffers and Europe’s shrinks dramatically. For the first time in a decade, inbound mergers and acquisitions investment has surpassed outbound investment for China as investors bet that the Chinese middle class will buoy the coming recovery.

Potentially worse than the immediate effects of the pandemic will be the lasting question of culpability. The answer to the blame game had been unambiguous in the first few months of the year, when China and the World Health Organization (WHO) were caught in a series of bald-faced lies about the state of the outbreak. The waters have been muddied since then. According to Pew Research, 61 percent of people in the developed world believe that China did a bad job “dealing with the coronavirus outbreak,” compared to 37 percent with a positive view of China’s performance. Views on America, however, are substantially worse, with 84 percent responding “bad” to 15 percent “good.” The numbers for the WHO are exasperating: despite it kowtowing to the Communist Party and helping to downplay the outbreak during the crucial early days, nearly two-thirds of respondents in all surveyed countries reckon that the WHO did a “good job” with the pandemic.

Back in July, Pew found that almost 80 percent of Americans thought that the Chinese government deserved “a great deal/a fair amount” of blame for “the global spread of the virus.” A more recent poll, conducted by the Associated Press in September, found that only 47 percent of U.S. adults blame the “governments of other countries” (read: China) for the outbreak situation in the United States. By contrast, 56 percent assign significant blame to the U.S. government, including 79 percent of Democrats. The anger of Americans, and in particular Democrats, has been directed inward. To understand why, look no further than the Biden campaign’s line on coronavirus, pushed daily by CNN, that elected Republicans personally murdered two hundred thousand Americans. As the White House flips in January, you can bet that history will be rewritten to assign all blame for the pandemic to President Trump.

Growing Soft Power

The closing months of 2019 seemed, at the time, to be a turning point in the fight to resist the Communist Party’s growing foreign influence. Back-to-back headline-grabbing censorship scandals had combined into a conflagration that threatened to scorch the party’s credibility.

On October 2, 2019, Apple drew widespread media attention and criticism after it bowed to pressure from China and banned an app from its App Store that protesters in Hong Kong had been using to track police movements. On October 8, Activision Blizzard, a U.S.-based (but partly Chinese-owned) video-game developer and publisher, punished the winner of an online game tournament after he spoke in support of Hong Kong’s protest movement in a post-match interview. Even more memorable was the National Basketball Association controversy, in which China virtually severed its ties with the NBA over a pro-Hong Kong tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, causing the NBA leadership to apologize and reprimand him. The grassroots backlash against the association, and against every corporation that had acceded to Chinese pressure, was ferocious — the issue of foreign influence had suddenly become personal for millions of people. The Communist Party had at last overplayed its hand, and it appeared that a reckoning was imminent.

As it turns out, 2020 had other plans in store. Chinese attempts to censor foreign organizations have continued, and the targets of these attempts have complied at alarming rates. Despite this, media attention on the issue has all but ceased. In April of this year, the European Union agreed to self-censor in a letter published in China’s English-language newspaper China Daily, removing a reference to China as the source of the coronavirus outbreak. On June 10, a Serbian professional football club fired one of its players after his father criticized the Communist Party. Two days later, it was revealed that the now-ubiquitous videoconferencing company Zoom had suspended multiple users who were planning to use the platform to coordinate a commemoration of the Tiananmen Square Massacre. None of these incidents received much attention. When was the last time that anyone mentioned that millions of Americans now telecommute to work on an app that censors on behalf of the Chinese government?

Hollywood remains the quintessential example of corporate profit-seeking butting heads with free expression. Most Americans witness dozens of subtle attempts to shape their perception of China through Hollywood movies every year, whether in the form of inclusion (of the Chinese space station in Gravity, which saves the protagonist from certain death) or exclusion (of references to a zombie virus originating in China when World War Z was adapted from its source book). Disney’s live-action Mulan, though a flop with critics on both sides of the Pacific when released earlier this year, painted a picturesque image of Xinjiang despite the ongoing atrocities against Uighur Muslims there.

Chinese influence in Hollywood derives its potency from a nexus of money and corporate consolidation. The country’s censors allow in exactly thirty-four American films per year, and these coveted slots are fought over by the Big Five American film studios: Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, Walt Disney Pictures, and Columbia Pictures. Studios do not know whether their latest blockbuster will be admitted until it is shown in full to Chinese officials, leading to self-censorship from the beginning of the film creation process in a bid to maximize each movie’s chances of acceptance and therefore access to a box office worth billions of dollars. Consequently, dozens of movies that never make it into the Chinese market are nonetheless created with Chinese sensibilities in mind.

The major studios have every incentive to avoid offending China at all costs. Disney’s colossal size is a source of much resentment and envy in the entertainment industry, but it becomes a disadvantage when dealing with the Communist Party. It owns immensely profitable theme parks and other auxiliary operations across China — all of which could be hamstrung at a moment’s notice if its film distribution arm happens to cross a line regarding Tibet or human rights. This guarantees an unspoken commitment to self-censorship at every level of the corporation.

The continuing fallout of the pandemic will greatly accelerate this phenomenon. China began this year with a box office worth $9.7 billion to America’s $11.1 billion. Throughout the course of 2020, lockdowns have all but crippled the U.S. cinema industry, while China’s theaters began reopening in May. The Chinese market’s rise to the largest in the world, previously expected to occur sometime in 2021, has instead happened a year ahead of schedule. For studios looking to continue churning out blockbusters, access to China appears increasingly like a financial necessity more than a bonus.

Bitter Medicine

How should America and its allies counter China’s encroachment? Any response must first acknowledge what has not worked. The list is, unfortunately, long. The year 2020 has, in many ways, marked the death of the old pipe dream that communist authoritarianism can be undermined through Western soft power alone. This may still be possible in a place like North Korea, with its universal poverty and death penalties for consuming Western media. Chinese audiences are evidently not so easily swayed; the example of Hollywood demonstrates how China has turned Western soft power against the West.

It is also time to be realistic about the idea that America can educate a generation of Chinese college students to bring liberalism and democracy to China. As many professors and university administrations have discovered this year, such students are more likely to bring Chinese ultranationalism to America instead — and if they’re bringing anything back to China with them, it’s probably American technology.

Countering China’s attempts to hijack American soft power has also proven difficult. This May, Sen. Ted Cruz introduced the SCRIPT Act, prohibiting studios from accessing federal funds for movies that have been altered to suit Chinese censors. It is the strongest move yet by an elected representative to combat Chinese influence in Hollywood, and Cruz’s intentions are certainly sound. But the act, which Skopos Labs gives a 3 percent chance of being enacted, would be the equivalent of hunting ghosts. Would the U.S.government have the ability to pore through every iteration of every film script coming out of Hollywood for signs of appeasing China? Would it be politically or legally feasible to foist such an approach upon a closed-door system like the movie content creation industry? As aforementioned, the censorship process is subtle and implicit; rarely do the major studios take direct cues from the Communist Party. Indeed, many countries engage in film censorship and banning — Singapore, Egypt, even Australia to a lesser degree. China just has a large enough market that studios actually pay attention.

On the economy, the trade war has proven useful but not sufficient. As with the consumer backlash and most other things, the end of 2019 looked like a looming disaster for China, with its exports to the U.S. falling to one of the lowest levels in recent memory. By August, however, Chinese exports worldwide had rebounded to their third-highest level on record, and exports to the U.S. had increased to their highest level in over a year. According to the latest available data, the U.S. trade deficit with China stands at $34 billion, the highest since November 2018. China’s early reopening, combined with the fact that it manufactures a large proportion of the world’s medical equipment, has allowed it to turn a healthy profit during the pandemic.

Even if the trade war had gone exactly according to plan, however, it is very unlikely that it would have been a viable long-term solution. The proportion of China’s GDP constituted by exports halved since 2006, from 36 to 18 percent. Tariffs, if applied strategically, can protect certain American industries, but they cannot protect America’s relative economic clout.

Other protectionist measures have also shown to be wanting. The Trump administration’s campaign against Chinese technology giant Huawei, including banning it from using American components, has slowed but not prevented its growth. The company’s latest move was the launch of the Mate 40 phone in late October, which Chinese retailing giant JD.com reported selling out in just eleven seconds.

Clearly, a new approach is needed on top of what is already being tried. Elected Democrats are unlikely to have answers — “China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man,” to quote Joe Biden. Some on the left do have a few ideas, though. Matthew Yglesias of Vox made waves recently with his book One Billion Americans, which argues for a dramatic increase in the U.S. population through immigration and other initiatives with the express purpose of staying ahead of China. Yglesias is probably correct in thinking that letting in more immigrants will increase America’s GDP. For conservatives who find even current immigration levels excessive, however, it goes without saying that such a proposal would seem implausible.

Others on the right, like David P. Goldman of the Asia Times, have called for what Goldman describes as a “Manhattan Project” to retake the initiative in technological innovation. It is not sufficient to prevent China from appropriating U.S. technology — the U.S. must accelerate its creation of new technologies or inevitably fall behind, he argues. This could be accomplished by adopting parts of the Chinese strategy, such as massive government investment in capital-intensive industries, an alternative to the Belt and Road initiative, and incentivizing Chinese scientists to work for the U.S. instead. Of course, such actions would be a substantial pivot away from the laissez-faire status quo and would represent a small concession to China’s own strategy.

Regardless of what happens next, 2020 has left China with one Achilles’ heel despite its advances elsewhere. Between its lies about the pandemic and its interference in the business of other countries, enmity toward China has risen in opinion polls to its highest levels on record. Economic clout has so far mitigated most of the effects of this hostility. Countries buy masks from Chinese factories because there are few other options, just as they install Huawei’s 5G because it is half the price of its closest competitor. But make no mistake: China’s clients in many industries would be glad to switch sides should a workable alternative present itself. That is America’s opening for the decade to come.",https://spectator.org/carbons-emissions-in-china-is-this-the-time/,2020-12-30
China Will Win Only if America Allows It - The American Spectator,"In December 2009, the Global Language Monitor, a language-tracking company based in the U.S., declared that the “Rise of China” was the single biggest news story of that past decade. At the time, China’s GDP was barely over $5 trillion, and it had yet to overtake Japan as the world’s second-largest economy.

More than a decade on, Chinese nominal GDP stands at nearly $17 trillion. The nation has established itself as the cornerstone of almost every major global supply chain and is beginning to accumulate military capital at an eye-popping rate.

Wariness of China in Washington has gone from fringe to universal in a couple of years. For all of his repudiation of his predecessor, President Biden has largely retained Donald Trump’s rhetorical emphasis on China as an ambitious adversary (policy action, which will be discussed in more detail later, is a different story altogether). Biden has acknowledged the obvious fact that China wishes to supplant U.S. dominance and has taken pains to portray himself as a tough negotiator against Xi Jinping.

It’s not just Joe Biden or the Washington policy circuit that believes that China has, in some sense, arrived. The roasting of Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the March U.S.–China talks in Alaska is evidence that Chinese leaders have become confident, even boisterous, in their perceived position of parity with the United States. Blinken’s timid response to a humiliating sixteen-minute lecture by top Communist Party Diplomat Yang Jiechi did little to dissuade the projected image of Chinese power.

Surveys also point toward a sea change in perceptions of relative status. An October 2020 poll by Pew Research found that, even as views of China turned sharply unfavorable during the unfolding of the pandemic, a strong plurality of people in the developed world now see China as the world’s leading economic power.

Yet the 2020s will almost certainly prove to be an immensely challenging decade for the world’s most populous country. Even as it continues to grow in nominal strength, a combination of demography, overreach, and systemic economic flaws could conspire to stop China’s rise.

Against this backdrop, the Biden–Harris administration is sure to flounder in its attempts to form a coherent strategy on China. Blinken’s framing of Beijing as an all-in-one “competitor, collaborator, and adversary” has set the tone for a policy approach characterized by indecisiveness and confused priorities.

The self-defeating philosophy of America’s leaders, rather than Chinese competence, may be China’s best shot at preeminent status during this decade.

Sinotriumphalists and Sinoskeptics

Rarely in history does any geopolitical commentator have the privilege, enjoyed by Sinologists and China watchers today, of witnessing an aspiring empire grow in real time and at such an unprecedented rate. Naturally, the question of China’s near-future trajectory has spawned endless pages of expert speculation, much of it radically divergent.

On the one hand, there is the prevailing school of thought that is broadly confident about China’s continued growth in wealth and stature. Perhaps unintuitively, this faction is deeply divided in terms of actual warmth toward China or its ruling regime: it encompasses relatively pro-China academics and sources such as Kishore Mahbubani and Martin Jacques, staid China Watch journals like the Economist and the Diplomat, and American patriots like Tucker Carlson and Robert Spalding, who have built followings for sounding the alarm every other day on the Communist Party’s machinations.

The otherwise irreconcilable members of this camp are united by a general acceptance of the mainstream view that China has achieved or nearly achieved peer competitor status with the U.S., that it is becoming stronger still, and that it will soon bring down or radically reshape the U.S.-led global order of the post–Cold War period, barring a massive blunder or a change in U.S. posture.

This China-bullish view is the predominant one in American discourse, and for good reason: it seems to be the best interpretation of the best indicators. GDP growth, military capital growth, and infrastructure investment are among the key metrics in which China has either surpassed the U.S. or is on track to do so within the next decade.

Projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative and Made in China 2025, though more like branding exercises than truly coherent grand strategies, have managed to wow many foreign observers. The country is also making strides in innovation and research, an area that has traditionally been considered its Achilles heel. After controlling for the huge numbers of fraudulent or junk Chinese scientific papers, the Nature Index found that by 2020, China had achieved top-quality research output equivalent to about 70 percent of the U.S.’s own output, placing it well ahead of third-place Germany.

Given these datapoints, as well as the prevalence of China-bullish dogma across the political spectrum, contrarian voices are hard to find.

Nonetheless, they do exist. These China bears — we’ll call them “Sinoskeptics” — believe that Chinese power is overhyped and unsustainable or even outright illusionary.

The most (in)famous Sinoskeptic is, without a doubt, lawyer and author Gordon Chang. He is best known for his 2001 book The Coming Collapse of China, which argues that a combination of bad debt and the shock of foreign competition (China was then on the verge of becoming a member of the World Trade Organization) would cause the country and its regime to implode within ten years.

The book raised many interesting criticisms of the weaknesses of China’s economic model, and some of its key points — particularly regarding debt and inefficient state enterprises — are still in play today. Of course, it also utterly failed in its prediction of a collapse. When 2011 came and went without a Chinese implosion accompanying it, Chang wrote a follow-up article asserting that the much-anticipated collapse would occur in 2012. Although that deadline also expired uneventfully, Chang has remained a Sinoskeptic, albeit one who is noticeably less enthusiastic about providing exact dates.

Chang’s diminished credibility has opened the way for many other writers to take on the collapsitarianist mantle. The most high-profile of these is probably Peter Zeihan. A former vice president of the leading geopolitical research group Stratfor, Zeihan has written three books that collectively argue that the world’s countries (and especially China) are entirely at the mercy of American foreign policy.

A Reckoning on the Horizon

In his first and best-known work, The Accidental Superpower (2014), Zeihan makes the case that the “long peace” of the post–Second World War period is an aberration that persists exclusively because of America’s combination of naval supremacy and internationalist foreign policy. China, too, is an aberration; it is a unified nation and not a bunch of squabbling kingdoms (supposedly its natural state) only because America chooses to actively keep it together.

Zeihan points to China’s rapidly aging population, its challenging geography, and its dependence on massive food and energy imports as the country’s insurmountable weaknesses. Should the U.S. ever decide to stop protecting the world’s sea lanes, Zeihan predicts the immediate return of interstate and nonstate piracy, the collapse of the global system, the subsequent drying up of the imports that China needs to survive, and therefore the inevitable collapse of China as a unified polity.

The U.S., on the other hand, is going to be just fine in Zeihan’s model. Indeed, he expects it to be the only great power (not just superpower) left by 2030. His follow-up books The Absent Superpower (2016) and Disunited Nations (2020) stress that the U.S.’s effective energy independence as of the late 2010s has eliminated the last reason that American policymakers had to engage with the rest of the world.

Zeihan predicts that the U.S., with its abundant natural resources, the world’s best farmland, a near-perfect navigable river network in the form of the Mississippi River System, and two oceans to protect it from any outside threat, will retreat into isolationism beginning in this decade, dooming almost every other country.

Though certainly exhilarating, Zeihan’s model has its share of flaws. For instance, a proclivity toward geographical determinism frequently blinds him to the decisive, and growing, role of technology. The fact that China possesses a fifth of the world’s population but only about 10 percent of its arable land — historically a primary cause of cycles of civil conflict and famine — looks like less of a problem once advanced greenhouse and vertical farming technologies are factored in.

Specific arguments aside, the greatest shadow over Zeihan’s credibility has been his own minor case of Gordon Chang Syndrome. While working for Stratfor, Zeihan co-authored the group’s 2005 and 2010 decade forecasts, in both cases predicting that China would suffer a Japan-style economic meltdown and collapse by 2015 at the latest. In 2011, he followed up with a talk in which he claimed that the Chinese system would only last for another “three to five years.”

At the beginning of last year, Zeihan asserted a new deadline of 2030 for China’s collapse; four months later, he wrote a newsletter titled “The Beginning of the End of China,” in which he predicted that the pandemic-driven depression of Chinese exports would continue (in fact, exports and GDP growth rebounded almost immediately.)

But though the resilience of the Chinese economy has so far defied the likes of Chang and Zeihan, the Communist Party can only put off the structural flaws that they point to for so long. In particular, China’s addiction to debt-fueled growth combined with its approaching demographic problem may culminate in a period of Japan-style forced deleveraging and stagnation sometime in the next two decades. An outright collapse is possible, but implausible — though putting it that way is unlikely to sell many books.

Another American Century, If You Can Keep It

The fact of China’s current middling per-capita wealth, together with its expected future problems, suggests that it is in fact unlikely to pose a serious threat to America’s superpower status in the decades to come.

Among the authors who predict continued American hegemony is the great power competition expert Michael Beckley. His 2018 book Unrivaled argues forcefully that China’s economic clout is largely illusory and that its perception in the American press is a consequence of overemphasis on the wrong metrics. It was released to a lot less fanfare than any of Zeihan’s works, but it has received steady play in the press, including a recent review by David Frum of the Atlantic.

True clout comes not from gross output but net output, Beckley argues. A country with twice as many citizens who produce half as much per person as its rival is not equally as powerful, since the burden of feeding, pensioning, educating, surveilling, and policing all those extra people cuts into net output and makes retaining and concentrating wealth much more difficult.

Consequently, the top-line figure that forms the staple of almost all commentary on Chinese growth — the country’s GDP — is misleading. Beckley proposes a formula to replace it as a measure of national power: GDP multiplied by GDP per capita, adjusted for purchasing power. As of 2021, this metric suggests that China’s net economic clout, far from being on par with the U.S., is only about one-third its size.

The formula is nowhere near perfect, of course; it seems a bit arbitrary, and Beckley himself concedes that it is a “primitive proxy.” Still, it is a good first effort to capture the fact, played out repeatedly throughout history, that large and poor states often lose to small and wealthy ones.

An appropriate example of this phenomenon is the First Sino-Japanese War, which ended with the humiliated Qing Empire ceding both Korea and Taiwan to Japan. Going by GDP alone, the Qing should have been almost twice as strong as Japan. But Beckley’s formula suggests that Japan entered the war with a three-to-one net economic power advantage over the Qing — roughly the same advantage that the U.S. enjoys today.

Based on projections of future GDP and population numbers by the International Monetary Fund and the UN, China might peak at half of America’s net economic power by the middle of this century, after which its declining population will cause the gap to widen again. If Beckley’s model is even approximately true, then China will never represent a great power threat comparable to even the crumbling final years of the Soviet Union.

Don’t Surrender the Second Cold War

The central question of the twenty-first century will not be whether America will have its hegemonic status forcefully taken from it. Rather, it will be whether America will voluntarily relinquish its status through folly, exhaustion, or self-loathing.

In a 2019 interview discussing his book, Beckley states that “internal decay” may erode U.S. power independently of any changes in the international situation. Possible eroders include “partisan divisions,” “special interests,” rising “cultural tensions,” and the decline of social mobility.

With the Biden administration in power and ideologues firmly entrenched in every major American corporation and institution, expect to see ever more decay around you. Indeed, America’s elite seem to be doing their best to throw in the towel against China.

How could this happen, and why? Woke politics has emerged from the fringes to become the best example of American institutional decay in the past five years. A few of its consequences are military recruitment ads focusing on LGBTQ causes instead of national defense, loosened entry requirements at colleges, restricted access to advanced classes in the name of equity, proposals for defunding the police, and political censorship at leading scientific journals, among countless other examples.

It is difficult to gauge how much material damage is being caused to America by the wokeification of everything. Nonetheless, the above examples serve to showcase the utterly self-defeating mindset of the liberal elite: they no longer want to win. They’re focused elsewhere, on internal crises often of their own devising. The armed forces, police, schools, corporations, science, and the family unit are all sacrifices to the undefined and insatiable goal of “equity.”

China’s leaders know that America’s current ideological fervor is self-defeating. That’s why they’re funding it: CCP-aligned groups in the U.S., such as the Chinese Progressive Association, help to fundraise for Black Lives Matter.

“Self-defeating” is also a suitable descriptor for the Biden administration’s policy agenda, much of which is ostensibly geared toward outcompeting China.

As discussed above, one of the United States’s primary assets in the twenty-first century will be its phenomenal fossil fuel reserves. In contrast, one of China’s Achilles heels will be its dependence on energy imports. Knowing this dynamic, a capable strategist would want to play into America’s strength, maintaining a self-sufficient fossil fuel economy while pulling back from guaranteeing the supply lines on which China relies.

Instead, the Biden administration has committed to assisting China’s “clean energy” strategy by mandating a shift away from fossil fuels and toward electric vehicles and wind and solar energy sources. This plays into China’s strength: the country dominates the clean energy supply chain and would directly or indirectly profit from American purchases. American investment in the advancement of green energy technology would also accelerate Beijing’s plans of ending its reliance on oil inputs through pivoting to coal and renewables.

One of the claims Peter Zeihan makes in The Accidental Superpower is that China is due to split along provincial lines as popular faith in the government erodes and the Han super-ethnicity begins to break back down into its constituent sub-ethnicities. In truth, however, it appears that nationalistic fervor has only increased in the wake of the pandemic.

The racial and political divides that Zeihan anticipated in China seem increasingly applicable to America instead. At the very least, those in power are doing their best to sow division and strife along racial, sexual, and political lines.

The Democratic Party is doing all that it can to fan these partisan tensions. After a year of Black Lives Matter–supported rioting while Democrats looked the other way, Biden’s Justice Department is moving to label Trump supporters as “domestic terrorists.” This intensification of mutual suspicion can only hurt the country.

Truth be told, America will probably dominate the twenty-first century regardless of any blunders, bad legislation, military misadventures, or Chinese aggression. Its wealth is enormous, its geographical assets are unmatched, and it is home to some of the most ingenious and enterprising people in the world.

But none of this will matter if the U.S. becomes unrecognizable — if it devolves into tyranny or a bunch of irreconcilable tribes. The question of the Second Cold War is therefore not whether America can win, but whether it wants to.",https://spectator.org/category/americana/,2021-07-27
China and France Raucous Over AUKUS - The American Spectator,"President Biden’s foreign policy initiatives have been consistently disastrous. From giving the Russians an extension to the New START Treaty on their terms to his pursuit of renewal of Obama’s nuclear weapons deal with Iran and his debacle in Afghanistan which abandoned U.S. citizens and Afghan allies to the Taliban, Biden has done nothing right.

Given that predicate, it’s very strange to acknowledge that he has now apparently done something right. The new agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom and the U.S. (“AUKUS”) to enable Australia to share nuclear submarine technology with the UK and buy new nuclear-powered attack submarines will re-create the strategic equation in the Pacific region to China’s disadvantage.

Under the agreement, Australia will be able to share nuclear submarine technology which means everything from how to weld hull plates for nuke boats to communications and weapon systems. The Aussies will be able to build, in U.S. shipyards, eight Virginia-class attack boats, which are fast, silent, and particularly deadly. The subs probably won’t be deployable until the late 2030s.

The AUKUS deal will strengthen our alliance with Australia and give an incentive to the other “Quad” nations — India and Japan, the fourth member being the U.S. — to strengthen that nascent alliance. It will add another major element in opposition to China’s expansionist aggression in the Pacific, but — as we’ll see in a moment — also increase their threat to Taiwan.

China is angrily opposed to the AUKUS agreement and so is France, for entirely different reasons.

Australia canceled a $39 billion contract with France to purchase twelve diesel-electric submarines in favor of buying the U.S. nuke boats. The superiority of the U.S. subs — in speed, range, stealth, and overall technology — is obvious. The French-built boats, based on vastly older technology, would have been greatly inferior weapon systems. As such, they would have been a far lesser threat to China’s ambitions.

In reaction to that cancellation, France has recalled its ambassadors to both the U.S. and Australia. It is the first time France has recalled an ambassador to the U.S. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the action was “justified by the exceptional gravity” of the situation. It’s a huge diplomatic signal, which means it’s entirely ignorable. Le Drian called AUKUS a “stab in the back.” He also said that the deal was “unacceptable behavior between allies and partners.”

French President Emmanuel Macron is reportedly livid, which is a collateral benefit to the AUKUS deal.

Why? Macron is angry that Australia, the UK, and the U.S. — three of the four “Anglosphere” nations, the other being Canada — could make a major strategic agreement without consulting France. (Imagine that. Excluding France from a strategic defense agreement in the Pacific just because they have a few troops sunning themselves on a couple of islands there.) That, of course, is in French minds secondary to the fact that French shipyards lost the money they’d have earned by producing the diesel-electric subs.

France is one of the NATO deadbeat nations that refuse to invest in their own defense. It would much rather earn the franc, the mark, the buck or the pound that makes its world go ’round by selling the weapon systems it produces. France’s dignity, based on its achievements in the Napoleonic wars, is a forgotten memory. For three of the Anglosphere nations to act without appeasing French interests appalls Macron and his administration.

More importantly, it also appalls China. The Chinese understand that the nuke subs will give Australia the ability to send its subs farther, for longer periods, and maintain them on-station far longer than the diesel-electric subs it now operates.

The Chinese are worried that, as part of the deal, Australia may allow U.S. nuclear subs — Virginia-class attack boats — to operate from Australian bases such as HMAS Stirling, near Perth on Australia’s southwestern coast. The Aussies should, and quickly.

Even without U.S. subs based in Australia, China will have to invest billions in its antisubmarine warfare capabilities. It will have to revise its strategy to cope with the threat the Australian — and possibly U.S. — subs pose.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman in Beijing, Zhao Lijian, said the AUKUS agreement was “extremely irresponsible” and that it stemmed from “outdated Cold War zero-sum mentality.” Think about that for a moment.

China is engaged in a three-decade old cold war against the Western nations, especially the U.S. Its aggression takes many forms such as its “Belt and Road” initiative, which is turning several nations in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa (such as Pakistan) into tributary states. Its establishment of military bases on islands in the South China Sea is well known. It is increasing its armed forces — especially its nuclear forces — at an alarming rate and is asserting economic dominance around the world. All of these forms of aggression have gone unanswered by the U.S.

China understands that the new Australian nuclear subs represent a threat to all of its warships and other vessels that now have free-rein in the South China Sea and the South Pacific. Were a war to erupt, the Australian subs could have a massive effect on China’s forces in the western Pacific. Which brings us to China’s intent to conquer Taiwan.

The only negative effect of the AUKUS agreement might be to accelerate China’s timetable to attack Taiwan.

The conquest of Taiwan has always been one of China’s top priorities. It regards Taiwan as a renegade province, not an independent free nation. China knows that President Biden won’t go to war to defend American allies, far less a quasi-ally such as Taiwan.

But by the 2030s, when the new Australian nuke subs are able to deploy, Biden — and hopefully Vice President Harris — will be long gone from our political scene. A new American president might have the backbone that Biden lacks and would likely defend Taiwan with military force.

That means that China — knowing the threat the AUKUS agreement poses — may try to conquer Taiwan before the Australian nuke subs can be deployed. If that happens while Biden or Harris are in the White House, there will be a lot of diplomatic outrage at the UN, but nothing else in defense of Taiwan.

We don’t know (and can’t, because our intelligence community isn’t capable of determining it) China’s timetable for conquering Taiwan, but it is probably very flexible. The temptation to attack Taiwan before 2028 may be greater than China can resist. If the Aussies are persuaded to base U.S. subs in their territory, the risk to Taiwan would diminish even before the Australian subs are built.

The AUKUS deal may also result in China’s acceleration of its other forms of aggression — both military and economic — around the world. It should result in our acceleration of efforts to strengthen the Quad Alliance with India and Japan. Japan is considering strengthening its missile defenses, which we should encourage and supply. India, the wild card, has been dependent on Russian and French arms sales for decades. We should attempt to wean them off those suppliers and encourage their own industries.

In short, Biden’s AUKUS deal is a major step in the right direction. It remains to be seen how quickly the Biden administration manages to muck it up.",https://spectator.org/category/americana/car-guy/,2021-09-20
China and the Coronavirus: A Reckoning - The American Spectator,"The coronavirus pandemic, which emerged in China in December 2019, shows no signs of abating. As of March 12, the World Health Organization reported 124,518 confirmed cases globally, with 80,980 of these in China, resulting in 4,607 deaths to date — the vast majority of them also in China, with a significant concentration of these in Hebei province, where the outbreak initially occurred. While various theories of its provenance have been advanced, given the Chinese government’s lack of transparency, we may never know the true cause.

What we do know from this lack of transparency is that the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) mask has slipped, and the emergence of COVID-19 and its aftermath represent a microcosm of a wider CCP modus operandi. As China enters its fifth decade since the implementation of Deng Xiaoping’s economic liberalization policies, Deng’s admonition that China should “hide its strength and bide its time” has given way to a more aggressive China on the world stage. As its role in a developing global pandemic reveals, the CCP is more interested in controlling the narrative than in public health (both domestically and globally). What we do know of its behavior in the wake of the virus’ appearance — draconian measures including mass quarantines, an already pervasive surveillance regime being stepped up, the aforementioned lack of transparency (including early attempts to downplay the existence and severity of the outbreak), and attempts to obfuscate the source of the virus — confirms what China “hawks” (long a lonely minority in Western policy circles) have long believed. China is an increasing threat to harmonious international relations, and it risks upending an already fragile rules-based order.

While China as an existential threat to global comity may only now be dawning upon the cognoscenti, it has been a long time in coming. China was admitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, only a few years after President Bill Clinton and then-Premier Zhu Rongji pledged to build a “constructive strategic partnership.” While George W. Bush campaigned for president on a platform of a rising China as neither partner nor enemy, the U.S. since the time of the Clinton administration has actively promoted China’s further integration into the world economy and its cooperative organizations. China has responded to this warm welcome into the global commons by pursuing mercantilist trade practices in violation of WTO rules, engaging in wholesale theft of intellectual property, threatening its neighbors through provocations in the South China Sea, and engaging in “gunboat diplomacy” throughout the developing world with its Belt and Road Initiative in a manner that would make Vito Corleone proud. Domestically, it has oppressed Uighurs, Tibetans, Falun Gong, and other minority or disfavored groups, and it continues to tighten its grip on Hong Kong through its suppression of civil liberties.

The prospect of a liberalizing China (along with its low-cost labor base and massive potential consumer market) integrated within the world economy was sufficiently tantalizing to encourage trading partners and transnational organizations alike to look the other way as the rules and norms of international economic and political relations were routinely flouted. Moreover, in the U.S., China’s size and economic potential encouraged an approach shared by the policy establishment and private sector comprised of one part blind hope (that China would evolve into a market-based democracy respectful of the international order) and one part self-enrichment (sometimes known as grifting). As China “hid its strength and bided its time,” its conduct hollowed out an already depleted American industrial base, as it also extended its reach economically and diplomatically such that it has largely displaced American influence in much of the developing world, with Africa as a prime example. Moreover, and most critically, a significant number of industrial supply chains rely heavily upon China, a risk not fully appreciated by the business and political classes as corporate earnings and stock prices rose, jobs were offshored, and America’s international profile waned.

Only with the election of President Trump and his focus on “fair trade” has China’s role in the international order become a larger part of the public debate. While Trump all too often engages in the “politics of personality” with world leaders, he has rightly called out the Chinese government on trade and economic matters (although less so on geopolitical flashpoints). Statements from other U.S. political leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, suggest an opportunity exists for a bipartisan approach to challenging China more aggressively when it acts outside of established norms.

As in a house infested with termites, China has exploited a rickety rules-based order already under assault on many fronts, including from the Trump administration. The fault in this lies not with the Chinese people — the inheritors of one of the world’s great civilizations — but a CCP-led regime that games the international system and not only has failed to liberalize but also has become increasingly repressive, as amply evidenced by its control of information, domestic surveillance regime, and aggressive propaganda efforts abroad, all on vivid display since the COVID-19 outbreak.

All nations face choices. Ours is whether to continue to tolerate a dangerous and at times hostile international actor while our pockets continue to be picked or to confront it on its norm-breaking behavior with our full arsenal of soft power. After having eagerly and successfully advocated for China’s inclusion in the world economic order, the option of “taking our ball and going home” is no longer available.

China, too, has a choice. It can become a responsible member of the international community and continue to reap the economic benefits of such relationships, or it can continue to engage in rogue, norm-defying behavior and become a significantly more culturally and economically relevant version of post-Soviet Russia, given its size and economic might — feared by all, respected by few, and trusted by none.

China and the Sound of Silence - The American Spectator,"There is not universal agreement about the origin and nature of transmission of COVID-19. Bats are suspected, as are pangolins, a delicacy also found in the so-called wet markets of China, where live animals are slaughtered. More sinister theories implicate a release somehow from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The U.S. Department of State had warned in 2018 that security protocols at the Chinese laboratory were inadequate.

There is broad consensus that officials of the Chinese Politburo were deliberately silent on the existence of this deadly pathogen and did not advise it to the world in a timely fashion in order to avoid embarrassment. As news of the virus began to leak out earlier this year, China also claimed that human-to-human transmission was not possible. During these initial weeks of denial, much of its own population and the rest of the world became infected. Further, China reprimanded a physician who issued an alarm about the virus and later died from it. Unbelievably, the wet markets in China are still open.

Amidst the global pandemonium caused by COVID-19 are understandably numerous calls that China be held accountable for the disastrous impact this virus has had on human life and the world economy. Some Wall Street estimates of the potential hit to U.S. GDP are over 30 percent for the second quarter.

“Holding China accountable” sounds peppy and suggests justice can prevail, but what does this expression really mean? This crisis is unprecedented in current times, and the legal landscape is not clear. Nonetheless, the answer to the question of what we can do to hold China accountable seems to be not much — at least not in the short run.

In the United States, a person can be held accountable for a criminal offense or civil tort, or violation of a contract or statute. In a criminal proceeding, a suspected defendant can be charged and arrested, and if a conviction is obtained, be sent to a state or federal penitentiary. A person found guilty of violating a contract or statute, or committing a tort, can be held liable for monetary remedies.

A U.S. corporation that is found guilty of violations of law exposes its officers, executives, and board members to fines and monetary penalties. In circumstances in which misconduct is found to be willful or grossly negligent, those individuals could be charged with a crime. Assets of corporations can be seized, and compensation can be clawed back.

So how do you hold a country accountable for slow and false communication about a deadly pathogen that harms or kills citizens of other countries and destroys economies?

Holding another country liable for malfeasance and misconduct is much more difficult than with an individual or corporation. Sanctions have been known to bite, in the case of Iran for example, but it has taken years for them to begin to exact a toll. And sanctions are damaging to the lives of the Iranian people, not just to the mullahs. In response to sanctions, there is always the possibility of retaliation by China through the nationalization of U.S. companies with assets there. Shown at historical cost (not adjusted for profit, loss, and dividends paid), direct investment in China during the last 20 years is estimated at approximately $115 billion, according to the German statistics firm Statista. Nationalization of U.S. interests in China would create havoc in credit, equity, and commodities markets.

Filing a complaint against China at the International Court of Justice, also known as The Hague, is an option, albeit ineffective. The Hague is an arm of the United Nations, an intergovernmental organization often hostile to Western interests. A trial at The Hague would position the U.S. against the developing world, evoking severe opprobrium from much of Europe and elsewhere. As with the World Health Organization, China’s influence with the UN is increasing — in view of its new position on its human rights panel.

Diplomatic isolation may be yet another option, but this has a practical limitation: how does one isolate the second-largest economy in the world, and that of a country with 1.4 billion citizens? The American consumer has a deep vested interest in the factories of China, churning out quality products at reasonable prices.

Another option would be for a U.S. company or citizens, individually or as part of a class, to file a lawsuit against China and officials in its Politburo, alleging willful and wanton malfeasance and obfuscation by the Chinese government. The defense of sovereign immunity would be raised, and litigants would need to prevail with the argument that knowing and willful actions by China caused much loss of life and economic damage in the trillions of dollars. If successful, litigants could attach Chinese investments in the U.S., estimated by the American Enterprise Institute and Heritage Foundation at over $180 billion during approximately the past 15 years. Even under the best of circumstances, however, litigation can be expensive and very time-consuming — with an uncertain outcome. Again, a consequence of this action could be nationalization of U.S. companies in China, or actions to destabilize the U.S. dollar with China’s massive foreign exchange reserves of over $3 trillion.

There seems little doubt that China’s vaunted Belt and Road Initiative will suffer. It embraces about 70 countries for massive infrastructure development and is an effort to establish Chinese hegemony with a set of trade and investment rules controlled by Beijing. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, countries such as Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Kenya had seen the intrusiveness of collaboration with China and the debt burden it imposes.

Chinese governance is certainly an oxymoron, but the potential retaliatory actions are not attractive or practical. Eventually, U.S. and European companies, on whom China is reliant for employment and an increasingly high standard of living, will likely shift some manufacturing and hub distribution out of China.

Rearranging manufacturing and supply chains will take time, but it will ultimately be free markets and the unseen hand of Adam Smith, the 18th-century Scottish economist, that eventually gives China its reckoning.

China as the New Motor City - The American Spectator,"GM’s Buick division is doing extremely well… in China. The Chinese own Volvo. And may soon own Jeep — one of the few still-viable pieces of what used to be Chrysler.

For now, it’s FiatChrysler.

Emphasis on for now.

Fiat invested in what was just Chrysler, hoping to use the once-Big Three company as a kind of Mulberry Harbor — the floating piers used by the Allies during the Normandy invasion toward the end of WW II to establish a beachhead in Europe — only this time in America and cars rather than troops. But unlike the Normandy invasion, the Fiat invasion has been a flop so far.

Sales of the company’s signature car — the 500 mini-car — are down almost 50 percent to just over 1,000 cars a month from a high of about 2,500 cars a month back in 2014, two years after Fiat’s return to America.

And that’s the high water mark.

Other Fiat models aren’t doing nearly as well.

Sales of the 500L — an upsized version of the 500 — are as lifeless as Dracula’s corpse, with the difference that Dracula rises at night. Fiat hasn’t sold more than 184 in a month so far this year. And that was a good month for the 500. A bad month was February; 72 cars got bought and that’s it.

The only thing that seems to help boost Fiat’s stock is the rumor about Jeep. The Chinese are very interested in buying the one un-cankered portion of the FiatChrysler conglomerate — chiefly because China is a kind of Asian revivication of 1950s America and its middle class desires large, powerful vehicles — like the SUVs Jeep specializes in and because it has a rising middle class that’s able to afford them.

America’s middle class, meanwhile, continues to wane like Hugh Hefner’s bedroom prowess.

It’s not that Americans have changed their minds and no longer want large, powerful cars. The problem is their buying power has been gimped. Their incomes are lower, the cumulative bite of taxes higher and things like health care now cost the average person probably three times what they did back in 1970, leaving not much in the way of disposable income for things like cars.

And while small cars with small engines are not unreasonably priced (on an inflation-adjusted basis) big cars with big engines have grown exorbitantly expensive and thus, beyond their means.

Consider, for instance, the flat-lined Dodge/Chrysler portfolio, starting with the Dodge Charger sedan.

This car is, in terms of its general layout — rear-drive, heavy steel frame, V8 engine — very similar to the cars middle class and even working class Americans routinely drove during the heyday of America’s working and middle class, from (roughly) the mid-late 1950s through the mid-late 1970s.

What’s not similar — and accounts for the sales plummet — is the price.

The V8 Charger stickers for $34,995 — equivalent to the buying power of $5,600 back in 1970. And back in 1970, you didn’t need $5,600 to buy a large, rear-wheel-drive sedan with a V8 engine. You could, as a for instance, have bought an Oldsmobile Delta 88 for about $3,800.

And the Olds was a near-Cadillac.

$5,600 — back in 1970 — could also have bought you a V8 Corvette, Chevy’s most expensive model — and left you a few hundred bucks for gas and tires.

In between then and now, the price of cars got higher but the means available to middle-class Americans did not rise to keep up.

Fast forward to now and cars like the ones Dodge (and Chrysler) sell are not selling — except to the government (which has unlimited funds) which buys up fleets of Chargers for use as cop cars. But otherwise, forget it.

Meanwhile, China.

It is an unplowed field, rich and loamy. Brand-new superhighways, as opposed to our ancient and decrepit ones. A chunk of real estate roughly analogous to the continental United States but instead of a tired and worn out population hag-ridden by debt and with its back to the wall, a potential market at least three or four times as large and flush. Did you know that the Chinese car industry is the world’s largest car industry? That it produces more cars than the U.S. and European car industries combined? That it grows by double digits, annually?

There is a damned good reason why GM hasn’t killed off Buick.

The brand is an irrelevance here — because there is no longer a market here for a nicer-than-Chevy but-not-quite-a-Cadillac. The Americans who bought cars like that are either mostly dead or getting ready for death, whiling away their remaining hours watching Matlock reruns in old folks homes. The cohort immediately behind them, meanwhile, is trying to figure out how to afford the monthly payment on a Honda.

And the cohort behind them — the Millennials — have tuned off to cars generally, as a generation. They are the ride sharing generation. Because when you can’t afford to buy, you rent. Cars, to them, are a burden. And they are. Financially, at least.

The whole ride-sharing thing is premised on the realization that there’s only so much peanut butter left in the empty jar; it is a finger desperately trying to reach the last scraps sticking to the wall.

But China?

It’s like a case of unopened jars of peanut butter. Cases. Stacked a mile high and as far as the eye can see. One-point-four billion Chinese, lopsided to the left of 50, in their prime car buying years and with the means to buy cars and the desire to buy them.

Is China Backing the Rioters in Our Streets? - The American Spectator,"The Heritage Foundation’s Daily Signal website earlier this week produced a bombshell report that contained information more shocking than surprising; namely, that there is a significant connection between the official Black Lives Matter organization and the Chinese Communist Party:

One of the co-founders of the official Black Lives Matter group, Alicia Garza, is reportedly partnering up with a Chinese organization that has deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party — and that group now appears to be funding one of Garza’s ventures, according to an investigation by the Daily Signal. Garza is one of several co-founders of the official “Black Lives Matter” group, and in 2018, she launched a project called “Black Futures Lab,” which aims, its website says, to help activists in the black community maintain interest in civic participation and civic activism year-round. The group “gathers information about the ways that policy affects Black communities and one that uses that information creatively to educate and challenge policymakers.” It also lobbies on behalf of BLM’s interests at the local level. The Daily Signal’s Mike Gonzalez, though, discovered that donations to the Black Futures Lab don’t seem to go directly to the foundation itself but rather to a group called the “Chinese Progressive Association” — a group that has deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party. “According to an authoritative 2009 Stanford University paper tracing its early days to the present, and which can be found on Marxist.org, ‘The CPA began as a Leftist, pro-People’s Republic of China organization, promoting awareness of mainland China’s revolutionary thought and workers’ rights, and dedicated to self-determination, community control, and “serving the people,” ’ ” Gonzales reports. “To this day, the CPA continues to be a partner of the PRC in the United States. Three years ago, the Boston chapter teamed up with China’s Consulate General in New York to offer Chinese nationals the opportunity to renew their passports, getting praise from China’s official mouthpiece, China Daily,” he continues. It also helped raise the Chinese flag over Boston City Hall to honor the anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party’s takeover of China. “It is clear, then, that CPA works with China’s communist government, pushes its agenda here in the United States, and is regularly praised by China’s state-owned mouthpieces,” Gonzalez says. “It is clear, too, from, this perspective, why the CPA would sponsor a new enterprise by Garza: They espouse the same desire for world communism.”

Garza called herself a “trained Marxist,” though she didn’t outline who provided her with her Marxist training.

Three months ago at the Epoch Times, Trevor Loudon offered a good bit of evidence that Chinese influence in organizations supporting the Black Lives Matter and Antifa protests in various cities around the country is real and pervasive.

Loudon’s report focused on a pair of organizations, both formerly named Freedom Road Socialist Organization, which originated from remnants of Maoist outfits like Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), the Weathermen, Revolutionary Communist Party, League of Revolutionary Struggle, Communist Party USA (Marxist-Leninist), Communist Workers Party, and others. The smaller of the two, FRSO-FightBack!, has material ties to terrorist organizations and was in fact the target of multiple FBI raids a decade ago:

In September 2010, the FBI raided the homes of 23 FRSO-FB members and supporters in Minnesota, Illinois, and California looking for evidence of “material support for terrorism,” according to The Washington Post. “Search warrants, subpoenas and documents show that the FBI has been interested in links between the activists and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Hezbollah.” Despite considerable documentation being seized and the first-person evidence of an FBI informant inside FRSO-FB, no prosecutions were carried out. The fact that several of the arrestees were tied to President Barack Obama through Chicago activist circles may have been a factor in that decision.

FRSO was involved in re-forming an old domestic terrorist organization, the National Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (NAARPR). NAARPR is the outfit former Communist Party terrorist Angela Davis fronted in the 1970s. But the current iteration was more than a little involved in standing up “mostly peaceful” protests almost immediately following the death of George Floyd:

On May 25, the day George Floyd was killed, the NAARPR issued a call for a National Day of Protest that weekend: “Cities across the country are picking up the call for a National Day of Protest on May 30th ‘to stop the racist murder and violence that this administration has willfully unleashed’ on the many people trapped in jails, prisons, and detention centers many of which are becoming death camps in this time of the Covid-19 pandemic.” NAARPR produced a quick list of 11 major cities where protests were planned — almost all to be led by known FRSO front groups: Minneapolis–St. Paul–Twin Cities Coalition Justice 4 Jamar

Chicago–Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression

Dallas–Dallas Alliance Against Racist & Political Repression

Los Angeles–Centro CSO

Jacksonville, Fla.–Jacksonville Community Action Committee

Salt Lake City–Utah Against Police Brutality Many more cities were added; many more marches were planned and continue to be planned. Almost all were led by FRSO front groups or allied communist organizations.

If you found it peculiar how fast those George Floyd riots blew up all over the country, almost as though somebody was just waiting for a spark to ignite the bonfires they had pre-positioned, Loudon wants you to know you weren’t crazy.

Another organization formerly calling itself Freedom Road is now known as Liberation Road, and its exploits of late have been significant:

Liberation Road is so strong in Virginia that by signing up hundreds of thousands of minority voters for the Democrats, they have flipped the state from red to blue. This was with the help of super-focused computer-generated electoral mapping done by Liberation Road comrade Steve McClure working out of Wuhan University in China.… We’ve all heard the story about three young black women — Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi — who were sitting around after the 2012 killing of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin grieving for the young black men being systematically persecuted and murdered by law enforcement. They just happened to come up with the hashtag “Black Lives Matter” — which then just happened to spark a worldwide movement. In reality, the hashtag gained traction because FRSO/OSCL and their armies of sympathizers in the social movements and the media pushed to make it happen. Communists have been doing this daily for more than a century now. They are very good at it. All three young women are seasoned far-left activists in the orbit of FRSO/Liberation Road. Garza worked in Liberation Road-aligned organizations People Organized to Win Employment Rights (POWER), the School of Unity and Liberation (SOUL), the Right to the City Alliance, and contributed to the War Times newspaper. In 2014, she was involved in a Mapping Socialist Strategies retreat in upstate New York, which was organized by the New York affiliate of the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation—a German-based group founded and led by senior members of the former East German Communist Party. Currently, she is a leader of LeftRoots, an FRSO/Liberation Road spinoff organization. Tometi was executive director of Black Alliance for Just Immigration. Her predecessor was Gerald Lenoir, a former leader of the Maoist-leaning Line of March group. On June 4, 2015, she visited the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation in Berlin, where she spoke about police violence in the United States and the accomplishments of the Black Lives Matter movement. Cullors was mentored in Los Angeles by Eric Mann, a lifelong Maoist and former member of SDS, the Weathermen, and the League of Revolutionary Struggle. In January 2015, she traveled to Palestine with a delegation of Black Lives Matter activists “to witness firsthand the effects of Israeli apartheid and occupation,” according to a Facebook post. One of Cullors’s fellow American delegates, “Dream Defender” Ahmad Abuznaid, is the son of a Nabil Abuznaid, a “close friend” and adviser to Yasser Arafat, the late leader of the terrorist Palestine Liberation Organization.

And now you know where the Marxist training came from.

We already know there is a great deal of parallel between what’s going on in America’s streets, and in American media and culture, and what Maoists in China perpetrated during the Cultural Revolution in that country, at a time when so many of the current graybeards in the American communist movement, the people who trained the current generation of BLM and Antifa revolutionaries, were making their bones with SDS and CPUSA.

The real issue, then, is how much material support, beyond simply ideological support — and moral support, which we’ve seen publicly — comes from China to organizations like Liberation Road, FRSO, Black Lives Matter, Antifa, and others.

We’ve seen hints at an answer coming from our government. National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien has mentioned China as one of several countries fomenting civil unrest in America. Attorney General William Barr has made similar statements. To date, though, American corporate legacy media has been wholly uninterested in investigating that subject. One gets the sense that any well-resourced investigation would turn up a wealth of evidence supporting O’Brien and Barr’s statements.

But so far, nothing. Which is unsurprising.

And yet shocking. Those riots have done more than a billion dollars in direct economic damage, which is a drop in the bucket compared to the indirect and long-lasting losses the cities BLM and Antifa have burned and looted will suffer.

Who benefits?

Who benefits from an America intent on tearing itself apart and, should the revolutionaries in our streets win the day, turning away from the capitalist economy that made it the strongest, richest, and freest nation in world history?

The question isn’t really whether China is backing those revolutionaries. It’s what we’re going to do about it.",https://spectator.org/category/americana/drawn-to-humor/,2020-09-18
Could China Be Held Accountable for COVID-19? - The American Spectator,"As things stand, there are two clear realities regarding the Chinese government’s culpability for the COVID-19 pandemic.

The first is that China shoulders a large part of the blame for the ongoing disaster. Its slow, opaque response in the initial stages of the outbreak likely cost the world several weeks of confusion and inaction at a crucial time, according to a report last year by the Congressional Research Service. Whether the government could have prevented the virus from ever leaving Wuhan will always remain a matter of speculation, but there is little doubt that its misconduct early on has since snowballed into countless unnecessary deaths.

With the lab leak origin theory roaring back into respectable mainstream opinion, Beijing now stands credibly accused of a triple serving of recklessness: creating the virus in the first place, allowing it to escape, and then doing nothing while it rampaged through the local population.

The second reality, made all the more frustrating by the first, is that Beijing appears to have successfully escaped accountability. Sure, its reputation took a hit, but this has yet to translate into abnegated treaties or any serious economic repercussions beyond what was already in motion.

The best time to exact punishment is now. Just like with the 2008 milk adulteration scandal in China, memories are short and passions are fleeting. Beijing’s capacity and willingness to muddy the waters has also grown substantially in the past decade. The world may soon return to business as usual — until the next catastrophe rears its head.

So why have America’s leaders done nothing substantial to retaliate? The main reason is that doing so would accelerate the onset of a bifurcated world. Washington clearly finds this possibility unthinkable.

Take lawsuits, for example. Of all the avenues for seeking redress, they are the most natural fit for the pandemic specifically. Individual Americans or organizations could seek damages for deceased family members or medical bills, without the degree of politicization that the direct involvement of the federal government would bring.

Many members of Congress have sought to open this avenue for Americans. The latest attempt was made this week by New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith, who has repeatedly antagonized the Communist Party. Smith’s effort follows two similar proposals by Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw, as well as an unsuccessful initiative by Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley early last year.

All of these attempts have sought to open the floodgates to lawsuits against the Chinese government by tearing down the single biggest obstacle: China’s protection under the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA). Under the act, federal courts are deprived of jurisdiction over civil suits brought against foreign sovereign entities. Exceptions exist but are narrowly focused on commercial activities by the offending state, which would have little to do with China’s handling of COVID-19. Stripping China of FSIA immunity would therefore be the necessary first step to suing it.

What China hawks in Congress have yet to address, however, are the many, many other hurdles in place. A foreign state without immunity can still lay down a veritable minefield of legal obstacles, such as the doctrine of forum non conveniens, with which China could argue that American courts are inappropriate venues for suits relating to China, or the act-of-state doctrine, on whose grounds American courts have no business judging the decisions of foreign governments.

An American plaintiff would have to navigate all of these barriers, likely a multi-year process, and only then be able to argue the actual merits of their case. And even if they could convince a judge that China’s actions bear more responsibility for the state of the pandemic in America than the actions of the American government, that wouldn’t be the end of it. Making good on any damages awarded would be its own legal fiasco.

It all sounds like a headache — and it is. Yet American leaders could do much to clear the path if they wished to. They did exactly that in the case of an ongoing lawsuit against Saudi Arabia. In 2016, Congress overrode a veto by President Obama to pass the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which made Saudi Arabia vulnerable to cases brought against it relating to its role in the September 11 attacks. Five years later, the case is still slowly making progress.

By voting down similar attempts to strip China of sovereign immunity, however, Congress has overwhelmingly demonstrated that it lacks the appetite for a legal confrontation with the People’s Republic.

The reasons are fairly obvious. Saudi Arabia, being under the political and military influence of the U.S., is unlikely to retaliate against minor perceived infractions by its superpower ally. China, by comparison, is a much more dangerous target. Its near-peer competitor status, combined with its diplomatic strategy of forceful retaliation, means that any move by the U.S. can and will be reciprocated. There are hundreds of billions of American assets within Chinese jurisdiction that could be “awarded” as damages. Moreover, any weakening of sovereign immunity could spiral into an international free-for-all. No doubt Beijing would try to enlist sympathetic governments, many of whom have no shortage of grievances against the West, to bombard the U.S with lawsuits.

America accepts the imperfect legal status quo precisely to avoid such a headache. Ending it would go beyond decoupling. It would be a rupture — a calamitous splitting in two of the post-Cold War world system.

It could be done, theoretically speaking. But it would step on too many toes ever to happen. For example, there is more American investment in China than vice versa, and therefore more for China to plunder; most of corporate America would be loath to see a conflict get to that point, or even close to it.

This desire to prevent bifurcation restrains America’s ability to punish China through other means as well. Take, for instance, the possibility of ceasing interest payments on the trillion-plus dollars of American debt held by China, as de facto reparations for the damage caused by COVID-19. According to legal experts, the U.S. could technically justify the cancellation of debt on the grounds that China violated treaty obligations with its misleading messaging in the initial stages of the pandemic.

The fact that the move could be legally justified, however, does not mean that most of Washington would be willing to go along with it. Against a weak and easily isolated economy like Iran, it might work. But China is actively attempting to build a parallel international financial system to rival the dollar. America reneging on 13 digits’ worth of debt would shake its reputation as the world’s best debtor and accelerate China’s plans. Sympathetic allies such as Japan and Australia could be willing to overlook the move, but what about ambivalent countries in Southeast Asia, Africa, or Eastern Europe, that China is attempting to bring into its sphere? In any case, Washington is unwilling to make the gamble.

For another perspective on how difficult it would be to extract concessions from China, just ask Mike Pompeo. The former secretary of state was the biggest China hawk in the Trump administration. Freed from his roles in the executive branch, you would expect Pompeo to hone his barbs against Beijing, now that he no longer has to worry about accidentally contradicting official U.S. policy.

But you’d be disappointed. In an op-ed published last week in the Washington Post, Pompeo demanded “punishment” against China by a “Biden-led coalition.” The piece hits the right rhetorical notes but little else. It calls for “leading democracies” to “act together” to facilitate a “strong response” consisting of “calibrated unilateral and multilateral measures” against Beijing. For a newly minted policy institute fellow, Pompeo’s suggestions are light on actionable specifics.

Perhaps the reason why is because Pompeo, Biden, and most of Congress struggle to even conceive of the U.S. reneging on its role in the global financial and legal system, even temporarily and to penalize an adversary. The collateral damage that would come from seeking reparations from China for COVID-19 stays Washington’s hand.

Changing this calculus will take a years-long process of gradual decoupling. It will mean letting the passions of the present moment pass, though not the memory or the lessons learned. America must continue the process of gradually shedding its integration with the Chinese economy.

It will mean, in other words, recommitting to President Trump’s China strategy, from long before the pandemic began, of low-intensity confrontation and patience.",https://spectator.org/category/americana/from-the-archives/,2021-07-20
Time for Unity on China’s COVID Role - The American Spectator,"With Trump’s exit, it is time for unity against the Chinese government’s COVID role. For too long, those on the American left have obscured the communist government’s fault. They have done so because it served their purpose to blame COVID solely on Trump. Instead of pretending COVID is a natural disaster, America must hold China’s communist government accountable for this massive, manmade health and economic crisis.

As of December 23, there have been over 78.5 million COVID cases worldwide. Over 21 million cases were still active, and over 1.7 million people had died. In the U.S., there have been 18.7 million cases, 5 percent of our population. There are 7.4 million active cases, and there have been 331,000 deaths. These enormous numbers are certain to continue increasing. COVID is unquestionably the largest health crisis in anyone’s living memory.

COVID’s economic impact has been equally horrendous. The world is enduring its greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression. Global growth is estimated to fall 4 percent this year. In America, just over half the jobs lost have been regained. The Federal Reserve estimates 2020 GDP will shrink 2.4 percent; pre-COVID GDP is not expected to return until mid-2021, and unemployment will remain relatively high throughout next year.

Adding insult to all this injury, China has apparently recovered, and its economy is expected to grow roughly 2 percent this year.

The reason this insult may escape many is because America continues to act as if the pandemic is an act of nature, instead of the fault of the Chinese government. COVID originated in China under its communist government’s watch, whether as a sin of commission or omission. China deliberately withheld COVID’s seriousness from the world; this lack of cooperation and candor increased the severity of what became a global pandemic.

As damning as this indictment is, this is the most benign rendition of the Chinese communist government’s COVID culpability. Almost a year after the outbreak began, that is still unclear. The world still does not know the role the government played in the Wuhan laboratory’s work, how the virus escaped, or the full extent of the cover-up that followed.

Answers are long overdue for America and the world; the first step in getting them must be a united front in demanding them. Those on the left have denied America this unity because they found it politically expedient to blame COVID entirely on Trump.

Entering 2020, Trump had a robust economy, had won several political accomplishments for his base, and had just defeated his political adversaries with the Senate’s acquittal on impeachment charges. Within less than 10 months, COVID had become a pandemic and spawned a depression.

The Left seized it like the lifeline it was. Their strategy of blaming COVID on Trump worked. Without COVID, Trump wins reelection. Instead, one year undermined three and denied him four more.

Yet the Left’s strategy has also taken the focus off the Chinese government’s COVID role. It has mistakenly shifted blame from them and, more importantly, blunted efforts to demand answers from them. The American politics of COVID must now be over as human costs continue mounting.

The largest consideration must be that COVID is not repeated. If that sounds far-fetched, consider: COVID was preceded by SARS in 2002. While much less serious in health and economic costs, the SARS outbreak contained many of COVID’s elements — most notably maladroit handling by China’s communist government.

China’s communist government also obfuscated and obstructed the transmission of accurate information about the SARS virus, which originated in China. The Chinese government’s concern was identical to their COVID priority: “Save face,” irrespective of others’ costs.

By not reacting more harshly to SARS, the world set the stage for COVID. At the time, everyone was enamored with believing China could be brought into the developed world order on our terms. So they effectively looked the other way on SARS. Instead, China has gone the other way, not accepting developed world standards but seeking to impose its own.

The result of the world and China having learned nothing, then, is history’s largest manmade health and economic disaster occurring today. Yet despite all evidence and the imperative that China’s communist government be held accountable, America’s Left acts as though COVID is a natural disaster that Trump has failed to manage.

For a growing part of America and the world, there is increasing awareness that China must be confronted. This is true in many areas, but none more important than COVID. On SARS, China did not learn, or at least change; there is no indication it will do so from COVID either. It is too great a risk to assume otherwise again.

For too long there has been a misconception that China will adopt developed nation standards, and that allowing them to save face in instances when they do not will help smooth their adoption. It is time for America, and especially our Left, to learn from the Chinese government’s misbehavior. We must stop worrying about China’s communist government’s loss of face and focus instead on the world’s loss of life.

A Vaccine From China? No Thanks - The American Spectator,"While Democrats including presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden, vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), Gov. Andrew Cuomo (N.Y.), Gov. Gavin Newsom (Calif.), Gov. Ned Lamont (Conn.), and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot all publicly question the Trump administration’s ability to facilitate a safe COVID-19 vaccine, could arsonist-turned-firefighter China have the cure we all need?

To deflect from world criticism of its role in spreading COVID-19, and following its earlier, disingenuous “mask diplomacy,” China seeks to become the world’s darling and savior by producing and exporting its COVID-19 vaccines. China is currently courting the World Health Organization (WHO) to bless these vaccines, in the hopes that China can win first-to-market advantage.

But to accomplish this ambitious goal, China is cheating on quality controls and ethics. China currently has four vaccines in phase three trials: China National Biotech Group (Sinopharm) has two, and Sinovac and CanSino Biologics, Inc. each have one. Phase three trials, which assess safety and efficacy compared with other treatments, typically involve up to 3,000 people. But Sinopharm tested one of its vaccines on 30 of its employees before clinical trials even began, raising significant ethical concerns. Further, while “nearing the end of Phase III trials,” Sinopharm leapfrogged over its own clinical trial process by simultaneously testing its vaccines on “hundreds of thousands” of Chinese (one source says 350,000 people, though it is unclear if these people are Chinese or others), in addition to more than 31,000 subjects in the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt, and Jordan for “emergency use.” It is also offering one of its vaccines to Chinese students studying abroad, and is currently considering sending the vaccine to 91,000 of these students (over 168,000 students had originally expressed interest). It is unclear if these students are receiving the vaccine for “emergency use.”

Sinovac, like Sinopharm, is similarly willing to forsake even a façade of clinical trial integrity. Sinovac CEO Yin Weidong has admitted to injecting 3,000 of its employees and their family members, including his wife and parents, with a COVID-19 vaccine, and giving “tens of thousands” of doses to the Chinese government. Indonesia hopes to use three pre-approved Chinese vaccines via “emergency use” as early as next month, and Sinovac has pledged 40 million doses to the archipelago by March 2021. The Chinese military has also green-lighted the use of a pre-trial COVID-19 vaccine it developed with CanSino Biologics, Inc. Some experts are questioning the safety and efficacy of China’s approach, in addition to its very broad application of “emergency use.”

China is working on its vaccines at ludicrous speed, and heaping praise on them in the process. Sinopharm, for example, claims that it achieved a 100 percent antibody response for one of its vaccines. Sinovac asserts that its vaccine has no major side effects. A top official from the National Health Commission stated that “none” of the subjects who received “emergency use” injection of any Chinese COVID-19 vaccine have “severe adverse reactions.”

But Americans should be skeptical of such claims, given a long history of fraud and quality concerns with China’s vaccines and drugs.

In February 2019, China disciplined, fired, or asked to resign 48 officials for their roles in fabricating data for Changsheng Life Sciences’ rabies vaccine. This, coupled with the fact that at least thousands of these vaccines were defective, resulted in a $1.3 billion fine and the arrest of the company’s chairwoman and another 14 executives. The company also had its license revoked in China, was delisted from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in October 2019, and went bankrupt the following month. The Changsheng Life Sciences scandal was merely the most publicized example of widespread fraud. A 2016 survey by China’s State Food and Drug Administration found that over 80 percent of clinical trials in China in a one-year period contained data that was “fabricated.”

Like Chinese toys, drywall, hoverboards, and dog treats, Chinese vaccines and drugs have caused serious risk to life and limb. Perhaps the most devastating was in 2008, when 12 Chinese companies supplied contaminated blood thinner heparin to 11 countries. This heparin killed 81 Americans, according to congressional testimony.

Other examples of quality failures in China’s pharmaceutical industry abound:

In May 2018, Sinopharm’s subsidiary, the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, recalled over 400,000 defective diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT) vaccines. This, coupled with approximately 500,000 defective DPT vaccines from Changsheng Life Sciences (247,200 discovered in August 2018 and 253,338 discovered in November 2017), meant that Chinese companies manufactured over 900,000 defective DPT vaccines for children.

In January 2019, news broke that a local health center in China gave at least 145 babies expired polio vaccines. In 2016, China arrested 130 people, and stated that 29 companies and 16 clinics were involved in illegally distributing expired or near-expired vaccines. China seized 20,000 such doses during a crackdown.

In July and November 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recalled batches of valsartan, a drug used to prevent heart attacks and strokes that Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Huahai) helped manufacture, after finding that it contained the “probable human carcinogen” NDMA. This was after 10 billion such pills had entered the global drug supply in the previous year through distribution by 50 companies. The working theory was that Huahai had inadvertently introduced NDMA into the drug in 2012 by changing production methods. In January 2019, FDA issued another recall from another drug that Huahai helped manufacture, which contained NDEA, another carcinogen. And in 2019, Zantac and its generics were recalled after they, originating in China and India, were found to contain NDMA as well.

In 2014, China’s BioKangtai’s Hepatitis B vaccine was associated with the deaths of 17 infants in China, resulting in a ban on that vaccine in China. That year, BioKangtai, along with Tiantan Biological Products and Dalian Hissen Bio-Pharm, all suspended production of Hepatitis B vaccine following their failing to meet the 2010 Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) code. In August 2020, AstraZeneca partnered with BioKangtai to produce a COVID-19 vaccine for China, but “[t]he pair will also explore the possibility of producing the vaccine for other markets.” Eek.

In 2010, Jiangsu Yanshen, a subsidiary of Simcere Pharmaceutical Group, was fined $3.75 million for quality issues with its rabies vaccine in addition to an additional $3.37 million to pay for the cost of re-vaccinations.

We should not allow any of our COVID-19 vaccines to come from China. Otherwise, we could literally end up getting a dose of our own medicine, as China may be at least in part reverse-engineering a vaccine built from our research. In July, the FBI was investigating whether China tried to steal COVID-19 research from the University of Texas. Less than two weeks prior, two Chinese nationals were indicted for, among other things, acting on behalf of the Chinese government to hack into computer networks to steal American intellectual property on COVID-19 vaccines, testing technology, and treatments. This followed a warning by the Department of Justice in May that China would try to steal such intellectual property.

China’s defective vaccines are merely the latest in a history of poor quality exports that include defective medical supplies and many other products. The Trump administration must counter any future harm anticipated from Chinese COVID-19 vaccines by swift and successful domestic vaccine development through Operation Warp Speed. If the WHO provides political cover for China’s COVID-19 vaccines, the Trump administration should strengthen our cooperation with Taiwan on COVID-19 research, including vaccine development. The Trump administration should also press hard for new leadership in the WHO and for the WHO to re-admit Taiwan as an observer, as recommended in a recent House Minority Report. The Trump administration must also develop a strong answer to the WHO’s COVAX initiative to prevent it from becoming a victory for China’s vaccine diplomacy.",https://spectator.org/category/americana/laughing-matters/,2020-10-22
China Ponders Retaliation Against Huawei Critics - The American Spectator,"The gloves are coming off in the tech tit-for-tat between China and the West. In an effort to prevent the rest of Europe from joining the U.S. and UK boycott of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, China is attempting to hold hostage Ericsson and Nokia, two of Huawei’s biggest competitors.

The EU has yet to issue hard rules on Huawei, but it has recently provided recommendations to its member states to avoid contracting “high-risk firms,” understood to be a reference to the Chinese corporation, for 5G infrastructure. States like Germany are expected to decide on their stance toward Huawei later this year.

Europe’s largest and most lucrative economies deciding to exclude China from their 5G grids should, in theory, be a significant boon to European firms Ericsson and Nokia. Based out of Sweden and Finland respectively, the two companies are Huawei’s only significant competitors in the 5G tower manufacturing sector and have hitherto been struggling against Huawei’s famously low state-subsidized prices. Giving these European manufacturers exclusive access to the European market could spur homegrown innovation and prevent Huawei from achieving an insurmountable market dominance.

Beijing, however, has a trump card — or so it seems. As the Wall Street Journal reports, both Nokia and Ericsson have long supply chains with tens of thousands of manufacturing and research-and-development staff based out of China. By implementing export controls, Beijing could cut these chains in half by preventing the two companies from shipping products out of China, including components that are necessary for other manufacturing sites to maintain production.

Communist Party officials in the Ministry of Commerce are considering doing just that if the rest of Europe follows the UK’s lead and bans Huawei, according to the Wall Street Journal report. Such a method of retaliation would be wildly disproportionate: while Huawei would merely be excluded from the European market in its worst-case scenario, Chinese export controls would pose a threat to the very existence of Nokia and Ericsson by destroying their manufacturing capabilities.

They would also, in the long run, undermine China’s manufacturing power. Already encouraged to exit China by rising labor costs, geopolitical instability, and consumer pressure, foreign firms are unlikely to tolerate the possibility that they could become sacrificial pieces in the new Cold War. The fact that Chinese officials are even pondering the move is likely to send shareholders into a panic. If Beijing is resolute (or desperate) enough to take this nuclear option, 2020 may herald the beginning of the end of China as a manufacturing hub.",https://spectator.org/category/americana/pulse/,2020-07-22
China Expands Ties to ASEAN and Islamic States - The American Spectator,"The Obama administration and its Democratic allies in Congress are no friends of free trade. Their myopia is effectively reducing America’s economic ties with other nations precisely when potential rivals are expanding theirs. For instance, China has signed a free trade accord with the ASEAN states, extending Beijing’s economic and political reach in Southeast Asia and among Muslim nations. Warns Joshua Trevino:

The political dimension of this convergence is a bit more worrying to the United States. Where, after all, do the political interests of Chinese and most Islamic states coincide? It’s a bad list: in the suppression of democracy, in the denial of minority rights, and in the rejection of Western dominance. The ASEAN nations themselves aren’t quite so uniformly malign, though they do have their bad actors in Burma, Vietnam, and Laos – but neither will they have much interest in countering the Chinese-Islamic concurrence on these points. We already see it in effect in international fora, most recently in the failed Copenhagen talks, when Sudan served as a Chinese proxy for the disruption of the proposed treaty. (This may actually be the first and only time Americans can applaud this partnership.) Expect more of this, and expect it to spill into war-and-peace matters in decades to come. If the Islamic world perceives China as a counterweight to Western influence – and if Chinese nationalism desires to be perceived as that counterweight – that’s a series of difficult choices for American policymakers in the years ahead.

Yet Congress can’t be bothered to ratify the U.S.-South Korea FTA even as China’s trade with the South races past that of America. Beijing’s influence in Asia is bound to continue rising, but there’s no reason for Washington to toss away America’s strongest card: trade and investment.",https://spectator.org/category/americana/serve-and-volley/,2010-01-04
China Is Spoiling for a Fight - The American Spectator,"Three more noteworthy developments occurred across the Pacific this past week. No fireworks yet, but it seems like China is setting up as many powder kegs as it can. America is of course busy dealing with its own home front, leaving Beijing room to maneuver with little scrutiny.

The first of the powder kegs is Hong Kong, which effectively lost its independence on May 28 when the Chinese legislature declared that mainland security law trumped the city’s own. To add insult to injury, the territory’s government has banned the annual June 4 vigil for the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre for the first time ever. Other than some verbal protests and an adjustment in trade status for the city by American officials, the international reaction has been subdued and there is the distinct feeling that Western governments, with their hands full, have stopped paying attention. Though perhaps the most depressing incident in this list, this one is the least likely to cause a conflagration at this point.

The second keg was lit late last week at a gathering for top Chinese officials. Speaking on the topic of Taiwan, Li Zuocheng, a top PLA general, declared that the Communist Party would “reserve the option to take all necessary measures to stabilise and control the situation in the Taiwan Strait” and would “take all necessary steps to resolutely smash any separatist plots or actions.” The general was careful to depict Taiwanese “separatists” as fringe extremists repudiated by the Taiwanese public. In reality, of course, Taiwan’s ruling party supports independence from the mainland, and so the general’s words constituted merely the latest Chinese threat against the Taiwanese government.

It is a threat that echoes remarks by former PLA general Qiao Liang in an interview given earlier in May. Qiao, retired and therefore presumably freer to speak his mind, declared that the PLA must “maintain our strategic strength to resolve the Taiwan issue by force at any time,” gloating that the fact that the American manufacturing industry “has hollowed out” places U.S. forces at a disadvantage in any armed conflict.

The final keg, and the one deserving the most immediate attention, is the gradual escalation of tensions along the China–India border. The two Asian giants have been in a month-long standoff centered on the Himalayan border regions of Ladakh and Sikkim. Soldiers from both sides have been filmed throwing punches and rocks at each other and engaging in pushing contests.

For the last couple weeks, both China and India have issued repeated assurances to the media that the situation was under control and that Beijing and New Delhi had open lines of communication. Nonetheless, both troop numbers and military infrastructure have been proliferating, sparking fears of an armed clash sometime during the summer. While China appears to be the aggressor, the reasons for its actions remain unclear, with explanations ranging from India’s buildup of supply lines on the border to China simply looking to flex the strength of its growing military.

As was recently suggested in a piece for this magazine by Frank Schell, India and the U.S. are well-positioned to establish closer military and research ties in the near future. The Himalayan clash demonstrates why: India is simultaneously one of the countries most threatened by an aggressive China and also the only Asian country other than China with the population, growth potential, and military power to match the ambitions of Beijing. Of course, unlike the Chinese Communist Party, the Indian government is democratic, mostly friendly toward the West, and has a prestigious history of peaceful resistance to autocracy.

An India–U.S. partnership may deter this sort of military adventurism by Beijing in the future. For the current clash, however, the Trump administration has remained mostly neutral in its public statements. One hopes that the situation will be resolved peacefully and to the satisfaction of both sides, but who knows what the devil has in store for the second half of this year.",https://spectator.org/category/americana/space-race/,2020-06-03
China Formalizes the Hong Kong Coup - The American Spectator,"As COVID-19 and its associated lockdowns have kept Americans anxious and occupied, events in Hong Kong have been proceeding at a breakneck pace. Despite renewed demonstrations and protests, the city is on the cusp of becoming a special administrative region in name only.

On May 18, pro-Beijing lawmaker Starry Lee was elected House Committee chairwoman of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong in a “unanimous” vote of 40 to nil, after pro-democracy lawmakers either boycotted the vote or were forcibly removed from the chamber. Lee would have won regardless: the current Legislative Council, elected in 2016 before the beginning of the protests, is dominated by Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing faction. Nonetheless, given that the November 2019 local council elections were an absolute landslide for the pro-democracy camp, the coronation of Lee was an unambiguous slap in the face to voters.

A few media outlets and commentators described the event as a “political coup.” Too few, however, reported it at all, and it mostly slipped by unnoticed.

Yesterday, Beijing put down the jackboot for good, with the Chinese legislature rubber-stamping a plan to impose China’s national security laws on Hong Kong in overt violation of the city’s evaporating semi-autonomous status. The plan, the details of which are expected to be hashed out by the time of its implementation in September, would empower security forces to crack down on subversive and secessionist acts and inclinations in Hong Kong to the same degree as in the mainland, effectively ending Hongkongers’ freedom of speech. An attempt to implement a similar plan in 2003 had failed due to huge protests. This time, the public backlash has been even more fierce, and the protestors more numerous — yet Beijing hasn’t even flinched.

There looks to be increasingly little that Hong Kong can do to help itself. The city’s populace was never much of a threat to the Beijing authorities, and so China’s hand was only stayed by the threat of international condemnation. Such condemnation now seems increasingly hollow as those countries with the hard power to back up their words are all struggling with their own crises.

On Wednesday, just a day before the plan to crack down on Hong Kong passed the Chinese legislature, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that the U.S. government no longer considered Hong Kong to be meaningfully autonomous, potentially ending the special U.S.–Hong Kong trade relationship not afforded to the rest of China. The threat of losing American business in Hong Kong might have given the Chinese Communist Party pause in 1997, when Hong Kong was nearly 20 percent of the Chinese economy, but it is unlikely to change any official’s mind now that the city represents less than 3 percent of its GDP. The acknowledgement that Hong Kong has lost its autonomy may prove more meaningful in the long term, as yet another step toward a Cold War-style standoff between the U.S. and China.

For the time being, however, Hongkongers cannot expect anything more than protests against China’s actions from their allies abroad. The U.S. economy is facing a massive lockdown-induced contraction, and the public’s attention is on the riots raging in Minnesota and now spreading throughout the country. All the while the Communist Party’s influence, and confidence, grows.",https://spectator.org/category/americana/sports-arena/,2020-05-29
China Grows Its Influence in the Pacific - The American Spectator,"While the world’s attention has been focused on the Russia-Ukraine war and China’s threatening behavior and rhetoric toward Taiwan, China has signed a security agreement with the Solomon Islands that Georgetown University professor Patricia O’Brien, writing in The Diplomat, claims is a “prism through which all components of Pacific geopolitics, indeed the geopolitics of the greater Indo-Pacific, will now be refracted.”

O’Brien, who teaches in Georgetown’s Asia Studies department and at the Australian National University (in the Department of Pacific Affairs), notes that when details of the draft agreement leaked on social media in March, it “set off an immediate firestorm” throughout the Asia-Pacific region. New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, expressed grave concern about China’s “potential militarization” of the Pacific. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the agreement “an issue of concern for the region.” Nearby Micronesian President David Panuelo wrote what the AP called an “impassioned letter” to Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare urging him the “rethink” the pact with China.

The Biden administration appears to be playing catch-up on the issue, which involves an island group that includes Guadalcanal (of World War II fame), and that is uncomfortably close to Guam, Australia, and New Zealand. Back in February, Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that the United States would be reopening its embassy in the Solomons to increase U.S. influence before China becomes “strongly embedded” there. This may be too little, too late.

The security agreement comes in the wake of the Solomons’ 2019 switch in diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China. Eugene Graham of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore sees the move as part of China’s effort to expand its naval presence in the Pacific. Japan’s Asahi Shimbun reports that Graham described China’s move as “a subtle and interesting geopolitical … outflanking [of] the United States and Australia in an influence competition.” Others are concerned that the agreement will eventually lead to China establishing a naval base in the Solomons. Both Chinese and Solomons Island spokespersons have denied rumors that the new agreement will result in a Chinese military base.

Georgetown’s O’Brien, however, believes that the security agreement allows “large-scale and varied Chinese military and intelligence operations” on the islands, and provides for the deployment of Chinese forces to maintain “civic order” in the Solomons, which has recently been the scene of domestic dissent and riots. And she suspects that China may reach out to other Pacific island nations, such as the Marshalls, Micronesia, and Palau for similar agreements.

China’s outreach to the Pacific Islands is a component of the Belt and Road Initiative, whereby China seeks to expand its influence — economic, political, and military — throughout the Eurasian landmass and its maritime periphery. It is China’s effort to add a powerful maritime component to its Eurasian continental presence. And for those who study history and its strategic implications, it may be China’s attempt to establish a 21st-century version of Japan’s Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. We know where that led 80 years ago — to thousands of U.S. Marines, army, and air forces waging unrelenting warfare on beaches, in city streets, in jungles, at sea, and in the skies above in the Pacific and South Pacific.",https://spectator.org/category/americana/sunday-visitor/,2022-04-11
"China Is at War With the World, And It’s Escalating - The American Spectator","Until a few days ago, and until now for those not up on the latest developments in the tech world, hafnium was a word describing a barely known element on the periodic table included in the manufacture of control rods for nuclear power plants.

But thanks to our never-resting pals across the Pacific Ocean, hafnium now means something else.

There is a group of computer hackers based in China, and reportedly employed by that country’s communist government, which calls itself Hafnium — an indication that for all their technical prowess the Chinese are still far behind the West when it comes to creativity in describing their villainous ways.

The Chinese Hafnium hackers scored a massive coup against Microsoft late last month and into this month by infiltrating hundreds of thousands of Microsoft Exchange servers across the globe. That let the hackers download and read a whole lot of email; one can only imagine the amount of industrial and other espionage that resulted.

And it isn’t over:

When news hit earlier this week that Chinese hackers were actively targeting Microsoft Exchange servers, the cybersecurity community warned that the zero-day vulnerabilities they were exploiting might have allowed them to hit countless organizations around the world. Now it’s becoming clear just many email servers they hacked. By all appearances, the group known as Hafnium breached as many victims they could find across the global internet, leaving behind backdoors to return to later. Hafnium has now exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s Exchange servers’ Outlook Web Access to indiscriminately compromise no fewer than tens of thousands of email servers, according to sources with knowledge of the investigation into the hacking campaign who spoke to WIRED. The intrusions, first spotted by security firm Volexity, began as early as January 6, with a noticeable uptick starting last Friday and spiking early this week. The hackers appear to have responded to Microsoft’s patch, released Tuesday, by ramping up and automating their hacking campaign. One security researcher involved in the investigation who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity put the number of hacked Exchange servers at more than 30,000 in the US alone, and hundreds of thousands worldwide, all apparently by the same group. Independent cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs first reported that 30,000 figure Friday, citing sources who had briefed national security officials.

The 30,000 figure shortly grew to 60,000 over the weekend as the full scope of the hack became understood.

“They went to town and started doing mass exploitation — indiscriminate attacks compromising exchange servers, literally around the world, with no regard to purpose or size or industry,” Stephen Adair, head of Volexity, a Virginia cybersecurity company, said in an interview with Bloomberg. “They were hitting any and every server that they could.”

The Chinese hackers’ tactics indicate a level of bad faith that can only be described as an act of war in cyberspace. They hit ice cream companies, banks, small businesses, the European Banking Authority, governmental agencies, whatever. They set up back doors into lots of these servers so they could continue their attacks later. They stole whatever information was available without regard to whether it had intelligence value.

And when asked about the hack, the response was a grin and a middle-finger salute:

Asked about Microsoft’s attribution of the attack to China, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said Wednesday that the country “firmly opposes and combats cyber attacks and cyber theft in all forms” and suggested that blaming a particular nation was a “highly sensitive political issue.”

And what is the Biden administration doing about this? Sanctioning Russia, of course.

Wait, what?

The Russians were reportedly the villains behind the SolarWinds hack, and the administration is hell-bent on punishing them for that:

It plans a series of clandestine actions across Russian networks — intended to send a message to Vladimir Putin and his intelligence services — combined with economic sanctions. President Joe Biden could issue an executive order to shore up federal agencies against Russian hacking, the newspaper reported. “We are undertaking a whole of government response to assess and address the impact,” a White House official wrote in an email on Saturday. “This is an active threat still developing and we urge network operators to take it very seriously.”

Of course, there is reason to believe the Chinese were also involved in the SolarWinds fiasco, something the Biden administration hasn’t been too forthcoming in discussing. Now we have the Microsoft hack, which appears to be a whole lot worse.

And the Russians are going to get it. While the Chinese laugh.

You would think that the people in charge of our national security and government infrastructure now would be especially anxious to prove themselves up to the challenge of China. Especially since it was necessary to use unprecedented levels of propaganda and suppression of relevant information from the public of just how compromised the current president is by the Chinese in order for those people to attain the power they hold.

In other words, it’s more than a little suspicious that Joe Biden and his minions don’t have much to say about Chinese hackers conducting unrestricted cyberwarfare against American civilian digital infrastructure, while they’re talking tough about the smaller Russian cybersecurity threat, given the fact that Chinese communist business interests were doing sweetheart deals with Biden’s crackhead son Hunter.

You would think the Biden administration would be awfully sensitive to that and would therefore act as forcefully as possible against the Chinese.

Economic sanctions, let’s say, until the hackers responsible were produced to be tried and sentenced in American courts. Or cyberwarfare in return. Or, most importantly, a continuation of the Trump administration’s efforts to rip our supply chain out of China as quickly as practicable.

See anything much along those lines right now?

No?

Me neither.

But we’ll surely stick it to those sneaky Russians.

There’s an old college basketball joke, originating in a quip from famous University of Nevada, Las Vegas coach Jerry Tarkanian, that goes like this: The NCAA is so furious at Kentucky’s cheating that they just gave Cleveland State two more years of probation.

China is Biden’s Kentucky. He’s standing by and doing nothing while the Chinese wage war on the world using every means other than military — so far — because just like the NCAA couldn’t afford to bury Kentucky with probation and tournament bans, Biden can’t afford a public throw-down with the Chinese. They’re too big, and they can do him too much damage.

And Joe Biden surely lacks the stones to find out. Nobody really doubts that.

You’ll see this play out over the next four years, and it isn’t going to be good. It started with COVID-19, which might not have been a deliberate release of a bioweapon, but the Chinese clearly employed their bioweapons playbook once it was out. After all, when it was more possible to fly to Milan from Wuhan than it was to fly to Beijing, you can’t really deny the ChiComs would much rather let that virus spread around the world than to contain the damage to within their own borders.

Now the contagion is in cyberspace.

It’s been in the culture. It’s clearly in politics and finance.

What’s next? Taiwan?

And what will Biden do to check China before there is a hot war in the South China Sea or somewhere else? What plans does he have to force these people to behave as members of the world community?

Plans?

Come on, man.",https://spectator.org/category/americana/the-talkies/,2021-03-09
"China, Hong Kong, and the Danger of Tyrannical Ideology - The American Spectator","Identifying a problem is at best only half the job of fixing the world. Responsibility demands that we must determine whether any proposed solution to the problem will result in actual betterment.

No one made this point more strongly that Edmund Burke. Burke, a Whig in the House of Commons in the late 1700s, was a powerful supporter of the American colonists and of American independence. When revolution came to France in 1789, however, he expressed serious reservations:

The effect of liberty on individuals is that they may do what they please; we ought to see what it will please them to do before we risk congratulations that may soon become complaints. Prudence would dictate this even in the case of private men considered individually; but when men act in bodies, liberty is power. Thinking people won’t declare themselves on this until they see the use that is made of power.

Burke wrote these words in 1790, when the French Revolution had only just begun to spin out of control. It would not take too long for the Terror to emerge. Waving the banner of liberty, fraternity, and equality, it set a hideous example that would be followed by the ideology-toting tyrants who brought ruin and death to millions — and continue to do so today.

What is so insidious about the ideologues is that they point to real problems. Whether the misery of exploited workers or the squalid oppression of colonial bureaucrats, militant ideologues have spoken about pressing issues. But by one means or another, they have always succeeded in evading Burkean responsibility for outcomes, until they inevitably inflict their greater evil upon the world.

One example of such a real problem exploited by tyrannical ideologues was the discriminatory attitudes and actions of Europe’s colonial powers in Asia. As the military increasingly took over the leadership of Japan in the 1930s, it focused Japanese public opinion on the obnoxious British contempt of Asians that was so evident to the native populations affected by the rule of British imperialism in the Far East.

Until they were laid low in 1945, the Japanese militarists played out what often seemed a winning hand. They mobilized enough support to launch the first of the many wars that eventually became World War II. In the course of their ascendancy, from the 1931 invasion of Manchuria until VJ Day, Japan’s army killed Chinese and other Asians by the millions and inflicted such signal miseries and humiliations on their captive ethnicities as forced prostitution for the Japanese troops and forced subjection to medical experimentation.

Britain, heir to Burkean political rationalism, with its core understanding that humans are imperfect and must conserve the wisdom of the past in order to continue to improve in the future, was not unaware of its shortcomings and errors. Many in Britain recognized the legitimacy of the main complaints Japanese propaganda was voicing, including by people in positions of power. A British diplomat of the time wrote, “We acquired our dominant position in China as the result of our wars with that country in the nineteenth century and we can now only keep it by the same or similar methods.” Foreign Office documents show an awareness of the long-term untenability of such a position.

Japan did drive Britain out of Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaya following its surprise attack in December 1941. Britain retook control of Hong Kong at the war’s end and kept control of it until a treaty negotiated with the People’s Republic of China turned over sovereignty to the Chinese Communist Party on condition that for another half-century, the people of Hong Kong would enjoy the same basic political liberties they had had under British law.

And in giving up the territory gained in the Opium Wars, Britain allowed its most compelling and enduring gift to shine and inspire. Britain’s empire came and went, but the gift of a system of law that is shaped to preserve liberty draws admiration and emulation, especially when it is contrasted to systems far less concerned about freedom.

In the last decade, the increasingly aggressive regime in China dramatically ramped up its long drive to eliminate political freedom in Hong Kong. This in turn brought about dramatic mass protests in Hong Kong, as the gift of political freedom inspired millions to resist the clumsy and threatening encroachments of the power monopolists of Beijing.

The CCP responded to the mass protests by a thoroughgoing revocation of the rights it had guaranteed and the reduction to zero of any of the cherished liberties of dissent and free political expression, which are at the core of the English law tradition. Protest leaders have been rounded up and imprisoned, the Hong Kong courts have no independence, and local governance is only by those who are approved by the central government. The regime has been generously applying its well-honed instruments of psychological and physical abuse to break the will to resist their complete domination.

Winston Marshall, a founder of the British folk-rock group Mumford and Sons, became deeply involved in supporting the cause of Hong Kong. In a very serious and deep interview recently with Ayaan Hirsi Ali, he spoke at length of how he was motivated to take up the cause by seeing how little the gravity of the abuse was registering on the public, especially in his Millennial age group.

Marshall’s brief word of appreciation of Andy Ngo’s work in exposing Antifa subjected him to a tsunami of indignation from the ranks of those who have crowned themselves as woke defenders of all that is socially just. Marshall, who sees himself as belonging neither to the left or right, could not understand why the profound Chinese abuses of human rights in Hong Kong and in their grotesque mass imprisonment of the Muslim Uyghurs have brought so little protest among his peers.

Marshall is impressive in his independence of thought and the clarity of his concern. He is not campaigning as a Trumpian or an anti-Trumpian, as Tory or as a Laborite. He shows a Burkean concern for looking beyond the mere claims of those working for societal change to get to the core issue: do the actions of leaders produce something better or not? If not, they must be exposed and protested against.

Communism has always been adept at portraying itself as rectifying great injustices. Today’s version of the Marxist vision is no different. Racism is bad and should be ended. On that, there is greater agreement in America and in the West than ever. The question is whether or not the solutions posed to racism and imperialism result in something better.

Looking with Andy Ngo and Winston Marshall at Portland, or with parents across the nation at their children’s education going in the exact opposite of Dr. King’s goal of people not being judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character, many people are seeing what Burke saw. They agree with the problem, but they criticize solutions that are substandard at best.

Certainly, in Hong Kong and in the Xinjiang home of the Uyghurs, the solution is far worse than the alleged problem the authorities claim to be addressing. It is dismaying that so many in free political societies have not taken on that basic responsibility epitomized in Burke’s simple question. The world needs true warriors for justice, not stuffed and mocking effigies whose policies result in increased injustice and its attendant miseries. We need to care about the practical results of the power we all wield as free citizens.

The message is as old as the book of Genesis, where we learn the principle that power and goodness must always be exactly linked. The new religions that erect their own gods, whether the Goddess of Reason of the Jacobins, the immortal Lenin of the Soviets, the Great Helmsman cult of the CCP, or whatever inchoate faith moves the woke in the West believe themselves unaccountable to any such principle.

Those who take up the challenge to be responsible for the results of their exercise of political power believe themselves accountable to something beyond kowtowing to some new and artificial ideological orthodoxy. The principles of Burke and of Genesis have proven themselves capable of sustaining societies that can be self-critical and dedicated to continuous and successful social betterment. Neither Jacobism, communism, wokeism, nor any similar ideology offer anything comparable.",https://spectator.org/category/blog/,2021-07-18
China’s India Gambit - The American Spectator,"The Ladakh plateau is a high-altitude desert, sparsely populated, parts of it studded with poplar, deodar, and juniper trees. It comprises the Himalayan and Kunlan mountain ranges, consists of river valleys, and has limited flora and fauna. It is an inhospitable place that is part of the Kashmir region of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, now under direct control of New Delhi as Union Territory since 2019. The Aksai Chin area of Ladakh is under Chinese control since a war between India and China in 1962 — but claimed by India.

Since April, there has been an uneasy standoff there of the world’s two largest armies: in an incident, 20 Indian soldiers were killed in hand-to-hand combat, along with an unspecified number of Chinese. Both sides have increased their military resources, and most recently China has dispatched H-6 bombers capable of carrying cruise missiles that can strike Indian mountain bases. In the meantime, India has procured the Russian S-400 air defense system that it intends to install in Ladakh. Of late, both sides seem to be trying to moderate tensions, pledging not to send more troops, and increasing communications to avoid a misunderstanding.

So why is China resorting to bullying tactics against India at this time?

First, China is giving India a warning not to tilt too closely toward the United States. U.S.–India relations are a success story over several administrations in each country. India’s current defense budget of $74 billion has limited capacity for weapons imports from abroad; in recent years, however, the U.S. has emerged, after Russia, as a leading supplier, along with Europe and Israel. India is interested in acquiring from the U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drones, Boeing’s Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, other aircraft for intelligence purposes, and an air defense system made in partnership by Raytheon Technologies Corporation and Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace AS of Norway.

Further, and as I have written in these pages, Boeing is collaborating with the Tata Group and with Mahindra & Mahindra to manufacture Apache attack helicopters and the F/A-18 Hornet, and Lockheed Martin is partnering with Tata to make the F-16 Fighting Falcon.

Of late, and contemporaneous with the standoff in Ladakh, the USS Nimitz carrier strike group conducted exercises with the Indian Navy in the Indian Ocean, where both India and China have strategic interests to maintain the oil sea lanes. Moreover, and continuing for many years, is Operation Malabar, a naval exercise comprising the U.S., India, and Japan. The U.S. and Indian navies also have a joint logistics agreement as well as the ability to share encryption platforms.

Second, while the U.S. and India in particular are devastated by COVID-19, believed to have originated from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan, China is leveraging an opportunity to advance its hegemony while the world is in chaos. However, its Belt and Road Initiative, which embraces about 70 countries with trade and investment protocols centered upon Beijing, does not include India, which is a holdout. With English law, language, and considerable Western culture, India has no intention of accepting a rules-based order commanded by Beijing.

Third, China appears to be emboldened by its successful lockdown to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, with its second-quarter GDP on the mend and increasing by over 3 percent. Admittedly, there is a credibility issue with statements emanating from China, although its seeming return to quasi-normalcy is nonetheless faster than that of Western democracies. Having survived a devastating hit from the coronavirus, the Chinese Politburo may calculate in its moments of hubris that it can prevail in the humiliation of India.

Why China Cannot Close Its Doors - The American Spectator,"In the height of the U.S.–China clash, the CCP’s new moves are worth noting. First, it has softened its aggressive stance and has again promoted the “mutual benefits of China–U.S. cooperation”; second, and simultaneously, it has begun to promote an inward shift for its economy in case the democratic world delinks with it.

These moves raise two closely linked questions. First, can China under the CCP change into a benevolent trading partner for democracies? Second, what would happen if the CCP closes China?

Before we address these questions, we need to briefly describe how the CCP runs China as a giant corporation. While typically we think of governments running countries in a purely bureaucratic sense, the CCP owns China, literally. All China’s resources and people are its properties. The Communist Party is deeply intertwined with, and exercises total control over, all businesses in China. Doing business in China is not a right, but a privilege granted by the party. This privilege is only extended to international trading partners in exchange for political support and technologies (which are then used against those countries internationally) and is frequently revoked when a trading partner criticizes the CCP’s poor human rights record (or even when Taiwan’s existence is acknowledged). Firms from democratic countries cannot hope to freely conduct business activities in China independent of the CCP’s interferences, or to compete with the CCP’s lack of rule of law, theft of trade secrets, and bottomless subsidies for industries in which it hopes to attain dominance.

Internally, China, Inc. has a rigid hierarchy: the CCP is the owner, and the Chinese people are workers who cannot organize, have no legal rights, and cannot freely quit. Within the CCP, the general secretary is the CEO, and the seven politburo standing members are the board of directors. With absolute power and no checks and balances, it is in their best interest to take China’s resources as their own and exploit the workers — the Chinese people. In the economic game between the owners (the CCP and its top leaders) and the workers (the Chinese people), the former has a disproportionately powerful upper hand. The gain of the CCP is at the absolute loss of the people. To increase its benefits, the CCP keeps taking from the people, and the people have to work harder and harder to satisfy the CCP’s insatiable greed. This is why the Chinese people bitterly joke about themselves as “chives” (an edible grass), and the CCP periodically mow the chives (collect money from the people). From 1949 when the CCP founded the People’s Republic of China to 1976 when Mao Zedong died, Mao and the CCP kept China closed, and the exploitation of the people by the CCP eventually drove China into a civil war — the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which totally destroyed the economy.

After Mao’s death, the CCP, out of economic desperation, opened China. Democracies welcomed the move with open arms in the hope that economic growth would usher in democracy in China. By now, we know that that hope was mere wishful thinking and the CCP adamantly rejects democracy and the rule of law. The Chinese people have not risen up against it because they have thus far benefited from the CCP’s economic moves since that opening.

This is because international trade fundamentally changed the economic game of China, Inc. Instead of the owners (CCP and its leaders) totally relying on exploiting the workers (the Chinese people), they now can take advantage of trading with foreign countries. Take the case of the high-speed rail industry: China imported trains from German, French, and Japanese firms, combined all the new technology into a new set of trains called the Fuxing, and now has CRRC (their gigantic rail monopoly) export the Fuxing trainset all over the world. The monopolistic profits from such exports trickle down to the Chinese people. The CCP has used its unfair trading practices to dominate a number of industries in this fashion. Seeing their pocketbooks fattened in this manner lends support to the party from the people — even if the CCP earns a disproportionate share of the gains.

In sum, by its nature, China, Inc. must interact with the world in order to thrive. International trade helps the CCP to mitigate its confrontation with the Chinese people, because China, Inc. gains from trade and can use a fraction of the gain to pacify the workers. The success of China, Inc. and the orderly coexistence of the CCP and the Chinese people depend on the democracies’ willingness to trade with China and tolerance of its unfair and predatory behaviors.

We need to make a clarification about regime type (democracy versus dictatorship) and trade relations. Democracies can mutually benefit from trade, but countries under dictatorship frequently do not because they prey upon each other. So, in order to benefit from trade, countries under dictatorship, such as China, must trade with democracies and take advantage of them. In this sense, China’s trade relationship with the democratic countries is analogous to Fagan’s gang in Charles Dickens’s Oliver Twist: Fagan’s gang can thrive only because the outside world — London — allows them to steal.

What if London delinks from Fagan’s gang? Fagan and his thieves will begin infighting and kill each other. By the same logic, if China is closed, the irreconcilable conflict of interest between the CCP and the people will become more pronounced and may even spiral out of control. China, Inc., by its nature, is expansive and predatory, and China cannot afford to be closed. China needs democracies to trade and thrive more than the latter needs China. Democracies must know this and deal with the CCP and its China, Inc. accordingly: if the CCP wants to trade, it cannot run China as a corporation. It must follow the rule of law, trade fairly, stop stealing, and most importantly, not use China’s market as a tool to silence other countries when they criticize the CCP’s numerous human rights violations. If the CCP cannot or will not meet these conditions, which, based on its nature and history, is likely, the democracies must delink from China, Inc.",https://spectator.org/category/crime-time/,2020-08-18
China Is as China Does - The American Spectator,"To state the obvious, we don’t know what we don’t know, but it seems to me this enhances the role of science rather than faith. In the case of the bug, it has been noted that many of the epidemiological projections seem based on faith, or the perverse deformation of faith called bigotry, more than science. Which begins and ends with a careful search for facts; this used to be standard practice in journalism as well, though necessarily with less rigor.

Facts depend on other facts. Many regions of Africa have scarce medical resources and unsanitary water supplies, among other drawbacks. Noting these facts was thought to bolster projections that the bug epidemic from China would overwhelm the whole continent.

With notable exceptions, the African continent has resisted the bug far better than western Europe and North America. The notable exceptions have been countries of high Chinese commercial contact, such as Algeria, though not Ethiopia. What explains this? More facts are needed. One area of Chinese density is the island of Taiwan — the (free) Republic of China — which the Free World, led by U.S. administrations of both parties, did not exactly stab in the back, but treated rather shabbily. Yet free China has resisted the red China bug, better than people who thought Mao was better than Chiang, as this charming film clip explains.",https://spectator.org/category/flynn-files/,2020-05-07
"China Is Persecuting Muslims, and We Should Do Something About It - The American Spectator","Recent developments add to an already glaring case that China is persecuting Uyghur Muslims. Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that China has been using malware in cell phones to spy on and track the movement of Uyghurs since as early as 2013. This is believed to be the first step in the establishment of an intricate surveillance state targeting the Uyghurs that includes “collecting blood samples, voice prints, facial scans and other personal data.” Chinese companies are assisting the government in this surveillance, including Huawei and ByteDance, the operator of Douyin (TikTok in China). The U.S. Department of Commerce placed restrictions on nine other Chinese companies in May 2020, adding to a list of 28 more from October 2019, due to their involvement in human rights abuses of the Uyghurs and other groups.

If that wasn’t disturbing enough, earlier this month, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seized a shipment of 13 tons of products made from human hair believed to be from the heads of Uyghurs. According to CBP, this shipment “indicat[es] potential human right[s] abuses of forced child labor and imprisonment.” This has “many distressing echoes” of the Holocaust, where Nazis used hair and skin from Jews to make textiles, lampshades, and photo albums.

But there is hope for justice. Two recent developments may serve as breakthroughs for establishing an actionable case that China is committing genocide against the Uyghurs.

The first development occurred this month, where two Uyghur exile groups filed a case against China in the International Criminal Court (ICC). Their 80-page complaint alleges genocide and crimes against humanity, and implicates over 30 Chinese officials, including Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China. While China does not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC, the plaintiffs hope to establish jurisdiction by focusing on China’s role in having Uyghurs deported from Cambodia and Tajikistan back to China. Both Cambodia and Tajikistan recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC. Counsel for the plaintiffs hope to draw on previous legal precedent; according to counsel, the ICC ruled that it “it has jurisdiction when crimes start or end in a member state” in 2018 with Myanmar’s (not an ICC’s member) deportation of Muslims who fled to Bangladesh (an ICC member).

The second development is a report written last month by Adrian Zenz, Senior Fellow of China Studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. This report buttresses the claim that China is committing genocide in its coercive sterilization of Uyghur women. The 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide stipulates a list of acts that constitute genocide, or “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.” One of those acts is “[i]mposing measures intended to prevent births within the group.”

Drawing from Chinese government documents, Zenz states that China has a policy of sterilization directed at the Uyghurs. Failure of the Uyghurs to comply is punishable by internment in “training” camps. Zenz points to government documents showing a targeted sterilization campaign in 2019 of “14 and 34 percent of all married women of childbearing age in two Uyghur counties.” Further, Zenz shows that the Chinese Xinjiang government aimed to administer “intrusive birth prevention procedures,” i.e. sterilizations or IUDs, in 80 percent of women of childbearing age in the four minority, rural southern prefectures. Zenz asserts that the actual number is likely closer to 90 percent. Between 2015 and 2018, nearly eight times more IUDs were placed in Xinjiang per capita than the national population.

In addition to coercive sterilizations, more evidence is coming to light of China’s organ harvesting of Uyghurs and Falun Gong. In its judgment from March, the Independent Tribunal into Forced Organ Harvesting from Prisoners of Conscience in China (“The China Tribunal”) concluded that present evidence shows China’s organ harvesting amount to “physical acts” of genocide. One of those “physical acts” according to the 1948 Genocide Convention is “[c]ausing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group.” The China Tribunal, however, could not find evidence sufficient for establishing the “mental intent” needed to fully establish genocide. Nonetheless, the China Tribunal concluded that China’s acts constituted crimes of humanity “beyond reasonable doubt.”

And evidence of such crimes against humanity is numerous. In January of this year, Taiwan News reported that 37 Saudi nationals requested “Halal organs,” from primarily Uyghurs in 2006 at the Department of Liver Transplantation of Tianjin Taida Hospital. An eyewitness was allegedly told that these donors were “slaughtered on demand.” Enver Tohti, a Uyghur surgeon, also claimed to have removed the kidneys and liver from a live Uyghur prisoner in 1995. He made a similar claim in testimony to the Scottish Parliament in April 2013, as shown in the 2015 Peabody Award-winning documentary Human Harvest. Human Harvest provides further evidence of organ harvesting, focusing on the Falun Gong population. The documentary features an employee of a hospital in China claiming that physicians at that hospital forcibly removed corneas and livers from a live Falun Gong member, and a Chinese policeman claiming he witnessed a heart and kidney transplant from a living Falun Gong member. According to Human Harvest, as of 2015, China executed up to 60,000 Falun Gong members for purposes of organ harvesting.

Recent events show a mounting case that China is committing both genocide and crimes against humanity against the Uyghurs. The United States should use this information to undermine China’s standing in international organizations. As I have argued previously in The American Spectator, the United States could pressure the World Trade Organization (WTO) to remove China unless China demonstrates improvements in human rights. If this is not feasible, Congress could vote to withdraw the U.S. from the WTO later this month, and then can re-activate the Jackson–Vanik amendment in order to link trade with China to Chinese advances in human rights. The United States and its allies should not let China get away with its persecution of the Uyghurs.",https://spectator.org/category/in-print-spring-2022/,2020-07-20
Good News: We’re Heading Back to the Moon. Bad News: China Beat Us. - The American Spectator,"This week, NASA selected four private companies to collect lunar resources to further its goals of landing the first woman and next man on the Moon by 2024. In a distinctly effervescent teleconference, NASA Acting Associate Administrator Mike Gold announced Lunar Outpost’s successful bid to collect samples in 2023 from the lunar South Pole and transfer ownership of the lunar regolith to NASA for one dollar. Ispace Europe’s bid was for $5,000, and Masten Space Systems came in at $15,000. Ispace Japan’s winning bid was $5,000, with their lander scheduled to reach Lacus Somniorum on the Moon’s northeastern near side in 2022.

Given the incredible successes of the last few months, NASA’s euphoria is understandable. They certainly seem to be on a roll. OSIRIS-REx successfully touched down on asteroid Bennu last September, scooped a load of asteroid dust and debris, and is now being configured to return the samples to Earth in 2023. While OSIRIS-REx was stowing away its samples, the Mars 2020 mission with the Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter was halfway to Mars and is scheduled to land on the red planet in February 2021. This last May, SpaceX launched the first crewed orbital spaceflight from the United States to the International Space Station (ISS) since 2011, and followed up last month by delivering an international crew of astronauts to the ISS. A follow-on SpaceX cargo mission launches today.

But as NASA contracts commercial providers to land on the moon over the next few years, China is already there. China’s National Space Administration launched their Chang’e 5 (Goddess of the Moon 5) lunar lander atop a Long March 5 rocket on November 23 on a no-nonsense lunar-sample return mission. Achieving lunar orbit, the lander/ascender separated from the orbiter/return vehicle and landed near the peak of Mons Rümker in the Oceanus Procellarum. If all goes well, the rover will collect 4.4 lbs. of moon rock (regolith) over a two-week period from as deep as 6 feet beneath the lunar surface, pack the samples into the ascent vehicle, blast off, link up with the orbiter, and return to Earth. The sample is scheduled to touch down in inner Mongolia by December 16 — in plenty of time for Christmas.

If all of NASA’s corporate partners succeed in landing on the moon over the next few years, and if they all actually collect a small amount of lunar regolith, NASA will own little piles of lunar material scattered about the lunar surface. NASA has no current plans on how they will recover the samples, but the price is right — a bargain at exactly $25,001 for all four missions.

China, on the other hand — if all goes well — will have been studying its four-plus pounds of new lunar material for years before NASA is able to even consider retrieval.

How did China get so far ahead?

President George W. Bush’s “Vison for Space” relied on the Constellation Program, providing for a Space Shuttle replacement, the completion of the International Space Station (ISS), a return to the moon no later than 2020, and crewed flight to the planet Mars.

In 2009, without consulting Congress, President Barack Obama scrubbed the Constellation Program, citing cost overruns, dooming the U.S Space Program to eight years of reliance on Russia’s Federal Space Agency to “shuttle” U.S. astronauts to and from the ISS.

While Obama was gutting NASA, China was finalizing its first prototype space station Tiangong-1 (Celestial Palace 1) as a crewed laboratory, and orbital testbed. Tiangong-2 was launched in September 2016 as a testbed for crewed and Shenzhou spacecraft and uncrewed Tianzhou-1 cargo vessels.

China launched the Chang’e 2 lunar orbiter in 2010 to map the surface of the Moon in greater detail, followed by Chang’e 3 lander and Yutu (Jade Rabbit) rover in 2013, which explored the northern region of Mare Ibrium. In 2018, Chang’e 4 and Yutu 4 rover landed on the dark side of the moon to explore the South Pole–Aitken Basin, where it continues to operate to this day.

On July 23, the week before NASA launched the Mars 2020 Perseverance/Ingenuity mission, China launched Tianwen-1 (Quest for Heavenly Truth), China’s first interplanetary mission. Tianwen-1 is expected to arrive in Mars orbit between February 11 and 24, 2021 — and set down in Utopia Planitia (south of NASA’s Viking 2 landing site and northeast of Elysium Planitia, the current location of NASA’s InSight Lander).

Does it matter? Have we caught up? Can we keep up?

Within his first year in offic,e President Donald J. Trump resurrected the National Space Council (defunct since 1993). He signed Space Policy Directive 1, calling for NASA to fast-track plans to return to the Moon and establish a lunar colony as a proving ground for deep space missions to Mars. He stood up the United States Space Force to fortify national assets and scan Earth’s orbit for threats. We are back on track with the core goals and timelines established in President Bush’s Constellation Project. But the next four years are critical.

Just as the United States has regained access to low-Earth orbit and the ISS, China is about to launch the core module of its new third-generation space station, Tianhe (Unification of Heaven). The 66-metric-ton space station could potentially expand to six modules, partnering with 17 countries for experimentation in low-Earth orbit.

It is a reality that has NASA chief Jim Bridenstine genuinely concerned. “A day is coming when the International Space Station comes to the end of its useful life,” Bridenstine said. “In order to be able to have the United States of America have a presence in low Earth orbit, we have to be prepared for what comes next.”

NASA emerged after eight years of Obama, struggling to make the false hope of private sector partners a reality. President Trump put money and muscle behind the project, and it remains NASA’s best and only hope for space travel. Bridenstine has requested $150 million for fiscal year 2021 to fund the commercialization of low-Earth orbit. “I don’t think it’s in the interest of the nation to build another International Space Station,” he said. “I do think it is in the interest of the nation to support commercial industry, where NASA is the customer.”

In announcing the companies selected to “collect lunar resources under the Artemis program,” Mike Gold spelled it out. “Apollos’s fatal flaw is that it ended,” Gold said. “Landing the first woman and the next man on the Moon will require a sustainable paradigm.”

But what if President-elect Joe Biden actually moves into the White House? The Biden–Harris administration has announced four priorities: COVID-19, economic recovery, “racial equity,” and climate change. The emphasis on climate change/Earth science will likely come at the expense of space exploration and the Artemis program. Just as President Obama killed the Constellation program, initiating an eight-year nuclear winter for NASA, a President Biden, unlikely to pursue a program so closely tied to President Trump, is almost certain to cancel Artemis.

China’s Space Program is not at the mercy of political lunacy, which turns on the spigots of research funds under conservative leadership only to turn them off again under radical liberal regimes. While we faltered, China doggedly stayed on track, becoming the only country that has landed on the moon in decades.

In a Space Race back to the Moon, the winner will own lunar resources, own crewed flight to Mars, and own the future of space travel. The loser won’t.",https://spectator.org/category/news/,2020-12-05
China Moves to Buy Off Africa - The American Spectator,"In an important article in the American Conservative, researcher John Mac Ghlionn provides further evidence that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is aiming at no less than geopolitical primacy on what Sir Halford Mackinder called the Eurasian-African “World-Island.” Mac Ghlionn’s article, entitled “As the US Slept, China Captured Africa,” shows that China is moving to replace American influence on a continent that has 1.2 billion people with the “youngest population in the world” (70 percent of sub-Saharan Africans are under 30 years old), “is home to an abundance of natural resources,” possesses “65 percent of the world’s arable land,” and has “almost a third of the world’s mineral reserves,” “40 percent of the world’s gold deposits,” and significant natural-gas and oil reserves.

China recently hosted a Forum on China-Africa Media Cooperation that “emphasized the importance of deepening cooperation and collaborative efforts between China and Africa.” Mac Ghlionn notes that a recent survey by a South African think-tank indicated that by a 10-point margin Africans believe that China has a more significant influence on their continent than the United States. Just two years ago, that same survey favored the United States over China. A survey researcher opined that former President Donald Trump “resonated with African youth” and “was seen as a powerful, charismatic leader,” whereas Africans’ perception of America as led by President Joe Biden “has changed drastically.”

Mac Ghlionn notes that the CCP plans to waive debts owed by 17 African nations and invest $300 billion more in Africa. “It’s clear,” he writes, “that, in return for generous investments, the CCP demands access to influential military and political personnel, as well as valuable minerals,” such as lithium in Zimbabwe, diamonds in Botswana, and cassiterite in Rwanda.

When observers discuss China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), they focus on the Eurasian component but sometimes leave out the African component. China’s leaders and strategists understand what Mackinder wrote about in his 1919 masterpiece Democratic Ideals and Reality. Mackinder divided the globe geopolitically into “one ocean covering nine-twelfths of the globe; … one continent—the World-Island—covering two-twelfths of the globe; and … many smaller islands … which together cover the remaining one-twelfth.” Strategists and statesmen, Mackinder explained, “must no longer think of Europe apart from Asia and Africa. The Old World has become insular, or in other words a unit, incomparably the largest geographical unit on our globe.” (READ MORE from Francis P. Sempa: China’s New White Paper on Taiwan: We Ignore It at Our Peril)

The combined Eurasian-African landmass, Mackinder noted further, is a “world-promontory” that strategically boasts both insularity and incomparable human and natural resources. He wrote:

What if … the whole World-Island or a large part of it, were at some future time to become a single and united base of sea-power? Would not the other insular bases be outbuilt as regards ships and outmanned as regards seamen? Their fleets would no doubt fight with all the heroism begotten of their histories, but the end would be fated.

Add air power, space power, and cyber power to the equation, and Mackinder’s World-Island concept is updated for the present.

Robert Kaplan, America’s most prominent contemporary geopolitical thinker, has written that, with the melting Arctic Ocean, Mackinder’s concept of the World-Island is a reality of international politics, and China’s BRI, which has both land and maritime components, is designed to extend to all parts of Eurasia-Africa. Add to this the fact of the growing Sino-Russian strategic partnership, and what Mackinder memorably wrote in 1919 could become reality: “Who rules the World-Island commands the World.”

Mac Ghlionn ominously concludes his article with the following warning: “The influence China exerts over the African continent cannot be emphasized enough. Just two years ago, the U.S. was considered Africa’s number-one ally. Today, it has been not just dethroned, but overtaken by its number-one global rival.” Yet another “accomplishment” of the Biden administration.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/,2022-09-05
China Mum on Trump's ‘Incredible Deal’ - The American Spectator,"President Trump may be cheering “an incredible deal” with China that will at least put on hold some of the contention between the two countries, but there are signs that it’s too soon to celebrate.

Reuters noted that the higher-ups in Chinese government are remaining mum on the talks between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit in Argentina this past weekend.

The country’s foreign ministry keeps referring questions on details of the discussion to the commerce ministry — and that agency isn’t talking, although it will hold a weekly news briefing on Thursday.

A Chinese official told Reuters that the government was waiting on its leaders to return before speaking. Xi and other senior officials are set to get back to China on Thursday after visiting Portugal.

The U.S. and China agreed to hit pause on their trade war for 90 days, the White House reported. Trump said he will hold off on his plan to raise all of the previously implemented tariffs to 25 percent on Jan. 1. He also will not impose duties on the remaining Chinese imports.

The White House has said China has agreed to buy a number of products from the United States in the sectors of farm, energy, and industrial, among others, but the Trump administration hasn’t laid out specifics. American soybean farmers have been hit particularly hard in the tariff wars after China stop buying their yield.

Trump said in a tweet that farmers would be “a very BIG and FAST beneficiary” of the China deal.

“They intend to start purchasing agricultural product immediately,” Trump wrote. “We make the finest and cleanest product in the World, and that is what China wants.”

China will also cut tariffs on imported American vehicles, Trump said. The current import rate is an astronomical 40 percent and it’s unclear what the new level would be.

China, meanwhile, hasn’t spoken publicly on any of this.

Fang Kechen, a Chinese media researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, told Reuters that “the Chinese government doesn’t want its people to consider the agreement as a failure for China.”

Trump created a new moniker for himself on Tuesday, declaring himself the “Tariff Man,” as a thinly-veiled threat to China if it backs out of the tentative agreements that were apparently made in Buenos Aires.

“President Xi and I want this deal to happen, and it probably will. But if not remember, I am a Tariff Man,” Trump tweeted.

“When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so,” he continued. “It will always be the best way to max out our economic power. We are right now taking in $billions in Tariffs. MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAIN.”

But as Tariff Man crows, American businesses left and right are reporting lost profits and job cuts in the wake of the economic fallout from the trade wars started by the tariffs.

General Motors recently announced plans to close plants and slash employment by 14,000. It had previously lowered its projected profits for 2018 in part due to higher costs for steel and aluminum resulting from Trump’s tariffs.

The president criticized GM CEO Mary Barra, saying “I spoke with her when I heard they were closing [a plant in Ohio], and I said, you know, this country has done a lot for General Motors.”

The New York Times noted that another hazy sign for a deal with China is the choice of U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer to lead the talks. Lighthizer has advised Trump to use hard-line tactics such as the tariffs to press China for a change in its trade tactics.

The outlet pointed out that deep divisions remain about how China treats American companies, including its lack of respect for intellectual property.

Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who prefers a lighter touch with China, had previously been the point man for negotiations but failed to close a satisfactory deal.

“The greatest amount of expertise in the administration, on trade and China, is held by Bob Lighthizer,” Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who has been advising the Trump administration, told the Times. “The Chinese are wary because they know he’s the real deal.”

The talk of a truce helped the stock market regain some recently lost ground early this week, but financial analysts are still wary. Citigroup wrote in a note to clients that the road for the trade deal between the two nations is “not one without potential pitfalls, and that such a ‘truce’ may well prove to be temporary, particularly when considering how the U.S. will try to enforce the implementation of such a deal.”",https://spectator.org/category/politics/a-further-perspective/,2018-12-05
China Needs to Stop Enabling North Korea - The American Spectator,"Back in 2016’s November elections, the Obama administration warned Donald Trump’s transition team that North Korea would be the top security priority for the incoming administration. The advice proved to be true; North Korea has increasingly become a threat in 2017. In February, Kim Jong Un allegedly sent North Korean agents internationally to murder his half brother, Kim Jong Nam, as part of a leadership purge. A more imminent threat, North Korea continues to test ballistic missiles, the most recent occurring on July 4th. It was the first successful nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles that theoretically can reach Alaska. This is obviously a snipe at the United States during the most patriotic day of the year.

What does North Korea gain from threatening the United States? Often, North Korea leadership is caricatured as irrational. However, its pursuit of a nuclear weapons program fits into what it believes to be a rational goal—self-preservation. It is not internationally accepted as practical, but based on Libya’s and Iraq’s nuclear surrender, it is understandable that North Korea does not want to fall to the same fate. From North Korea’s point of view, having nuclear weapons makes it untouchable by the United States in addition to showing the North Korean public that Kim Jong Un can keep his country safe from “western imperialists”. It seems to me that North Korea is playing a bargaining game, appearing hawkish to gain leverage over possible negotiations and public favor. From the United State’s point of view, this is completely absurb, yet continues to work for North Korea.

The United States responded to Tuesday’s missile test with a joint military exercise with South Korean forces along the Korean Peninsula’s east coast. Furthermore U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, announced at an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council that the United States may need to take military action against North Korea. President Donald Trump vowed in a news conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda that the United States “will confront [North Korea] very strongly”. So far, this only means more sanctions on North Korea.

In a pointed tweet at China, Trump writes “Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us – but we had to give it a try!” This is true as the China Customs report in April shows that there was a 37.4 percent increase in trade between China and North Korea in the first quarter of 2017. However, the overall trend show a decline in trade activity. Nevertheless, China must stop supporting North Korea as it is North Korea’s main life source. The United States should aim its sanctions toward Chinese corporations that fund North Korea’s economic activities.

In fact, the Treasury Department has already taken some measures towards isolating Chinese companies with ties to North Koreans. These measures include sanctions for now, and possibly banning American financial institutions from collaborating with the Bank of Dandong, known for allowing North Koreans to circumvent sanctions. Sanctions against China are risky because the United State’s and China’s economies are intertwined. However, allowing North Korea to continue building a nuclear arsenal is an even more alarming danger. The United States government exists to protect its citizens from foreign attacks, thus it must continue to take difficult measures to ensure safety for its citizens.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/another-perspective/,2017-07-10
The Threat of a China-Centric New World Order - The American Spectator,"Writing in the January/February 2022 issue of Foreign Affairs, the Hoover Institution’s Elizabeth Economy explores Chinese President Xi Jinping’s efforts to shape the international order by “fundamentally transforming the global system” to reflect Beijing’s interests and values. The leader of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), she explains, seeks nothing less than to replace the U.S.-led post–World War II global order with a “China-centric order with its own norms and values.” To understand what is at stake here, let’s talk geopolitics.

Since the end of the 19th century, the world has been what the great British geopolitical thinker Sir Halford Mackinder called a “closed political system.” The end of the age of discovery ushered in a post-Columbian world where, in Mackinder’s words, “Every explosion of social forces, instead of being dissipated in a surrounding circuit of unknown space and barbaric chaos, will be sharply re-echoed from the far side of the globe, and weak elements in the political and economic organism of the world will be shattered in consequence.” The events of the 20th century confirmed Mackinder’s observation — through two world wars and one cold war, the center of the world’s geopolitical landscape shifted away from Europe to North America and Asia. At the end of this “long war,” which lasted from 1914 to 1989, the formerly Euro-centric international system was at first temporarily replaced by America’s “unipolar moment,” which gradually receded with the emergence of today’s bipolar geopolitical contest between the United States and China.

Economy notes in her article that the Sino-U.S. competition involves two very different visions of the global order. The U.S. vision, she explains, includes the rule of law, free markets, and a limited state role in people’s lives. “Xi,” she writes, “seeks to flip a switch and replace those values with the primacy of the state.” The CCP’s vision is of “a world in which the state controls the flow of information and capital both within its own borders and across international boundaries, and there is no independent check on its power.”

In the end, which vision triumphs will depend on who wins the geopolitical struggle. Economy notes that President Xi seeks to control the South China Sea, annex Taiwan, extend its economic and political influence throughout Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Europe through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and “supersede the United States as the dominant force in the Asia-Pacific.” The BRI, Economy notes, “has positioned China at the center of the international system, with its physical, financial, cultural, technological, and political influence flowing to the rest of the world,” while also evoking “historical memories of the Silk Road and of Chinese centrality during imperial times.”

The Asia-Pacific can serve as the base — the geopolitical heartland — from which China can make a bid for global dominance. Mackinder and like-minded geopolitical thinkers such as Alfred Thayer Mahan and Nicholas Spykman long ago warned about the rise of a great power on the Eurasian landmass that could use the vast human and natural resources of “the great continent” to forge a global imperium.

In his geopolitical masterwork Democratic Ideals and Reality (1919), Mackinder called the joint landmass of Eurasia-Africa the “World-Island” and cautioned that “Who rules the World-Island commands the world.” Economy notes that China’s former vice minister of foreign affairs He Yafei has asserted, “The end of Pax Americana, or the American Century, is in sight.” China has engaged in a multi-decade military buildup that includes an ever-expanding navy and a growing strategic nuclear force.

Economy notes that some observers continue to believe that Xi’s geopolitical goals are more limited and “overwhelmingly defensive” in nature. “That view,” she writes, “misses the scope of Xi’s vision,” which “connotes a radically transformed international order” in which a “resurgent China would be on par with or would surpass the United States” on the international stage. Xi, she concludes, is seeking a “shift in the geostrategic landscape” and a “profound transformation” of the global order.

What is to be done? Economy points out that China’s increasingly aggressive actions and bold proclamations have pushed its Asian neighbors toward the United States as a geopolitical counterweight to Chinese power, while the BRI is meeting with some resistance among some Asian and African nations. Moreover, China’s cultural offensive and other “soft power” initiatives have also suffered some setbacks. And its so-called “Wolf Warrior” diplomacy, which includes using economic coercion to further its political interests, is increasingly resented by other countries.

But the United States cannot afford to hope and wait for China’s geopolitical offensive to fail. “Whether Xi is able to realize his ambition,” Economy concludes, “will depend on the interplay of many factors, such as the continued vitality of the Chinese economy and military and the support of other senior leaders and the Chinese people, on the one hand, and the ability of the world to continue to resist Chinese coercion and the capacity of the world’s democracies and others to articulate and pursue their own compelling vision of the world’s future, on the other.”

As Economy notes, the United States and its allies have a “compelling vision of the world’s future,” but that is not sufficient. It must be backed by effective military power, competent diplomacy, and a demonstration of the will to wage and ultimately prevail in the geopolitical struggle.

China Looks to Increase Its Nuclear Arsenal - The American Spectator,"On May 27, 2021, the Global Times, an English-language mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), featured an article by Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of the paper, calling for an increase in China’s nuclear arsenal. “We must be prepared for an intense showdown between China and the US,” Hu wrote. “In that scenario, a large number of Dongfeng-41, and JL-2 and JL-3 (both intercontinental-range submarine-launched ballistic missile) will form the pillar of our strategic will. The number of China’s nuclear warheads must reach the quantity that makes US elites shiver should they entertain the idea of engaging in a military confrontation with China.”

The next day, Zhang Hui, a reporter for the Global Times, wrote that CCP military experts had recommended an increase in the number of China’s nuclear weapons, especially its sea-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, and including the DF-41 ICBM, China’s most advanced nuclear missile.

“China needs to increase the quantity and quality of nuclear weapons, especially submarine-launched ballistic missiles, to effectively safeguard its national security, sovereignty and development interests, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Friday,” according to Zhang.

The inclusion of “sovereignty” in Song’s statement undoubtedly refers to Taiwan, which the CCP claims is part of China. Zhang writes that the call for more nuclear weapons is in part a response to the fact that “the US has applied greater military pressure on China, sending warships and warplanes at an increasing frequency to the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits.”

Zhang further noted that Song said that “China could use its most advanced submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) to effectively counter the US threat.”

Zhang’s article also issued warnings to India, South Korea, and Australia that they should reject U.S. efforts to enlist their nations in plans to contain China. Those countries should recognize, Zhang wrote, that the “flames of war would eventually burn themselves.”

Bill Gertz of the Washington Times reported in mid-January that the outgoing Trump State Department warned, “China has rapidly expanded its nuclear and conventional missile forces over the past decade, nearly tripling its ballistic missile production capability and deploying a wide array of nuclear and conventional missile systems.”

Sanguine U.S. observers, however, repeatedly point to our huge advantage in nuclear weapons and delivery systems vis-à-vis China. “It should be pointed out that even if China doubles or triples the number of ICBM silos,” said Hans Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists, “it would only constitute a fraction of the number of ICBM silos operated by the United States and Russia.”

But that misses the point. China does not need parity with the U.S. in nuclear weapons to effectively deter the U.S. from coming to the aid of Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion or attack. In April, national security expert Matthew Kroenig of the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center told the Heritage Foundation that “China arguably has a nuclear threat advantage over the U.S.” in the Indo-Pacific region, which includes Taiwan. In May, the Economist warned that “China’s growing military confidence puts Taiwan at risk.”

In May, the New York Times reported that the United States was much closer to using nuclear weapons to defend Taiwan during the 1958 Taiwan Straits crisis than previously revealed. The U.S. military drew up plans for nuclear strikes against mainland Chinese targets in response to China’s shelling of islands controlled by Taiwan. Then, U.S. deterrence worked. Mao’s forces stopped shelling the islands.

In July 2005, a Chinese general publicly threatened to destroy several U.S. cities with nuclear weapons if America went to war with China over Taiwan. China’s nuclear arsenal and capabilities have only increased since then. And the editor-in-chief of the Global Times wants China’s nuclear arsenal to “make U.S. elites shiver” should they even think about defending Taiwan.

Instead of seeking new arms control treaties with Russia, the United States should be modernizing and upgrading its nuclear arsenal and its missile defense systems. And it must once again, to use Herman Kahn’s phrase, “think about the unthinkable” — fighting and winning a nuclear war. It may even be time for a new Strategic Defense Initiative.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/at-large/,2021-06-07
China Is Dramatically Upsizing Its Nuclear Arsenal - The American Spectator,"A few months after the Pentagon warned that China intended to expand its nuclear weapons program by “at least doubling” its stockpile, there is now photographic evidence of this buildup taking place.

While browsing satellite imagery, an American researcher has discovered a massive construction project taking place in a desert in China’s northwestern Gansu province. It appears to consist of a series of missile silos identical to those at a known nuclear weapons site in Jilantai in the province of Inner Mongolia.

Concerningly, there are around 120 silos under construction at the moment, compared to only 16 at Jilantai.

The site is absolutely gigantic — over 700 square miles, or roughly the size of 30 Manhattans. The silos are separated from one another by around two miles of empty desert each, a standard precaution against preemptive nuclear strikes. There is also reportedly a lot of auxiliary infrastructure: bunkers, trenches, roads, and a small military base.

Whether 120 silos translates into 120 additional missiles is unknown and probably unlikely. Writing in Foreign Policy, nuclear nonproliferation expert Jeffrey Lewis posits that China may be imitating a decoy silo strategy pioneered by the United States during the Cold War. The strategy, dubbed the “shell game,” consisted of the U.S. constantly moving small quantities of missiles between a lot of mostly empty silos, thereby presenting a lot of dud targets that the Soviets would have to attack in a preemptive strike. Additional missiles are expensive — and often politically troublesome — to manufacture, whereas silos are cheap.

Lewis speculates that the site could very well have an intended missile to silo ratio of 1:10, noting that the U.S. planned a 1:23 ratio in its own strategy. The former ratio would mean only that only 12 missiles would be stored at the site. The latter would allow for only five missiles.

Regardless of the precise number of new weapons, the new site is clearly intended to communicate nuclear readiness to China’s adversaries, especially the United States. Open-air silos are not the only way to store nuclear weapons; indeed, they are generally considered vulnerable to surveillance, and therefore attack, by hostile forces. China’s decision to expand its nuclear capabilities in such a conspicuous manner may well be an intentional attempt to play up its strength to foreign observers.

The country’s leadership likely sees bolstering its nuclear credibility as a priority. With around 300 warheads, China has long found itself in the second tier of nuclear-capable states alongside France and the UK, well behind Russia and the U.S., which have more than 6,000 warheads each. With American missile interception capability constantly improving, China is likely betting on maintaining its retaliatory power by building an arsenal large enough to overwhelm defenses.

Lewis argues that the only way out of this escalation is for the U.S. to intentionally discard some or all of its defensive infrastructure, thereby allowing the equilibrium of Mutually Assured Destruction to be established with fewer missiles. Unfortunately, such a concession would embolden the Chinese leadership and, needless to say, would be political suicide for whichever party proposed it. It’s therefore a safe bet that the buildup will continue.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/biden-watch/,2021-07-02
China Offers ‘No Mercy’ During the Vatican’s Year of Mercy - The American Spectator,"The release of 400 pages of internal Chinese government documents obtained by the New York Times revealing the mass detention, torture, and reeducation of as many as one million predominantly Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region should give pause to Pope Francis and some of his top Vatican officials, who have spent the past few years praising the communist state. Claiming that “My dream is China,” Pope Francis lauded the positive relationships he has enjoyed with the leaders of communist China.

For those incarcerated in the detention camps, it is a very bad dream. But Archbishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, the chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, told an interviewer just last year that “Right now, those who are best implementing the social doctrine of the Church are the Chinese.” Citing China’s “concern for the environment and human dignity,” Sorondo claimed that when he visited the country earlier in the year, “What I found was an extraordinary China. What people don’t realize is that the central value in China is work, work, work. There’s no other way, fundamentally it is like St. Paul said: he who doesn’t work, doesn’t eat.… You do not have shantytowns, you do not have drugs, young people do not take drugs.” Instead, there is a “positive national conscience.”

Suggesting that “China is developing well,” Sorondo dismissed any concerns about China — claiming that “you cannot think that the China of today is the China of the time of John Paul II, or Cold War Russia.” Sorondo concluded that China now has “many points of agreement” with the Vatican.

At least one Vatican official, concerned about what he called Sorondo’s “adulation” of Chinese culture, published an editorial with the headline “Sánchez Sorondo in Wonderland.” Claiming that Sorondo’s praise of the totalitarian dictatorship in China “makes a laughingstock of the Church,” Fr. Bernardo Cervellera, head of the Asia News Agency, called the archbishop naïve.

But, Sorondo is not alone in his naïveté. Pope Francis himself has gone out of his way to accommodate China’s demands to regularize the communist state-sponsored Catholic Church (the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association) that is beholden to the state and not to Rome. For decades, there was a schism in China between the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and the underground Church that was in full communion with Rome. Pope Francis developed a way to unify the two ecclesiastic communities, although the details of the “unification” remain unclear.

Refusing to acknowledge concerns about the continued marginalization and imprisonment of underground Catholics — including priests and bishops — Pope Francis claimed that the Sino-Vatican agreement he signed in September 2018 with representatives of the communist government “united” Catholics. In the agreement, Pope Francis regularized the status of seven of China’s “Patriotic Association” bishops who had been ordained by the communist government, marking the first time since the 1950s that all Catholic bishops in China were in “full communion” with the pope.

Unfortunately, the agreement has not ended the arrest and imprisonment of underground Catholic priests and bishops, and the continued persecution of Catholics. But Pope Francis continues to claim that China is united now, telling a journalist, “The other day two Chinese bishops came to me, one who came from the underground church and the other from the patriotic church, already recognized as brothers…. they know that they must be good patriots and that they must take care of the Catholic flock.” During the previous month, Chinese government officials detained Fr. Peter Zhang Guangjun, an underground priest, after Palm Sunday Mass. Fr. Guangjun was the third underground priest to be detained by the communist government during April 2019. On June 8, 2019, Monsignor Stefano Li Side, the underground bishop of Tianjin, died in captivity. The bishop had refused to be a part of the communist-sanctioned Church and had been exiled to a mountain village under house arrest along with a coadjutor underground bishop, Monsignor Melchiorre Shi Hongzhen, 92, who remains under house arrest.

While it is clear that his intentions are for unification, Pope Francis has had little to say about the persecution of priests and bishops in China and the brutal history of the formation of the government-created Patriotic Catholic Association to control the Catholic Church under communist dictator Mao Zedong back in the 1950s. Following the formation of the Patriotic Association Church, Bishop Li was arrested in 1958 and sentenced to forced labor camps. Although he was released in 1962, he was again arrested and imprisoned again in 1963 until 1980 — again assigned to forced labor camps.

As Assumption College philosophy professor Daniel Mahoney points out in his recent book, The Idol of Our Age, Pope Francis has always been “rather indulgent” towards despotic regimes that appear to speak in the name of the poor. In an interview with Catholic World Report, Mahoney suggests that Pope Francis, in contrast to his two papal predecessors,

learned nothing or next to nothing from humanity’s experience with ideological tyranny in the twentieth century.… He seems to have admired Fidel Castro, was slow to face the truth about the Maduro regime in Venezuela, and never emphasizes or repeats the Church’s condemnation of socialism and totalitarian collectivism. He seems to have confidence that the atheistic Communist Party of China can run the Catholic Church in that still authoritarian country.

The recent revelations published in the New York Times show clearly that the Communist Party in China is as ruthless as it has ever been. But unlike Pope Francis, who has stayed silent on the revelations of the totalitarian brainwashing, bizarre lies, and industrial level indoctrination that has been occurring in the communist country, the editorial board of the Times courageously decries “the paranoia of totalitarian leaders who demand total fealty in thought and deed and recognize no method of control other than coercion and fear.”

Faithful Catholics in China have faced persecution for decades now. Last week, Chinese Bishop John Fang Xingyao told those gathered at a Communist Party–sponsored meeting in Beijing, “Love for the homeland must be greater than the love for the Church and the law of the country is above canon law.” Bishop Fang is head of the Diocese of Linyi, on the east coast of China — and president of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association.

The Catholic News Agency reports that since 2013 crosses have been removed from an estimated 1,500 churches, both Catholic and Protestant, as part of an effort to Sinicize Christianity. When the Chinese authorities demolished a Catholic church last month, it was reported that Chinese officials claimed that “the Vatican was on our side” and would support them tearing down the churches. If it is true that Pope Francis has taken the side of the communist state–sponsored Church during his much-heralded “Year of Mercy,” the Catholic Church is in bigger trouble than any of us realized.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/campaign-crawlers-politics/,2019-12-08
China Once Again Attempts to Fool America - The American Spectator,"This year, 2023, is the Chinese Year of the Rabbit, and China is sending a cute one to us. The former Chinese ambassador to the United States, Qin Gang, has been promoted to the position of China’s foreign minister, and, on the occasion of his departure as ambassador, he published an article in a U.S. newspaper in which, contrary to the world’s notorious image of Chinese diplomats as wolf warriors, he smiled all over, put down his stance, and talked about the importance of Sino-U.S. friendship! The “hypocritic” and “destructive” Americans “with poor human rights records,” according to the Chinese Communist Party, suddenly became “broad-minded, friendly and hard-working,” a people full of “sincerity and hospitality.” I was shocked — is this guy a CCP official or a candidate for the U.S. Congress?

The panda huggers in Washington and the West must be so happy to see such a statement: They can forget again all the bad things the Chinese Communist Party has done! China and the U.S. can get back together again! We are relieved to have such a moderate person as China’s foreign minister!

Is this really the case?

The Qin Gangs certainly think so. They have been fooling Americans for years. They also think that this time will not be an exception. Americans, with their Christian spirit of forgiveness, do not hold grudges and can still be easily manipulated by the CCP.

If American people and politicians are so fooled over and over again without realizing it, America is really hopeless.

Ironically, Qin’s sweet talk is not believed even by the Chinese. I saw the following comments on Qin’s article in a WeChat group of mainly Peking University alumni:

“The U.S. ambassador should also be able to publish articles in the People’s Daily” [Note: Because the U.S. is a free-speech country, the Chinese ambassador can publish in any media in the U.S. But China is a dictatorship that controls the media, so the U.S. ambassador cannot publish in any media in China, a situation that is totally unequal.] “Qin just spoke well, but the problem is that no one believes it now, and others understand that this is a tactical retreat.” “Saying one thing and doing something else.” “Even if the boss [Xi Jinping] says what Qin Gang said, it would be useless.” “You can’t say one thing and do another.” [Someone liked this one.] “The biggest change in the United States this decade is that it no longer believes in the promises of Chinese leaders.” “No one believes him.”

There is a Chinese proverb that says, “The same trick cannot work three times.” An English proverb says, “Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.” How many times has the United States fallen for the Chinese Communist Party? Too many to count. Here I will list just a few of the major dupes of past U.S. presidents:

• In 1972, Richard Nixon, accompanied by Henry Kissinger, visited Communist China, which had been closed since the 1949 Communist Revolution. It was in the midst of the Cultural Revolution: The economy was collapsing, the CCP was fighting with the Soviets, and China was in isolation. Nixon’s visit gave a much-needed shot in the arm to the CCP. Nixon was a hardcore anti-communist; thus, he was not a Chinese Communist admirer. But I think he greatly underestimated the ability of the CCP to survive. Faced with internal and external crises, Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and others all put themselves down and warmly received the “American imperialists” in order to save the Cultural Revolution and seek a turnaround. This marked the first time a U.S. president was fooled.

• In 1979, just over two years after the death of the great dictator Mao, the Chinese Communist Party had just ended a decade of devastation from the Cultural Revolution, and the country was in ruins, with the economy in desperate need of recovery. Jimmy Carter announced the establishment of diplomatic relations with China, another shot in the arm. This was the second time a U.S. president fell for it.

• In 1989, an unprecedented mass pro-democracy movement broke out in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, which was brutally suppressed by heavily armed troops and tanks on June 4, resulting in the Tiananmen massacre that shocked the world. At this time, countries all over the world condemned the Communist atrocities and came to the aid of Chinese democrats. The situation at that time provided an opportunity for China to move toward democracy. If democratic countries around the world had joined together and pressured the CCP, it could have possibly led to China’s democratic transformation, but the United States, under the leadership of George H. W. Bush, decided to adopt a policy of nonintervention and did not actively press the CCP to end its dictatorship. After the Tiananmen massacre, China’s economy declined greatly, and Deng Xiaoping went to Shenzhen, a relatively open and developed city in southern China, and called for the opening of China’s economy while pleading with the world to continue to do business with the country. He masterminded the strategy of hiding one’s strengths and biding one’s time, not competing with the United States for hegemony, not becoming a world leader, and concentrating on economic development. This strategy worked well, and this marked the third time an American president fell for it.

• In 1999, when China applied to join the World Trade Organization, many countries expressed concern, including U.S. businesses and politicians, because, after all, China was still under the rule of the CCP and a communist economic system — how could it join a World Trade Organization based on democracy, the rule of law, private-property rights, and the protection of free trade? At this time, Bill Clinton strongly supported China’s bid, and, to his credit, China’s application succeeded. This was the fourth time that a U.S. president was fooled.

• From 2000 to 2015, the United States went through two presidents: George W. Bush and Barack Obama. They began to realize that the rapidly developed Chinese Communist Party had begun to flex its muscles on the United States, including through military provocation, harassment of neighboring countries, reclamation of islands for military purposes, and so on. Both presidents often complained to the CCP, telling it to abide by international law and order, be a responsible member of the global community, and so forth. The CCP always accepted these complaints with humbleness and told the U.S. that it would definitely change. Back then, the U.S. was still considerably more powerful than China. For example, in 2000, China’s gross domestic product was $1.2 trillion, while the U.S. gross domestic product was $10 trillion, nearly 10 times that of China. Therefore, the strategy of the party at that time was to refrain from confronting the U.S. head on, to promise changes while, in fact, making none at all. In Chinese, it is called playing taichi, making circular movements without achieving anything. So, it can be said that Bush fell for the fifth time, while Obama fell for the sixth time.

Things changed in 2016 when Donald Trump was elected president. With the assistance of his think tank, Trump quickly figured out the CCP’s taichi strategy of humbly accepting U.S. criticism while resolutely refusing to change. He took a head-on approach, forcing the CCP to make structural changes by directly increasing tariffs. At the same time, he asked the CCP to stop infringing on intellectual property rights, to open up the market, and to allow the free flow of information. The Trump administration was threatening to delink from China if the CCP failed to make structural changes. What Trump did made his threat credible.

Trump’s strategy has worked. The Chinese Communist Party found out that taichi was not working and started buying more American goods.

The survival of the dictatorship of the CCP depends on profitable international trade, with the CCP taking the lion’s share and the people taking a small share. If the world, especially the developed democratic countries, decouples from the Chinese economy, China will not be able to profit from international trade, thus leading to increased internal strife and destabilization of the CCP’s rule. So, the CCP’s greatest fear is being delinked from the world, especially from the developed countries. This was the first time that an American president did not fall for the Chinese Communist Party’s tricks. (READ MORE from Shaomin Li: Another Wuhan-Style Virus Outbreak Is Brewing)

Now comes Joe Biden as the president. Biden’s current China policy is basically a continuation of Trump’s policy. The current administration has even started to contain the CCP in chip and high-tech industries. However, Biden’s policy is still unclear, and the people he uses are weak. As a result, the CCP often gains the upper hand in matches. At the same time, the Biden administration has adopted a policy of not actively asking the CCP to make structural reforms, an approach that allows the CCP to become even stronger.

The gross domestic product of the United States is now $25 trillion, while China’s has reached $17.4 trillion; and, in terms of purchasing power, China’s is $30 trillion, which already surpasses that of the United States. Biden’s policy of not confronting the CCP head on is very shortsighted. Because the growth rate of China’s economy is higher than that of the United States, China’s economy will greatly exceed the U.S. economy in the near future. By then, the party will be a greater threat to the United States.

The good news is that a bipartisan, bicameral consensus has emerged in the U.S. Congress that the greatest threat to the United States is the Chinese Communist Party and the huge Chinese economic and military complex under its control. So, the United States has begun to make the right turn in dealing with China.

Just like a huge cargo ship, it will take time for the U.S. to go from a policy of engagement to one of containment. But it is happening. There are signs that delinking is occurring: Apple has moved some of its product production to India and Vietnam, and this is what the CCP fears most. So, the CCP ordered its new foreign minister, Qin, to rush to extend an olive branch and make a goodwill gesture to the U.S. in order to fool the country once again.

Will the United States be fooled this time?

Falling for the same trick twice already reveals one as a fool, and America has been fooled so many times that I cannot find a proper term to describe it anymore.

Beware, America, beware. When China’s wolf warriors turn into cute rabbits, be ready for a bloody fight.

China Plays Reagan to Our Gorbachev - The American Spectator,"Borrowing Chinese money leaves American politicians unsatisfied. Every time they’ve spent all the Chinese have lent us, thirty minutes later the Democrats wants to borrow more. For Republicans, Chinese lending is a double-edged sword: on one hand, it’s a huge weapon in Chinese hands that can be used to force changes to U.S. foreign and domestic policy. On the other, given Chinese leaders’ increasingly hostile statements about American fiscal irresponsibility, it’s a political tool Republicans can use.

On April 16, the House passed the Paul Ryan budget plan. The Senate Democrats (with the help of their usual RINO accomplices) voted it down. Our national debt limit of $14.3 trillion has been reached and the money will run out on about August 2 unless Congress raises the limit.

We are fast approaching the 800th day since the Senate Dems passed a budget. Negotiations, if the byplay between congressional Republicans and the White House can be called that, have made precisely no progress because Republican demands to make trillions in cuts to the budget as part of a debt limit hike are being stonewalled by the White House and Senate Dems who have proposed budgetary legerdemain rather than real cuts.

In what may be a historic level of irony, it’s apparent that President Obama and his congressional mafia family are less fiscally responsible than the Communist Chinese.

In March 2009, when Obama was counting on Chinese lending to finance his $800 billion stimulus package, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao warned against excessive US federal spending. He said, “Of course we are concerned about the safety of our assets. To be honest, I’m a little bit worried.” Jiabao added, “I would like to call on the United States to honor its words, stay a credible nation and ensure the safety of Chinese assets.”

Substitute “American” for “Chinese” in the last sentence and Wen could have been mistaken for Art Laffer. But Laffer never threatened to stop lending to America if we made arms sales to Taiwan, as China did as recently as 2009.

Last week an adviser to the People’s Bank of China warned against a default on U.S. debt, and said that Republicans were “playing with fire” by contemplating even a brief default. And only a few days ago, a top Chinese debt-rating expert warned that U.S. default had already commenced. Meanwhile, Obama wants to borrow more, presumably from China, to help Greece prolong its financial disaster.

China isn’t just our lender. It’s not a free-market trading partner hoping that a rising economic tide will raise both economies out of the recession. China is an adversary, a 21st century mercantilist nation whose policy is to gain economic strength by manipulating markets. And its role as our reliable lender is aimed at manipulating U.S. economic strength as a means of diminishing our ability to interfere in Beijing’s ambitions.

The European mercantilist nations of the 15th-18th centuries sought to increase government holdings of gold and silver as a means of growing economic power. Their main tool was market manipulation — by tariffs and trade cartels, which were restrictive enough to cause a few wars. But military power was, to them, a secondary means of protecting or obtaining economic power by conquest and colonization.

China has adapted European mercantilism to its own ambitions for hegemony around the Pacific Rim. Under China’s strategic policy, economic power and military power are inseparable. For decades, the Chinese trade surplus has funded their hell-for-leather military buildup including their cyberwar campaigns against American and European defense and intelligence networks. When the dollar was strong, they did everything possible to maintain a trade export to bring U.S. dollars into their reserves. The weakening dollar caused them to reduce their trade surplus in May.

By their modern mercantilism, China has achieved enormous economic power. Were they to significantly reduce or stop buying U.S. debt, the interest rates our government pays would rise in proportion to their cutbacks. Their vehement objections to the Federal Reserve’s “quantitative easing” policy — buying up federal debt to pump money into the credit market, thereby flooding the market with less valuable dollars — brought China to the brink of that action.

China’s opposition to reckless U.S. spending is based only on preserving the value of our $1 trillion debt to them. They don’t want to be repaid with less valuable dollars than they lent us. And we’re not a national version of Goldman Sachs — “too big to fail” — in China’s eyes. We are an adversary whose policy can be leveraged with that debt.

China’s economy — as strong as it is — isn’t strong enough to make its leaders think they should cause a U.S. default. But it can do to us what we did to the Soviet Union in the 1980s: make it too costly for us to pursue our national interests.

Unless we reduce federal spending by trillions of dollars over the next few years, China’s financial leverage over us will reach a critical stage at the same time that our need to oppose China on several fronts becomes acute.

China is Iran’s closest ally and trading partner. It has built a major presence in oil-rich African nations and in Venezuela. North Korea is effectively a Chinese satellite state. China’s ambitions — turned to India, Japan, Taiwan and Malaysia — will bring it into confrontation with us economically and, possibly, militarily. What would happen if some future US president went head-to-head with the ayatollahs or Chavez or Kim Jong-il?

If China were to stop lending to us, or even cut back on lending at a critical moment, the interest costs we pay will rise, perhaps massively. We will be faced with an economic-political crisis like Gorbachev faced in the late 1980s. Our national policy can be turned around by that sort of economic warfare. It’s a point that Republicans — especially the presidential wannabes — should be making daily in arguing for spending reductions now.

None of the leading (God help us) Republican presidential aspirants — Romney, Palin, and Giuliani according to the latest RealClearPolitics poll roundup — have made any serious effort to chart a path out of our financial crisis. Which may be because neither Palin nor Rudy are yet running and the former CEO of Massachusetts, as the Wall Street Journal said, would be better as a running mate for Obama than his opponent. Only Tim Pawlenty has taken a shot at it, and done reasonably well.

(Read my lips: no Newt axes in this column. The man is chopping at himself so effectively I need not hack away at him further.)

Tonight, in the CNN debate, many of the presidential candidates in waiting will be asked to address how they’d fix the economy. Newt will have a long and indecipherable answer. Pawlenty will talk about getting us to 5% growth. But none of them will mention the problem China poses. Every one of them should, because China will be one of the biggest obstacles to economic recovery the next president has to deal with.

The only way to reverse the growth of China’s power over us is to take a machete to the national budget. Paul Ryan knows this. So do Michele Bachmann and Tim Pawlenty. Over to you, folks.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/climate-change/,2011-06-13
China Prepares - The American Spectator,"It may be a bit unfair to Chinese technical competence, but there is good reason to track the spurt of China’s current military sophistication to the Clinton Administration’s sale of Cray supercomputers to Beijing in the 1990s. (Paralleled, of course, by the PRC’s accelerated program of technical secret stealing during the same period and later.) In any event, Chinese strategic weapon development now seeks to arrive at a point where it can challenge American superiority. Whether China can attain its objective in any reasonable future is the question.

Signs of growing Chinese military capability came about again only a few months ago when the latest generation of the Dong Feng 21 D missile was recognized as operational. U.S. Navy estimates place this medium-range land-to-sea missile as being accurate up to 900 miles. This has been referred to as a carrier-killer weapon that is aimed to counter U.S. Navy domination of East Asian waters. One development such as this doesn’t have the ability, in itself, to alter the balance of power in this portion of the Pacific, but it can present a new and important factor in threatening the defense of Taiwan.

Beijing’s enhanced missile capacity is only part of a series of weapon systems that China is in the process of developing — most of which reflects a belief in its need to counter U.S. influence in the Pacific regions. Beijing’s strategy is centered on the development of a “blue water” operational strength. Just how “blue” really depends on how the Peoples’ Liberation Army – Navy (PLAN) sees its role. Its prime considerations are maintaining and increasing their offensive ability to attack Taiwan and on the defensive side to protect China’s oil pipeline from the Middle East.

Last Spring the PLAN sent a ten-ship battle group of destroyers, frigates, and submarines into the Pacific through the channels between Okinawa and the Miyako Islands. This was not the first time such a maneuver occurred, but it certainly was the largest. Along with an accelerated program of development of Jin class submarines, there continues to be a highly prioritized target of aircraft carrier construction. These ambitions clearly reflect Beijing’s desire to build a naval force capable of projecting China’s military power beyond its oft-stated defensive coastal role.

Japan, through its defense minister, Toshimi Kitayawa, already has declared China’s fleet operations to be “unprecedented” and indicated that Tokyo would have to assess whether these actions had any belligerent intent toward Japan. That was as close to a formal demarche the Japanese were willing to present on the subject of PRC force projection into near Japanese waters. Of perhaps even greater importance to China, however, is the need to build a naval presence off its island of Hainan (a main PLAN submarine base) and the vital sea-lanes of the South China Sea that it seeks to have recognized as its private pond.

Perhaps the area of most critical concern for Washington, and indeed also Moscow, is China’s commitment to stretch its technological and strategic ambitions in space. The PRC’s second lunar probe sent back high resolution images of the moon that the Chinese intend to use to determine just how and where they are going to place their unmanned landing in 2013. Seven years later, in 2020, Beijing states it will have completed its own space station — with no one’s help, they remind the world.

The real importance of this space plan has as much to do with international prestige and domestic morale as it does any real technological breakthrough. After all, the U.S. and Russia already have built a space station. What is a strategic objective of long-term import, however, is the notice that China is giving to the rest of the world that it intends to press forward with its own expeditions into deep space.

Perhaps of even higher immediate priority is the Chinese program to focus on the creation of new generations of smaller satellites for military purposes. These new satellites are being planned to act both defensively and offensively. They supposedly will have the ability to protect existing Chinese spy satellites or interfere with the operations of adversarial nations’ own space-borne military facilities.

Commentators in the West and Russia already have noted their expectations of Chinese efforts to build a forward base on the moon to aid it in deep space exploration. The Chinese, themselves, have not been shy about such long term potential for their programs.

In the meantime, the ever-commercially savvy trade officials in Beijing are aggressively selling their competitively priced communications satellites in the developing world. From a strategic planning standpoint, space-related projects are definitely win-win for the Chinese. China’s planners are moving at high speed in all strategic military areas — short through long term — pushing their country out front on the world scene.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/commie-watch/,2010-11-12
China Puts the Full-Court Press on Americans in NBA Controversy - The American Spectator,"The Hong Kong saga reached a climax this past week with back-to-back American corporate capitulations to the Chinese government. The spotlight has been on the National Basketball Association’s disastrous handling of a pro–Hong Kong tweet made by Daryl Morey, the Houston Rockets’ general manager, but many other supposedly all-American firms have added to the humiliation.

Apple has restricted the Taiwanese flag emoji for devices in Hong Kong. It removed an app used by the protesters to track police, reinstated it after a backlash, and then removed it again upon being issued an ominous warning by the People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s primary mouthpiece. Videogame giant Blizzard Entertainment panicked after a player from Hong Kong spoke out in support of the protests during an official event: they banned the player and confiscated his prize money.

Washington Post columnist Sally Jenkins pointed out last week that this rout is far from the first, or most egregious, example of corporate appeasement of China. Nonetheless, its visibility to the American public may serve to shore up a weak point in the U.S.’s combative stance toward the Chinese regime: the attitudes of American consumers.

A Morning Consult poll of Americans conducted October 8 and 9 in the immediate aftermath of the Morey fallout paints a picture of indifference. Thirty-eight percent of all adults would prefer that corporations stick to doing business and refrain from engaging in political or cultural issues, an echo of the advice that NBA players are receiving in private to “tread lightly” and avoid discussing Hong Kong. A further 38 percent have no opinion on the matter.

Obviously, American corporations, including the NBA, do not usually “stick to what they do” — anyone who thinks otherwise need only look around during Pride Month. NBA players have been quick to trash President Trump and embrace social-justice movements such as Black Lives Matter when doing so earns them brownie points with woke millennials and costs them very little. With China, though, their multi-million-dollar salaries are on the line. Cue the sudden uninterest in politics: LeBron James, who once tweeted that “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” now subscribes to the philosophy of “we’re not politicians.”

In light of all the progressive browbeating, it is understandable that conservatives are more suspicious of corporate activism than liberals. Only 20 percent of Republican respondents to the Morning Consult poll approve of corporations using their influence to “impact political and cultural issues” in other countries, compared to 31 percent of Democrats. But continued indifference cannot be justified. There is no such thing as simply doing business with a customer like China, whose leaders are willing and able to squeeze geopolitical leverage out of every international business relationship.

What should conservatives do? Before anything else, they need to leverage their power as consumers. Companies such as the NBA that lecture Americans on inclusivity at home and then accede to the whims of exclusive regimes abroad should be roundly mocked and exposed for the hypocrites they are. Beyond that, Chinese goods ought to be boycotted with the understanding that buying from China is always more than just a financial transaction.

There is still a long way to go before most Americans are willing to accept that economic engagement with China is a geopolitical trap. The same Morning Consult poll found that 42 percent of all U.S. adults currently support American corporations doing business in China, with only 36 percent opposed — a major roadblock to the efforts of President Trump and his allies to combat China. With the NBA’s helpful and timely reminder of China’s influence, the tide may finally be turning.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/crisis/,2019-10-17
Religious Freedom’s Role in Fighting China’s Tyranny - The American Spectator,"When the revolution broke out in France, it was not guided by a sense of restoring liberties that had been ignored, as was the case in England in the 1600s and in America in the 1700s. France had exemplified royal absolutism. Under the genius of King Louis XIV, all power had been concentrated in the person of the monarch. Whatever independent power the other estates of the realm had had in ancient days became dead letter. No appeal could be made to law or tradition or any institution.

When revolt came in 1789, the flood swept all before it. There was no viable constitution to give shape to the chaos. There was no loyalty to any institution, including religion, because all had been gutted of their independence and had existed to serve the king. So as the terror built in France and royalty and nobility met their end at the hands of the revolutionaries, the clergy as well were marked for destruction. Put to the sword, put on barges that were then scuttled or sent to the guillotine by the cartload, they were extinguished from the public life of the new Republic.

But the grand ideas of the cult of reason that Robespierre set up to be the new religion of France had little appeal. As soon as Robespierre lost his grip on power and on his head, it disappeared as well. Indifferent government prevailed until Napoleon deftly put himself into the seat of power.

Napoleon saw the revolutionary campaign against religion as excessive. He was a deft enough politician to figure exactly what he could allow. He was willing to make many concessions to religion, on the one condition that all had to acknowledge supreme allegiance to the state. One could listen to one’s conscience only to the extent that it was in agreement with the government.

Napoleon worked with the organized Catholic community and the Jewish community to get them to publicly affirm this as official religious doctrine. The results looked like this extract from the Napoleon-approved catechism for the French church:

Question. Why are we subject to all these duties toward our emperor? Answer. First, because God, who has created empires and distributes them according to his will, has, by loading our emperor with gifts both in peace and in war, established him as our sovereign and made him the agent of His power and His image upon earth. To honor and serve our emperor is therefore to honor and serve God himself.

Tyrants dislike rival authorities. The less intelligent ones flail away directly at religion. The more intelligent try to co-opt religion, so that there is a show of acceptance but without substance. If push comes to shove, the State will always win.

Today’s China is an example of this shrewd approach. A few religions are officially tolerated, but they are watched continuously. Religions that don’t suit the Communist Party’s purposes are hounded with all the power of a high-tech police state the likes of which the world has never seen. Whether the centuries-old Buddhism of the Dalai Lama or the recently minted Falun Gong, if the State feels it is a threat, social ostracization, exile, reeducation camps, imprisonment, or death follow. Ask the millions of Muslims living just north of Tibet in a province that has been effectively turned into a gigantic prettified concentration camp.

The origin of the holiday of Chanuka was in Jewish resistance to the attempt of the Hellenist ruler to force Judaism into the mold of the state religion. A “fair” offer was made to the Jewish traditionalists — if you accept the gods of our empire as your gods as well, then we will accept your god into our pantheon. When that failed, the king saw that as treason. A Jewish guerilla army persisted in its faith until eventually it won a decisive victory and expelled the worshippers of the state from Jerusalem and the countryside.

It was a signal victory for civilization. The great constitutional tradition we inherit in this country is grounded in an authority larger than any tyrant or council of tyrants. It is the explicit recognition of the freedom to worship that confirms the idea that the government’s powers derive from the Source of all order, not from some ideologue’s great theory or the private agreement of well-placed functionaries.

There are many career bureaucrats hoping to take over the White House in a little more than a month. Most of them are embarrassed by Trump’s willingness to call out China on important issues. Biden himself has tried to escape the persistent criticism of having improper financial ties with but letting a friendly media bury the stories.

We will need to keep lighting our little lights and letting them shine. We can and will push back the darkness. We will not let the tyrants’ model take root here. Light your light!",https://spectator.org/category/politics/d-c-politics-the-hill/,2020-12-13
"China, Russia, and the Geopolitics of Space - The American Spectator","The Global Times, the English-language mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), reports that China and Russia will sign a new five-year space cooperation agreement. The report states that the two countries have joined forces “to achieve new heights in the sphere of space exploration,” including the creation of a lunar surface station. The report further notes that in March of this year, China’s national space agency signed a memorandum of understanding with its Russian counterpart. This was followed in November by the signing of the “Russian-Chinese Roadmap for Cooperation in Satellite Navigation.” That same month, Russia tested a direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) missile that successfully hit a Russian satellite and, according to R. Lincoln Hines of the Air War College, endangered the crew aboard the International Space Station. Hines notes that while the U.S. condemned the Russian ASAT test, China remained silent. China, like Russia, has ASAT weapons. The Sino-Russian geopolitical challenge to the U.S.-led world order extends to outer space.

Classical geopolitics — the works of Halford Mackinder, Alfred Thayer Mahan, Nicholas Spykman, Colin S. Gray, and others — focused on the dichotomy of land power and sea power, and later added the air power dimension in assessing the global balance of power. In 2002, Everett C. Dolman, of the School of Advanced Airpower Studies, published Astropolitik: Classical Geopolitics in the Space Age. Dolman described Astropolitik as “the extension of … theories of global geopolitics into the vast context of the human conquest of outer space.” Dolman wrote: “Even as states publicly denounce the use of violence and force in space operations, all spacefaring states … have military missions, goals, and contingency space-operations plans.”

Dolman’s use of “Astropolitik” brings to mind Bismarck’s Realpolitik as examined by August Ludwig von Rochau (who coined the term), and the German geographers in the 1920s and 1930s, led by Karl Haushofer, who wrote about Geopolitik. Space competition among the great powers must be viewed through the lens of hard-headed realism. Astropolitik, Dolman writes, “describes the geopolitical bases for power in outer space, and offers suggestions for dominance of space through military means.”

Even before Dolman’s book appeared, Colin Gray in 1996 wrote an article entitled “The Influence of Space Power upon History” (mimicking the title of Mahan’s most famous sea power book). Gray defined “spacepower” as “the ability to use space while denying reliable use to any foe.” Gray urged his fellow strategists to analyze spacepower as they had previously analyzed land, sea, and air power, and to integrate outer space into the analyses of the global balance of power.

In one sense, the geopolitics of outer space have been with us since the advent of missile technology during the Second World War. The German V-2 ballistic missile effectively launched the space age, and geopolitical competition ever since has included intercontinental ballistic missiles, space satellites, anti-satellite weapons, anti-ballistic missile systems, and other military space projects and technologies. President Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) helped bring the Cold War to a successful end. And under President Trump, the United States established the U.S. Space Force in December 2019, whose mission is “to protect U.S. and allied interests in space and to provide space capabilities to the joint force.” This mission includes educating and developing military space professionals, organizing space forces, and updating spacepower military doctrine.

R. Lincoln Hines notes that “China and Russia have shared interests that will deepen their cooperation in space,” and those shared interests include an attempt to counterbalance U.S. military power. “Using counterspace weapons,” Hines writes, “Russia and China can threaten American satellites, potentially deterring American military action or denying the United States space-enabled advantages (e.g., communications, intelligence, reconnaissance, and precision-guided munitions) in the event of a conflict.” As noted previously in TAS, two recent novels of future wars between the U.S. and a Sino-Russian alliance portray Chinese space attacks on American space assets at the outbreak of war that cripple our military forces’ ability to communicate with each other and with political leaders in Washington.

Hines, however, also sees fault lines in the Sino-Russian space relationship, including nationalism, mutual distrust, and competing interests elsewhere in the world. It would behoove the Biden administration to exploit these potential fissures in the China-Russia relationship the way that President Nixon and Henry Kissinger did in the early 1970s. To be sure, the potential fissures today are not as great as those exploited by Nixon and Kissinger, but that doesn’t mean we should not try. Instead, however, we seem bent on pushing China and Russia closer together, seemingly impervious to the idea that a principal security goal of our foreign policy is to maintain the geopolitical pluralism of Eurasia. Historians may one day look back on all of this and conclude that the United States lost the second Cold War because successive U.S. administrations pursued policies and diplomacy that fostered the very alliance that in the end defeated us.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/daily-folios-and-consecutive-sentences/,2021-12-30
Did China Give Russia a ‘Blank Check’ for Ukraine Invasion? - The American Spectator,"On July 6, 1914, German Foreign Minister Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg sent a telegram to Germany’s Ambassador to Austria-Hungary instructing him to inform Emperor Francis Joseph that while Kaiser Wilhelm II “cannot interfere in the dispute now going on between Austria-Hungary and that country [Serbia],” Austria-Hungary may “rest assured that His Majesty [Germany] will faithfully stand by Austria-Hungary, as is required by the obligations of his [Germany’s] alliance and … friendship.” This was the so-called “blank check” whereby Germany pledged to support Austria-Hungary if it went to war against Serbia. Emboldened by Germany’s “blank check,” Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to the Serbs (a document that Winston Churchill called “the most insolent … of its kind ever devised”), then declared war against Serbia on July 28, 1914, and shelled Belgrade — one month after Serbian terrorists assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife in Sarajevo. Thus began the war that George Kennan called the “seminal catastrophe” of the 20th century.

Fast forward to February 4, 2022. China’s President Xi Jinping and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin declared in Beijing that their “partnership” had “no limits.” Three weeks later, Russia invaded Ukraine. Did Putin interpret this partnership without limits as a “blank check” that emboldened him to invade Ukraine? Was Xi signaling to Putin that China would back Russia in its Ukraine venture? Washington Post China expert Josh Rogin has written that President Xi is Putin’s “co-conspirator” in the Ukraine war. Since the war began, China has diplomatically sided with Russia, and as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Reid Standish notes, China’s “state-run media have pushed Russia’s narrative of the invasion to audiences at home and abroad.” And Raffaello Pantucci of London’s Royal United Services Institute has noted the “durability of the China-Russia relationship” even in the face of Western sanctions and international condemnation.

One week before Russia invaded Ukraine, China and Russia agreed to expand their energy relationship, including a coal deal worth $20 billion and oil and gas deals worth more than $117 billion. BBC News reports that the two countries seek to construct a gas pipeline that will be worth more than $400 billion. China may be helping Russia financially and militarily, though China calls reports of the latter “fake news.” And the Economist warns that Western statesmen would be foolish to underestimate Xi’s bond with Putin, which is fueled by shared geopolitical interests.

Germany’s blank check to Austria-Hungary set Europe ablaze in a war that few statesmen wanted and even fewer believed would last more than four years, claim over 15 million lives, produce over 40 million casualties, lead to the fall of four empires, spawn the twin ideologies of fascism and communism, and lead to an even more deadly and destructive global war.

We don’t know how the Ukraine war will end. It is already a tragedy for the Ukrainian people, and risks becoming a broader European and perhaps global nightmare. China’s “blank check” to Russia — if that is what it was — will live in infamy if, as in the case of Germany in 1914, it sets in motion events that help trigger what Winston Churchill memorably described as “a world of monstrous shadows moving in convulsive combinations through vistas of fathomless catastrophe.”",https://spectator.org/category/politics/dismal-science/,2022-04-23
China and Russia: The Diplomatic Revolution of 2022 - The American Spectator,"With the formation of the Sino-Russian strategic alliance, the world has witnessed the near completion of a diplomatic revolution that may change the global balance of power. This development in some respects echoes the diplomatic revolution of 1756 (when Austria and Prussia switched alliances) that set the stage for the outbreak of the Seven Years War — the first global war in history. And it also echoes in some respects Prussia’s unification of Germany in 1871, which set the stage for the First World War. If we are not careful, the diplomatic revolution of 2022 could lead to another and much more dangerous global conflagration.

China during the 1970s and 1980s was a de facto ally of the United States and the West in the Cold War. China’s role as our ally against the Soviet Union resulted from increased tensions between the two Eurasian communist powers in the 1960s, which the skillful diplomacy of President Richard Nixon exploited in the early 1970s. This, too, was a diplomatic revolution that, as Nixon later said, organized a grand coalition against which the Soviet Union could not prevail. When the Cold War ended, there were two victors: the United States and China. From the 1990s until the latter years of the Trump administration, the United States attempted to continue engagement with China while neglecting the need to keep China and Russia apart. Instead, successive administrations from Bill Clinton to Barack Obama needlessly expanded NATO, prompting Russia’s historic paranoia to resurface and nudging Russia into the Chinese orbit. It didn’t happen overnight. But as the United States was distracted in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Global War on Terror for more than two decades, China and Russia grew closer.

When the George W. Bush administration and some voices in Europe suggested that Georgia and Ukraine could be NATO’s next two members, Russia’s reaction was entirely predictable. Indeed, the American historian and former diplomat George F. Kennan predicted it. In an article in the New York Times on February 5, 1997, Kennan wrote that “expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-Cold War era.” NATO expansion, he explained, would “inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion.” Kennan later told New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman that NATO expansion “is a tragic mistake.” It will start, the intellectual architect of containment said, a “new Cold War.” Kennan, you see, had the ability to see things from Russia’s perspective — an ability sorely lacking in most American statesmen for the previous three decades.

So instead of following Nixon’s example of using diplomacy to keep Russia and China separated, and instead of heeding Kennan’s warning against the unnecessary and provocative expansion of NATO, U.S. foreign policy acted as if a Sino-Russian alliance didn’t matter. It was a colossal failure of historical and geopolitical imagination. For centuries, Great Britain as the world’s leading sea power had pursued a foreign policy designed to prevent a single power or alliance of powers from achieving command of the Eurasian continent. Since America’s involvement in the First World War, our statesmen had followed a similar policy approach, and during and after World War II, the United States succeeded Britain as the “holder” of the Eurasian balance of power. The outcome of World War II with an unbalanced Europe provided the impetus for Kennan’s containment doctrine, and the formation of the Sino-Soviet bloc in early 1950 produced NSC-68 — the then-classified national security strategy that expressed the goal of maintaining the geopolitical pluralism of Eurasia.

It may be too late to prevent the completion of the diplomatic revolution of 2022. China supports Russia over Ukraine. Russia supports China over Taiwan. The two powers cooperate in exploiting the melting Arctic Ocean, energy security, and much, much more. The two greatest autocracies on the planet confront the United States, Europe, and Asia with a Eurasian bloc possessed of enormous human and natural resources, first-class militaries and growing navies, growing and modernizing nuclear arsenals, and common interests in challenging the U.S.-led world order. Few in Washington seem to understand, as the Biden administration proceeds from crisis to crisis, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, in strange paradox, using tough, resolute rhetoric, while manifesting weakness and irresoluteness.

China Sanctions 11 Americans - The American Spectator,"A week after the U.S. placed sanctions on 11 Chinese and Hong Kong officials accused of facilitating the crackdown on Hong Kong, Beijing has retaliated with sanctions of its own against an equivalent number of Americans that it accuses of being hostile to its interests.

Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian announced the measures on Monday, declaring that “China has decided to impose sanctions on individuals who have behaved egregiously on Hong Kong-related issues…. China urges the U.S. to have a clear understanding of the situation, correct mistakes, and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and interfering in China’s internal affairs.”

The sanctioned individuals include five Republican senators: Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton, and Pat Toomey; and one Republican representative, Chris Smith. All six politicians are known to be China hawks who have been particularly vocal on the issue of Hong Kong.

The remaining sanctions are directed toward the leaders of several government-funded agencies and nonprofits that work to promote democracy and human rights abroad: National Democratic Institute President Derek Mitchell, National Endowment for Democracy President Carl Gershman, Human Rights Watch Executive Director Kenneth Roth, International Republican Institute President Daniel Twining, and Freedom House President Michael Abramowitz.

Responses from the sanctioned individuals have ranged from defiant to tongue-in-cheek. Sen. Cotton (R-Ariz.) released a statement declaring that “Chinese Communism is the most dangerous threat to freedom in the world, and I will never back down from fighting it.” Sen. Rubio (R-Fla.) quipped on Twitter, “Last month #China banned me. Today they sanctioned me. I don’t want to be paranoid but I am starting to think they don’t like me.”

Beijing has been moving to extinguish opposition to its occupation of Hong Kong, continuing a series of arrests that took down media tycoon Jimmy Lai on Monday. Lai, who is one of Hong Kong’s richest men and the most prominent financial and media backer of the city’s pro-democracy political faction, stands accused of subversive activities under the recently introduced national security law.

The new sanctions are fairly light on details, and indeed several of the individuals on the list have already been targeted with previous sanctions and restrictions — Rubio and Cruz, for example, were banned from travelling to China last month. The fact that Beijing chose to exactly mirror the sanctions imposed on it by the U.S. suggests that the move is first and foremost meant as a way of saving face while avoiding further escalation. With the general election right around the corner, the CCP is no doubt betting that a Joe Biden victory would take the pressure off.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/education-wild/,2020-08-11
China Slam-Dunks on Daryl Morey and the NBA - The American Spectator,"During the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, the Communist Party of China (CCP) deployed the weapon of compelled self-abasement to devastating effect. In the practice, rendered in English as the “Struggle Session,” enemies of the party, real or imagined, were forced under threat of imprisonment, torture, and death to denounce and humiliate themselves in public arenas before their peers.

As Daryl Morey, general manager of the National Basketball Association’s Houston Rockets, learned on Sunday, the practice is alive today in a new and global form made possible by the internet. Over the weekend, Morey tweeted a simple image expressing support for the people of Hong Kong’s ongoing challenge to its Beijing-backed government. The image contained but seven words: “Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.”

But as is now unavoidable when a prominent figure voices opposition to the CCP, the party’s new internet Red Guards leapt into action. The tweet — the kind of commonplace expression of goodwill about which we in the West would hardly think twice — sparked a public relations firestorm that appears only to be spreading. As of this writing, retail giant Alibaba has pulled Rockets merchandise from its Taobao and Tmall platforms, Chinese broadcasters have canceled Rockets coverage, and the Chinese Basketball Association has nixed a scheduled exhibition game with the Rockets’ developmental team. This reaction is all the more notable since the Rockets are one of the most popular teams in China, having had Yao Ming, China’s first NBA All-Star, as their starting center for a decade.

Despite the NBA’s cultivated reputation for upholding the values of a free society, it quickly distanced itself from Morey and abetted the commencement of his public Struggle Session.

Amid the furor, Morey’s boss, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta, tweeted from the Rockets preseason tour of Japan, “Listen….@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization.” Rockets cornerstone James Harden responded to the reaction to Morey’s tweet by saying, “We apologize. We love China. We love playing there.” The NBA league office — the entity that should be most prepared to face political maelstrom — released a statement describing as “regrettable” that Morey’s tweet “deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China.” The NBA’s Chinese-language apology, according to translators, was even more craven, expressing that the league was “(e)xtremely disappointed in Morey’s inappropriate statement.”

With his cues delivered from Beijing and the NBA itself, Morey’s self-abasement thus began. He deleted the tweet and replaced it with a mea culpa that may as well have been handed to him by the Red Guards:

I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives. I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.

Tilman Fertitta, James Harden, and the NBA indeed owe an apology. But they do not owe it to the CCP or to its fragile internet cadres. They owe it to Daryl Morey, the people of Hong Kong, and Chinese dissidents everywhere.

The 21st century will be characterized by increasing tension between free, open, pluralistic societies and societies governed by authoritarianism and repression. Conventional wisdom holds that business entities can benefit people on both sides of that divide and that cultural exports like the NBA will promote the values of the West, as rock and roll did during the Cold War. As the NBA also wrote in its response, it wants to be a unifying force to bring people together. That sentiment is admirable.

But this episode suggests that such an expectation may be naive. The Struggle Session imposed on Daryl Morey reveals that rather than weakening the CCP’s grip on the culture of China, overtures like the NBA’s might weaken our own grip on the values of a free society. As the dominoes continue to fall after Morey’s tweet, corporate boardrooms across the United States are surely filled with unease. From cultural mainstays like the NBA and Hollywood production studios to large retailers like Walmart, American enterprises must reckon with the moral prudence of operating only with the blessing of an unjust regime. The NBA was caught embarrassingly unprepared. Confronted unexpectedly with the choice between solidarity with freedom, openness, and pluralism or with authoritarianism and repression, its reflexive response was to abandon Morey to the internet Red Guards.

Rather than accepting the conditions set by the CCP, the institutions that embody the dynamism, creativity, and wealth-generation of the West ought to establish the terms of cultural engagement, holding as sacrosanct not only expression qua expression but also the values of liberty that Morey’s tweet succinctly conveyed. Fertitta, Harden, and the NBA, in their failure to defend Morey, revealed the pettiness of their own concerns. But with Hong Kong’s limited autonomy being squeezed, Xinjiang’s Uighurs languishing in concentration camps, and the internet Red Guards on the offensive, corporate ignorance and naïveté can no longer be afforded. Businesses need not be moral pioneers marching through Hong Kong’s Causeway Bay to provoke the CCP, but when put to the test they ought to make clear which side of the divide they represent. As the CCP’s economic power grows, more entities will face these difficult decisions. Will they uphold the values of free society, or will they give way and let the Struggle Sessions continue?

China’s Spectral State - The American Spectator,"Yunnan, 1914

It is summertime in the lush hill country of southwestern China, and the air is suffused with a damp mist and with the discordant songs of cicadas and laughing-thrushes. Here, in this teeming, preternatural paradise, we encounter the Mission archéologique Segalen-Voisins-Lartigue as it wends its way through the chasmic intermontane valleys and verdant terraced hillsides of Yunnan province, cataloguing at every opportunity the mausolea, tumuli, and other ancient monuments that have for centuries lain half-buried in the undergrowth. With the aid of their guides and porters, the three Frenchmen after whom the expedition is named — Victor Segalen, Gilbert de Voisins, and Jean Lartigue, all students of the celebrated Sinologist Émmanuel-Édouard Chavannes — painstakingly ascend from tropical to subtropical to alpine zones, traversing the broad strips of moss-cloaked forest that separate what the aboriginal Hani people of the Ailao Mountains distinguish as the “human space” and the “ghost space.” Victor Segalen has no qualms about delving into this spectral realm, pregnant with history. Indeed the very point of his journey, as he will later recount in his epic travelogue Equipée: Pékin aux marches tibétaines, published posthumously in 1929, is to survey the literal and symbolic terrain that “divides into two polar opposites: what has been done. And what is to come.”

If we are to make any progress in understanding the age-old Chinese confrontation between tradition and modernity, between the dead and the living, between the shades that haunt the Chinese diyu, or “earth-prison,” and the exorcists, well-meaning or otherwise, who seek to banish the ghosts of the past, we would do well to fall in behind Segalen as he plunges ever deeper into the unknown.

It was at one crucial juncture of that expedition, in a locale nestled against the steep slope of an obscure Yunnan valley, that Segalen chanced to find himself walking along the dividing line between what has been done and what is to come. The archaeologist had been strolling through the Village of the White Salt Mines, a “great market town,” and then down a “mossy, dead road that no one seems to take anymore,” when he met a party of graybeards coiffed in Ming-era chignons instead of Manchu-style braided queues and wearing skirted, flowing robes instead of plain-sewn Ch’ing-era changshans. “These people,” Segalen marveled, “are from another era … living as though it were three hundred years back in time,” with their “drawn-out Ming gestures, the style and ancestral bearing that goes back six or seven generations to the old Ming dynasty. Gestures that were long ago captured, glazed and fired onto Ming porcelain.” Surrounded by these living fossils, the Frenchman was told that he had stumbled upon Hei-yen-ch’ang, the “Ancient Town of Black Salt Pits,” an “elusive sub-prefecture the history books declared was destroyed in ages past,” a sort of long-lost yīn to the modern village’s mundane yáng. Segalen had run across this mysterious place previously, albeit in a dusty tome that alluded to a town said to “have fallen” and to “no longer exist,” its “prefectural rank downgraded, the city destroyed by order.” The elderly gentlemen arrayed before Segalen existed all the same; they were, by all appearances, descendants of the quixotic generalissimo Wu San-kuei, self-proclaimed emperor of the “Great Zhou Dynasty,” the “King Who Pacifies the West,” and the strongman best known for a foolhardy rebellion against his Ch’ing masters. Wu had perished back in 1678, his cadaver torn into strips and scattered to the four winds by a vengeful K’ang-hsi Emperor. Wu’s heirs, it would seem, had secreted themselves rather more securely in the rugged hills of Yunnan.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/free-market/,2021-07-25
Is Our Fate in China’s Hands? - The American Spectator,"After the coronavirus pandemic exposed the precarious position of the American economy, Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) have thrown their support behind measures to bolster our feeble manufacturing infrastructure and limit our dependence upon global supply chain partners who are indifferent, or even antagonistic, to American interests. Our reliance on other countries to manufacture our medications, masks, and medical equipment has left our ultimate fate up to the whims of foreign governments and multinational corporations.

In an April Washington Post op-ed, Hawley emphatically endorsed measures to create a more resilient American economy: “It is past time to secure our supply chains by adopting strong local-content requirements for all industries essential to our crisis response, to be phased in when the current emergency ends,” he wrote. “These measures should be paired with generous financing for all businesses looking to move back home.” In addition to ensuring that America is able to efficiently and effectively respond to future crises, these measures could help provide employment in an economy currently hemorrhaging jobs. It is extremely important that American leaders understand, as Hawley does, that global influence stems from a solid manufacturing base.

In May, Rubio proposed legislation that would increase the taxes on American companies’ Chinese-earned profits. The bill would also prevent American companies from selling sensitive technology to China, helping to preserve our current technological advantage and ensure that the fruits of our research and development don’t wind up in the wrong hands. While it is unlikely that this measure will be passed, the bill represents a step in the right direction. In 2018, the Chinese government spent over $35 billion buying intellectual property rights from foreign firms in the aviation, telecommunications, computing, and manufacturing industries. Firms sold their intellectual property rights in exchange for access to the massive and ever-growing Chinese marketplace.

President Trump, long a critic of China and a proponent of bringing manufacturing back from overseas, is considering establishing a $25 billion reshoring fund to subsidize the additional operating costs of firms that move operations back to America. This action would help to alleviate the additional financial burden for firms who reshore their operations, as the operating costs in China and other developing countries are significantly lower. Another more realistic solution is the establishment of a fund that subsidizes the costs of firms that move operations from China to other developing countries with favorable attitudes towards America, which would still allow companies to produce their goods cheaply while refraining from putting our national security in jeopardy.

Our economy’s structural vulnerabilities and lack of resilience are not lost upon China. Former Chinese General Qiao Liang made recent statements recognizing the tenuousness of our situation. He acknowledges the definite American advantage in technology, research, and development, but asserts that “high technology always falls back on manufacturing.” If America itself doesn’t have the capacity to produce goods of strategic importance, then its technological advantage over competitor countries is negated. Our reliance upon less-than-friendly trading partners, like China, for these goods becomes leverage for them and a vulnerability for us.

In the post-coronavirus world, America needs to internalize the lessons from the pandemic and take significant and tangible steps to secure our strategic supply chain and create a stronger, more resilient economy.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/health-care/,2020-06-11
Bend to Xi: China Swabs State Department Officials - The American Spectator,"Last week, the State Department filed a complaint against the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for allegedly using anal swab COVID-19 tests on American diplomats entering China.

Visitors to China are expected to be tested for COVID-19 in this manner, which some say is a more accurate form of testing than using nasal swabs. While diplomats entering China are required to take a COVID-19 test, there is a provision that they are exempt from invasive rear-end tests.

A spokesperson for the State Department said, “The Department is committed to guaranteeing the safety and security of American diplomats and their families while preserving their dignity, consistent with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, as well as other relevant diplomatic law provisions.”

At a press conference, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said, “China has never required US diplomatic staff stationed in China to conduct anal swab tests.” Given Beijing’s proclivity for dishonesty, as well as the humiliating nature of the incident for U.S. diplomats, it’s likely that the diplomats were indeed swabbed anally.

The United States is not the only country upset with this practice. On March 1, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobo Kato requested the Chinese government to stop using anal swab tests on Japanese citizens. While not stating that the tests were given to diplomats, he did say that the tests cause “great psychological pain” to Japanese citizens entering China.

Make no mistake: these moves from Beijing are not an accident.

By subjecting visitors, and particularly diplomats, to such an invasive test carries the implicit message that China is in charge and can do anything it wants to its visitors. It is a sign of submission that the State Department personnel did not outright refuse such tests.

This is not the first time China has engaged in behavior like this. When President Obama arrived in Hangzhou for the 2016 G20 summit, he was given the silent treatment. While other world leaders had the red carpet rolled out for them, President Obama was not even given a rolling staircase and had to exit through the baggage area. China claimed that the disembarking incident was the Obama administration’s decision and that it was blown out of proportion by “arrogant and big-headed” Western media. While it might be right in its description of Western media, the Chinese government almost certainly intended to snub the president.

President Donald Trump did not quietly acquiesce to such incidents.

In fact, Trump often was the one doing the snubbing. In May 2020, he said, “I have a very good relationship [with Xi], but I just — right now I don’t want to speak to him.” His main reason was the COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in Wuhan, China.

President Joe Biden does not have the same tough-guy approach to China as his predecessor. While on the campaign trail, then-candidate Biden said, “China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man!” Since taking office, Biden has taken a somewhat stronger stance on China, saying, “They’re going to, you know, if we don’t get moving, they’re going to eat our lunch.” This 180 rhetorical shift is welcome, but whether it will translate into action remains in doubt.

At a recent town hall event, Biden said, “And so the idea I’m not going to speak out against what he’s [Xi Jinping is] doing in Hong Kong, what he’s doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China and Taiwan, trying to end the One China policy by making it forceful — I said — and by the — he said he — he gets it. Culturally, there are different norms that each country and they — their leaders — are expected to follow.” It’s not entirely clear what President Biden meant, but it appears to suggest a willingness to excuse China’s bullying and crimes instead of standing up to them.

Hopefully, this embarrassing swabbing incident doesn’t prove to be an allegory for President Biden’s posture towards China in the next four years. But the prospects are bleak for our aged president.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/hither-and-yon/,2021-03-02
"China Syndrome: Blues, Greens Gaze Longingly at the Reds - The American Spectator","Here are some gems from the spokesperson for the gaggle of labor unions and environmental pressure groups that have organized to push President Obama’s “global warming” agenda on America, the Blue-Green Alliance, in an interview with the trade press outlet E&E TV (subscription required).

Yvette Pena Lopes: … The economy, workers are hurting, new jobs and opportunities are needed. We’re falling behind. China is beating us right now on the race to renewable energy and clean investment.

Note: True enough about the economy, but otherwise that’s a wretchedly unsupportable argument. It’s just all they’ve got now.

Monica Trauzzi: Climate and energy were top-tier issues for the president when he came into office last year. With both houses of Congress run by Democrats, the president pushing hard for these issues, things still fell apart. Does that mean that there’s no hope at all for climate, for cap and trade to ever pass? Yvette Pena Lopes: Well, there’s always hope, though we do have an uphill battle. Again, with the climate being – even though you do have a Senate Democrat majority in the Senate, it’s not a strong enough majority to really push us there for an overall comprehensive bill.

Note: Yeah, we know about Brownback. But still, that’s 59 senators in that majority you say is too weak; plus him. Yet that’s not enough to do to you what they want to do. Precisely as Tom Friedman likes to complain. Worth thinking about.

And what is it they are really peddling? Well, according to a man BGA to this day also retains as a spokesman despite outburts of candor like the following, addressed in my discussion of this looming travesty in “Power Grab“:

“It is an economic restructuring bill for the global economy. We should not pretend that it isn’t.” — David Foster, BGA spokesman

Agreed on both counts, including that it’s time to stop playing make-believe about what’s really going on. Putting a sock in that nonsense about China is a good place to start on the road to an honest debate about where you really want to go with this.

The CCP Sees Taiwan as the Unfinished Business of China’s Civil War - The American Spectator,"On Sunday, China conducted yet another large-scale naval and air exercise around the island of Taiwan. CNN reports that 28 Chinese warplanes crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, and a total of 57 Chinese planes — including Su-30 fighters; J-10, J-11, and J-16 fighters; bombers; and AWACS-type aircraft — participated in the exercise. The People’s Liberation Army Navy’s Eastern Theater Command described the exercises as “combat drills.” As Al Jazeera notes, these latest drills follow similar exercises conducted less than a month ago, and their aim, according to Senior Col. Shi Yi, is to practice combat operations to “resolutely counter the provocative actions of external forces and Taiwan independence separatist forces.” The Center for Strategic and International Studies just issued a report on wargame scenarios in the South China Sea, which concludes that while the U.S. and its allies might win such a war, the costs will be heavy on both sides. And a new book by one of America’s foremost China experts shows that Chinese leaders consider the reunification of Taiwan to be the unfinished work of China’s civil war.

We are now in the midst of the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis. Two such crises occurred during the Eisenhower administration in the 1950s. The Third Taiwan Strait Crisis occurred in the mid-1990s during the Clinton administration. The origin of the Fourth Crisis was not, as is often thought, a reaction to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit in August 2022, though China ramped up tensions after that visit. In fact, the origins of the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis can be traced to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speech celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on July 1, 2021. In the most important part of that speech, Xi said, “Resolving the Taiwan question and realizing China’s complete reunification is a historic mission and an unshakable commitment of the Communist Party of China.” Xi also pledged to “take resolute action to utterly defeat any attempt toward ‘Taiwan independence’” and cautioned that “[n]o one should underestimate the resolve, the will, and the ability of the Chinese people to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”

But what is at stake for China in the Taiwan Strait cannot be understood without looking back to the end of China’s civil war, when CCP leader Mao Zedong, after his armies conquered most of the mainland, launched a naval effort in 1949–1950 to take Taiwan, the offshore island where Chiang Kai-shek and his Nationalist forces retreated after their defeat on land. A new book by Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (CSBA) Senior Fellow Toshi Yoshihara, titled Mao’s Army Goes to Sea, tells that story.

Yoshihara, a former strategy professor at the U.S. Naval War College, is considered one of our country’s foremost experts on the Chinese navy. He has authored or co-authored several books on the subject and periodically issues lengthy reports on China’s navy for the CSBA. Mao’s Army Goes to Sea details the founding of the CCP’s navy and its early island campaigns designed to invade and capture Taiwan. There was fighting on or near the Zhoushan Islands, Xiamen, Hainan, the Wanshan Archipelago, Jinmen Island, and others. These campaigns, Yoshihara writes, were “the PLA’s first exposure to sea combat and first joint maritime campaign,” and they “eliminated a Nationalist foothold in the South China Sea.” But Taiwan escaped the navy’s grasp. Mao planned to attack the island in the summer of 1950, but when North Korea invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950, the United States dispatched the 7th Fleet to the Taiwan Strait and thereby blocked Mao’s planned invasion.

Twice in the 1950s, Mao sought to reclaim Taiwan, but each time the Eisenhower administration prevented it. Capturing Taiwan, in other words, is the unfinished business of the Chinese civil war. In this sense, for the CCP, the Chinese civil war never ended and won’t end until Taiwan is reunified with the mainland under CCP rule. That was the meaning of Xi’s speech in July 2021. And that is why we are currently in the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis.

The first three ended peacefully. It is anybody’s guess how this one will end.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/in-print/,2023-01-11
Is China About to Enter a Thaw Period? - The American Spectator,"Perhaps the biggest challenge to dictatorship, and its greatest weakness, is the danger and uncertainty associated with leadership transition. No one — including the incumbent ruler — knows the real rules of transition, such as how a candidate is chosen and how the incumbent should exit. All these are determined secretly based on brutal power struggles. This is why, as Xi Jinping’s second term as China’s leader nears the end, predictions of what will happen to China’s leadership proliferate.

Xi has two titles: general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and president of the Chinese government. Based on the CCP charters, the term of the general secretary is five years, and there is no limit on how many terms one can serve. The Chinese constitution had a presidential term limit of no more than two five-year terms, but the People’s Congress of China removed it in 2018, essentially enabling Xi to rule indefinitely.

Two predecessors of Xi, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, each served as general secretary and as president for two five-year terms. This year is the last year of Xi’s second term, and the CCP will hold its congregation this fall to determine whether he will continue to rule.

Many analysts predict that he will rule forever, some say he will be replaced, and a few forecast a crisis in China.

Dictatorships have been dotted with thaw periods, such as the Khrushchev Thaw after the death of Stalin in 1953 and China’s thaw in the late 1970s. In general, after a long period of harsh repression, a totalitarian regime tends to precipitate a period of limited political and economic liberalization to deflate the high pressure accumulated. Under Xi Jinping, China has experienced the most repressive and anti-free market era since Mao Zedong. Thus, there is a high likelihood that post-Xi China will be a period of thaw.

There have been two thaw periods in Chinese history: after Mao’s death in 1976 and after the Tiananmen massacre in 1989. Deng Xiaoping, the de facto leader of the CCP during the post-Mao thaw, designed a strategy of avoiding confrontation with the West and quietly building capabilities known as “hide one’s claws and bide one’s time.”

Thaws provide rare opportunities to make meaningful changes in the political and economic systems — or what we call “meaningful structural changes” — such as making laws more independent from the ruling party and allowing some press freedom. Unfortunately, during China’s two thaws, the democracies did not seize the opportunity to push China for structural changes. Instead, the democracies were disarmed by Deng’s strategy and spent their time praising the CCP for the thaw and investing in and profiting from the newly opened markets.

U.S. China-policy analysts are very good at war games and scenario analysis, such as formulating plans for a sudden collapse of the CCP. But if a thaw comes, they usually are unprepared and leave a glaring white space for the power brokers who have benefited from doing business with China or who have been deeply entrenched in their pro-China stance. And these elites will waste no time promoting the peaceful rise of China and further cooperation with the CCP.

If we have learned anything from history, we must not allow this to repeat.

How should China-policy analysts help their governments in democratic countries, especially the U.S., to prepare for the next thaw? Below are some points that I believe they should consider.

First, embrace the liberalization and express support for the thaw because it provides an excellent opportunity for making structural changes in China. Second, suggest concrete steps for the new leadership to take and explain why taking these steps is in the best interest of China and the world.

The CCP always labels such suggestions from democracies as “foreign interference.” To reduce such resistance, policymakers in the democracies must explain why their suggestions are warranted: China, being the largest economy and global trader, interacts with and affects the welfare of the rest of the world, and therefore the rest of the world must play an active role in China’s policies, just as China exerts its influence on other countries’ policymaking. The most important structural changes we should push for are the development of the rule of law and the free flow of information. (READ MORE from Shaomin Li: China’s Zero-Tolerance COVID Policy Is to Protect One Man)

If we don’t seize the opportunity of thawing and instead merely praise it while increasing economic activities with China, what will likely happen during the thaw? Here is a likely scenario:

Under the current repressive policy of Xi, the Chinese society has been increasingly divided into two camps: Xi loyalists and the liberal-leaning people, mostly intellectuals, who despise Xi. Xi’s policy widens the gap between the two and drives the liberal-leaning camp from being merely liberal to disliking him to becoming anti-CCP. Currently, in China, especially among the liberal-leaning people, there is an overwhelming nostalgia for the post-Mao thaw and a strong desire to restore Deng’s policy. If the post-Xi leadership takes a more liberal stance by downplaying party ideology and emphasizing national unity and harmony, the people of the liberal camp will likely abandon their anti-CCP stance, and the CCP loyalists will likely support the call for national unity. This will narrow the gap between the two camps and unite them on liberal nationalism, a new version of Deng’s policy. This, plus the renewed enthusiastic support from the vested groups in the democracies, will provide much-needed breathing room and resources for the CCP to restore its eroded base, reboot China’s economy, and cement CCP’s rule. Needless to say, structural changes will be all but forgotten. Eventually, if the society becomes too liberalized for the CCP to stomach, a more repressive era will follow, repeating the repression-thaw-repression cycle.

If the CCP fails to replace Xi and he stays in power for a long period and continues his iron-fisted rule, it will make China ripe for a bigger thaw or even for the collapse of the CCP. That will provide a bigger opportunity for structural changes.

So we must be prepared not only for a prolonged Xi era or the sudden collapse of the CCP but also for a thaw period after the current repressive leadership in China.

China’s Grand Theft - The American Spectator,"Grand theft auto is a persistent crime in America, a felony in most states with jail sentences up to 10 years and a fine of $10,000, depending upon the value of the car and any valuables left inside. Car theft is a lucrative pursuit. Thieves steal an average of 2,400 vehicles a day for a grand total of around 873,000 stolen cars in 2020, a 9 percent increase over the previous year. It is a telling sign of our times that one of the most popular action/adventure games is Grand Theft Auto, with over 280 million units sold. Now imagine a gang of thieves organized to steal not our cars and trucks and RVs but an invaluable national resource: our research and development in modern technology.

Who is this gang of thieves? The “gang” in question is the government of a country with a population four times that of the United States, a booming gross domestic product second only to America’s, and a totalitarian political system with global ambitions. The country is the People’s Republic of China (PRC) — Communist China — and the organization responsible for its policies is the Chinese Communist Party.

In the past, Communist China occupied itself primarily with feeding, housing, and satisfying the material demands of its people. Today, Communist China spends much of its time and money calculating how to stand athwart the world like a modern-day Colossus. It is prepared to do whatever is necessary to become the world’s leading superpower, including engaging in a global campaign of economic espionage.

This is not hyperbole. Of 5,000 active FBI counterintelligence cases, approximately one-fifth of them deal with China. Sixty percent of the bureau’s trade secret cases involve China. Right now, says the bureau, Beijing is working to compromise American health-care organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and academic institutions conducting critical COVID-19 research. In 2019, U.S. members of CNBC’s Global CFO Council were asked if their company doing business in China had recently been the victims of intellectual property theft. One-fifth of them said yes. Council members include several of America’s largest companies, such as Facebook, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, Marriott, PepsiCo, and United Airlines.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) revealed in April that more than 500 federally funded scientists are under investigation for being “compromised” by China and other foreign countries. A typical scientist-as-thief is researcher Song Guo Zheng, who pleaded guilty to lying on applications for NIH grants totaling $4.1 million. He admitted that he used the U.S. government funds to enhance Chinese expertise in rheumatology and immunology.

At the Hudson Institute last year, FBI Director Christopher Wray said that “the greatest long-term threat to our nation’s information and intellectual property, and to our economic vitality, is the counterintelligence and economic espionage threat from China.” The latest annual survey of national security threats conducted by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence sounded a similar alarm, concluding that Chinese technology theft and espionage remain “the top threat” to U.S. competitiveness. America’s economic edge has always depended upon its innovative R&D, but if China succeeds in continuing to steal our nation’s intellectual secrets, that edge will disappear.

China’s targets include Fortune 500 companies and Silicon Valley startups, respected academics and think tanks. China extracts concessions from multinational corporations in exchange for market access. It requires the corporations to surrender source code, store data on platforms based in China, invest in Chinese companies, and permit the Chinese government to conduct security audits on its products. It is a rare U.S. corporation that will deny such concessions, since they fear losing entry to the enormous Chinese market. The annual cost of China’s intellectual property theft is difficult to calculate, but estimates are about $50 billion per year, based on the findings of the Trump administration.

The man on Main Street as well as the investment banker on Wall Street is a target. In 2015, China’s hackers stole the personal data of 80 million current and former customers of Anthem Insurance. Its hackers also stole more than 21 million records from OPM — the federal government’s Office of Personnel Management. As Wray points out, this kind of theft feeds into China’s development of artificial intelligence (AI). Communist China uses AI software to track down political opponents such as the Hong Kong demonstrators and “undesirable” populations like the Muslim Uighurs in western China.

Communist China has acknowledged that it must make large leaps in cutting-edge technologies to surpass America and that it cannot accomplish this with its own state-directed economy. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told a Communist Party meeting, “Our capacity for innovation is not strong, and our weakness in terms of core technologies for key fields remains a salient problem.”

For China, the solution is simple: intellectual theft on a scale never seen before in modern history. As U.S. Assistant Attorney General John Demers put it, “China wants the fruits of America’s brain power to harvest the seeds of its planned economic dominance.”

China’s thieves are everywhere. One of its intelligence officers posed as a headhunter on a social media platform and offered an American scientist a large sum for “consulting” services. The American realized that the “consulting” was related to sensitive information he had as a military intelligence specialist. He reported the suspicious contact to the FBI.

Not everyone turns down such fulsome offers. Charles Lieber, chairman of Harvard’s Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, was indicted for making false statements to U.S. authorities about his participation in the Thousand Talents Plan, a PRC program that offers mainly Chinese scientists working overseas “lavish financial incentives” to bring their expertise and knowledge back to China. Lieber concealed from both Harvard and the National Institutes of Health that the Chinese government was paying him, through the Wuhan Institute of Technology, a $50,000 monthly fee plus $150,000 in living expenses and over $1.5 million to establish a laboratory in China.

Hongjin Tan, a Chinese national with permanent resident status, enrolled in the Thousand Talents Plan and proceeded to steal, according to the FBI, more than $1 billion worth of trade secrets from his former U.S. employer — an Oklahoma-based petroleum company. Shan Shi, a Texas-based scientist, was sentenced to prison for stealing trade secrets regarding syntactic foam, an important substance used in submarines. As a participant in the Thousand Talents Program, Shi promised to “digest” and “absorb” relevant technology in the United States. He acted on behalf of a Chinese state-owned enterprise, which planned to put the American company out of business and capture the market. The American company had spent millions of dollars developing the technology. Communist China could not duplicate the work and instead paid to have it stolen.

Although we do not know precisely what happens when technology is stolen, we do know that the information is usually given to one of China’s universities, which then applies for patents based on the technology. The government distributes the patents to selected Chinese companies, which usually report spectacular advances in their field. The giant Chinese telecommunications company Huawei, for example, acquired an incredible 56,000 patents on 5G and artificial intelligence without spending much of its own money on R&D. Because of the illegal efforts of China’s far-flung spy ring, Huawei didn’t have to.

China is obliged to depend upon spies, bribes, and theft because its system of centralized decision-making stifles technological innovation. The Chinese Communist Party does not dare permit a real entrepreneurial spirit to flourish in China for fear that economic freedom would lead to political freedom threatening its hold on the levers of power. The Chinese Communist Party looks to intellectual property theft to fill the technological gaps, but this grows more difficult with the aggressive policing of the FBI and other U.S. agencies.

Stung by criticism, Communist China claims it has created courts that have prosecuted many cases of intellectual property theft. But Chinese court records are hard to come by, and several corporations have complained their cases have been dismissed by courts friendly to Chinese businesses. Such an outcome is not surprising in a land in which the law is what the Communist Party says it is.

What is to be done? Walter Lohman, director of the Heritage Foundation’s Asian Studies Center, has suggested that U.S. policy toward China should “go big,” dealing with national defense and diplomatic as well as economic issues. It should avoid protectionism and focus on measures that restrict purchases by companies controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. It should build a united front of action with allies such as Australia, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand. It should call out China’s widespread use of forced labor in Xinjiang and extend refugee status to Muslim Uighurs fleeing persecution in China. America must expose China’s tactic of applying diplomatic and economic pressure to secure support in international organizations. Citing China’s intellectual property theft before the next meeting of the World Trade Organization would be a good place to start.

Certain to capture worldwide attention would be U.S. pressure on the International Olympic Committee to postpone the 2022 Beijing Olympics and select a new host country. Postponement of the Olympics, let alone a transfer of venue, would constitute an enormous loss of face by China and the Communist Party.

The time is far past for America to take decisive action against China’s grand theft and treat it for what it is: a serious violation of international law that merits severe penalties, including condemnation by the global community.

China Threatens to Nuke Japan in Video - The American Spectator,"The Chinese Communist Party posted a video online Monday warning Japan that they would face retaliation by nuclear bombardment if they interfere in China’s growing reunification efforts with Taiwan.

“We will use nuclear bombs first. We will use nuclear bombs continuously. We will do this until Japan declares unconditional surrender for the second time,” the video declares.

The Baoji Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party shared the video on its Xigua page. Xigua is a video hosting platform similar to YouTube, and its parent company has extensive connections to the Communist Chinese Party.

The video has since been taken off of Xigua but can still be found across the internet. Jennifer Zeng, human rights activist and refugee from the Chinese Communist Party, reposted an excerpt of the video on her Twitter page:

#CCP Vows to Nuke #Japan if Japan defends #Taiwan. As Japan is the only country that has been nuked, so nuking Japan ""will get twice the result with half the effort.""

中共軍事頻道威脅對日本實施連續核打擊，直到日本第二次無條件投降。 pic.twitter.com/dp45R2LXtD — Jennifer Zeng 曾錚 (@jenniferatntd) July 13, 2021

The video continues, “When we liberate Taiwan if Japan dares to intervene by force — even if it only deploys one soldier, one plane or one ship — we will not only return fire but also wage full-scale war against Japan itself.”

This video is a deviation from China’s stated policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons, to which the country has adhered to the policy since 1964, when it became the fifth nation in the world to have a nuclear arsenal. The Chinese government said that year that “China will never at any time or under any circumstances be the first to use nuclear weapons.” China has repeatedly affirmed the policy and did so as recently as 2011.

The no-first-use policy enabled China to amass a moderate nuclear arsenal nominally for the sake of deterrence. It appears, however, that the Chinese Communist Party is now more interested in using nuclear weapons to extort their neighbors.

In a major speech delivered on July 1 celebrating the Communist Chinese Party’s centennial anniversary, President Xi Jinping said that the 21st century will be defined by China’s increasing presence on the international stage. Xi emphasized that China will no longer continue to “accept sanctimonious preaching from those who feel they have the right to lecture us.”

Xi emphasized his dedication to establishing control over Taiwan, saying that “realizing China’s complete reunification is a historic mission and an unshakable commitment of the Communist Party of China” and “We must take resolute action to utterly defeat any attempt toward ‘Taiwan independence.’ ”

On July 6, Deputy Prime Minister of Japan Taro Aso said that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would present Japan with an existential threat and that if it should occur, the United States must intervene alongside them.

Aso said, “If a major incident happened (over Taiwan), it’s safe to say it would be related to a situation threatening the survival (of Japan). If that is the case, Japan and the U.S. must defend Taiwan together.”",https://spectator.org/category/politics/political-hay/,2021-07-20
China’s Three-Child Policy Shows Xi Jinping Is Terrified - The American Spectator,"The Chinese government has carried out a massive population control campaign since the 1970s with the hope that it would generate economic prosperity. The government unremorsefully forced women to receive abortions, pressured or forced millions of women to be sterilized, and punished families with multiple children with debilitating fines. More than 300 million children were aborted under China’s one-child policy.

Last week, the Chinese government ended the two-child policy, which had been in effect since 2016, and instead enacted a three-child policy. The new policy is essentially an admission that the Chinese Communist Party’s heinous population control policies will not give it the riches it had hoped for. Instead, the population control program will deliver a demographic disaster, which will ravage the country’s economy for generations.

Many economists recognize that population control never improved China’s economy — that was the result of increased freedom in the marketplace and foreign investment. And the Malthusian crisis the government was so desperately trying to avoid with population control was an entirely false specter.

China needs women to have as many children as possible in order to avert economic catastrophe. But a three-child policy enables the party to pretend that limiting the number of children that couples can have, no matter what that magic number is, was ever a good idea. The three-child policy allows the government to maintain its control over every aspect of Chinese citizens’ lives.

The UN predicts that population contraction will begin in China before 2025 and that by 2030, the number of elderly will have doubled and the country will have lost 67 million working-age people. Others believe that China’s population could already be shrinking or will begin to shrink in 2021 or 2022.

A rapidly aging population will cause decreased productivity, low business expansion, and high labor costs. An increased dependency ratio — the ratio of workers to the elderly and children dependent on them — will leave China with more financial stress on workers and not enough monetary support, including health care and pensions, for the elderly.

China will lose much of its global competitiveness as money that would have been invested to grow its economy will be spent on supporting the disproportionate number of elderly people. The country’s innovation will be stifled, living standards will decrease, and economic growth will slow considerably and perhaps cease altogether.

Liang Jianzhang, a research professor of applied economics at Peking University, called the demographic challenge a “long-term time bomb.”

Evidently, the results from the once-a-decade Chinese census, which were released May 11, set off alarm bells in the Chinese government. The census showed that China’s fertility rate stands at 1.3 children per woman — the fertility replacement level is 2.1 children per woman — and that only 12 million babies were born in 2020. This is the lowest number of births in the country since 1961, a year that immediately followed a famine caused by communist policies that killed tens of millions of people.

There is some dispute over whether China’s fertility rate is even as high as 1.3, seeing as the government has a reputation for fudging its statistics. Yi Fuxian, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, has estimated that the real fertility rate in China averaged 1.18 over the past decade.

Unusually, the decision to enact the three-child policy came not through the normal channels of a communist party policy conference but rather a meeting of the Politburo, the communist party’s top decision-making group. The meeting was chaired by Xi Jinping himself.

“It’s unprecedented,” Yi told the Wall Street Journal. “It signals how concerned Xi Jinping is.”

The desperation is high, but the party is past the point where it can repair the damage in the near future. Decades of the foolish (and downright evil) population policies will take generations to reverse. After the government enacted the two-child policy in 2016, birth rates rose for one year before sinking ever since. There are no signs that a three-child policy will be able to reverse this trend. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences reports that China will soon enter into “unstoppable” population decline.

A long-term barrier to reversing China’s sinking birth rates goes much deeper than policy: the government has created a culture that prefers very small families and does not see the value of the sacrifices that come with raising children.

For instance, a 28-year-old Chinese woman, Dong Chang, told the New York Times that millennials in her country don’t see a reason to give up their own wants for a child.

“We are all only children, and to be honest, a little selfish,” she said. “How can I raise a child when I’m still a child myself? And take care of him and feed him at midnight?”

Another problem is that a preference for boys alongside the one-child policy has resulted in a distorted sex ratio achieved by sex-selective abortions and female infanticide. It’s estimated that there are 37 million fewer women in China than men.

Xi Jinping knows that the CCP has made a huge mistake and that the party can’t reverse it. In this case, the CCP’s impulse for authoritarian control and total lack of regard for human rights has not consolidated the party’s control and propelled China’s global power. China’s population control scheme will come back to wreck its economy.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/public-depravity/,2021-06-11
China Throws Iran a $400 Billion Lifeline - The American Spectator,"China and Iran are moving quickly toward a comprehensive strategic partnership that could see up to $400 billion in Chinese investments flow into the beleaguered Middle Eastern country over the next three decades, according to a leaked document.

The agreement, which the New York Times obtained and reported on Saturday, would feature extensive investment by Beijing into Iranian telecommunications and internet infrastructure as well as strategic assets like railroads, subways, ports, and airports.

In return, China would get what it usually demands from its trade partners: raw resources, in the form of a steady and heavily discounted supply of Iranian oil. The partnership would also be a prime opportunity for Beijing to push the digital yuan or a digital yuan-compatible currency framework, weakening the U.S. dollar’s sanction power.

Perhaps most importantly, adding Iran to China’s economic network would be an enormous boon to the Belt and Road Initiative. Iran has, since antiquity, served as the primary land route connected Eastern Europe and Asia, where the bulk of Chinese investment has occurred.

The two countries also intend to move toward closer military ties, with the agreement referencing joint exercises, research and development, and intelligence sharing, ostensibly to fight terrorism.

The possibility of a deal was first hinted at in 2016 by President Xi during a state visit to Iran when he upgraded China’s official relationship with the country to a “Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” the second-highest level of bilateral relations recognized by Beijing (the Communist Party claims to have a no-alliance policy).

Discussions have since seemingly proceeded in secret as Donald Trump entered the White House and reimposed sanctions upon the now increasingly desperate Islamist regime in Tehran. It ought to be noted, however, that China was buying enormous quantities of Iranian oil even while the agreement was in its early draft stage. Multiple reports had emerged in mid-2019 of “ghost ships,” Chinese oil tankers that were mysteriously vanishing off the grid while entering the Persian Gulf, only to reappear a week or so later in the same location, filled to the brim with oil. No doubt many in Washington were privy to this phenomenon, yet little was done or even said aloud about the situation.

Of course, nothing is confirmed until the two parties state their intentions. Even then, there’s no guarantee that the partnership would actually come into fruition. Four hundred billion dollars is far more than China has spent on any other Belt and Road partner, and might ultimately represent more of a wishlist than an actionable policy agenda. Moreover, Beijing’s increasingly sour international reputation has led to backlash from Iranians, including rumors that China intends to trap Iran with debt, and even that the Iranian government has agreed to sell one of its islands to the Chinese. These accusations are also unconfirmed at the moment, but the people making them can hardly be blamed for being suspicious.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/special-report/,2020-07-15
China on the Rise: Never Forget the Horror of Chinese Totalitarianism - The American Spectator,"The People’s Republic of China is America’s biggest foreign policy challenge. China is an ancient civilization and a fascinating country. It also is regressing toward brutal authoritarianism if not totalitarianism. This terrible legacy undermines the legitimacy of the Chinese political system.

For many people, misrule under Mao Zedong, the so-called Great Helmsman and Red Emperor, might seem like old news. But the PRC continues to illustrate the danger of infusing absolute dictatorship with communist ideology. That toxic combination yielded years of immiserating poverty, brutal tyranny, social chaos, and mass murder.

Yang Jisheng powerfully chronicled this experience. A member of the Chinese Communist Party, he worked for Xinhua News Agency for more than three decades. He was traumatized by the Tiananmen Square massacre, which encouraged him to explore the reality of CCP rule. In 2008, he also became deputy editor of Yanhuang Chunqiu, a liberal historical journal later seized by President Xi Jinping’s minions and turned into a mouthpiece of dictatorship.

Yang used his Xinhua position to travel about the country, unearthing a history that many people knew of but not well. He benefited from good timing, researching and writing while China was liberalizing after exiting the Maoist era. He completed his project before Xi Jinping reestablished suffocating censorship and tight controls over everything political. Yang published in Hong Kong while the rule of law, civil liberties, and press freedom remained intact.

He produced two mammoth tomes that detailed the unimaginable suffering of a nation and people whose 4000-year history exhibits contrasting moments of glory and tragedy. China’s civilization initially eclipsed what came to be called the West. Yet the system turned inward while the Europeans looked beyond their limited continent. The consequences were profound.

The West came to respect the life and dignity of every person, who was understood to have been created in the image of God. But this philosophy largely bypassed the Chinese Empire, which for centuries devalued those who toiled in harsh obscurity. Peasants lived and died unnoticed as emperors ruled, invaders conquered, dynasties flipped, and revolutions erupted.

Western powers were equally callous and careless in their treatment of the Chinese population. In the 1930s, Japan visited foreign fury and murderous nationalism on an ill-prepared but brave people, a fight that continued in World War II. In 1949, the civil war concluded with creation of a renewed empire, the People’s Republic of China, announced by Mao Zedong on October 1 in Tiananmen Square.

Alas, the revolution only intensified the agony of the Chinese people. Power had to be consolidated. Political enemies had to be crushed. Cadres had to be rewarded. Domestic ideological campaigns had to be run. And a war had to be fought against America. Collective casualties ran into the millions, so many individual eggs infamously broken to make a national omelet of the Marxist–Leninist variety. In 1958 came what became known as the Great Leap Forward, a collective headlong dive into the abyss. Mao intended to spur development with an intense program of rural industrialization and agricultural collectivization. The result, however, was dislocation, disruption, devastation, and starvation.

Yang became the premier chronicler of Mao’s most catastrophic fantasies. For instance, Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine: 1958-1962, published in 2008, is a compelling, often mind-numbing read. It runs 629 pages, with 87 devoted to notes and bibliography. It can be summarized as the story of what happens when the world’s most populous nation anoints one person as a secular god and turns his ideological nightmares into national policy. Insulated from reality, Mao denied overwhelming evidence of failure and treated critics as class traitors. His cowardly colleagues competed with one another to more completely and quickly enforce his arbitrary will, irrespective of human cost.

This depressing story is repeated throughout the book. Mao made manifestly inane, impractical, and impossible demands to implement real communism. Other party leaders, even those who foresaw the disaster to come, joined in a CCP chorus praising the new proposals and sending them across the nation. Local apparatchiks implemented the directives, despite the obvious stupidity in doing so. Crop production dropped while provincial leaders falsely informed Beijing of increasingly bountiful harvests, leading to ever-greater national requisitions. As farmers and their families starved, cadres looted supplies for themselves. Officials who reported failure and hardship were denounced as rightists and punished accordingly. This general routine was repeated again and again in province after province with ever more gruesome results.

Yang had a personal stake in his story since his father died of starvation. Only years later did Yang realize that his government was responsible for that very personal loss. His tragedy was repeated endlessly, yet such deaths were treated by Beijing as abstract statistics. Eventually even Mao recognized the resulting humanitarian carnage, but it still affected him little. Yang wrote of one incident: “On October 26, 1960, Mao read a report stating that hundreds of thousands of people had starved to death in Xinyang Prefecture. He responded with a blasé memo of a dozen words: ‘Liu [Shaoqi] and Zhou [Enlai], please read today and this afternoon discuss ways to deal with this.”

No one will ever know the true death toll from the grossly misnamed Great Leap Forward, but even regime apologists admit that it was in the millions. Yang’s conclusion: “I estimate that the Great Famine brought about 36 million unnatural deaths, and a shortfall of 40 million births. China’s total population loss during the Great Famine then comes to 76 million.” Quite a price to pay for an idiotic ideological experiment that failed on day one and could have been halted quickly but for Mad Mao’s delusions.

Unfortunately, in this totalitarian system the Red Emperor’s contrary opinion ended all debate. Explained Yang:

With Mao as China’s sole theoretical authority, as well as the ultimate wielder of political and military power, China’s government became a secular theocracy that united the center of power with the center of truth. Divergence from Mao’s views was heresy, and since the government had the power to penalize and deprive an individual of everything, the merest thought of discontent prompted an overwhelming dread that gave rise to lies.

But so disastrous was the failure of the Great Leap Forward that party leaders, including such near CCP immortals as Liu, Zhou, and Deng Xiaoping, afterward pushed more rational economic policies and pried practical control away from Mao. The latter came to see Liu, chosen by Mao as president, as an ideological apostate and political enemy. This was one cause of the Mad Mao’s next grand misadventure, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. “It would be overly simplistic to attribute the Cultural Revolution to nothing more than the power struggle between Mao and Liu or to Mao’s idiosyncrasies; all the same, Mao’s suspicion and dissatisfaction toward Liu were factors,” wrote Yang.

And he should know. He also wrote The World Turned Upside Down: A History of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. This volume, published four years ago but only recently available in the U.S., ran 722 pages, including 72 pages of notes.

Mao unleashed the campaign in 1966. It was originally supposed to end in 1969 but continued until Mao’s death in 1976. This Frankenstein social experiment was, if anything, more bizarre and senseless than the Great Leap Forward. The latter, in theory, was intended to spur the PRC to the forefront of humanity, yielding a society more productive and wealthy than even America. In contrast, the Cultural Revolution mixed personal pique with ideological purification, party purge, civil war, and social breakdown.

Armed warfare broke out. The military was engaged, divided, and purged. Competing mobs battled for control across China. Provinces were torn apart. Party officials divided into warring gangs. Ideological vigilantes abounded as “Red Guards” invaded universities, sacked ministries, destroyed homes, held trials, exacted peremptory injustice, and tortured and murdered revolutionary enemies. Schools emptied, with students, including a young Xi Jinping, sent to the countryside to labor and learn. Mao exiled his lucky rivals, including Xi’s father, to factories and fields, sometimes multiple times. The unlucky ones, like Liu, ended up in prison, where, denied adequate medical treatment, he died. So did hundreds of thousands or millions of other Chinese.

Mao triggered the Cultural Revolution just like he did the Great Leap Forward. Although some top party officials resisted his worst excesses, they almost always fell in line if confronted. Zhou, though widely seen as a moderate in the West, constantly played the cowardly shill to survive politically. Deng was slightly braver and twice purged as a result. Although Mao stood on the nation’s political summit alone, he quickly lost control of the process as chaos spread across the vast land. Subsequently the CCP attempted to paint the party rather than people as the principal victim of the Cultural Revolution. Yang wouldn’t let this deceptive historical rewrite stand unchallenged: “Official histories amply cover the persecution of cadres during the Cultural Revolution but barely mention or even distort the repeated bloody suppressions targeting ordinary people, the victims of which outnumber persecuted cadres by many hundredfold.”

It is difficult to summarize what convulsed the entire country. Yang explained, “The Cultural Revolution was an extremely complex historical process with multiple layers of conflict between multiple forces enmeshed in repeated power struggles and reversals over the course of ten years and a vast geographical space.” In detailing these events Yang produced another tour de force.

China was delivered from its misery only by Mao’s death on September 9, 1976. There could be no greater relief for the suffering people. Within a month the leadership’s radical advocates of the Cultural Revolution, the infamous “Gang of Four” led by Mao’s widow, Jiang Qing, were arrested, soon to be convicted in Stalinesque show trial and imprisoned. It took another two years for Deng to emerge as the undisputed “paramount leader” of the CCP, after which he set the country on a reform course that changed China and world history.

Deng’s PRC was not free, but he made it a freer nation. Unfortunately, Xi has reversed that progress and much more. Today’s China is increasingly authoritarian, with totalitarian characteristics — suffering from pervasive censorship and religious persecution, mass detention of the Uyghurs, an end of intra-CCP restraints, and a growing Xi personality cult. That doesn’t mean war, whether cold or hot, is the right response by the U.S. government. It is important, however, to understand the challenge presented and to remember from Chinese history the potential dangers posed by the CCP’s creation of another Red Emperor.

Of course, the greatest threat from Xi’s imperial communist state is to his countrymen. These creative, entrepreneurial, talented, and vibrant people deserve to be free. They have suffered under several varieties of political bondage over the last 4,000 years. Xi’s PRC is the latest and might not be the last. But the Chinese people ultimately retain the power to make a better and freer future.

China’s Toxic Dog Food Threatens Our Four-Legged Friends - The American Spectator,"A nexus can be formed among seemingly unrelated things during unusual times. Such is the case with dogs, COVID-19, mental health, politicians, and China’s history of peddling toxic products.

Americans of all ages have experienced a harmful lack of social interaction in the last year, with no definitive end in sight. For millions, the best therapy is a dog.

As the acquisition of furry friends skyrockets and our dependence on them increases with our isolation, those dogs’ health may be at risk from food and supplements made with ingredients sourced in China. First they sent us COVID-19, and now — yet again — potentially toxic food threatening the four-legged friends helping us through it.

As a former commissioner on the congressionally chartered U.S.–China Economic and Security Review Commission, identifying toxic ingredients from China in American products has always been a grave concern for me. In its 2019 report to Congress, the commission noted China was the No. 1 global source of pharmaceutical ingredients, which includes dietary supplements for pet consumption.

As far back as 2007, we found rampant agricultural contamination by airborne pollutants as a result of China’s rapid growth, conflicting layers of oversight, oppressive control of state media, and China’s tacit refusal to enforce its own product safety laws.

The dog food safety problem is no small thing. It has never been more important, nor more human-centered.

A beloved pet’s health is the first concern of its human, and the “Pet Effect” is real. Pets lessen stress, depression, anxiety, and loneliness — feelings widely reported to be increased during COVID. In a recent survey, nearly all pet owners thought of their pets as family, and 75 percent attributed improvements in mental health to their pets.

Dogs regularly assist veterans suffering PTSD or physical injury. One pet organization touts “the Woofice,” noting pets in the workplace create happier employees and higher productivity. “Pets in the Classroom” promotes pets in schools to teach children compassion for “small things that have no words.” Pets are critical companions to seniors and are often their only companion. Dogs are even used as medical healers and in recovery from mental illness and addiction.

In 2019, the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine began to investigate significant upticks in dilated cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart), a deadly illness debilitating and killing dogs. Between 2016 and 2018, the number of reported annual cases shot up from two to 320. The culprit seems to be grain-free pet foods. Between 2016 and 2017, as these cases exploded, sales of this type of dog food from China increased by 173 percent.

Toxic Chinese dog food is not a new phenomenon; it is a trend. Since 2007, thousands of dogs sickened or died from jerky treats with Chinese ingredients but labeled as “U.S. made.” Dogs have been killed and injured from Chinese-sourced food containing the industrial chemical melamine. More recently, knockoff Chinese flea collars sickened and possibly killed pets.

American pet owners prefer American-made pet food, but this market is not regulated with the scrutiny of human food, and vague labeling guidance makes it difficult to ascertain whether any raw ingredient is from China.

Many pet food and supplement labels contain wiggly phrases like “manufactured in the U.S.” without country-of-origin source information. COVID has had a demonstrable effect on the pet supplement market, increasing sales by 21 percent in 2020, an indicator of the increased awareness of pet health to American well-being.

In the human realm, toxic Chinese products have included toothpaste with anti-freeze, destructive sulfur-laden Chinese drywall, and dangerous lead-tainted toys. So we cannot pretend Chinese products are safe or that its raw materials meet U.S. safety standards.

China’s soil is dirty. It contains contaminants not present in American soil. China’s government will only admit publicly that 20 percent of its soil is contaminated to crisis levels; the truth is likely exponentially higher.

Would you eat a bean grown in heavy metals? Dogs shouldn’t either.

Dogs can’t read or dial a phone, but humans can research dog food brands for ingredient sources and pressure Congress and the Biden administration to increase scrutiny over dog food’s raw materials and provide guidance that makes pet food labels more accurate. As the White House prepares for its first meeting with Chinese officials, food safety for all living beings should be on the agenda.

We have all seen mental health problems, addiction, and suicide climb during the COVID-19 pandemic. The love and companionship of a dog is a critical element in soothing the loneliness and isolation of many Americans. My mother always said, “Dogs are God’s way of showing us how to treat each other.” In these times of stress and anxiety wrought by social and economic COVID restrictions, the corollary is also true.

Our government should take serious action to protect consumers from harmful Chinese products whether for the human or pet market. Our furry therapists should be treated with the same level of food safety concern as we do ourselves.

A firm message from our elected officials to the Chinese government on behalf of American consumers would not be difficult, but it is long overdue.

China Under Stress - The American Spectator,"If all proceeds on schedule, on November 8, 2012, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) through its 18th Congress of the Communist Party of China will choose Xi Jinping to replace Hu Jintao as president for the next ten years. An initial reaction might be that this would appear to be simply yet again another internal disciplined and prescribed, if not pre-ordained, Chinese Communist Party personnel reassignment.

That’s what they would have liked, but it’s far from the fact. To begin with the congress was supposed to occur in early October. This is what had been planned since last spring. Unexpected delays like this just don’t happen in a government and political structure that depends on apparent orderliness and thus a certain predictability. When this requisite consistency is disrupted, problems reverberate throughout the system. A crucial presidential year was the worst time for the established form to be bent.

In March a bombshell exploded. Bo Xilai, one of China’s acknowledged future leaders, a regional party secretary, a princeling — son of one of the Revolution’s trusted comrades — was taken into custody along with his wife and Chonqing’s police chief. The wife of Bo Xilai was quickly convicted in camera of participation in the murder of a well-known British businessman with whom the couple had had extensive business and personal dealings over the years. Bo’s role as a high profile party leader was particularly important because of his populist appeal centered on his encouragement of a highly personalized nostalgia for the imagined halcyon days of Chairman Mao Tse-tung’s leadership.

Bo Xilai had begun to be suspected of a personal ambition for increasing Maoist autocratic rule contrary to the political consensus that has marked Chinese governance for nearly twenty years. While the murder of the Briton was the incident that focused international attention, it has been Bo’s political ambition and strong effort to evolve a popular cult of personal support that has so impacted what was supposed to be a smooth transition to Xi Jinping’s presidency this autumn.

As if the Bo incident were not enough, Xi Jinping, always a socially available politician, went missing in September. No sign of Xi has turned up in spite of feverish searching on the part of Chinese and foreign journalists. The best guess as of this writing is that Xi underwent some form of non-life threatening — though possibly very debilitating — surgery. Prostate surgery has been suggested. Another theory, not so generally publicized, is that this next president is involved in extensive and super secret negotiations with China’s military leaders (with whom he has had close ties in the past) to evolve knotty political military problems that must be addressed before the 18th Party Congress. In any case, the run-up to the Congress has hardly been the well-organized affair that people had come to expect of the Chinese Communist Party.

Not discussed as much as the Bo Xilai affair, but of related importance and political impact, has been the reduction in status of Zhou Yongkang, the formerly powerful head of domestic security as a member of the controlling nine-member standing committee of the Politburo. Even though Zhou was due to step down by the end of 2012 , his relinquishing of operational control of all aspects of internal security half a year early was seen as related to his earlier sponsorship of Bo Xilai for promotion to the standing committee. A purge of some sort would seem to be in process.

All of these things — and more — reflect a broad scale struggle over the ideological direction of the country. Demographics have added an unplanned-for negative aspect to China’s growth. The aging population has been accompanied by a more vocal and less easily directed younger workforce. At the same time increased wages have not had the salutary effect that might be expected on worker attitudes. As the gap between the wealthy and the poor has grown obvious, material acquisition has become more and more an everyday objective of Chinese life rather than the long-time acceptance of shared deprivation.

The breakdown of governance on a local level has been precipitated by the central authority’s requirement that local governments have the financial responsibility to fund stimulus objectives announced by Beijing. According to Amnesty International, to accomplish this demand the communities — especially in rural areas — have taken to evicting small property owners, seizing the land, and then selling it to developers. While village demonstrations have become commonplace, there has been little in the way of Beijing taking action to find alternatives to this method of gaining revenue by exercising the ultimate in local governments’ rights of eminent domain.

These among many other issues will face the new administration of Xi Jinping — when and if he shows up. In the meantime, the current leadership of Hu Jintao has chosen to divert the Chinese people’s attention to the East China Sea and the ownership dispute over the islands called Senkaku by Japan and Diaoyu by China. Japan took over the island chain in the late 1800s. Similar expansions were rectified after WW2, but not these islands. Beijing wants them and Tokyo isn’t budging.

The island contest is a perfect distraction for the PRC at this moment when its economy is suffering a slowdown as China’s cheap labor-built exports to a world suffering from its own economic problems appears to be no longer an engine for growth. Even China’s falsely valued currency isn’t working as well as a financial gimmick as it once did. Oh well, they were warned!!!",https://spectator.org/chairman-disney-ambassador-china/,2012-10-19
China v. Trump: COVID and the 2020 Election - The American Spectator,"Charlie Gerow and Mark Singel get it.

This week in their side-by-side columns in the Harrisburg Patriot-News, the main newspaper for the Pennsylvania state capital area, Republican Gerow and Democrat Singel drew a perfect illustration of exactly what COVID-19 has done to the 2020 presidential election campaign. (Full disclosure, I am a long-time friend of Charlie Gerow, the head of his Harrisburg PR firm Quantum Communications, the author of a well-read “Daily Breakfast Briefing,” and a longtime Pennsylvania GOP strategist. I have met Mark Singel but a couple times over the years. Mark is the former Democratic lieutenant governor of the state. The two also appear every Sunday on CBS-21’s “Face the State” television show.)

Here are the headlines for their respective columns.

For Republican Gerow:

China should bear a lot of the blame in the coronavirus’ spread throughout the world

For Democrat Singel:

Racism is not a legitimate campaign strategy

In other words, to summarize, post-COVID the rest of the election year is going to boil down to a contest between two very different narratives: Trump or China?

Among Charlie’s points were these:

Let’s face the obvious facts first. The Chinese Communist Party lies. They cheat. They steal. The Chinese communist government is one of the most repressive and brutal in the history of the world. Chairman Mao, the father of the Chinese Communist Party and still their patron saint, was the biggest mass murderer in history. The savagery he unleashed on his own people resulted in more than 65 million deaths, far surpassing what Joe Stalin or Adolph Hitler did.

After more detailed history about the role of the Chinese Communist Party in history — none of it good — Charlie concludes,

The impact of all this on the 2020 presidential campaign is significant. Who can best deal with China will be a critical question asked as we return to normal and the campaign for the White House restarts. President Trump has a clear message on the issue of how we should deal with the Chinese communists. Joe Biden does not. That’s the politics of it. But, there are still those who refuse to demand accountability from the Chinese, who ask us to ignore [what] they’ve done, to look the other way or even to make excuses for them. That’s the tragedy of it.

In other words, Charlie is not blaming the Chinese people in the least for what has happened. He is decidedly blaming the real source of the problem — the Chinese Communist Party. Two very, very different things, as the Chinese people themselves are forced to live daily under the communist thumb. As an example of the latter, over here at, of all places, NPR radio, is host Scott Simon illustrating the point exactly. Said Simon late last year:

We’re learning more about the chilling moves by China against Uighur people. It’s been happening in the Xinjiang region in northwestern China. Uighurs are a Muslim minority. China has rounded up a million and imprisoned them in camps. Now the Uighur Human Rights Project reports that the Chinese government has destroyed more than 100 mosques.

And let’s not forget that before the virus dominated attention the CCP government was in the news for its crackdown on the Hong Kong freedom movement.

Meanwhile, Democrat Singel has another narrative altogether. A narrative that, summarized, is simple: Trump Did It.

After highlighting an attack on an American woman of Asian descent and suggesting that to label the virus the “Wuhan virus” is racist, Mark says, in part, this:

Translation: let us shift our attention away from the bungling performance of the president and send the marching order to our base: “Blame the Chinese.” As the death toll in America reaches 100,000 and the unemployment rate approaches 30 percent, the president’s enablers will propose all kinds of conspiracies and launch attacks to mask the collapse of leadership coming from the White House.

What Gerow and Singel have pinpointed exactly is the seismic shift the virus has now caused in the 2020 election. Pre-virus, America was experiencing a fairly typical presidential election cycle with the eternal quadrennial debate about the state of the economy at its center. As candidate Ronald Reagan once posed to Americans in his 1980 debate with then-President Jimmy Carter, this became, “Are you better off now than you were four years ago?” In 1992, Clinton campaign guru James Carville famously summed it up as “It’s the economy, stupid.”

Americans — and indeed the world — are now living in a post-COVID world. The crisis, which has now killed almost 100,000 Americans and literally shut down the American economy, is still ongoing and conceivably will be here for the entire rest of the year and beyond as the rest of the looming Trump–Biden showdown emerges. But, as said, what Charlie and Mark have just vividly illustrated is that the rest of this election is going to boil down to two competing narratives. “Trump did it” versus “China did it.”

Indeed, as this is written the Trump-supporting America First super-PAC is airing a Pennsylvania-specific commercial that attacks Biden over his record on China. The commercial was written up in the Philadelphia Inquirer and is linked in the article, found here. The Inquirer reports this way:

A super-PAC supporting President Donald Trump’s reelection started airing new TV commercials in Pennsylvania last week portraying Joe Biden as weak on China — part of an effort to damage the presumptive Democratic nominee’s standing in key battleground states.

Similar commercials are targeting Michigan and Wisconsin, among other battleground states, each crafted for the specific state involved.

And on the Democratic side, issuing her own version of Mark Singel’s point, here is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as headlined in the Daily Caller:

Pelosi Calls President Trump’s China Criticism A ‘Diversion’

The story begins:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped President Donald Trump on Thursday over his criticism of China’s coronavirus response, calling it a “diversion.” “Let me just say that what the President is saying about China is interesting. It’s an interesting diversion,” Pelosi said. “Right now our focus should be on meeting the needs of the American people.”

Over in the Senate, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer took this tack, saying of Trump:

Even if [coronavirus] came from China, why didn’t you do something about it?

In other words, as with Singel and Pelosi, Schumer is focused on a “blame Trump” narrative.

For those of us of, ahem, a certain age, this new debate has echoes of a very old debate. Note well, again, Charlie’s focus on the Chinese Communist Party. Once upon a time in post-World War II America, as the Cold War took off, Democrats were accused of being “soft on communism.” One event after another unfolded over the ensuing decades that had this or that Democrat pictured as having sympathies for the Soviet communists. To name a few:

Alger Hiss and charges of spying in the FDR/Truman-era State Department for the communists.

The 1950 Richard Nixon–Helen Gahagan Douglas U.S. Senate campaign in California, in which the left-wing Democrat Douglas was pilloried by the Nixon campaign as “The Pink Lady,” sympathetic to communists if not actually one herself.

Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, left-wing activists convicted of spying for the Soviet Union and later executed.

The rise of Wisconsin’s Republican Sen. Joseph McCarthy and accusations of communist sympathizers in the Roosevelt and Truman administrations.

This theme of some — but not all — Democrats being “soft on communism” existed for the entire Cold War. It flared with the left-wing protests of the Vietnam War and the anti-war candidacy of 1972 Democratic presidential nominee Sen. George McGovern. In the Reagan era of the 1980s, it centered on the rise of the “nuclear freeze” movement. Indeed, just this year there was Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination and saying this of Cuba’s communist leader Fidel Castro:

When Fidel Castro first came into power … you know what he did? He initiated a major literacy program. It was a lot of folks in Cuba at that point who were illiterate and he formed the Literacy Brigade … and they went out and they helped people learn to read and write. You know what? I think teaching people to read and write is a good thing.

Castro, like Mao, was a tyrant who murdered countless Cubans in his communist dictatorship. Brutality is a feature of communism, not a bug in the system.

Which is what makes Charlie Gerow’s listing of the brutal history of the Chinese Communist Party so telling. Like myself, Charlie is a Reagan alumnus and well recalls this warning from President Reagan, a dedicated anti-communist warrior, in 1981. As it happens I wrote up Reagan’s 1981 warning on the Soviet communists only the other day in this space, and reminded that his wisdom then was relevant to today’s dealing with the Chinese communists. Said the president (bold print supplied):

Well, so far détente’s been a one-way street that the Soviet Union has used to pursue its own aims. I don’t have to think of an answer as to what I think their intentions are; they have repeated it. I know of no leader of the Soviet Union since the revolution, and including the present leadership, that has not more than once repeated in the various communist congresses they hold their determination that their goal must be the promotion of world revolution and a one-world socialist or communist state, whichever word you want to use. Now, as long as they do that and as long as they, at the same time, have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is what will further their cause, meaning they reserve unto themselves the right to commit any crime, to lie, to cheat, in order to attain that, and that is moral, not immoral, and we operate on a different set of standards, I think when you do business with them, even at a détente, you keep that in mind.

Substitute “Chinese Communist Party” for “Soviet Union,” and Charlie’s point is plain to see.

It takes very little to see that the Trump argument going down the 2020 road is that old, gullible, Sleepy Joe Biden is “soft” on the Chinese communists, just as some of his party ancestors were soft on the Soviet communists. Indeed, there is Biden in that aforementioned pro-Trump commercial saying of the CCP that “they’re not bad folks.”

Then there is — as always with the Left — the race card playing. As I noted in this space earlier in the week, CBS’s White House correspondent Weijia Jiang did exactly that in an exchange with the president in a Rose Garden press conference. When Trump responded to her question about global competition on virus testing he said, “Maybe that’s a question you should ask China. Don’t ask me, ask China that question, okay?”

In a blink, Jiang, whose parents departed China and brought her to America at two year old and is long an American citizen raised in West Virginia, took offense. As if Trump, who campaigned on the China trade deal question and the role of China internationally, were a racist for saying it. Mark Singel says this episode was “nasty” and “personal” — and I would respectfully disagree. The Democratic Party was built on race card playing — supporting slavery, then segregation, and now the son of segregation, identity politics. And identity politics is exactly what reporter Jiang was playing with her snarky, racial response.

This is what is also at play in protesting that calling the virus the “Wuhan virus” or “Chinese virus” is somehow racist. In fact, as I have mentioned previously, it has been standard practice over the decades — as verified with a look at the World Health Organization website — to name global diseases for their place of geographic location. From Lyme disease to the Marburg virus and Ebola (successively a town in Connecticut, another in Germany, and a river in Africa) and so many others, this is standard practice. Race has zero to do with it.

There is also one more interesting, not to mention ironic, feature of Democrats seeking to avoid blaming China for the virus. What is one of the biggest constituency groups in the modern Democratic Party? That would be, of course, the trial bar. Lawyers. Reported Fox News a few years back:

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, in 2014, 97 percent of political contributions from the nation’s leader (sic) trial lawyers association went to Democrats.

And what are a lot of trial bar types in America gearing up for as we speak? Here’s a sample headline from U.S. News & World Report:

Lawsuit: China Hid Virus Information, Should Pay Billions A lawyer who represented victims of the Las Vegas shooting massacre has filed a federal lawsuit over the coronavirus, seeking class-action damages from China for 32 million U.S. small businesses.

And here is another headline, this one from the UK Sun:

COVID ‘COVER-UP’ US lawyers sue China for TRILLIONS for ‘allowing virus outbreak to erupt before covering its tracks’

In other words? The more Democrats like Pelosi and Schumer insist that blaming the Chinese government for the virus is a “diversion” — they will be undercutting one of their major constituencies that is busy insisting … as is Trump … that the Chinese government must be held accountable for the spread of the virus and sued for — yes indeed — trillions.

In the world of political punditry lots is written and said that un-memorably vanishes in the ether. But in this case, what Charlie Gerow and Mark Singel have done here is to very astutely put their finger on the new dueling narratives competing in the 2020 election. Narratives unimagined as the New Year dawned.

The victory of one narrative over another will determine who wins not just the battleground state of Pennsylvania but the election itself. Not to mention guide whatever is to come in America’s relationship with China.

China’s Warfooting in Space - The American Spectator,"In 2018, China launched 39 space rockets into near-Earth orbit and beyond, beating out the U.S. (with 34 launches), and Russia (with 20). In 2019 China led the world again, with 32 successful orbital launches, compared to 22 flights from Russia and 21 from the United States. Last year, thanks to SpaceX, America topped the scoreboard with 40 successful launches (four failures), with China a close second at 35 (four failures), and Russia placing third with 17 (no failures). Payloads ranged from satellite deployments, International Space Station (ISS) resupply flights, and crewed missions to robotic exploration of the sun, asteroids, near planets, and in the case of China, to the Moon.

On December 22, 2020, at 12:37 p.m. Beijing time, China successfully launched their new Long March 8 rocket into orbit from their new spaceport on Hainan Island. The Long March 8 deployed five separate payloads, debuting an expendable booster, which will eventually be outfitted for recovery and reuse.

China kicked off the new year on January 19, launching a Long March 3B rocket from the Xichang launch center in Sichuan province, deploying the Tiantong 1-03 satellite into geosynchronous orbit.

China’s stunning technological advances are not rare, black swan achievements that could not be predicted or foreseen. A more appropriate metaphor for President Xi Jinping’s aspirations would be gray rhino events — obvious, visible, coming right at you, with highly probable consequences.

While President Obama was gutting NASA’s space exploration capability, forcing NASA to send astronauts to the ISS as passengers on Russian rockets (and to subsidize Russia’s space program in the process), China built and launched its Tiangong-1 crewed space station. Their Chang’e 2 lunar orbiter launched in 2010 to map the surface of the Moon in greater detail, followed by Chang’e 3 lander and Yutu (Jade Rabbit) rover in 2013, which explored the northern region of Mare Ibrium. Tiangong-2 was launched in September 2016 as a test-bed for crewed Shenzhou space craft and uncrewed Tianzhou-1 cargo vessels. In 2018, Chang’e 4 and Yutu 4 rover landed on the dark side of the Moon to explore the South Pole-Aitken Basin, where it continues to operate to this day.

So what’s the big deal? The “West” still has the ISS, which, while aging, is still functional. And as far as moon landings go, “we” did that 50 years ago, with Apollo. Right?

China, like Russia, has always framed its presence in space as the ultimate military high ground, but China was way behind the curve. Russia successfully tested its first anti-satellite weapons as early as 1968. China wasn’t even able to launch its own satellites until 1970 (on top of modified ICBMs). But China plodded forward, step by inexorable step, acquiring its first ground-based satellite jammers from the Ukraine in the late 1990s and developing “domestic” electronic countermeasures to disrupt, deny, deceive, and degrade U.S. uplinks and downlinks from low-Earth orbit.

By 2007 China achieved its first successful anti-satellite missile launch, shattering the derelict Fengyun-1C weather satellite. The kinetic strike shredded the target into more than 150,000 chunks of shrapnel, forcing emergency evasive maneuvers for dozens of spacecraft, including the ISS. In 2008, Obama entered the White House, neutering NASA and giving China eight years to catch up. And caught up they have.

Russia stood up its Space Force (Russian Aerospace Forces) on August 1, 2015. China followed suit four months later (with the People’s Liberation Strategic Support Force). Obama was largely oblivious, but President Trump, forced to play catch-up, announced the creation of the United States Space Force on December 20, 2019. He had every right to expect in his second term to sequentially build and expand the nascent command, but Biden’s presidency places the future of the American Space Force in doubt.

China’s space program was never about exploration, was never “peaceful,” and has always focused on the ability to deny space-based systems to its “adversaries.” Its Space Force arsenal includes kinetic kill missiles, ground-based lasers, orbiting space robots and shadow satellites, surveillance satellites, satellite jammers, directed-energy weapons, and cyber attacks to “blind and deafen” its opponents. In addition to advanced offensive anti-satellite capabilities, China continues to enhance space capabilities across the board, in satellites, sensors, launch vehicles, and lunar systems, to achieve its long-term goal of becoming the world’s most powerful space presence.

On July 23, the week before NASA launched the Mars 2020 Perseverance/Ingenuity mission, China launched Tianwen-1 (Quest for Heavenly Truth), China’s first interplanetary mission. Tianwen-1 is expected to arrive in Mars orbit between February 11 and 24, 2021 — and set down in Utopia Planitia (south of NASA’s Viking 2 landing site and northeast of Elysium Planitia, the current location of NASA’s InSight Lander). Last December, China launched and landed its Chang’e 5 lunar sample mission on the moon, scooped up samples, and returned them to Earth.

The good news is that SpaceX has allowed the United States to regain manned access to low-Earth orbit and the aging ISS without relying on Russian rockets. The sobering news is that China is about to launch the core module of its new third generation space station, Tianhe (Unification of Heaven), a 66-metric-ton space station that could expand to six modules.

Speaking at the fifth plenary session of the 19th Communist Party of China Central Committee last October, President Xi Jinping outlined plans to speed up efforts to build China into a scientific and technological powerhouse. Announcing his administration’s priorities to the American public, President Biden zeroed in on COVID-19 and health equity, economic equity, racial equity, and climate change equity.

So, while Beijing is weaponizing space, the Biden administration is busy weaponizing “Equity.”",https://spectator.org/china-america-american-spectator-print-summer-2021/,2021-02-01
How’s the Weather in China? - The American Spectator,"WASHINGTON — I have good news for my readers. I come with glad tidings. November was a month of clement weather throughout these United States. Not only that, but the weather reports for December are going to be even better. I predict the weather for December is going to be absolutely balmy, even tropical, in our southern climes. Put away your ugly goulashes. Pack up your earmuffs. January will be flip-flop weather. We are facing a suntan climate for months to come. We are going to have 70-degree weather probably all the way to springtime, and, after that, who knows? By that time, we shall be facing the summer months. How warm can it get?

You might well ask what have I been drinking, or, even worse, what have I been smoking? Well, I have neither been drinking nor smoking. I am as clean as a hound’s tooth. I have been trying to see the world through the eyes of one Sam Bankman-Fried, the mesmerizer of the cryptocurrency hedge fund attached to FTX, which recently went belly up. Sam also was a very generous donor to the Democratic Party. The last time I checked, he had only George Soros ahead of him, though that could be false information. There is a lot of false information around Sammy boy.

Sam started his fund for big bucks not on Wall Street but in Berkeley, California, where so many other dreams of making a better world have been hatched. He with a group of like-minded do-gooders gathered around a firm called Alameda Research in the fall of 2017. They had one thing in common: Effective Altruism. Their goal was to give more effective charitable donations to good causes and to avoid conventional investments. According to the Wall Street Journal, the group “viewed Alameda as a way to make a lot of money trading cryptocurrencies—profits that could be funneled to charitable causes employing” Effective Altruism principles.

Early on the group splintered, with some of the more conventional investors claiming that Sam had lost track of his investments to the point that he did not know what funds he had available and for what purpose he had them. Sam disputes this criticism, though it now is suspected that Sam mixed his own money with Alameda’s. Apparently, Sam’s critics were right, and he has filed for Chapter 11.

How long could Sam believe that his fantasy world was going to continue untroubled by the authorities? Well, it seems there is a lot of fantasy in the world nowadays. We see it in the financial world, where Sam is the latest in a long line of charlatans; in the medical world, where Elizabeth Holmes practiced her arts before the authorities closed in on her; in the political world, it goes without saying; and even in the world of tyrants. Recent events suggest that China’s leader, Xi Jinping, is going to have rough seas ahead.

Until recently things seemed to be going Mr. Xi’s way. Mr. Xi presided over a twice-in-a-decade Politburo meeting where he was elected to an unprecedented third term. But for some reason he panicked over the COVID outbreak. Does he know something about COVID that the rest of the world does not? After all, COVID got its start in a lab in Wuhan, China. Mr. Xi’s response was to lock down the nation. That has not gone over very well with the 1.4 billion Chinese citizens. They have held demonstrations all over the country, the likes of which have not been seen since the Tiananmen Square demonstration of 1989. There have even been calls for Mr. Xi to step down. The cracks in his facade came about very quickly, though writers familiar with China have been predicting it for years. The unrest is due not just to COVID and the lockdown but also to ethnic and geographical divisions splintering this vast country.

Toward the end of last week, Mr. Xi responded to the protests in the street by surprising a visiting European Union delegation with the claim that the demonstrations show that the dissent reflects “frustration” with the COVID lockdown. It was the first-known response by China’s leader to the demonstrations. Now there have been some signs of official relaxation of the lockdown. Will there be more relaxations in China’s policy of COVID lockdowns?

We shall see, but I shall be particularly interested if Mr. Xi gets up one morning and proclaims the weather as balmy as I have.

China’s ‘World-Island’ Ambitions - The American Spectator,"In August 2020, after U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar visited Taiwan, Chinese fighter jets crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, which brought a response from Taiwan’s U.S.-supplied air force. In late September, China simultaneously held five military exercises along its coast: in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, the Bohai Sea, and the Yellow Sea. Tensions in the Taiwan Strait are high, with U.S. warships repeatedly demonstrating the right of free passage in waters that China claims as its own, according to the so-called nine-dash line.

Last month, China’s ZhenHua Oil Company concluded a multi-billion dollar agreement with Iraq, while China and the European Union signaled agreement on trade and investment, which, according to Hong Kong University’s Alexis Leggeri, “will broaden … European companies’ market access in China … while ensuring access to key European strategic markets for Chinese firms.” In early January, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited five African countries to further advance China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). On January 10, 2021, China issued a new white paper on international development, which is one of the tools the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) uses as part of the BRI.

Meanwhile, China and Russia continue to grow closer. Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, writes George Washington University professor Robert Sutter, “spend more time together than any other two world leaders.” China and Russia have increased science and technology cooperation through the auspices of Huawei, China’s massive communications and technology company. In October, Putin publicly suggested that a Sino-Russian military alliance was “quite possible.” China and Russia have held joint naval exercises with South Africa and in the Gulf of Oman with Iran, and both navies have gradually increased their presence in the Indian Ocean. The Global Times, a mouthpiece for the CCP, recently touted the strengthening Sino-Russian strategic ties meant to send a strong signal to the United States. In December, Chinese and Russian air forces held a joint exercise in the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea, and the Miyako Strait east of Taiwan and close to Okinawa.

The United States, meanwhile, has strengthened its alliances with Japan, South Korea, and Australia, while reaching out for new allies in India and Vietnam. During the past four years, President Trump put meat on the bones of what under his predecessor was little more than a rhetorical “pivot” to Asia. Some American strategists warn that China’s rise and its challenge to America’s global leadership risks triggering the “Thucydides Trap” — war between a rising power and the existing world leader.

What kind of threat does China’s rise pose to the United States? Some observers call China an economic competitor. Others point to China’s growing military power, especially, as noted above, in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea. Some strategists say China has been using “information warfare” to spread disinformation throughout the world. Still others contend that China is using “soft power” to gain goodwill throughout Central Asia, Africa, and Europe. And many observers still believe that the United States should continue to engage China in areas where we supposedly have common interests, like climate change, trade, scientific exchanges, and international terrorism.

In truth, China’s threat is fundamentally no different from previous threats to the global balance of power that emanated from the great Eurasian landmass. Since at least the early 19th century, the world has suffered through repeated attempts by Eurasian-based powers to attain global hegemony: Napoleonic France, Wilhelmine Germany, Nazi Germany, and most recently the Soviet Union.

A proper assessment of China’s threat begins with geography. Classical geopolitical theorists, such as Britain’s Sir Halford Mackinder and James Fairgrieve, and America’s Alfred Thayer Mahan and Nicholas Spykman, recognized that the Eurasian landmass was the dominant land feature of the globe. It contains most of the world’s people and resources. Compared to Eurasia, all the world’s other landmasses are offshore and distant islands or, in the case of Africa, an extension of the great continent. China’s BRI is aimed at nothing less than hegemony in Eurasia.

Eurasia is also geopolitically divided between what Mackinder and Fairgrieve called the Heartland or “pivot” region — the mostly landlocked north-central inner core of the continent — and what Spykman called the Rimland — the great arc extending from East Asia to Scandinavia that has access to the sea. Mackinder believed that geography, technology, and modern means of communication favored the Heartland in the struggle for Eurasian preeminence, while Spykman viewed the Rimland as potentially controlling “the destinies of the world.”

Eurasia and the world’s other landmasses are situated in what Mackinder called the “World Ocean.” The oceans and seas are the global highways that connect Eurasia with the rest of the world. The sea, Mahan explained, is the “wide common” on which much of the world’s goods and resources travel. Mahan believed that command of the seas was the key to global preeminence, enabling smaller insular powers such as Britain and the United States to offset the power or powers situated in Eurasia. But the preeminence of the sea powers was dependent on what Zbigniew Brzezinski called the “geopolitical pluralism” of Eurasia. In other words, British and American security required the existence of multiple power centers in Eurasia. Without that geopolitical pluralism, a Eurasian power or an alliance of powers could use the resources of the great continent to construct superior naval power that could overwhelm the insular powers of Britain and the United States.

In the 21st century, this geographical setting includes air, space, and cyber power, which have made the globe geopolitically “smaller” and enabled competing nations to strike each other from afar. The geography hasn’t changed, but its strategic meaning has to some extent. In addition, power on the Eurasian landmass has since the end of the Second World War shifted east. Prior to World War II, the threats to the global balance of power emerged from the Rimland. From 1945 to 1989–91, the threat emanated from the Heartland. Today, the threat from China touches both Heartland and Rimland, especially if China’s naval power continues to grow and the current Sino-Russian strategic relationship continues and intensifies.

Both Robert D. Kaplan and Daniel Yergin, whose writings are in the tradition of Mackinder, Spykman, and Mahan, have issued thoughtful warnings about the geopolitics of Eurasia. Kaplan, in a geopolitical masterpiece titled “The Return of Marco Polo’s World,” which was originally written a few years ago for the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment, noted China’s ambitious efforts “to build a land bridge across Central and West Asia to Europe, and a maritime network across the Indian Ocean from East Asia to the Middle East.” That is the geopolitical essence of the Belt and Road Initiative. Russia, meanwhile, views “the Greater Middle East and Central-Eastern Europe” as its sphere of influence. Both China and Russia, he writes, “have influence of increasing imperial dimensions” and are “Eurasia’s principal hinge states.”

Yergin in his new book The New Map, a brilliant analysis of the interrelationship of energy resources and geopolitics, warns about the “strategic partnership between Russia and China” in the context of China’s “advance into Central Asia.” The Sino-Russian partnership reflects the two Eurasian giants’ shared interests in commercial relations and geopolitical opposition to the United States. Yergin describes it as an updated version of the old Sino-Soviet bloc of the early 1950s, with China as the leading power and without the ideological baggage that led to their political split in the late 1950s to early 1960s.

Kaplan, echoing Mahan and Spykman, urges the United States to use sea power and its sea power allies — Britain, India, Australia, Japan — to strategically envelop the Eurasian Rimland. “Here,” Kaplan writes, “is where the ideas of Alfred Thayer Mahan meet those of Halford Mackinder.” It was Mackinder, after all, who wrote in Britain and the British Seas that the “unity of the ocean is the simple physical fact underlying the dominant value of sea-power in the modern globe-wide world.”

Long ago, Mackinder, Mahan, and Spykman all recognized that China — given its size, resources, population, and geographic location — could and likely would become a Eurasian than a global power. In 1904, Mackinder expressed concern that China with its long eastern coast and in effective control of the Heartland would “add an oceanic frontage to the resources of the great continent and thereby combine land and sea power.” Three years earlier, Mahan in The Problem of Asia worried that “the vast mass of China” could become the dominant Asian power. And in 1944 in The Geography of the Peace, Spykman envisioned China emerging from the Second World War as a global power.

But geography alone does not tell the whole story. As Mackinder wrote in 1904, “The actual balance of political power at any given time is . . the product … of geographical conditions, both economic and strategic, and … of the relative number, virility, equipment, and organization of the competing peoples.”

Today’s U.S.–China relationship involves a multifaceted competition — economic, military, diplomatic, strategic — that takes place in a geographic context. As recent events demonstrate, the competition cannot be wished away and is intensifying almost daily. The stakes are great — nothing less than global leadership. To win this competition, the United States needs to play to its strong suit — naval power, alliances, diplomacy, the cause of freedom, and steadfastness in a “long twilight struggle.”

Faced with a similar challenge from the Soviet Union more than 70 years ago, the diplomat and historian George F. Kennan wrote that the American people “will experience a certain gratitude to a Providence” for providing an “implacable challenge” that will force them to pull themselves together and accept “the responsibilities of moral and political leadership that history plainly intended them to bear.”

Chinagate and the Clintons - The American Spectator,"When Senator Tim Kaine on Tuesday denied that there was any corruption at the Clinton Foundation, I couldn’t believe it. That was unquestionably one of the most dishonest things I ever seen in a presidential debate. Even Bill Clinton had promised that, if Hillary got elected, there would be no more foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation.

Another reason I don’t believe Kaine is that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) illegally received foreign donations from China when Bill Clinton was president. This scandal was called Chinagate.

For people who think I am being unfair, I will only use links to liberal sources such as the New York Times and the Washington Post to prove my points.

Chinagate, more than any other scandal, should have led to the impeachment, and removal, of Bill Clinton from office. At least six individuals were believed to have been used by the Chinese to influence the 1996 elections. Despite the fact that the illegal donations were returned, Janet Reno was criticized for never appointing an independent prosecutor for the Chinagate scandal.

Here’s a quick overview of the six in question and their associates.

Johnny Chung

In 1996, then Senator John Kerry was in a tough re-election fight against Republican Governor Bill Weld. In July, Kerry met with businessman Johnny Chung and his Chinese partner Liu Chaoying. Johnny was born in Taiwan and later became an American citizen.

When John Kerry met with them in his Washington office, he had no idea that Liu Chaoying was a Lt. Colonel in the People’s Liberation Army.

Johnny Chung told Kerry that Liu wanted one of her companies listed on the Stock Exchange. Senator Kerry’s people were happy to help and immediately sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

On September 9, 1996, Johnny Chung helped organize a fundraiser for Kerry in Beverly Hills. This was undoubtedly pay-for-play.

Around the same time, Liu Chaoying would wire $300,000 to Johnny Chung. Liu put that money into Chung’s Hong Kong bank account after she introduced him to Chinese General Ji Shengde.

Johnny Chung testified before Congress that in the summer of 1996, Ji Shengde told Chung, “We really like your president. We hope he will get reelected.… I will give you 300,000 U.S. dollars. You can give it to… your president and Democrat Party.”

Chung used most of that money to pay for his business expenses and sent the remaining $35,000 to the Democratic National Committee. Shortly after Chung’s testimony, Ji Shengde was reassigned from the head of Chinese military intelligence to the Academy of Military Science. In the United States, that would be the equivalent of the head of the NSA being reassigned to teach political science at a university.

Beyond the $35,000 from the Chinese government, the DNC was forced to return all of the money that Chung had donated to them ($366,000).

There is no way that this money could have been authorized without the full knowledge of the Chinese government. Liu Chaoying was the daughter of General Liu Huaqing (1916-2011). In China, the sons and daughters of important government officials are known as taizidang or princelings. They use their connections to allow businessmen access to China. They would never risk their family’s privileged status especially when there are many other profitable deals with less political risk.

At the time Liu Chaoying was giving money to Johnny Chung, her father was serving as the Vice Chairman of China’s Central Military Commission. General Liu was a dedicated communist. He participated in the Long March with Mao. He would later be regarded as the “father of the modern Chinese Navy.”

In 1982-1987, he was the commander of the People’s Liberation Army Navy. From 1992 to 1997, he was on the Politburo Standing Committee as well as the Vice Chairman of the China’s Central Military Commission.

Last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping honored General Liu’s accomplishments in honor of his 100th birthday. In his obituary (he died in 2011 at 94), the New York Times mentioned General Liu’s accomplishments in modernizing the Chinese Navy, but did not mention his daughter’s role in transferring money to the Democratic National Committee.

Johnny Chung first met the Clintons in 1992. From 1994 to 1996, Chung visited the White House 49 times. Nearly half of those visits were authorized by the office of the First Lady. In one visit, Hillary met with Chung and his visiting delegation of Chinese businessmen from state-run companies.

In one visit, Chung paid the DNC $50,000. In exchange, Chung was allowed to bring some of his investors to see the president deliver one of his radio addresses.

John Huang, Mochtar Riady, and James Riady

In 1996, John Huang would raise $3.4 million for the Democratic Party. More than half of this money was returned because some of these donations were foreign.

In 1980, John Huang met Mochtar Riady at an event in Little Rock, Arkansas. The featured speaker was then-Governor Bill Clinton. Riady’s son, James, would later hire Huang at one of his companies. At the same time, Huang would serve as a fundraiser for Clinton’s 1992 campaign. He became an expert in fundraising among different Asian-American communities.

In late 1993, Clinton appointed Huang to serve as deputy assistant secretary for international economic affairs at the Commerce Department. Huang got a severance package of $750,000 from the Lippo Group (below). In 1995, Clinton recommended him to work at the DNC.

In 1996, approximately $1 million in donations to the Democrats were from people with close ties to the Lippo Group. One of them was Hashim Ning who was a business partner with the Riady family. Hashim sent $500,000 to his daughter Soraya and his son-in-law Arief Wiriadinata. From November 1995 to July 1996, they donated $450,000 to the DNC.

Mochtar Riady was the son of Chinese immigrants who came from modest circumstances and founded the Lippo Group, a conglomerate in real estate, insurance, and banking. By 1996, the company had over $12 billion in assets.

Mochtar had three sons. The youngest was James and he first met Bill Clinton in the late 1970s. He contributed money to Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign. The Lippo Group had many projects in China. A peaceful and stable U.S.-China relationship was in the interests of the Lippo Group.

In its report in 1998, the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs noted that both Mochtar and James Riady “have had a long-term relationship with a Chinese intelligence agency.” James Riady was also in the Oval Office on September 13, 1995 when Bill Clinton authorized the transfer of Huang to the DNC. In September 1996, James Riady was again in the Oval Office with Clinton lobbying for better trade relations with China.

According to White House logs, James Riady visited the White House 20 times and met with President Clinton on six of those visits. At the time, Clinton’s top aide, Bruce Lindsey, tried to spin that Riady’s visits were social calls. It was only after the election that White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry admitted that the meetings involved substantive conversations, including about American foreign policy in Asia.

Ted Sioeng

In 1997, Attorney General Janet Reno, FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, CIA Director George J. Tenet and NSA Director Kenneth A. Minihan testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee about Ted Sioeng. They claimed to have credible information that this Los Angeles-based Chinese Indonesian businessman intended to influence the 1996 elections. Through family members and his businesses, he donated $250,000 to the DNC. This money was returned.

Maria Hsia

After the 1988 election, Al Gore met Maria Hsia who organized a trip for him to Taiwan. She would later help with his campaigns, including the 1996 campaign. According to the Justice Department, Hsia raised $100,000 in illegal contributions for the Clinton-Gore 1996 campaign. Since foreigners could not provide donations to the campaign, she used monks and nuns at the Hsi Lai Temple as straw donors. The donors that were citizens used the monks in order to give beyond their contribution limits. Hsia had strong ties to Huang and Riady.

Yah Linh “Charlie” Trie and Ng Lap Seng

Charlie Trie owned a restaurant in Little Rock that was frequented by his friend then-Governor Bill Clinton. After Clinton won the presidency, Trie went to Washington to cash out on their friendship. He thought his association could help him develop more business contacts in Asia. One of them was Hong Kong businessman Ng Lap Seng. Seng would wire a million dollars to Trie. From 1994 to 1996, Trie directly sent $200,000 to the DNC. Trie provided the rest of the money to other people who later sent that money to the DNC. Trie also helped raised another $640,000 for Bill Clinton’s Legal Defense Fund.

According to the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, 94 people were called to testify, including the six people in this article. Of the 94, 57 invoked the Fifth Amendment, 18 fled the country, and 19 foreign witnesses refused to testify. Here is a link to the full list.

Bill and Hillary Clinton continued this pattern of getting foreign donations from unethical businessmen with the Clinton Foundation. If they get into office, there is truly no line Bill and Hillary Clinton won’t cross.

For all the condemnation about Trump’s tax returns, remember that Trump obeyed the law. If you don’t like the law, change it. The Clintons didn’t bother to change campaign finance laws. Laws were broken in the Chinagate scandal.

Tim Kaine and other Democrats want to argue that Donald Trump would be a puppet of Putin when it was Bill Clinton who received speaking fees abroad from the Russians and plenty of other countries.

Bill Clinton was a paid $500,000 to give a speech in Moscow after Hillary Clinton’s State Department approved a deal that gave the Russians control of one-fifth of America’s uranium capacity. When the state-run Rosatom bought Uranium One, Hillary should have said that Ian Telfer, the chairman of Uranium One, donated $2.35 million dollars that made its way to the Clinton Foundation. The Clinton Foundation failed to disclose this donation.

Trump saying nice things about Putin is not the same as giving Russia one-fifth of our uranium reserves. After more than twenty years of watching the Clintons, there can be no other conclusion that their capacity for corruption is limitless. Chinagate was brazen enough, but since then they’ve never looked back.",https://spectator.org/china-and-iran-axis-of-evil-2-0/,2016-10-06
China’s Approach to Taiwan: Rhetoric vs. Reality - The American Spectator,"Just one day after China sent 71 warplanes and seven warships toward Taiwan, the National Interest published a propaganda piece by China’s ambassador to the United States, Qin Gang, that pledged “mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.” At least 47 of China’s warplanes crossed the median of the Taiwan Strait in what People’s Liberation Army spokesman Shi Yi called a “firm response to the current U.S.-Taiwan escalation and provocation.”

This show of force follows a series of military drills that China conducted last week near southern Okinawa that involved China’s aircraft carrier Liaoning, two destroyers, and a frigate, as well as 180 carrier-based fighter jets and helicopters. Yet Qin Gang writes that “China is committed to its foreign policy goals of upholding world peace and promoting common development, and it remains dedicated to building a community with a shared future for mankind.” And the ambassador warns that viewing the world from a “democracy vs. authoritarianism perspective” will result in a world of “division, competition, and conflict.”

Qin Gang writes that the “tension across the Taiwan Strait was not created by the Chinese mainland breaking the status quo, but by ‘Taiwan independence’ separatists and external forces [i.e. the United States] continually challenging the status quo of ‘one China,’” while it is Japan, not China, that is attempting to alter the status quo in the East China Sea. This rhetoric from the ambassador of a country that has constructed islands to serve as military bases in the South China Sea, declared that sea to be part of China per its so-called nine-dash line, and is engaging in a massive conventional and nuclear weapons buildup, is evidence of what James Burnham in The Machiavellians explained as the difference between the “formal” and “real” meaning of words and phrases.

Burnham began The Machiavellians with an analysis of the Democratic Party’s platform in 1932 and Dante Alighieri’s 14th-century work De Monarchia. In both instances, the “real” meaning of the words and phrases was disguised by the “formal” meaning. The Democrats of 1932 rhetorically committed themselves to a balanced budget and a sound currency, but that formal meaning of the words disguised the real meaning, which was the Democrats wanted to control the budget and the currency. Similarly, Dante in De Monarchia promotes the notion of “universal peace, salvation, a unified world government,” but in reality he is promoting one side in a conflict over who is to rule Florence. The formal words, Burnham explained, told us nothing and should be assessed only in the context of the political or geopolitical situation of the time.

Qin Gang’s rhetoric in the National Interest should be viewed according to Burnham’s “formal” and “real” meaning dichotomy. He formally writes about “upholding world peace,” but the real meaning of those words in the context of China’s actions is a world peace with China in control of Taiwan. He formally writes of promoting “common development,” but the real meaning of those words is spreading China’s economic and political influence by economic means per China’s Belt and Road Initiative. His formal warning about viewing the world as a struggle between democracy and authoritarianism hides the real meaning, which is to convince the United States to accept a China-led autocratic world order, i.e., Xi Jinping’s “China Dream.”

The “formal” meaning of Ambassador Qin’s article is what Burnham called a “systemic distortion of the truth.” We experienced this all throughout the Cold War with the Soviet Union, whose leaders and spokespersons repeatedly pledged “peaceful coexistence” while waging ideological and geopolitical war against the citadel of capitalism. “In the hands of the powerful and their spokesmen,” Burnham wrote, “… this method [of communication] is well designed … to deceive us, and to lead us by easy routes to the sacrifice of our own interests.”

The ancient Chinese strategist Sun Tzu taught that it was the acme of skill to subdue an enemy without fighting. We would be wise and prudent to view and listen to what Chinese leaders write and say but only in the context of their actions, which, as we know, speak louder than words.

China’s Belt and Road Initiative Expands to Cuba - The American Spectator,"With so much attention being paid to China’s increasing threat to Taiwan in the South China Sea, under the radar the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is deepening ties to Cuba’s communist regime. On Nov. 25, 2022, President Xi Jinping hosted Cuba’s communist leader Miguel Díaz-Canel at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. China’s foreign ministry announced that, at the end of their talks, Xi and Díaz-Canel “witnessed the signing of bilateral documents on party-to-party exchange, the consultation mechanism between the two foreign ministries, Belt and Road cooperation and practical cooperation.” So, while China claims ownership over the South China Sea and Taiwan in its version of an Asian Monroe Doctrine, it takes steps to weaken America’s Monroe Doctrine in the Caribbean Sea and the Western Hemisphere.

The Chinese foreign ministry statement highlighted the fact that Cuba’s president “is the first head of state from Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) to visit China after the 20th CPC National Congress,” which “speaks volumes about the special and friendly relations between the two parties and two countries.” The statement pledged to work with Cuba on the Global Development and Global Security initiatives and stressed that the two nations will “jointly advance the socialist modernization drive.” China, the statement continued, “attaches great importance to the development of its relations with” Latin American and Caribbean countries, including “high-quality Belt and Road cooperation.”

An article in the Global Times, the CCP’s English-language mouthpiece, noted that China–Cuban cooperation will include “fields such as electronics, machinery manufacturing, textiles, energy, agriculture, information and communication, infrastructure construction, genetic engineering, medical and health” as part of construction of a “Digital Silk Road” and a “Health Silk Road.”

Another Global Times article heralded the “pink tide” that Latin America is currently experiencing in opposition to America’s antagonism toward the hemisphere’s “left-wing” governments. Cuba and other Latin American countries, the article claims, are “tired of [the United States’] hegemony and coercion.”

The Associated Press reported that the Chinese and Cuban leaders “pledged mutual support over their fellow communist states’ ‘core interests,’” noting that China defines core interests to include control over Taiwan.

Cuba’s leader met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow prior to his visit with Xi. China and Russia have established what both countries call a “strategic partnership” in opposition to the U.S.-led global order.

Newsmax reports that China agreed to restructure Cuba’s debt and to provide trade and investment credits to Cuba’s struggling economy.

In the past, China has used the BRI to coerce and force cooperation from economically vulnerable countries, securing access to, and sometimes ownership over, port facilities, along with unrestricted People’s Liberation Army (PLA) access.

One observer termed China’s BRI as “debt-trap diplomacy,” while the Asia Society Policy Institute (ASPI) accuses Xi of “weaponizing” the BRI.

“Beijing’s approach,” according to an ASPI report, “seeks to lay the groundwork for military utilization without raising red flags,” then gradually use its economic leverage to persuade or force recipient nations to accommodate military platforms.

Writing last year in the online journal 19FortyFive, Naval War College strategy professor James Holmes asked, “Will China trigger the Monroe Doctrine?”

Holmes noted that Chinese inroads in Latin America were “real and growing.” He suggested that if Latin American governments begin siding with China and if China translates its BRI economic leverage into a military threat, the U.S. Monroe Doctrine could make a comeback.

The United States went to war in Cuba against Spain as a result of the Monroe Doctrine. We intervened countless times in Latin America and the Caribbean when we perceived overt challenges to the Monroe Doctrine. We engaged in nuclear brinkmanship with the Soviet Union over Cuba in October 1962 in defense of the Monroe Doctrine. It would behoove U.S. policymakers to keep a watchful eye on developments in the Caribbean and Latin America, even as we focus on the more immediate threat in the South China Sea.",https://spectator.org/china-and-the-sound-of-silence/,2022-11-28
China’s ‘Birthday Gift’ for Hong Kong - The American Spectator,"On the eve of the anniversary of the Hong Kong handover, China’s rubber-stamp legislature finally revealed the national-security bill that it had been conceiving since late May. The executive deputy director of Beijing’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office sardonically referred to it as a “birthday gift” for the besieged territory. It is, in reality, a revocation of freedoms more severe than even the most pessimistic analysts had predicted.

The Communist Party had already run out of patience over a month ago, when it began forcibly removing pro-democracy lawmakers during votes before announcing a plan to impose China’s national-security laws on Hong Kong — a violation of the one country, two systems model that China had guaranteed for the city during the handover.

The bill outlines a series of basic crimes tailored to be applicable to the recent protests, including terrorism, subversion, secession, and collusion (or treason). These charges will cover everything from graffiti to calling for Hong Kong’s independence or waving the American flag, and all four categories carry sentences of up to life in prison.

For particularly “serious” cases, the bill also permits the government to send Hong Kongers to the mainland for trial, where more punishments up to and including execution may apply. It is difficult to read this clause as being anything but an intentional provocation of protesters: the unrest had begun in the first place in 2019 because of a planned extradition bill. Early on, city leaders had withdrawn the legislation in the hopes that it would appease protesters. With the protests failing to abate, Beijing has brought extradition back with a vengeance.

In addition to the new laws, under which arrests are already being made, the bill calls for additional regulation of Hong Kong’s information infrastructure: universities, news media, social media, and the internet more broadly. Hong Kong remains the only place within China with anything approaching Western standards of free speech and access to the open internet. The CCP understands that these institutions are the main incubators of the city’s political opposition to Beijing. As with modern Western authoritarianism, the playbook is the same: take over the discourse and then raise a pliable generation of citizens.

Sensing that the end is near for the city’s autonomy, Hong Kong’s residents have begun departing in large numbers for greener pastures. Among these emigrants are some of the pro-democracy camp’s most high-profile advocates and leaders, including Nathan Law, who gave online testimony to Congress before fleeing. Some leaders, such as the 23-year-old Joshua Wong, disbanded their organizations out of fear that they or their followers might face imminent arrest.

A note on asylum offers

Multiple Western governments have reacted to the imminent loss of Hong Kong’s independence by extending offers of asylum and even citizenship to large portions of Hong Kong’s population. A bipartisan group of senators recently introduced the Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act, which would allow many protesters to come to the U.S. as refugees without counting toward the Trump administration’s refugee cap. Australia, likewise, has signaled that it is willing to act as a haven for Hong Kongers.

The country that has gone the furthest to extend an offer of assistance is the UK, which had sovereignty over the territory up until 1997 and whose government clearly still feels some degree of obligation to protect the rights of Hong Kongers. Boris Johnson’s plan would allow up to three million of the city’s residents — almost half of Hong Kong’s population — to settle in the UK for five years, after which they would be able to apply for citizenship.

While the support of these governments for the plight of Hong Kongers deserves to be applauded, such asylum offers are sure to be divisive among conservatives at a sensitive time. Donald Trump and Boris Johnson were both brought into power largely due to concern about immigration. Few people in the world deserve asylum as much as Hong Kong’s activists, but suddenly extending citizenship offers to three million foreigners would be irresponsible, not to mention politically dangerous.

A sensible middle ground would be Taiwan. The island has been unwavering in its support for Hong Kong and is now crafting a comprehensive plan to provide housing, residency, and work for refugees from the city. Beyond the small language barrier (southern Chinese mainly speak Cantonese, whereas Taiwanese speak Mandarin), there should be little problem integrating Hong Kongers with a shared interest in resisting Beijing’s aggression. From there, the spirit of freedom in Hong Kong can be kept alive.",https://spectator.org/china-anoints-its-new-ceo/,2020-07-05
China’s Bloody Taiwan Procedure - The American Spectator,"It all reminds me of July 1, 1987 when President Ronald Reagan nominated Judge Robert Bork for an opening on the Supreme Court. He had it made in the shade, said my complacent conservative friends. The result was brutal. But we do not have to look back 32 years to see how unruly the leftwing mob can be. Recall the recent fate of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Only his courage and unscotchable determinate saved him. The simple fact is that the conservatives are often slow on the draw against the American left. Only the Wall Street Journal and the intrepid New York Sun have come out swinging for Moore. It is time for the conservatives to rally around him. He can probably win with the President on his side. He apparently has the votes. Yet the coming battle would be a lot less bloody if the conservative movement were to take the field on Moore’s behalf — and make it clear that from now on they are going to wage war for the President’s nominees.

China’s Cashless Revolution - The American Spectator,"The Cashless Revolution: China’s Reinvention of Money and the End of America’s Domination of Finance and Technology

By Martin Chorzempa

(PublicAffairs, 320 pages, $29)

In The Cashless Revolution: China’s Reinvention of Money and the End of America’s Domination of Finance and Technology, Martin Chorzempa masterfully chronicles China’s transformation from a cash-centric, sclerotic, state-dominated financial backwater to a nation with a vibrant, cutting-edge electronic payment and financial system.

The title is a bit hyperbolic, as Chorzempa doesn’t make a compelling case that America’s domination of finance, technology, and payments is at risk. He does, however, make a powerful argument for the benefits of competition and light regulation, which can spur and enable innovation in payments and fintech — a lesson American and European policymakers would do well to heed.

China’s fintech revolution was driven by a combination of galling need; great visionary and opportunistic entrepreneurs, like Jack Ma and Pony Ma; regulatory forbearance; political air cover for liberalizing regulators; and the advent of enabling platform technology, such as mobile smartphones.

In 1978, the People’s Bank of China was the Middle Kingdom’s only bank. By 2002, massive state banks dominated the financial sector. There was one state-protected monopoly card network: China UnionPay. The overwhelming majority of payments were cash. Financial repression reigned, with state banks offering de minimis interest for savers and meager investment alternatives.

While the Chinese Communist Party never ceded power, it did loosen the reins, creating space for private-sector enterprise. For a spell, laissez-faire regulators such as then–People’s Bank of China Gov. Zhou Xiaochuan permitted fintech innovation and competition, hoping it would force state banks to perform better. In some cases, laws weren’t enforced against favored companies viewed as critical to China’s payments and fintech revolution. For example, a ban against QR-based payments wasn’t enforced they were launched by e-commerce titan Alibaba’s payment system, Alipay.

In 2012, Premier Wen Jiabao invited private firms to take on state monopolies. In 2014, Premier Li Keqiang said fintech should be promoted. The great captains of Sino-fintech got the regulatory and legal forbearance they needed, for a spell.

The author observes approvingly that China’s fintechs enjoyed “the world’s largest regulatory pilot program, or sandbox.” China’s great fintech pioneers made hay while it rained.

The visionary entrepreneurs Alibaba founder Jack Ma and Tencent founder Pony Ma learned from what did and didn’t work in the U.S., knew the Chinese market, and were acutely aware of and pushed the boundaries of their regulatory sandbox and political cover.

Tencent and Alibaba’s fintech spinoff Ant Financial, now Ant Group, had a revolutionary impact on payments, the financial sector writ large, and how Chinese citizens managed their quotidian lives. Ma and Ma were the most prominent and consequential of the wave of fintech entrepreneurs who challenged China’s stodgy, state-bank-dominated financial system. State banks and the card monopoly China UnionPay were terrific foils for Tencent and Ant Financial in developing electronic-payment systems and a rich constellation of complementary services, which ultimately evolved into “super apps.”

Potentially powerful foreign competitors like Mastercard and Visa were kept out of the market. And better capitalized and established foreign competitors such as eBay were wrongfooted by the nimbler Alibaba, which enjoyed superior local-market knowledge.

Online gaming and chat colossus Tencent and e-commerce giant Alibaba were pathbreakers in payments. Tencent launched first a digital currency, Q Coin, and later a digital wallet and payment system, which ultimately became WeChat Pay. And as Alibaba’s Alipay expanded payments off the company’s platforms online and at the physical point of sale, additional services were added, including Yu’e Bao, which became the world’s biggest mutual fund and a major provider of insurance, credit, ride-hailing, bill payment, and credit scoring. Jockeying with Tencent, the two mobile-payment dragons relentlessly enhanced the scope and reach of their platforms, putting state banks and UnionPay on their backheels.

China’s super apps have been held up as the future of fintech. Neither Alipay nor WeChat Pay, however, has gotten significant traction as a super app outside China.

In the mature U.S. market, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, and Square’s Cash App aspire to become more super-appish. None, however, are anywhere close to becoming comprehensive dashboards with which consumers can manage their lives.

Chorzempa notes that China’s initial hands-off approach to regulating developing fintech sectors permitted more experimentation with new models than did the U.S. He explains, “In some cases … it made sense to let an industry get on its feet before imposing regulation.” If the risks aren’t systemic, why not? Risks to the financial system are most likely to be systemic with government-controlled or protected systems, not with private-sector challengers.

Jack Ma rightly observed that “innovation is bound to make mistakes … [T]here is no risk-free innovation.” With regulators holding back, there were excesses and failures. Chorzempa calls out the Middle Kingdom’s peer-to-peer lending bubble, which was chock full of fraud, as exemplified by Ding Ning’s Ezubao.

Allowing failure enables innovation.

Chorzempa is impressed by and worries about the People’s Bank of China’s digital currency. Its innovation model couldn’t be more different than Alipay’s and WeChat Pay’s. It’s state planned.

It’s intended to make China’s payment system more efficient, to displace anonymous physical cash, to enable surveilling Chinese citizens, and, longer-term, to make China less dependent on the global dollar-based financial system.

American and European Central Bank Digital Currency evangelists warn that the digital yuan is a threat and reason to develop Central Bank Digital Currencies. Thus far, however, the e-yuan hasn’t been successful. Xie Ping, the former People’s Bank of China director-general of research, described the e-yuan’s results as disappointing. He explained, “The cumulative circulation of the digital yuan in the two years of the trial has been only 100 billion yuan ($14 billion),” saying that usage was “low” and “highly inactive.” The digital yuan doesn’t solve a burning problem, but Alipay and WeChat Pay provide ubiquitous convenient digital payments. And for those who want to make and receive anonymous payments, physical cash is preferable to the e-renminbi.

The U.S. dollar is the world’s reserve currency. The yuan is a distant No. 5. A FEDS Note, “The International Role of the Dollar,” reports an aggregate index of international currency usage over the last 20 years. King Dollar’s index hovered around 75. The euro was a distant No. 2 at 25. While the yuan’s index increased, it’s still No. 3.

The dollar is a crushingly stronger global network than the yuan and e-yuan. The renminbi isn’t freely convertible. Non-Chinese businesses won’t use the digital yuan unless they’re subject to U.S. financial sanctions and/or forced to by Beijing.

King Dollar and dominant Western payment systems such as Mastercard, SWIFT, and Visa aren’t at near-term risk.

Chorzempa marvels at the power and risks of consumer data harvested by China’s super apps.

Ant and Tencent hoover up enormous user data invaluable for marketing and credit and insurance underwriting. The Chinese government at the national and local levels during the COVID-19 pandemic used the super apps to track and manage individuals. Chinese national and local governments use “social credit” systems to punish disapproved activity and restrict blacklisted individuals’ ability to get government benefits, find jobs, travel, and stay in hotels. Chorzempa observes that Chinese consumers have some data protections but that the CCP’s increased use of data to monitor citizens is chilling.

The liberalization window started to close in 2016, if not earlier. However, this was long after Tencent’s WeChat Pay and Ant’s Alipay had achieved network critical mass and become indispensable in most consumers’ quotidian lives.

Jack Ma’s ascent from English teacher to revered, pathbreaking entrepreneur and China’s richest man, and his humbling denouement, embody Chorzempa’s story.

Ma gave a speech on Oct. 24, 2020, at the Bund Finance Summit in Shanghai in which he derided China’s financial system as unhealthy and criticized regulators for suppressing innovation. Unlike in the U.S. and the U.K., in Red China, CEOs and entrepreneurs, no matter how prominent, are not free to criticize government policy without fear of retribution.

Beijing reacted swiftly. Ant Financial’s IPO, which was on track to be the biggest ever, was canceled by Emperor Xi.

For years, conservative regulators chafed at captains of fintech like Jack Ma being protected. Given the green light, regulators moved. Ma disappeared for several months. Fortunately, he didn’t get the Khodorkovsky treatment.

Wishful thinking that a semi-liberal economic order would endure and was compatible with CCP rule has been shattered.

While American and European payments and financial services industries are more mature than China’s circa the early 2000s, there are lessons to be learned from the Middle Kingdom’s “cashless revolution.” Light regulation permitting experimentation and failure spurs innovation. Jack Ma says that trying to manage “risk down to zero is the biggest risk.”

Chorzempa’s Cashless Revolution is a page turner that policymakers, payment-industry practitioners, and interested laymen all would enjoy and benefit from.

China’s Challenge to the Monroe Doctrine - The American Spectator,"Time magazine reported earlier this year that China is South America’s top trading partner. Chinese companies, according to correspondents Ciara Nugent and Charlie Campbell, invested nearly $13 billion in Latin America in 2019, while China is a major consumer of Latin American exports, purchasing “beef from Uruguay, copper from Chile, oil from Colombia, and soya from Brazil.” State-controlled Chinese tech companies (Huawei, ZTE, Dahua, Hikvision) have made inroads in Latin America, Time reports, that will allow “Beijing to dictate the rules of commerce for a generation.” And China’s political influence has spread to the Caribbean Sea and Central America, where the Dominican Republic, Panama, and El Salvador switched their formal recognition from Taiwan to China.

More recently, Thiago de Aragao, a director of a leading public affairs company in Latin America, writing in the Diplomat, explained that China has established economic dependency in several Latin American countries, including Brazil and Argentina. China’s approach to Latin America, he writes, involves “multiple actors within the firm and unambiguous leadership of the Chinese Communist Party [which] instructs Chinese companies and government organizations to develop ties with municipalities, state governments, and companies linked to sectors of interest.” This approach turns Latin American elites into sources of Chinese influence.

China’s growing influence in the region led Foreign Policy to title a recent article, “Can the United States Rival China in Latin America?” Axios reported that Ecuador’s ambassador to Washington has warned that the United States “is losing Latin America to China without putting up a fight.”

Meanwhile, in National Defense, Dr. R. Evan Ellis, a specialist on Latin America at the U.S. Army War College, reports that China’s military “has become increasingly active in the region.” Chinese warships make port calls and conduct military exercises in Latin America. Chinese defense companies provide defense-related equipment to security forces in the region. Ellis concludes that “China’s engagement with Latin America presents multiple strategic perils” for the United States. One such strategic peril involves the Panama Canal, where Chinese companies have been busy with infrastructure projects, including at important ports at both ends of the still strategic canal.

What happened to the Monroe Doctrine?

On December 2, 1823, President James Monroe issued a statement to Congress — largely written by Secretary of State John Quincy Adams — that became known as the Monroe Doctrine. It is one of the most important and lasting geopolitical doctrines in U.S. history. The key passage of the president’s statement warned the powers of Europe against attempting to “extend their political system to any portion of either continent [in the Western Hemisphere].” Such an effort on their part, Monroe continued, would endanger “our peace and happiness.” The United States, the message boldly proclaimed, could not be “indifferent” to efforts by other powers to extend their political power to any portion of the Western Hemisphere.

The Monroe Doctrine was a bold proclamation mainly because at that time we did not possess the naval power to effectively enforce it. But Great Britain did. Later, when the U.S. acquired a suitable navy, the American theorist of sea power Alfred Thayer Mahan wrote in 1903 that the Monroe Doctrine was “a product of national interest … and of national power.” “The virtue of the Monroe Doctrine,” Mahan explained, is that it corresponds “with the national necessities of the United States.”

Mahan explained the geopolitical importance of the Monroe Doctrine as follows:

It is considered by the United States essential to her interests and peace to withstand the beginnings of action which might lead to European intervention in the internal concerns of an American State, or render it contributive in any way to the European system, a makeweight in the balance of power, a pawn in the game of … international politics.

“The United States,” Mahan proclaimed, “is inevitably the preponderant American power.”

In the late 19th century and throughout the 20th century, American presidents and statesmen invoked the Monroe Doctrine to justify armed intervention in the Western Hemisphere — from the Spanish-American War in 1898, to interventions in Mexico by the Wilson administration, to Eisenhower’s covert action in Guatemala in the 1950s, to the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 and subsequent efforts to assassinate Fidel Castro, to the invasion of the Dominican Republic in the mid-1960s, to the response to the construction of a Soviet naval facility at the Cuban port of Cienfuegos in 1970, to the covert overthrow of Salvador Allende in Chile in the early 1970s, to the interventions in El Salvador and Nicaragua, and the invasions of Grenada and Panama in the 1980s. Not every U.S. intervention was wise or prudent, but they all originated from a common strategic outlook — that the United States should maintain its preponderant power and political influence in its own hemisphere.

You don’t have to go all the way back to Mahan to find strategists who appreciate the continuing significance of the Monroe Doctrine. A few years ago in Small Wars Journal, two naval officers and an air force officer wrote an article entitled “The Monroe Doctrine in 21st Century Great Power Competition,” in which they noted China’s growing influence in the Western Hemisphere and concluded that “The original purpose of President Monroe’s statement is still relevant today. The United States should be concerned about external powers taking actions in the Western Hemisphere that could affect U.S. peace and security.”

In 2013, then Secretary of State John Kerry foolishly declared that the Monroe Doctrine was dead — effectively giving a green light to other powers to extend their influence to the Western Hemisphere. Five years later, President Trump’s Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told a reporter that the Monroe Doctrine “is as relevant today, as it was the day it was written.” The following year, President Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the Monroe Doctrine was very much alive and well. It may be alive, but it is not well — as noted above, China is challenging it even as it declares its own version of the Monroe Doctrine in the South China Sea; that’s what the nine-dash line, the creation of military-capable islands, the growth of the PLA Navy, and the impending annexation of Taiwan are all about. These are dangerous times — very dangerous.",https://spectator.org/china-biden-alaska/,2021-10-22
China’s Coming Crisis Will Not Be Capitalism’s - The American Spectator,"Conservatives should prepare for China being the next big economic crisis. While they cannot stop it, they can prepare for the left’s predictable response. Liberals seek to use every economic crisis to tarnish capitalism and increase government control of the private sector. Because of China’s claimed duality of communism and capitalism, liberals will be particularly focused on steering blame from where it should lie.

Despite China’s latest quarterly economic growth coming in at 6.9%, there are troubles aplenty on China’s horizon. Government growth rates only mask China’s real problem — government’s direct participation in the economy.

Certainly, 6.9% growth seems robust. The U.S.’s latest quarterly rate was 2.1%, while Japan’s was 1.3% and the EU’s 1.9%. However, by Chinese standards, the economy is slowing. Last year it officially grew 6.7% — a 26-year low. This year’s projection is lower still: 6.5%.

Nor is confidence high in official figures. In general, government officials need the economy to do well and look for ways to show it is. This is especially so for China. A communist state, it has a far bigger stake in the economy — its economy.

So government growth numbers tend to be taken with more than a grain of salt — perhaps, a shaker’s worth. These numbers are not simply questionable, but often reflect unproductive investment as well.

China’s stake in the economy is also not just figurative — but decidedly literal. Despite the government’s “deal” with capitalism, much of the economy is state-owned. State-owned-enterprises (SOEs), and mixed SOEs — a combination of public and private ownership — account for a large percentage of the nation’s economic activity.

Unsurprisingly, corporations in which the government has a large share also get a large share of government largesse — access to credit and regulatory approval, both at favorable terms. Separated from market mechanisms on the input side, they are equally separated on the output side. SOEs’ average return on assets is often well below their cost of capital.

Together these pieces form a troubling puzzle. An admittedly slowing economy, in a communist government with an outsized incentive to produce data showing continued growth, where an extremely large part is in very unproductive enterprises.

Little wonder there is a pervading sense that more lies below the surface in nonperforming loans, speculation, and outright fraud. Think the U.S. housing crisis, except on a far broader scale. When the cracks finally appear, they will reverberate globally — and in China’s case, not just economically but ideologically.

Worldwide, the left will have an enhanced reason for the crisis trail to lead away from “the state” and toward the “capitalism” of “state capitalism.” Liberals will try to argue the tail is wagging the dog. As usual, they will claim capitalism is inherently predatory — not just to others, but to itself — and must be controlled. For them, China will not be contradiction but validation: Even here, capitalism unleashes forces too dangerous to control.

However, when China’s impending economic crisis arrives, the left’s arguments will not hold, and conservatives must be ready to show they do not.

In contrast to liberals’ argument that more regulation is always the answer, the epicenter of China’s economic crisis — the state-run part — will have had been nothing but state regulation at every level — in oversight, in lending, and in investing and managing. Only state actors will have been involved, with the state having unlimited ability to regulate every step.

China’s economic crisis will not have been due to the absence of the state, but to its presence — indeed, its omnipresence — and its diminution of the private sector. What is lacking and cannot be installed fast enough are the private sector’s checks on the economy. Instead because of the state’s pervasive presence and direct participation throughout the economy, moral hazard — isolation from economic consequences leading to increasing risk-taking — is endemic. Everyone not only had an incentive to take excessive risks, but all turned a blind eye to it.

China’s crisis will be a lesson in too-big-to-fail on a vast scale, and that regulation is no substitute for the ultimate private sector penalty: Failure. In China’s state-run economy, the problem lies not in being “too big,” but in “to fail’s” absence.

The left will ignore this, just as the communist state itself now turns a blind eye to China’s SOEs. It will be up to conservatives to tell the truth. Failures in capitalism are not the failure of capitalism. In true capitalism, failure is not simply inherent, it is imperative. It is as necessary a condition as giving individuals full control of their decisions and success — conditions China’s communist government refuses to allow and from which all its other problems spring.",https://spectator.org/china-birth-rate-bosses-shaomin-li-cartoon-american-spectator/,2017-07-24
China’s Communist Government Catches Coronavirus - The American Spectator,"China’s government could be the coronavirus’ biggest victim. The crisis effect on China could be much like the coronavirus itself: Not universally dangerous, but especially so to those whose health is compromised already. While China has long appeared economically and politically robust, several factors have sapped its strength, increasing its vulnerability.

The coronavirus arrived with the new year; by the Chinese New Year, it was already a crisis in China. Moving into March, it threatens to be a global one. If it does not yet qualify as a pandemic, it certainly qualifies as a panic.

Although it does not have a generally elevated mortality rate, it is particularly dangerous to those with other serious conditions. The threat of coronavirus to such people is analogous to the one it poses to China’s communist rulers.

Growing internal pressures have beset China for some time. It began its meteoric economic rise as a low-cost producer, possessing a seemingly infinite source of cheap, dependable labor. No more. China’s days as a low-cost producer are gone and will not return. The investment now flows elsewhere.

China’s authoritarian communist government could guarantee a relatively reliable return. Of course, that same government extracted economically onerous terms — forced technology transfer, intellectual property infringement, and investment restrictions — from foreign investors in return for its surface reliability. The global business world found itself forced to accept them in order to have access to the world’s largest and fastest-growing economy.

When President Trump acted on what the rest of the world knew, China’s façade of reliability began to crack. Trump’s tariffs dramatically raised the cost of China’s exports, and China’s retaliatory tariffs did the same on imports. Suddenly, China was not the reliable market it once seemed. Once again, investors had reason to look elsewhere.

China’s stability once was a given. Its communist government’s political monopoly guaranteed it, even as it relaxed its economic monopoly over the last four decades. Then came Hong Kong. Beijing’s overreach ignited scenes unthinkable since Tiananmen Square — and on a larger, longer scale. While coronavirus has replaced it in 2020’s headlines, Hong Kong was China’s 2019 headline. And it was another reason for foreign investors to look elsewhere.

Even China’s vaunted economy concealed internal weakness. While it raced forward, many overlooked how much was due to government “investment,” in addition to real foreign investments. China’s state-run enterprises are over-leveraged, and China’s good economic numbers conceal much bad debt. China desperately needs to eliminate inefficient state enterprises, reduce overall government subsidies, and write off bad debt. To understand such a scenario’s danger, just look back to America’s financial crisis.

All these factors had signaled to foreign investors to diversify away from China — even before coronavirus. Coronavirus accentuates all these preexisting economic weaknesses. This is particularly true of its over-leveraged state-run enterprises.

The OECD ( warns that coronavirus will slow China’s economic growth from 2019’s 6.1 percent to below 5 percent. This means the government must resort to intervention to bolster growth. Of course, the enterprises most in need will be the weakest, and these will be those already dependent on too much government support. Instead of reducing these enterprises’ dependence on the government, slowing growth increases the government’s dependence on them.

The deterioration in broad economic numbers would speak loudly to any government. In China, they shout. The communists took control in 1949 in large part because the Chinese people were dissatisfied with the nationalists’ economic failure and corruption. The communists have maintained a self-enforced bargain with the people ever since: political monopoly for economic prosperity.

With the abandonment of its rigid economic ideology, China’s communists have been gaining on prosperity for decades, but that lead has been shrinking. With coronavirus, that lead becomes dangerously thin while also raising a host of questions about the performance of the country’s political monopoly.

Coronavirus will not be the single thing that topples China’s communist government, but it accelerates and accentuates those factors that one day could. The question is not whether China will catch the coronavirus (it already has); the question is whether the coronavirus will capture China’s communist government.",https://spectator.org/china-ccp-us-spying/,2020-03-10
China’s COVID Deceptions: Can Democracies Ever Learn? - The American Spectator,"Once again, we — most of our leaders, elites, and most of the general public — have been caught flatfooted. A totalitarian state has clandestinely been working on a weapon of mass destruction. When COVID-19 emerged last December, the above groups accepted at face value Beijing’s denial of malicious intent. China was working with a “dual-use” (civil and military) product — in this case, a lab-created pathogen that could be used for medical research created and studied for not only defensive, but offensive military purposes (albeit not deployed). The above segments of American society bought into China’s explanation: that the virus originated in bats sold in China’s infamous Wuhan wet markets.

China’s Viral Deception. An online paper posted on Feb. 6, 2020, by two Chinese scientists, presents evidence that the COVID-19 virus originated in bats that were examined in two laboratories near Wuhan, and not in the wet markets. Jim Treacher wrote about it at PJ Media:

First, the scientists confirmed what scientists around the world have said they believe: the virus mostly likely came from an animal known as the Intermediate Horseshoe Bat. There are no known colonies of this bat within 900 kilometers of Wuhan. Nor is there evidence they were sold in the Wuhan wet market, despite many claims in American media to the contrary. Interviews with almost 60 people who frequented the market confirmed there were no horseshoe bats for sale there. So where did the virus-carrying bats come from? The paper says this, quote: “We screened the area around the market and identified two laboratories conducting research on bat coronavirus.” Within a few hundred yards of the wet market was something called the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention. According to public reports, the center used Intermediate Horseshoe Bats for research. About seven miles away was another facility, called the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The virology institute also conducted research on Intermediate Horseshoe Bats. South China University scientists concluded that the Coronavirus pandemic likely came from one of these two labs. They noted that a scientist at the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention had been exposed to the blood and urine of bats. They also suggested that infected tissue samples from research animals may have wound up in the Wuhan wet market. They ended their paper this way. Quote: “The killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan. Safety levels may need to be reinforced in high risk, bio-hazardous laboratories. Regulations may be taken to relocate these laboratories far away from city center and other densely populated places.”

Incredibly, no journalists reported this, or, alternatively, they dismissed this paper as idle speculation, until Tucker Carlson reported it on his March 31 show. Here is a 2015 Italian documentary video (2:20, subtitles) — not a misprint, 2015 — exposing massive Chinese duplicity on coronavirus research back then. The Chinese grafted a protein taken from horseshoe bats onto the SARS virus, the acute pneumonia carried by mice, thus creating a super pathogen, the molecule SHC 0 14, capable of infecting humans. This enabled the coronavirus to attach itself to human respiratory cells without passing through an animal intermediary.

And there is yet another clue: The Epoch Times reports a sharp drop in cell phone and landline phone use in China from Nov. 2019 through Jan. 2020 — compared to an increase in those months a year earlier. Cell phone data is especially pertinent, as Chinese people are required by law to have a cell phone so the regime can monitor their activities for “social credit” score purposes. All users are assigned a health code, as well. The Epoch Times cited details from a New York Times article:

“The Times’s analysis found that as soon as a user grants the software access to personal data, a piece of the program labeled ‘reportInfoAndLocationToPolice’ sends the person’s location, city name and an identifying code number to a server. The software does not make clear to users its connection to the police. But according to China’s state-run Xinhua news agency and an official police social media account, law enforcement authorities were a crucial partner in the system’s development. “While Chinese internet companies often share data with the government, the process is rarely so direct. In the United States, it would be akin to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention using apps from Amazon and Facebook to track the coronavirus, then quietly sharing user information with the local sheriff’s office.” The system, which relies on a unit of the immense Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, assigns users a green, yellow, or red “health code” in the style of a traffic light. Predictably, Chinese citizens find the opaque system cryptic and frightening, since the government has not explained exactly how it works. “In some cities, residents now have to register their phone numbers with an app to take public transportation,” the Times added.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ariz.) nails China (6:53) for its duplicity — its infections and deaths are likely far higher than Beijing has admitted publicly — and coverup, and criticizes prior U.S. administrations for outsourcing critical medicines to China. U.S. intelligence reportedly concluded that China has been lying about the extent of coronavirus in China. The prestigious medical journal the Lancet has concluded that the first COVID-19 case had no connection with the Wuhan wet market. The first case of COVID-19 has now been traced to Nov. 17, 2019. One Chinese lab is located less than 300 yards from the market; a second lab — a biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facility, is seven miles away.

The World Health Organization (WHO) was also complicit in China’s deception, writes demographer Nick Eberstadt. Noah Rothman at Commentary writes that the U.S. response to COVID-19 was misdirected by false medical data, from not only China but also the WHO, that grossly understated the transmissibility and lethality of the pathogen. European health officials aired optimistic views about being able to contain it; doctors and hospitals were unaware of the full extent of the threat they were facing. (European officials have also discovered that test kits recently sent by China have an error rate as high as 80 percent, rendering them useless.)

A Univ. of Southhampton study concluded that had China begun remedial measures one week earlier, COVID-19 infections would have been reduced 66 percent; two weeks earlier, the reduction would have been 86 percent; and three weeks earlier, the reduction would have been 95 percent.

An AEI study released just before this article went to press went even further. It concludes that China’s figure for cases outside of Wuhan and Hubei province (in which Wuhan is located) are “low by a factor of 100 or more.” The study estimates 2.9 million cases based upon studying migrants who left Wuhan before quarantine was imposed. Its final, blunt conclusion, comparing its 2.9 million cases estimate with the 15,000 estimate aired by the Chinese Communist Party:

Or you can believe that 1.2 million travelers left from ground zero of a pandemic, some freely circulating for weeks, resulted in national contagion of a little over 15,000 cases.

For its part, the COVID-19 number for China offered by Johns Hopkins’ dashboard, at press time, of necessity largely based upon information supplied by China, is 82,883 cases.

China, meanwhile, is moving aggressively in the South China Sea while the U.S. is preoccupied with crises at home. But the regime faces growing opposition, possibly endangering the tenure of president Xi Jinping.

One final point: Beijing has been accused of deliberately unleashing COVID as a trial run for biowarfare. This charge surely is untrue. Were the military interested in conducting such a trial, they would hardly run it within walking distance of their bio labs and the Wuhan wet markets. Wuhan is a major metropolis of eight million, China’s eighth most populous city. Nicknamed “the Chicago of China,” a manufacturing and transportation hub, it sits at the junction of China’s two greatest rivers, the Yangtze and Han. The Three Gorges Dam, which boasts the world’s largest installed electric power capacity, is nearby; also in Wuhan’s environs are two of China’s leading institutes of higher education, Wuhan University and the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Wuhan is also a UNESCO “Design City” (note its gorgeous skyline) and a beta world city.

Such a highly visible and vital metropolis, with myriad valuable facilities and institutions, and countless international visitors, is hardly the place to stage a biowarfare experiment. Any test would be conducted clandestinely, deep in China’s interior, outside public view, and then likely the regime would have executed all participants, to destroy incriminating evidence.

Why Can’t We Learn? Western democracies rarely learn certain lessons. We did learn from Germany’s use of poison gas in World War I that Hitler would have such weapons and that he could only be deterred form using them if he feared retaliation. Let’s revisit a few classics: We refused to believe that the former Soviet Union was making bioweapons at its Sverdlovsk facility, even as it leaked pulmonary anthrax in 1979. The Soviets thus violated a 1972 bioweapons treaty — one that lacked verification provisions. Ultimately this was revealed at the end of the Cold War, when in 1992 Russian premier Boris Yeltsin admitted that Sverdlovsk in fact had been a bioweapons facility. Soviet leaders from Lenin to Gorbachev were portrayed as potential peacemakers. Risibly, Yuri Andropov, a former KGB chief who was sinister even by Soviet standards, was portrayed as a closet liberal who liked scotch and jazz. Andropov, who orchestrated the betrayal of the Hungarian freedom fighters in 1956, drank vodka. As for jazz, there is no evidence that Andropov knew Duke Ellington from heiress Doris Duke. Gorbachev did, in the end, prove a peacemaker, but only after his effort to save the Soviet system failed. So the peace crowd, in the 75 years of what Ronald Reagan aptly termed the “Evil Empire,” proved right half as often as a stopped clock is in 24 hours.

Put simply, Western democracies continually hope for the better, given that the alternative scenarios are horrific. Shattered by the “war to end all wars” that produced what was called “the lost generation,” European publics slid into pacifism and denial. As the totalitarian powers armed, violating arms treaties, launching military assaults to test-drive their growing power, testing aerial bombing against hapless civilians, Western governments temporized, bargaining desperately for peace — even outlawing war and delaying rearmament while hoping that their pacifism would induce their adversaries to relent. In fact, contrary to their hopes, their vacillations proved an incitement to aggression.

China today is the hideous living incarnation of George Orwell’s legendary dystopian novel 1984. In that book, a totalitarian state is in perpetual war with its neighbors, brutally repressing its subjects, installing a “telescreen” in every home, bombarding its populace with propaganda, and forcing lovers to put loyalty to the State over love of their intimates. China’s Orwellian telescreen is the smartphone. Yet, with rare exceptions, for three decades our leaders and media have chosen to believe a benign picture of China, one that would grow freer and more friendly as it grew stronger and richer.

At long last, COVID-19, coupled with China’s cynical and cruel duplicity, has proven the tectonic shock that has opened the eyes of many (though not the eyes of our mainstream media minders). So we can expect that we will, for a time, learn useful lessons. But let a generation pass — even, perhaps, a few years — and lassitude may once again take hold.

The epigraph of Winston Churchill’s sixth volume of his magisterial history of World War II, Triumph and Tragedy, sums up the habits of Western democracies after winning wars:

How the Great Democracies triumphed, and so were able to resume the Follies which had so nearly cost them their lives.

Let us pray this time proves a shining exception, that we cease to naively trust, and thus reduce our dependency on, essential supplies from China.

China’s COVID Surveillance State and Its Western Imitators - The American Spectator,"When the dust finally settles and we look back on the COVID-19 pandemic as a matter of history, we may well conclude that the most consequential aspect of the ordeal was not the pandemic itself but rather the explosion in state power, mass data collection, and surveillance that the pandemic incubated.

Much like the First World War had served as a seismic outpouring of the cumulative advances in warfare that had quietly taken place since the fall of the French Empire in 1870, so has COVID-19 allowed many governments in developed nations to realize decades of advancements in data surveillance.

The High-Tech Panopticon

The modern surveillance state has many antecedents, but certainly the most important at this moment is the Chinese government. The growth of China into the world’s “surveillance superpower” can be traced back to at least 1997, when the country first implemented controls on the newly introduced internet. Since then, Communist Party technocrats have labored to turn their society into a closed system in which every inch is surveilled and nothing enters or leaves without official sanction.

The goal, in short, is the construction of a sort of gigantic, nation-spanning panopticon — a system of surveillance first proposed by the eighteenth-century English philosopher Jeremy Bentham as a “humane” format for prisons. Such a system, which Bentham envisioned as a circular, hollow multi-story building, would allow a single guard stationed in the center to have a full view of every room in the structure. Constantly monitoring every room would be unnecessary even if it were possible, argued Bentham: the mere credible threat of surveillance is sufficient to deter bad behavior.

Thankfully, no government has yet forced this level of transparency on the lives of its citizens (though some, such as North Korea, clearly would love the opportunity). But the Communist Party of China is certainly pushing the envelope. Beijing possesses the world’s most sophisticated system of integrated and overlapping methods of mass observation and data collection.

This was not a preordained path. When the cornerstone of China’s surveillance apparatus, a camera network called Skynet — yes, named after the genocidal AI antagonist of the Terminator movies — was launched in 2005, the average Chinese person was about as rich as the average North Korean. Only 8 percent were internet users. Beijing decided that China’s growth would take place within the confines of a surveillance state that would grow alongside it.

As of today, Skynet is the world’s largest camera network, and probably the most technologically advanced. In 2013, when the program was first publicly revealed, it already boasted twenty million cameras. As of 2021, China has around one billion cameras, around half of which are integrated into Skynet. Compare that figure to around eighty-five million cameras in the United States, most of which are privately owned.

Even so, Skynet is merely the biggest tool in Beijing’s toolbox, and not even its most advanced. Indeed, it is hard at work on an even more comprehensive successor system: Sharp Eyes, officially launched in 2015.

The project seeks “100% video surveillance coverage in key public areas and major industries” and better penetration into rural regions. Most notably, it intends to connect China’s public surveillance camera network with its many millions of private cameras. The end goal is likely one billion or more cameras feeding into centralized databases equipped with facial recognition and AI technology. No other polity has even attempted this kind of public-private surveillance integration, let alone on this scale.

Another area where Beijing seeks total penetration of surveillance is the internet. It should not surprise anyone to know that online anonymity does not exist for the average Chinese netizen. Every social media and gaming platform that Beijing is able to regulate enforces a policy of demasking its users, requiring ID for registration and mandating the use of real names rather than usernames or pseudonyms.

WeChat, a do-everything app with over 1.2 billion active users, is often regarded as the world’s least secure major social media platform. The product of a publicly traded company, its level of information integration with government censors is unknown. But the absence of live state surveillance does not mean no surveillance at all: the app has admitted to hoarding user messages, including supposedly deleted messages, as well as geolocation data. There is little doubt that this information is freely handed over whenever Beijing demands it.

But state meddling hardly matters in WeChat’s case. Much like Western social media, Chinese social media engages in enthusiastic self-censorship. They contract this work out to giant “censorship factories,” which hire recent college graduates with no better prospects and make them sift through thousands of social media posts per day, looking for references to government officials and sensitive historical events.

Of all of China’s surveillance initiatives, however, perhaps none will be as consequential as its push to expunge all privacy from the financial system. The digital yuan, a state-controlled digital currency that is being publicly tested with more than two hundred million users, is slated to eventually replace all physical and digital cash alternatives.

Such a system would give the People’s Bank of China unfettered access to the time, location, and nature of every transaction that occurs in the country. Granular surveillance of such a volume of data would be impossible, of course. But, as in Bentham’s panopticon, the point is the threat of surveillance.

A Contagious Policy

COVID-19 wasn’t the only thing taking the world by storm during the pandemic. At home, China swiftly adapted its existing surveillance system into what became the world’s toughest biosecurity membrane. Abroad, it solidified its position as the world’s premier surveillance exporter, in terms of both technology and policy.

Many developed democracies, following Beijing’s lead, introduced unprecedented levels of mass surveillance in the name of public health.

By April 2020, when the “first wave” of COVID-19 was cresting in many parts of the world and public health authorities were scrambling for solutions, China had deployed a nationwide, color-coded virtual health monitoring app to control the movement of its citizens.

This procedure was particularly intrusive in its identity verification requirements, encouraging users to submit biometric selfies on a nightly basis. Its stated purpose was the bulk collection of health data from civilians — and the restriction of movement for those deemed “red code,” or at high risk of carrying the virus.

At the time of its release, the app received well-deserved criticism from foreign observers. The state was, as rightly pointed out, cracking down on freedoms of privacy and free movement.

But then a sea change occurred in the attitude of Western leaders and media as the virus began to spread worldwide. Suddenly safety at the cost of freedom became a politically expedient position. Aggressive contact tracing and geolocation data harvesting apps were introduced, and continue to be introduced, in developed countries as diverse as Australia, Poland, and Israel.

The irony has not been lost in China. In the words of a retrospective analysis by University of California professor Chuncheng Liu, the free world’s embrace of mass data collection in the name of fighting COVID-19 only “further proved” to Chinese social media commentators that China “was right about surveillance from the beginning.”

Bureaucrats around the world were quick to imitate China’s methods in other ways, too. Authoritarian Russia expanded its AI-powered camera network in 2020, citing the supposed interest of public safety. Liberal Britain did the same thing at around the same time, citing the need to enforce social distancing. At the beginning of the pandemic, dystopian footage emerged out of China showing loudspeaker-equipped drones warning civilians to go home; within a couple of months, drones were being used to enforce health measures in places like Greece, Spain, Ireland, and even Connecticut.

None of this is to assert that any government other than Beijing has fully embraced totalitarian surveillance methods. There are more and less harmful methods of surveillance and even mass data collection. An app that knows everything about a person at the point of contact can still, on paper, protect his or her privacy with the right combination of encryption, anonymization, and prudent data handling.

Nonetheless, the expansion of the surveillance state around the world in the past two years portends bad things to come. Even if the newly introduced methods of watching and controlling the public were to disappear alongside the pandemic, many ostensibly liberal governments tampered with civil liberties in disturbing ways, and they will have precedent to try again in the future.

Long COVID

Even worse is the likely possibility that many governments, having been given a taste of data-powered authoritarianism, will not relinquish control so easily.

Just as important as the growth of the physical tools of surveillance has been the attempted legitimization of an all-encompassing philosophy of surveillance and control. Since 2020, there has been a fundamental shift in the attitude of many bureaucrats and voters toward the role of government. Gone are the traditional progressive arguments about positive liberty, the idea that government intervention can promote freedom. Much trendier now is the “guardian state” — a government that boasts of curtailing liberty in the interest of protecting the health of its citizens and soothing their anxieties.

The worldwide shift in governance prompted by COVID-19 has perhaps only one suitable historical analogue, in the Second World War. The story of U.S. government deficits and debts is a story of the paradigm shift that occurred because of the war. Having mobilized an all-of-state effort to smash the Japanese empire and the Nazis, New Deal progressives began to wage expensive — and frequently fruitless — government wars on poverty, racism, and every other social ill.

Now a new precedent has been set for mass surveillance. “Whiteness” has already been declared a pandemic, surely as destructive as any Wuhan bat virus. Soon we may add conservative activism to that list.

When, years ago, President Barack Obama went after conservative groups with the IRS, he did so secretively out of concern for public backlash. When, this February, Prime Minister Prime Minister Justin Trudeau used the threat of unprecedented financial sanctions to harass truckers protesting Canada’s vaccine mandates, he did so proudly and publicly.

As part of his campaign against civil disobedience, Trudeau effectively conscripted Canada’s banks into participating in a huge data dragnet: financial firms were forced to scrutinize the political sympathies of their customers, immediately freezing the accounts of anyone participating in, or materially supporting, so-called “illegal protests.” Such civil disobeyers were then to be promptly reported to Canadian intelligence. Not even accounts suspected of money laundering are usually acted upon so decisively by banks. (READ MORE by John Jiang: COVID Zero Is the Technocracy’s Test Run)

Trudeau’s actions plumbed the depths of progressive authoritarianism, and many rightly pointed this out. Yet the public backlash was disappointingly muted; the loudest opposition voice was not a Canadian at all, but Tucker Carlson. Many, it seemed, had grown accustomed to government violations of liberties and privacy in the supposed public interest.

Similar breaches of privacy occurred at the hands of U.S. federal law enforcement in the wave of last year’s Capitol riots. The FBI investigation into the event was a master class in post-hoc data harvesting. According to the Washington Post, the case showed “a mix of FBI techniques, from license plate readers to facial recognition.”

These techniques prove that China-level surveillance penetration is far from necessary for a government to threaten civil liberties. In the case of cell phone location data, federal agents tapped multiple sources: warrants served to telecommunications providers, tip-offs from “Sedition Hunters,” and media outlets that had managed to obtain cell phone data leaked from supposedly secure data pipelines.

When a congressional panel tried to access encrypted messages sent on January 6 in September, Politico quoted an expert claiming that cracking message encryption “is really just a question of time and money.” Indeed, there are few surefire guarantees of privacy in a society permeated by data collection; there is only the uncertain reprieve of government indifference. When a president is in office who calls Trump supporters “domestic terrorists,” don’t count on such a reprieve.

Of course, the Biden administration faces more friction when collecting surveillance data on its citizens than the Xi administration does. The brutal crackdown on the January 6 podium-stealers, as shameful as it has been, has yet to be repeated elsewhere in the United States. Nonetheless, the fact that such capability was demonstrated so publicly should, as Bentham would have argued, have a chilling effect.",https://spectator.org/china-comes-to-washington/,2022-06-28
China's Cyber Militia - The American Spectator,"There’s been an interesting new development in China’s use of cyber space as an element in its intelligence and security operations. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is reportedly funding a vast complex of part-time cyber-devotees to supplement and compliment the official structure of cyber interception and invasion.

Equally as interesting is the willingness of the Chinese authorities to allow the publication of this fact. The first official recognition of this program occurred in one chosen hi-tech factory in 2002. According to an official PLA publication, there are now thousands of such units around the country. Obviously the proliferation was considered too great to hide.

Effectively acting as a PLA-associated technical reserve, its mostly under-thirty part-timers are drawn largely from civilian companies and university-level institutes operating in electronic fields. A national guard of “cyber soldiers” provides China’s central cyber security system with a particularly useful training ground and support structure for the already vastly expanded echelon of professionals committed to both the defensive and offensive aspects of electronic warfare.

Beijing views the cyber world as an immense battleground on which to gain advantage over its perceived enemies and at the same time act as a defensive bulwark against counter-cyber intrusions. Beijing believes firmly in the importance of the mobilization of volunteer talent in order to add substantially to the intellectual firepower of national security and defense activity.

The world of cyber action has a technological base that is equally useful for both military and civilian use. It has been proven true that an inspired and hardworking hacker can maneuver his way through many, perhaps most, electronic defenses. The difference between Western and Chinese amateur hackers is simply that the Chinese individual is involved in an intellectual adventure that can aid his country. The American counterpart has the opportunity and facility to experiment on his own — for his personal enjoyment and gain. State-organized instruments established in Chinese communities already devoted, for example, to telecommunications, Internet, and electronic industries operate in an environment already acculturated to a group rather than individual goal. The PLA naturally exploits this orientation.

PLA cyber reserve units provide a source for innovative techniques. On a more mundane basis they also act as a large-scale redundancy force for both offensive and defensive cyber attack targeting. Information warfare operations can be a highly manpower intensive activity and the Chinese have utilized a readily available part-time resource to obtain these personnel.

Published Chinese military scientific reports cited in Western media note that the PLA has constructed an auxiliary instrument that carries on the assignments of what has been referred to as “stealing, changing and erasing data” targeted to provide “deception, jamming, disruption” and other objectives appropriate to cyber warfare. While such targeting appears initially aimed at military and related “enemy” operations, they are easily adaptable to strictly civilian cyber communications and development.

The proliferation of cyber attacks, invasions, and general destructive actions has caused considerable consternation in the West. While cyber security is the subject of various publications and conferences, there appears to be little official action when the issue involves China. The Russians, while quite guarded, appear more willing to discuss a broad agreement that would counter destructive cyber attacks. Basically the Chinese have shown little or no interest in the concept of a binding international cyber agreement.

And why should they? This form of international treaty restricting sensitive military and quasi-military targeting rarely is effective unless the parties are on a friendly basis to start. The truth is that Beijing obviously does not see Washington as a true friend. It isn’t really clear that it wishes to be so. China feels safer with its own military defense and ability to acquire the classified military technology of the United States. Stealing civilian technology secrets is of collateral commercial benefit and in the collective minds of Beijing not at all of the same character as the gathering of classified defense data.

The openness of society that is enjoyed by the U.S. and the West, in general, is contrary to the traditional tendency of the Han people for concealment. To expect otherwise is quite foolish. Sun Tzu, the famed author of The Art of War, Sun Tzu, wrote: “To secure ourselves from defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.” And this is the strategic view of the PRC leadership in regard to the cyber war with the United States.",https://spectator.org/china-communism-xishuangbanna/,2011-10-21

China’s Exhortation to Study (and Conquer) - The American Spectator,"“In the 21st century,” Chinese scholar Qian Xuesen once said, “if a particular country fails to be in the lead in science and technology, it will be difficult for it to maintain its economic activities and international standing.” Qian was a Chinese-born American scientist who was accused of spying for Red China during the McCarthy era, and sent back to China for his purported crimes. Once in China, Qian did, indeed, become a leading figure in Mao’s missile program. For well over a century, going back to the republican period of China in the early 20th century, the Chinese have sought to “catch up” with the West technologically by any means necessary.

In 1878, the radical Chinese nationalist, Zhang Zhidong, wrote his essay Quan Xue Pian (“Exhortation to Study”) in which he elaborated upon the concept of ti-yong, which meant to “keep China’s style of learning to maintain societal essence and adopt Western learning for practical use.” This concept of ti-yong is not merely an interesting bit of Chinese history. In fact, it is a hallmark of China’s strategy for full-spectrum dominance in the 21st century.

There are several analysts in the West who remain convinced that, just as happened in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Chinese will not succeed in their attempts at replicating advanced Western technology and capabilities (thereby securing their position as a dominant world power and pushing the United States away from the Asia-Pacific). However, unlike the recent iterations of Chinese history, China is strong, and it is a modern country — with an advanced economy and a modernizing military. Whereas 20 years ago, when China ramped up its industrial espionage of the United States, Western analysts could soothe themselves with the knowledge that China remained a third rate, developing country, the fact that virtually no serious attempt was made to counter China’s espionage campaign during that time has allowed China to become the threat these skeptics disbelieved it ever could be.

The same Western observers now try to console us that, ultimately, China has problems too and, in much the same way that our problems are coming to a head today, China’s proverbial chickens will come home to roost also. This is undoubtedly true. However, China’s problems will not become truly threatening to it until closer to the middle of the century. Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party increases its hold on power and the Chinese threat grows to stratospheric levels.

Then, of course, there are those in the West who love to point out how the United States is truly innovative whereas China continues to be imitative. While this once was true, those days are long gone. Not only is China currently transitioning from an industrial-type economy to a knowledge-based, post-industrial economy (to be more like ours), but it has already started to out-innovate us at several levels. The global consulting firm KPMG asked 800 of the world’s leading tech executives where the next great innovation hub would be by 2020. A plurality of those executives agreed that Shanghai and not Silicon Valley would be the next great global innovation hub. And, America’s advanced tech firms are following in the path of previous American manufacturing firms by moving their operations to the vast market of China, thereby conferring immense technological capabilities and economic opportunities onto China — specifically the Chinese Communist Party and the People’s Liberation Army (which will be used to weaken the United States further).

You see, just being a copycat country doesn’t immediately disqualify China from being a serious contender for world power. When analyzing different corporations, the business guru Oded Shenkar observed in his 2010 book, Copycats: How Smart Companies Use Imitation to Gain a Strategic Edge, that firms which emulate the innovations of other firms eventually out-compete the more innovative firms, because the imitators managed to keep their costs down. Inevitably, Shenkar argues, those imitators become innovators on their own. I believe his observations apply as much to countries as they do to corporations.

Plus, can’t you just hear some Tory lord in the Court of St. James downplaying the threat that the upstart United States posed to British commercial interests after American textile factories began competing with the British Empire’s? In 1793, Samuel Slater, a British-born entrepreneur moved to Rhode Island and built a series of textile factories, based on the advanced English model. Slater became known in the United States as the “Father of the American Factory System” and “Slater the Traitor” in Great Britain, because he brought advanced British technology to the United States and then shared it with his Yankee neighbors. (This American Factory System would ultimately inspire Eli Whitney, the inventor of the Cotton Gin, which utterly upended Britain’s textile industry.) By imitating Great Britain, the United States eventually leapfrogged it. China is replicating this experience — only this time it is the United States that is about to be usurped by a determined upstart nation.

According to China scholar Michael Pillsbury, since Mao’s rise there has been a quiet consensus (though not necessarily an active conspiracy) to achieve parity with — and ultimately displace — the West’s dominance by 2049, the one-hundredth anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party’s founding. Conveniently, 2049 is also the year that President Xi Jinping believes the “China Dream” will become a reality. Xi has also argued that China’s authoritarian capitalist development model as a “new option for other countries,” implying that China will continue to press its desire to compete with — and displace — the American-led liberal capitalist global system.

Toward that end, China recognizes that which Qian Xuesen noticed a decade ago, and China has sought to apply the lessons that Zhang Zhidong first taught 140 years ago: in order to dominate the science and technology fields today, China must entice advanced Western firms (and get many Chinese students to study advanced science in the West) to come to China. Once in China, the capabilities and knowledge of the West will become integrated into the Chinese system and empower China — potentially at the expense of the West itself.

Meanwhile, China continues its ceaseless assault on American intellectual property (IP): stealing or coopting innovative research, melding it with ongoing projects in China, and then beating America to the punch. Presently, China is developing genetic enhancements (known as “gene-doping”) for its special forces; it is leading the world in nuclear fusion technology research; and the Chinese are leaps-and-bounds ahead of the United States in quantum computing technology. All one need do is look at the Chinese government’s official Science and Technology Development Guidelines from 2006. This 14-year plan clearly shows that China (rightly) views science and technology, more than manufacturing and mercantilism, as being the key “force multipliers” in today’s great power competition.

The Trump Administration must do whatever it can to slow the brain drain from the United States to China and use any means necessary to protect its vital intellectual property. Without adequate protections in place, like a parasite China will drain America’s competitive advantages. Then, once China has taken everything it needs from the withered husk that once was the United States, it will use all of that knowledge to turn itself into the world’s only superpower.

Don’t listen to the skeptics: China has historically been a major world power. The last 200 years have been an aberration in the 5,000-year-long history of China, not the norm. It’s just that the way in which China rises to become a great power again will look very different from previous iterations in the past. The United States must prepare itself for a complex, dangerous, and highly toxic global competition with China. It must start with protecting its advanced technology and intellectual property.",https://spectator.org/china-covid-19-pandemic-lawsuits/,2018-03-19

China’s Intimidation Campaign - The American Spectator,"The stock markets rose abruptly Friday on President Trump’s announcement of a ceasefire in our trade war with China. There is no agreement on a trade deal — not even an agreement to agree — but the president suspended application of increased tariffs, at least for a while, as talks go on.

Trump’s unilateral ceasefire comes at a significant moment for China. It has managed to intimidate American companies — most bluntly in the case of the NBA — into self-censorship regarding the Hong Kong freedom demonstrations it may have also done with the president.

According to a CNN report (which is suspect because it is from CNN), in a June telephone call Trump promised Chinese President Xi Jinping that he would remain quiet about the Hong Kong protests while the trade talks went on. Whether or not that report is true, the president has remained silent on those protests — now in their 20th week — and, bizarrely, congratulated Xi on the regime’s 70th anniversary.

Trump’s relationship with Xi is puzzling. Why would an American president congratulate the leader of a regime that has murdered millions and oppresses its more than a billion citizens every day? Has Trump been intimidated or just buffaloed by Xi’s supposed willingness to enter into a trade deal that would end China’s theft of American military and commercial secrets?

Two weeks ago, in the military parade held in Tiananmen Square, the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force displayed what it claimed were new hypersonic missiles against which the U.S. has no defense. Like those being developed by us, the Russians, and others, the Chinese missile is a “boost-glide” vehicle that could deliver nuclear weapons or destroy large chunks of territory merely by striking at hypersonic speeds.

The reason why we have no defense against such missiles is the natural phenomenon called “plasma stealth.”

We were all taught in grammar school that matter exists in only three forms: solid, liquid, or gas. That’s not quite correct. There’s a fourth form called plasma gas.

Plasma gases can be electronically manipulated in solid containers to do such things as form antennae enabling communications. One inventor I know has already perfected the means of doing so. The applications for such antennae include stealthy aircraft and missiles that could have highly effective communications without external antennae that increase their detectability by radars.

Plasma gas occurs in nature, albeit far less than the other forms of matter. It is ionized gas — i.e., a gas, such as those found in the atmosphere — in which the atoms of the gas lose an electron and thereby become more electromagnetically active and unstable. That brings us to plasma stealth.

In 1957, American radars were trying to track Russia’s original Sputnik satellite in low-earth orbit, effectively within the outer limit of the atmosphere called the ionosphere. Sputnik was traveling at orbital speed, about 17,500 miles per hour or Mach 23.

The satellite was traveling in a naturally created ionic plasma cloud that in turn created two different radar shadows that effectively canceled each other out. Thus, Sputnik was at times invisible to radars because it was shrouded in a plasma cloud. That means plasma stealth isn’t just theoretical: it can be accomplished.

Hypersonic weapons such as the Chinese DF-100 are supposed to be able to be boosted to speeds of Mach 5 and higher. They would be trackable by conventional radar in their ascent stage to their maximum altitude, where they would tip over and then reenter the atmosphere at speeds of Mach 10 or higher.

If the missiles were equipped to electrically charge their skins, they would create a cloud of plasma shrouding the missile’s body. Even if we had interceptor missiles that could catch and kill them, we couldn’t target the incoming missiles because they would be invisible to radar.

We don’t know if the Chinese (and Russian) claims that they have perfected hypersonic missiles that cannot be detected by radar are true. (Russian President Putin announced in March 2018 that Russia already has such missiles.)

The Chinese “missiles” displayed in their October parade weren’t missiles themselves, just big missile casings hauled on what the Chinese claim are launch vehicle trucks. Again, we don’t know if their claims of success in hypersonic missile development are true.

The Chinese and Russian claims of success in developing hypersonic boost-glide missiles pose a question of national security that disrupts our theory of deterrence through “MAD” — mutually assured destruction. They are clearly first-strike weapons that cannot be defended against by our current defense systems.

The risk they pose can be answered in several ways. First, by our own development of such weapons, which is proceeding at our usual pace, meaning very slowly. It takes two decades for us to field weapon systems such as fighter or bomber aircraft. There is no reason for the development of hypersonic weapons to succeed faster.

The other way to answer the threat such missiles pose is for us to develop systems to detect and kill them in their boost stage, before they tip over into the atmosphere and are plasma-shrouded. That would necessitate making the decision to develop and deploy weapons — such as a modern version of the Reagan-era “Brilliant Pebbles” system that was never built — which is a decision that neither we nor our adversaries have been willing to make.

The idea that space is a region where weapons do not exist is a fallacy. China successfully tested a ground-launched satellite killer a dozen years ago. Russia has reportedly — and successfully — tested its mobile satellite killer, the PL-19 Nudol, at least seven times.

Both the Russians and the Chinese are developing hunter-killer satellites that could orbit for months or years awaiting signals to destroy our satellites, crippling our abilities to securely gather intelligence, communicate, navigate, and detect missile launches by our enemies. (Our Space-Based Infrared System — “SBIRS” — can probably detect any launch of even small, short-range missiles and give almost instant warning to our defense systems.)

Hypersonic “boost-glide” missiles and satellite killers are designed to make MAD’s deterrence obsolete and to tip the balance of power decisively in the direction of those who can first deploy them. They are weapons of intimidation that will affect us and our allies in a way that must be answered very soon.

By their impeachment proceedings against him, the Democrats have diverted President Trump’s attention from almost anything else. Neither we nor our allies can allow him to ignore the effort to make MAD obsolete. He has some tough decisions to make on the matter of the further weaponization of space. Those decisions must be made quickly, whatever else may be diverting him from his duties.",https://spectator.org/china-covid-vaccine/,2019-10-14

China's Morally Hollow Economy - The American Spectator,"In recent weeks, China has been consumed by an unprecedented internal debate concerning a subject bound to make its Communist rulers nervous. At issue is the moral health of Chinese society.

Widespread Chinese discussion of this most un-politically correct subject was triggered by the October 21 death of a two-year old girl in the city of Foshan in Guangdong province. She died of internal injuries sustained after being run-over not once, but twice in a local market.

Accidents happen. But what made little Wang Yue’s death a matter for intense public discussion was the fact that nearly 20 people simply walked by and ignored her plight as she lay bleeding in the gutter.

What, hundreds of Chinese websites, newspapers and even state media outlets are asking, does this say about Chinese society? Have Chinese people lost all sense of concern for others in the midst of the scramble for wealth unleashed by China’s long march away from economic collectivism? One local official summarized the collective angst by stating: “We should look into the ugliness in ourselves with a dagger of conscience and bite the soul-searching bullet.”

The problem, from the perspective of China’s party-government-military elites, is such soul-searching may lead increasing numbers of Chinese to conclude that the circumstances surrounding Wang Yue’s death are symptomatic of deeper public morality problems confronting China, some of which could significantly impede its economic development.

One such challenge is widespread corruption. By definition, corruption doesn’t easily lend itself to close study. Its perpetrators are rarely interested in anyone studying their activities. Few question, however, that there’s a high correlation between corruption and widespread and direct government involvement in the economy. The more regulations and “state-business” partnerships you have (and China has millions of the former and thousands of the latter), the greater the opportunities for government cadres to extract their personal pound of flesh as the price of doing business.

Back in 2007, for example, a Carnegie Foundation study of China reported that approximately “10 percent of government spending, contracts, and transactions is estimated to be used as kickbacks and bribes, or simply stolen.” The situation has since become even worse. In late 2009, for example, China’s state anti-corruption watchdog admitted that 106,000 officials had already been found guilty of corruption that year — an increase of 2.5 percent from 2008.

From an economic standpoint, high corruption levels are a powerful disincentive for foreign investment. And if corruption grows to sufficient levels in China, there’s a strong possibility it may start cancelling-out the attraction of the lower labor costs that are one of the biggest magnets for foreign investment in China.

The ethical predicaments corroding China’s economy, however, go beyond everyday corruption. They also touch on China’s willingness to tell the truth about what’s really going on in the Chinese economy.

While hardly anyone questions China’s economy is growing, doubts are continually expressed concerning the veracity of its growth figures — including by some members of China’s elite. In 2010, for instance, Wikileaks revealed that China’s present Vice Premier Li Keqiang had expressed little confidence in his own country’s GDP numbers during a 2007 conversation with the American ambassador.

The causes for such uncertainty are several. But one that has consistently plagued China since the 1980s has been outright fudging and lying on production and growth numbers by local officials eager for political advancement.

Why does this matter? It’s important because domestic and foreign businesses need reliable data if they’re going to be able to make prudent investments. Conversely, misleading GDP data helps generate a cycle of expectations, risk-assessment, investments, production and exports that is built on lies. And if the falsehoods are big and systematic enough, they will severely undermine business confidence and leave a legacy of distrust of China among foreign investors and international markets.

Many members of China’s Communist party elite — but especially its younger set — are very conscious of these problems. Their concerns were vented in an unprecedented fashion at an informal October 6 meeting held at the China World Trade Centre which gathered together the children of those party leaders who ended the anarchical insanity associated with the “Gang of Four” 35 years ago.

Instead of being a gathering during which preparations were supposed to be made for next year’s Party Congress, young apparatchik after young apparatchik stood up and slammed the state of Chinese society. Some spoke of the “rapid decline of moral standards.” Others referred to “rampant corruption.” Still more expressed their disgust at the perks enjoyed by party and government officials. One well-connected cadre even insisted: “The Communist Party is like a surgeon who has cancer.… It can’t remove the tumor by itself, it needs help from others, but without help it can’t survive for long.”

And herein lies the dilemma for those members of China’s elites who are aware of the threat that widespread corruption, nepotism, and all the usual phenomena associated with one-party states represent to China’s economic and political future. The ideology that still (at least theoretically) justifies their leading place in society and politics — i.e., Communism — has literally nothing to offer by way of serious moral counsel.

Communism is, after all, based on a materialist conception of life, and materialism can’t generate any coherent ethic, beyond recourse to appeals to speeding up the so-called “dialectics of history” or the mailed fist of raw power. That’s why Marxists typically dismiss concerns for objective morality as “bourgeois false consciousness.”

Nor does the other force that increasingly serves to legitimize the rule of China’s elites — old-fashioned nationalism — have much to offer by way of moral guidance. Indeed, nationalist regimes are invariably associated with widespread corruption because of their propensity to meddle widely and deeply in every aspect of economic life.

Either way, if China’s rulers are going to confront some of the looming moral problems threatening to compromise China’s economic progress (not to mention the present elite’s power-monopoly), then they need to find some alternatives — and quickly. Revolutions have, after all, started on far less.",https://spectator.org/china-emissions-problem-nuclear-energy/,2011-10-28
China’s New White Paper on Taiwan: We Ignore It at Our Peril - The American Spectator,"A few days ago, China’s State Council issued a new white paper on Taiwan titled “The Taiwan Question and China’s Reunification in the New Era.” It is no accident, as the Marxists say, that the Chinese Communist Party chose to publicly release the paper in the wake of the Chinese navy’s dangerous exercises surrounding the island of Taiwan. The paper’s table of contents leaves little doubt as to the CCP’s policy approach to Taiwan: “I. Taiwan Is Part of China – This Is an Indisputable Fact”; “II. Resolute Efforts of the CPC to Realize China’s Complete Reunification”; “III. China’s Complete Reunification Is a Process That Cannot Be Halted”; “IV. National Reunification in the New Era”; and “V. Bright Prospects for Peaceful Reunification.”

The State Council in China is “the executive body of the highest organ of state power” but it is completely staffed with members of, and is subservient to, the CCP and President Xi Jinping. It was formally established in 1954 under Mao Zedong. The council includes the Chinese premier, vice premiers, state councilors, ministry executives, the CCP’s general secretary (Xi), and others. The key positions on the council are nominated by Xi and confirmed by the National Party Congress. Under China’s 1982 Constitution, the council exercises broad administrative powers. It is “responsible for carrying out the principles and policies” of the CCP.

The preamble to the white paper states that reunification with Taiwan “is a shared aspiration of all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation” and “a historic mission of the Communist Party of China.” It accuses Taiwan’s political leaders of redoubling their efforts to “divide the country,” and notes that “some external forces have tried to exploit Taiwan to contain China, prevent the Chinese nation from achieving complete reunification, and halt the process of national rejuvenation.” And the paper notes that “national rejuvenation is driven by an unstoppable force.” (READ MORE: We Are Now in the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis)

After reciting their version of history which holds that Taiwan has been and always will be part of China, the authors of the white paper assert that “the sovereignty and territory of China never have been and will never be divided, and Taiwan’s status as part of China’s territory has never changed and will never be allowed to change.” The authors accuse the United States and a “small number” of other countries of colluding “with forces in Taiwan” regarding Taiwan’s legal status. China’s Constitution states that “Taiwan is part of the sacred territory of the People’s Republic of China,” and claims that it is the “inviolable duty of all Chinese people, including our compatriots in Taiwan, to accomplish the great task of reunifying the motherland.”

The paper notes that China’s Anti-Secession Law of 2005 and the National Security Law of 2015 provide that Taiwan is part of China and that China will “brook no violation” of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Taiwan’s “status as part of China is unalterable.”

Distorting history, the white paper claims that the CCP under Mao Zedong promoted policies “for peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question” — a statement that obscures the fact that Mao’s plan in 1950 to invade and conquer Taiwan was foiled by the U.S. Seventh Fleet shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War and that Chinese forces initiated offensive operations against Taiwan twice in the mid-to-late 1950s but were ultimately deterred by the strong leadership and policies of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Reunification with Taiwan, the authors state, “is the only way to avoid the risk of Taiwan being invaded and occupied again by foreign countries, to foil the attempts of external forces to contain China, and to safeguard the sovereignty, security, and development interests of our country.” China’s stated goal is “complete national reunification.” This is reminiscent of Adolf Hitler’s approach to a greater Germany that embraced, for example, the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia.

The white paper demonizes Taiwan’s leaders, accusing them of colluding with external forces to “divide the country.” Taiwan’s leaders are “radical separatists” who have taken “provocative actions” to undermine China’s sovereignty. Taiwan’s leaders, not the CCP, the paper states, have increased tensions in the South China Sea and endangered peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. Then the authors demonize the United States for its “delusions of hegemony” resulting from being “trapped in a Cold War mindset.” The U.S. is inciting “separatist forces” in Taiwan in an effort to “create obstacles to China’s peaceful reunification.”

The authors of the white paper remind readers that China “won a resounding victory in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea” — otherwise known as the Korean War, which China’s ally North Korea started after being given the green light by Mao and Stalin. Remarkably, the white paper uses the example of Hong Kong to promote its version of the “peaceful reunification” of Taiwan and China. The crackdown in Hong Kong, in other words, is China’s version of the “One country, two systems” approach, which in reality is “One country, one system” — the system controlled by the CCP.

China warns outside powers — and specifically the United States — that it will decide its own affairs, and that “the Taiwan question is an internal affair that involves China’s core interests … and no external interference will be tolerated.” China, the paper states, “will not renounce the use of force” and will take “all necessary measures” to bring about reunification with Taiwan. “The historic goal of reuniting our motherland,” the paper concludes, “must be realized and will be realized.”

One of the world’s best China watchers, the Diplomat’s editor-in-chief, Shannon Tiezzi, notes that reunification will likely result in the harsh persecution of Taiwan’s current leadership and anyone on the island who opposes reunification. “[T]here have been clear signals,” she writes, “that any unification scenario on Taiwan would involve prosecution and jail time for Taiwan’s current leadership” for being “separatists” or “secessionists.” Tiezzi also notes that those who oppose reunification will be subject to “re-education” similar to the “massive re-education campaign” against the Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslims in Xinjiang. Indeed, she quotes China’s ambassador to France as saying, “It’s necessary to reeducate [Taiwan’s population] to eliminate the separatist thought and secessionist theory.” Tiezzi concludes that China’s white paper presents a “chilling prospect” for Taiwan’s 23 million people.

A few days after the white paper’s release, the Global Times, the CCP’s English-language mouthpiece, suggested that Americans read it if they don’t want war. “Americans still have time to read China’s White Paper … to change course … and extinguish the fuse they lit that otherwise will explode in war.”

And the Washington Times’ Bill Gertz reports that China is continuing its military exercises near Taiwan, with Taiwanese military officials stating that they detected five Chinese warships and 30 PLA aircraft in the Taiwan Strait.

Perhaps the most important takeaway from the new white paper is the lack of subtlety and the increased confidence of the CCP in its ability to bring about reunification with Taiwan peacefully or by force. China’s leaders are undoubtedly playing to a domestic audience with the white paper, but they also appear to have judged that the regional balance of power has shifted in their favor, just as the Soviet Union did after America’s loss in Vietnam and its subsequent global retreat under President Jimmy Carter. China may view President Joe Biden as a Carter-like president who has suffered from international debacles (Afghanistan) and appeared weak on the world stage. America and the West were fortunate that after Carter came President Ronald Reagan. The big question is will China wait until after Biden to make its move?",https://spectator.org/china-ericsson-nokia-retaliation-huawei-critics/,2022-08-18
China's One Child Policy: Two Cases - The American Spectator,"During these last few weeks, media reports about Chen Guangcheng’s arrival in New York and China’s brutal one-child policy continue to raise awareness in the United States about a real war on women. China’s one-child policy is supported by the UN and is sponsored by U.S. tax dollars through UNFPA. In an election year, we need to educate our elected officials and American citizens about why this real war against women must end. Consider these two cases.

Cao Ruyi Returns Home After Five-Day Detention, Still Ordered to Undergo Abortion

After several days of domestic and international media and public pressure, Cao Ruyi, a pregnant woman who had been detained for five days by Hongshan District, Changsha Family Planning Commission, was allowed to return home. However, China’s government continues to be a threat to forcibly terminate her pregnancy.

Around 9 o’clock on June 10, after performing an ultrasound exam on Cao Ruyi in the Hunan Province Women and Children’s Hospital, Family Planning officials planned to detain her at the Changsha County Women and Children’s Hospital. Despite heavy coercion, Cao resisted, and remained determined to let her child live. Family Planning officials brought her to one of three permanently rented rooms in the Beifu Hotel. They forced her to sign the Order to Terminate Pregnancy within Set Time, with the stipulation that she must have an abortion before October 16. Past that date, she would be subject to the fine of the “end of pregnancy collateral.” Cao signed the document solely because of her utter exhaustion. She returned home at noon accompanied by a cousin and a WRIC volunteer.

Cao Ruyi told the WRIC volunteer that the “collateral” was set by the Family Planning Commission at between 2,000 to 10,000 yuan. The fine imposed on her was 10,000 yuan, just for the pregnancy. If she did not pay the fine in time, the birth of the child would mean fines of over 100,000 yuan. Cao was determined to have the child. Cao was unemployed. Her husband had to support the whole family including Cao’s mother-in-law. The financial situation of the family was difficult. Paying the fines would be impossible.

Sadder yet is that WRIC has received information that Cao Ruyi has been quietly threatened by a local Family Planning officer, Yan Zhang, who told Cao that she has “friends in the military.” Cao and her family are living in fear of what acts of revenge the government may take against them. They are also worried about the prenatal and perinatal care that may or may not be available.

WRIC has found a place where Cao and her husband can live in safety from government officials until her child is born. She remains in hiding with her husband. If her husband were not in hiding, government officials would likely capture him and torture him until he agreed to help get his wife aborted.

Feng Jianmei Forcibly Aborted at Seven Months

Feng Jinmei was 7 months pregnant with her second daughter. Because Feng Jinmei is poor and her family is unable to pay the fine of 40,000 yuan that was imposed on her, Family Planning officials forcibly aborted Jianmei. On June 2, while her husband, Deng Jiyuan, was at work, Feng Jinmei fought against Family Planning officials as they tried to force her into a car. She was beaten and dragged into the vehicle, and forcibly admitted into a hospital where labor was induced. The body of her aborted daughter was savagely left next to her on her bed. [Editor’s note: A picture of this scene was included with this submission, but is too graphic to be published.]

Government officials in China remain outraged that stories and photos of this case have been released to the public, but families in China are all too familiar with the cruelties that precede and follow many abortions in China.

Feng Jinmei remains under medical treatment in Ankang City, Zhenpin County, Zengjia Town, Yupin village. Her husband remains tormented because his family’s life has been shattered.

China’s Procurator officials went to the home of Deng Jiyuan to demand answers about how the photo was made available to the media, and to forbid them to speak to the media.

Crimes Against Humanity

Women in China have no reproductive rights. No permit, no pregnancy. There is no right for women to give birth. Those are the rules. Many Americans believe that those involved in should be prosecuted crimes against humanity.

Unlike Vice President Biden, we all need to second guess China’s one-child policy, especially since China has no plans to end this policy for at least another generation. Aside from the personal human suffering each aborted woman must endure, Americans need to know about the suffering that exists for the spouses and parents and most families in China who can no longer have brothers and sisters and will never be aunts and uncles.

As Americans, we need to appeal to our President and to all of the Members of Congress, especially during this election year, to condemn forced abortion, forced sterilization, and coerced family planning in China. We need to appeal to American taxpayers to stop funding UNFPA with millions and millions of U.S. dollars that sponsor these programs.",https://spectator.org/china-expands-ties-to-asean-and-islamic-states/,2012-06-15
China’s Permanent COVID State - The American Spectator,"It all reminds me of July 1, 1987 when President Ronald Reagan nominated Judge Robert Bork for an opening on the Supreme Court. He had it made in the shade, said my complacent conservative friends. The result was brutal. But we do not have to look back 32 years to see how unruly the leftwing mob can be. Recall the recent fate of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Only his courage and unscotchable determinate saved him. The simple fact is that the conservatives are often slow on the draw against the American left. Only the Wall Street Journal and the intrepid New York Sun have come out swinging for Moore. It is time for the conservatives to rally around him. He can probably win with the President on his side. He apparently has the votes. Yet the coming battle would be a lot less bloody if the conservative movement were to take the field on Moore’s behalf — and make it clear that from now on they are going to wage war for the President’s nominees.

The CCP and China’s Predatory Industrial Policy - The American Spectator,"“China’s pattern of misconduct is well known. For decades, they have ripped off the United States like no one has ever done before,” claimed President Trump in a Rose Garden address in late May. U.S. Attorney General William Barr was similarly critical in a mid-July appraisal of China’s economic policies, claiming that “they don’t want to trade, they want to raid” and that “fair competition with China is a fantasy.”

Trump and Barr are fundamentally correct in their assessments. Although market reforms have played no small role in China’s explosive GDP growth over the past few decades, taking it from the status of a small, developing economy to overtaking the U.S. in terms of purchasing power parity, liberalization is far from the only tactic that China has employed in its long-term quest to catch up with the U.S. in terms of economic development. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, China has aggressively pursued an industrial policy wherein it uses the powers of the state to achieve world dominance in an industry, in some cases using theft and outright extortion to secure trade secrets, information, and obeisance to the CCP’s dictums regarding censorship (which range all the way from Tiananmen Square to Winnie the Pooh).

Although China abandoned the central planning model much earlier than some of its counterparts in the USSR and satellite countries, it never really outgrew the Leninist political model, wherein the party follows “democratic centralism” (that is, the population obeys the party, and political matters are only up for discussion within the party and by top leaders of the party) and operates above the law rather than observing the rule of law. Not only is this model of governance defended strenuously both at home and abroad, but in keeping with their view of its superiority, the CCP has “[adhered] to the advantage of concentrating the country’s resources to do big things” by centrally manipulating China’s economic development.

That is, China still behaves like a communist country in that they allocate economic resources towards sociopolitically key areas in order to advance the goals of the communist party. Once an industry is identified as strategically important, the party-state will mobilize all necessary resources from across the country to develop this industry. The party-state will also designate some domestic firms as rising stars or national champions, and at the same time erect barriers to foreign firms entering the industry. With a large, protected domestic market, the designated firms will be able to quickly realize the necessary scale and to lower unit production costs. Once the designated domestic firm becomes efficient, the party-state will support it as it goes out and dominates the world market. In this sense, China’s industrial policy is more like a strategy of a giant corporation — China, Inc.

Take, for example, the case of China’s electric vehicle (EV) battery firms. In addition to mandating that electric vehicle producers choose from a list of local suppliers (or risk facing the loss of subsidies as well as the ire of the government), China also acquired massive reserves of raw materials (such as cobalt) with government sponsorship. After taking these steps, China has become the world leader in EV battery production and has the largest EV battery firm. Each of the top 10 providers in China are Chinese, as are three out of five of the largest suppliers globally.

Or the solar power industry, in which China has gone from being tangentially involved to the global leader in producing photovoltaic panels in a relatively short span of time. In addition to massive subsidies, regulatory benefits, and a global search for top talent, the Chinese government was also able to lower costs by allowing firms to bypass the proper disposal of poisonous byproducts of solar panel production and instead dump them near neighboring villages without facing domestic repercussions.

While laws might get in the way of externalities like improper toxic waste disposal occurring in the U.S., China disregards seemingly any rules that might impede the party’s goals. For instance, in 2004, it was decided by the State Council that China would embrace high-speed rail travel. Domestic trains, however, were not up to the task, being considered too unsafe for passenger transportation. Their solution was to aggressively acquire the necessary technology, legally or illegally. First, the Hexie series of trains was created using control systems from a French firm, transmission technology from German ones, and power dispersion systems from the Japanese. Then, the Fuxing series was created for export, having been re-engineered to avoid violating foreign patents. Further, while the Siemens-Alstom merger has faced opposition in the EU due to concerns regarding the creation of a monopoly, the Chinese government allowed its largest rail firms to merge into one that controls over 90 percent of the domestic market. Though as an economic investment, China’s massive subsidies of high speed rail are a long way from breaking even, in terms of projecting political influence the investment is paying dividends.

The shared theme among all of these cases is that when a foreign firm is competing with a Chinese one in an industry that has been selected to advance the goals of the party-state, then the foreign firm faces an uphill battle indeed. Or, in the words of one American solar executive, “Free money is impossible to compete with.”

One of the obvious implications of China’s “state-led, mercantilist” policy is that the party-state’s goals go beyond mere economic concerns. Secretary of State Pompeo has noted that China has been stealing not only industrial secrets but military ones as well. And Christopher Wray, director of the FBI, has recently revealed that China has attempted to infiltrate academic institutions as well as pharmaceutical firms in order to spy on research related to COVID-19, with an eye towards taking credit for a vaccine or cure.

Recently, democratic countries have begun to take measures to counter China’s predatory practices, such as demanding the trading relationships with China to be fair and reciprocal. The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) enjoys bipartisan support in a variety of countries. And if democratic countries can effectively sanction unfair trading practices in a cooperative fashion, this may be an important step towards curbing the more harmful aspects of China’s industrial policy.

China's Securities - The American Spectator,"Whenever the subject of China arises, the issue of Beijing’s ownership of 21.9% of foreign-held U.S. Treasury securities (May 2010 figures) immediately is mentioned. Supposedly this factor provides China with considerable leverage over the United States, even though Japan holds 19.8%. In fact, depending on the extent of pain Washington is willing to inflict on the American financial scene, the U.S. need not be overly worried. It’s China that is in the position of greater vulnerability.

To begin with, China is well aware that it has no substantial alternative to its exports to the United States that, for example, amounted to $297 billion for the year 2009, approximately one quarter of the value of all its worldwide exports for the same year. And this figure was down from the previous year. The first thing that would occur on the occasion of China’s refusal to accept any more Treasury securities — or even a severe limitation of such — would be a requirement by Washington to make serious changes to balance the government budget. Such action clearly would firm the value of the dollar.

While such an increase in dollar value adds to the overall market value of U.S. securities held by the Chinese, it also reduces the current yield of the instruments that are held. Beijing then might seek to sell these valuable instruments, but as they have a coupon value substantially reduced, there wouldn’t be many takers. Better for China just to hold on to the U.S. paper until maturity. No leverage there.

If the Chinese just stop buying U.S. government securities and Washington succeeds in taking successful steps toward a balanced budget, the American stock markets would be expected to rise substantially, providing major cash inflows for publicly traded industries, pension plans, and —tax revenue. That’s the optimistic side of the prognostication.

More realistic would be the natural rise of interest rates acting as a brake on some sectors of the U.S. economy. All in all, however, the impact of a major reduction in China’s purchasing of U.S. Treasury securities might be just the shock needed to force serious cutbacks in U.S. Government spending. Does Beijing really want to aid the American economy to that degree?

What the Chinese have to do in any scenario is work toward bringing greater investment to development of the predominantly rural western half of their country. Here is where the need is most obvious when it comes to empowering a rising consumer base, the key to China’s economic future. So far they have made the right sounds, but serious sustained action is lacking due to internal political disagreements over where development emphasis should be placed.

The figure of 36% of GDP generally has been used to characterize Chinese dependency on foreign trade. That large figure would be far less if Beijing had taken serious steps to enlarge its consumer base presently only equal to a single major member of the European Union even though China has a population of 1.3 billion. (600 million — urban and 700 million – rural).

The fact is, however, that the cities of coastal China have been modernized often to the point of extravagance and 21st century creativity at the expense of traditional cultural values and social cohesion. Their luxurious architectural appointments have given new meaning to Gordon Gekko’s theme of “greed is good.”

Rural China meanwhile lives in traditional poverty and 19th century housing and transport conditions. Migration of the youth eastward to the coasts has become a natural passage of life — as has their devastatingly disappointed return back west. Rural unemployment figures are completely clouded by the lack of reliable statistics, but the to- and- fro movement of millions of rural youth unmistakably tells the story.

With this situation as the background to a summer of far too public disagreement between China and the United States over the value of China’s currency, the renminbi, there has been a well-reported recent effort by Beijing to lower the decibel level of conflict over financial issues. Unfortunately, the reasons behind the effort to seek a lowered tone are less economic than strictly political.

The Chinese appear to have no real interest in pressing on with an American-desired exchange rate reform leading to an appreciation of the officially recognized value of the renminbi. Last June Beijing announced it “would allow greater flexibility” (as the N.Y. Times optimistically put it), but then the Chinese government played its usual game of working the international markets to keep its currency from a speedy rise that would injure Chinese export product competitiveness.

China’s president, Hu Jintao, however, is looking forward to a state visit to Washington in early 2011 prior to his own leaving office the next year. The Chinese may be willing to toss a bone to the American administration in the form of further utterances regarding their currency flexibility. But as Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, said in her excellent English, “Our exchange rate reform can’t be pressed ahead under external pressures.”

To participate in this game of international financial poker, Washington had better come up with some smarter players than Larry Summers, director of the National Economic Council, recently negotiating in Beijing and now returning to Harvard. The Chinese, who always take a longer view, are undoubtedly gauging their next move in terms of how long they may have to deal with the Obama administration. Washington had better be thinking about what they are going to do with Beijing post-Hu Jintao.",https://spectator.org/china-hack-microsoft-solarwinds/,2010-09-24
China's Security Blanket - The American Spectator,"Information has been long recognized by the Chinese as the most potent weapon in business and war. The ability to gather, analyze and utilize confidential information is an integral part of China’s political and economic existence. Whether it be foreign or domestic, all information is considered “intelligence,” both in its semantic and operational sense; as such, all information can therefore be considered of a security concern.

In the 1970s the Chinese began invigorating their external military intelligence program aimed at penetrating U.S. and European commercial and intellectual information centers. The devices they used were as rudimentary as they were traditional. Social contacts growing out of formal meetings were extended to lavish dinners and encouragement of personal friendships; all of which led to the creation of “a relationship of reciprocal favors.” The Chinese are expert in this form of exploitation of social interaction. It’s been a staple of their contact with “the long noses” since the days of Marco Polo.

It’s hard to believe that it wasn’t until 2007 that British business executives were warned in a restricted memorandum by MI5 that their enterprises were high value intelligence targets for the Chinese security services. Perhaps it was the incident involving one of the assistants to the newly installed British PM Gordon Brown that pushed the UK’s Security Service (MI5) into action. The aide was seduced by a Chinese female agent in Shanghai who subsequently managed to steal his “Blackberry” and all the information it contained.

At least the aide had the courage to report a type of incident that undoubtedly had happened many times in previous years. It is interesting to note that People’s Liberation Army (PLA) intelligence officers along with their civilian counterparts from the Ministry of Public Security have been cited by both the UK and US security agencies as being vigorous practitioners of the arts of sexual entrapment as a means of gaining cooperation on divulging commercial and industrial secrets from businessmen traveling abroad both in China and elsewhere.

While all this appears rather old fashioned and Hollywood-esque, it actually has been an effective method for the Chinese to gain clandestine access to important computer networks. By using these stolen external electronic paths, the Chinese technicians have shown they can manipulate non-direct methods to hack into defense, foreign affairs, and elected officials computerized records.

Great attention was paid to Google’s announcement that they had “…detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google.” That the Chinese decided to electronically invade this multinational company’s infrastructure is best explained simply “because they could do it.” Whether the official Chinese hackers were seeking information on human rights activists or as a convenient pathway to more commercially sensitive and/or defense-related information is actually less important than the fact of China’s interest in and ability to penetrate some of the most sophisticated computer networks civilian and military.

The preoccupation in Chinese leadership circles with private and sensitive information has grown exponentially since long before the advent of Mao’s communism through to the 21st century’s computer revolution. Their structure of information-gathering is massive and far ranging: It includes the little old ladies who are paid to sit daily in alleyways cataloguing the comings and goings of anything and anyone of a “suspicious note.” This traditional information-gathering base expands eventually to the gargantuan organization of domestic and foreign-targeted electronic intercepts of all technical mechanisms. Chinese officialdom uses every device known in modern and ancient times to track everything said, done and even contemplated of significance to the People’s Republic of China.

Underlying this technical wizardry and human preoccupation is an abiding socio-political paranoia that pervades the vast community of government life that exists in a country of 1.3 billion people. The belief is that the non-Chinese world is jealous and covetous of all that China has accomplished physically and intellectually. The aim of this outside world is deemed ultimately to destabilize and then control the PRC.

The ten years of the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) and the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre combined to scar the experience of all the ranking leadership of China today. The political powers in Beijing and the provinces are haunted by fear of unseen dangers internal and external. With that mindset security in any sense can come only from total knowledge and control of all forces working to aid what the leaders perceive as anti-Chinese interests, economic, political, social, scientific, and military.

As a result, real and imagined foes are seen to exist at all times and everywhere. These potential adversaries must be monitored — and all who are not ethnically Chinese (Han) fall into that category. This includes all Chinese minorities. At the same time ethnic purity does not protect the individual Chinese citizen from surveillance of his actions or speech. Sun Tzu in his classic guide, The Art of War, quite clearly and extensively comments on “the dangers from without and within.” It is a lesson still followed today throughout Chinese official life.",https://spectator.org/china-hong-kong-ideology/,2011-05-27
China’s Share of Ukraine - The American Spectator,"Xi Jinping’s China, which is Vladimir Putin’s silent partner in Ukraine, is penetrating global finance, agriculture, energy, and government systems in order to amass data on a hitherto unknown scale.

Machine learning — which is well short of real artificial intelligence — has to be based on massive databases from which computers can learn and predict what the next set of data should be.

We know, for example, that China is gathering DNA data on millions of people, including Americans, for its own reasons. It is entirely possible that the DNA of a virus can be “tuned” to be deadly to one racial or ethnic group and not another. The Chinese may have such research into bioweapons well under way.

Simpler data gathering, and espionage, can be accomplished by many routes. We’ve known since the 2003 “Titan Rain” Chinese computer attacks on American networks of China’s deeply penetrating and endless attempts to infiltrate U.S. government-connected computer systems, such as those of intelligence, military, and military contractors. These attacks come hundreds or thousands of times each day.

We spend billions each year trying to guard against cyberattacks by China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Sometimes our defenses are sufficient, and sometimes they are not.

China’s efforts to gather data take many more forms and can penetrate to any level, grand or trivial.

On February 4, in Beijing, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping stood together on the opening day of the Chinese Winter Olympics. They announced a new strategic partnership between the two regimes.

In a joint statement, the two leaders said, “Friendship between the two States has no limits, there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation,” promising to work against the United States and supporting each other on Ukraine and Taiwan. Putin probably shared with Xi his plans for the invasion of Ukraine.

Xi is Putin’s silent partner in the Ukraine war.

A friend of mine has a young teenage son. He bought his son a fairly expensive Chinese-made drone, produced by a company called Da-Jiang Innovations (DJI). They took the drone to a large private area they often visit and flew it, taking videos with the drone’s camera.

A couple of weeks later, my friend checked out the DJI website. On it, he found some of the videos he and his son took. DJI, through its “AeroScope” program, gathers real-time information from DJI’s drones, which include both the recorded videos and the location of the drone operator. What happened to my friend is happening to Ukrainian forces fighting against the Russian invasion.

Ukraine has been using several types of drones to spot Russian forces and direct its own to counter them. Many of those drones were made in the U.S., Turkey, and China.

The Chinese drones are products of DJI. As a result, the Ukrainians believe, China is sharing intelligence information with the Russians that helps said Russians locate the Ukrainian drone operators. That data sharing gives the Russian forces an enormous tactical advantage in combat.

In March, Ukrainian Minister of Digital Information Mykhailo Fedorov wrote DJI’s chairman asking him to block AeroSpace from tracking any of his company’s drones that were purchased and activated in Ukraine. (Why he unwisely limited his request to only some drones in Ukraine is a mystery.) In response, DJI halted drone sales to both Russia and Ukraine and said it “abhorred” the use of drones in combat.

There is no reason to believe China has halted its information sharing with Russia because, as Putin and Xi have stated, their alliance is unlimited.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine continues with fighting concentrated in the eastern Donbas region. Russia’s defense ministry claimed that missile strikes in western Ukraine killed up to 80 Polish fighters who were trying to keep the flow of Western weaponry going into Ukraine. In Ukraine’s north, Russia has renewed its strikes on Kyiv, possibly trying to get lucky and kill Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky or at least further disrupt the functioning of Ukraine’s government.

Ukrainian forces are, as usual, outgunned. Russian artillery — which can be spotted by Ukrainian air forces, including drones — may be countered, in some degree, by the arrival of long-delayed U.S. multiple launch rockets. Whatever the result, both sides are continuing to lose troops at a steady and alarming rate.

A recent Washington Post report said that Western experts expect Russia will soon exhaust its military capabilities in the Donbas region. That’s possible, but Russia will not give up on Putin’s ambition to conquer Ukraine. If Russian forces exhaust their current capabilities, Putin might slow his campaign and regroup. He will continue to spend whatever it takes to reach his goal.

For Putin, a direct Chinese intervention, such as sending troops to fight with the Russians in Ukraine, would be a blow to Putin’s prestige that he can’t afford. It’s highly unlikely that China will intervene directly in the Ukraine war, but it will continue to intervene indirectly as it possibly has with its drones.

Russia, with China’s help, will continue its cyberwar against Ukraine. Though Russia has its own considerable cyberwar capabilities, China can — and will — aid its cyberespionage effort by, for example, penetrating Ukraine’s cellphone networks.

Putin’s alliance with Xi should be among President Joe Biden’s major concerns, but it evidently is not. That evidence is, in part, shown by Congress’s inattention to building up our forces in order to counter China’s in the Indo-Pacific region, which obviously includes Taiwan.

In a recent interview, Indo-Pacific Command’s boss, Adm. John Aquilino, contested congressional Democrats’ inattention to what he needs to counter China. They provided him with more assets such as an increase in the number of littoral combat ships, which are neither survivable in combat nor among Aquilino’s greatest needs.

Meanwhile, Biden and his cabinet, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, are more concerned with the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade.

As this column has stated before, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is the war that ended peace. Lithuania is playing with fire by enforcing sanctions against Russian shipments passing through Lithuanian land to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. By doing so, Lithuania, a NATO member, is putting itself at the top of Putin’s attack list. Meanwhile, Russia has moved nuclear-capable missiles into Belarus, which borders Ukraine.

At the same time, Xi’s military is preparing for its conquest of Taiwan.

Our military planners used to be intent on preparing for a two-front war. But we no longer have the capability of fighting such a war. Biden’s profound weakness lies in making war more likely in Europe, in Taiwan, and with Iran. He is rendering our military a shambles.",https://spectator.org/china-india-gambit/,2022-06-28
China’s Trial Balloon - The American Spectator,"As the Chinese spy balloon crisis deflates, a key question remains: Why did the PRC do it? The answer might be as simple as this: Because they could.

Maybe no one in Beijing believed that the Red Zeppelin would be allowed to overfly the entire United States. But then again, maybe they did. The Chinese intelligence community no doubt has a substantial personality profile on President Joe Biden, based on his self-admitted long association with President Xi Jinping. And Biden’s response to this crisis was true to form — risk averse, lacking in decisive leadership, yet claiming everything went according to plan. If any president was going to let this mess happen and still brag afterward, it would be Biden.

The takedown at the end — live on cable TV — folded into the administration’s “can do” narrative, but only after the damage was done. It was a case study on how to turn a potentially small-scale incident into a political headache. There was no transparency at the front end. The balloon first crossed into U.S. airspace over the Aleutian Islands on Jan. 28. The administration was well aware of this yet said and did nothing. Maybe officials were hoping it would just float away and no one would be the wiser. In fact, the only reason anyone knew about it was because days later private citizens spotted it over Montana. When asked whether the public had had a right to know about the balloon, the Pentagon responded dismissively, saying, “The public certainly has the ability to look up in the sky and see where the balloon is.”

White House crisis communications were substandard. The president said he gave the shootdown order on Wednesday, but he only mentioned it after the balloon was downed. If he knew days in advance that action was to be taken, why not say so sooner? Why not publicly engage China, telling them the balloon would be taken out unless they shared how to bring it down safely? After all, if Beijing puts those things up, it must have a way to get them back to earth. And by letting the political crisis simmer in the media, Biden’s ultimate action looked forced by circumstances rather than independent and decisive. There are a variety of communication strategies a more adroit team might have employed that would have taken control of the story, better informed the public, and put the United States in a more favorable diplomatic posture.

Perhaps Biden was slow to act because he did not want to disrupt the planned meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his counterparts in Beijing. Ultimately the meeting was postponed, but the PRC claims that no such meeting was even planned in the first place. This demonstrates the depth of contempt the Chinese leaders have for us — as if Blinken’s previous bilateral meeting in Alaska hadn’t already proved that point.

So, we are still left with the question of why the PRC did it. Though there is a chance it could, a balloon overflight is unlikely to gain any intelligence greater than what can be viewed from satellites. Perhaps Beijing was testing the capabilities for an EMP attack. There’s also the sheer impudence of it, of testing Biden’s resolve and finding it lacking.

Regardless of the primary motive, collecting detailed intelligence on how the Biden administration responded to the crisis was in itself useful to the PRC. Chinese planners benefitted from watching how decisions were made, who made them, and why. Once the balloon imbroglio was underway, Beijing could harvest all the information on how it was handled — or mishandled — and thus create a road map to anticipating Biden administration responses to future emergencies. In-depth knowledge of the White House crisis decision-making process, communications, personalities, and networks could be more important than details on the locations of ground-based nuclear forces, information the Chinese surely already knew anyway.

Is the administration intellectually honest enough with itself to treat this as a setback and learn from it? Will the National Security Council staff prepare an objective “lessons learned” study that will detail the many points of failure within this incident? Will the U.S. Intelligence Community supply the president with a comprehensive analysis of what Beijing accomplished based on the best information collected in real time as the crisis unfolded?

Because you can bet that Chairman Xi’s agents are using every bit of information they gleaned from this episode to set up the next, potentially more serious crisis.

China’s Two Front IP War - The American Spectator,"President Donald Trump’s recent decision to investigate China’s theft of American intellectual property (IP) is as good a sign as any that “America First” was more than just a campaign slogan. And when it comes to intellectual property theft, the President is entirely correct that China ranks at or near the top of all offenders regarding this crime. Moreover, the Chinese government often makes the wholesale surrender of intellectual property a precondition of doing business in its country — a fact which keeps all but the most cowardly, desperate tech companies wary of its business climate.

However, China’s strategy to hobble America through abuse of IP does not begin and end with theft or wholesale seizure. Rather, the Chinese attempt to wage economic warfare through IP policy has two fronts, one focused on hobbling American business by taking away its intellectual property, and the other focused on strangling American business within China’s own borders through even more restrictive IP policy than that followed by the United States. This second prong is less reported on, but no less deadly. Moreover, rather like the desperate cowards who abet the taking of American IP, the Chinese strategy of driving out American business with China’s own IP laws has its own set of quislings ready to defend it for the sake of sheer opportunism.

To see this strategy in action, one need only look at the actions of China’s government, which has been issuing patents as fast as it can print them, with little to no regard for quality, presumably as a means of giving Chinese businesses a way to exclude U.S. competition on IP grounds. No test case for this particular leg of the strategy has happened yet, but given that frivolous patent litigation experts are chomping at the bit to do business in China, it’s likely only a matter of time.

What has happened repeatedly, however, has been Western patent trolls suing within the Chinese legal system. Witness Canadian patent troll WiLAN deciding to pursue its lawsuit against Sony in China, rather than in Canada or the U.S., or a similar decision by the Hawaii-based troll GPNE Corp. to go after Apple in Chinese courts. In all these cases, the goal is to weaken the West by shutting it out of competition in China proper, and by exerting legal pressure on Western business through the Chinese legal system. In short, at the same time that China is stealing genuine American IP with one hand, it is generating bogus IP at home, and offering to enforce even foreign bogus IP “rights” with the other.

Now, you might wonder who is helping with this strategy at home. Well, to nobody’s surprise, trolls and opportunists stick together. As a result, a whole host of U.S.-based patent trolls and unscrupulous patent attorneys have jumped on the Chinese gravy train. With regard to the former, witness, for example, the Texas-based troll known as Longhorn IP buying up Chinese patent portfolios. Or, look at Dominion Harbor JV, another Texas-based troll, which recently decided to form a joint venture with China’s Paicheng International Technology Transfer (PITT) to enable it to more effectively “monetize” its patents (read: troll with them). Furthermore, market analysts predict that China could soon be the most friendly legal territory for patent trolls.

But the really troubling evidence of U.S.-based cooperation with this attempt to fleece American businesses through IP abuse comes from the lawyers themselves. The pro-troll blog IP Watchdog posted a thinly veiled pitch to China about how to exploit its patent portfolio in February, apparently blithely unconcerned that trolling already costs the U.S. economy $29 billion a year.

A few weeks later, famed troll apologist Paul Morinville praised the Chinese patent system. “Today, China leads the world in new patent filings,” Morinville gushed. “As a result, startups are fleeing to China.” What Morinville didn’t mention is that the reason China leads the world in patent filings is, among other reasons, that it issues patents without even checking if someone already filed a patent for the exact same invention by searching through previously submitted design schematics. Meanwhile, pro-troll legal analysts such as Dave Kappos and Russ Slifer have both praised China’s system while badmouthing the U.S. for not following the same policies, in spite of the fact that they have been repeatedly found unconstitutional by a unanimous Supreme Court and, again, cost the U.S. economy billions every year.

To see this kind of footsie-playing with a foreign power from self-interested legal and business actors is saddening, but nothing new. No doubt those people would defend themselves by saying that China is living up to their ideal principles of IP law. If so, they are either naïve or disingenuous. Can anyone kid themselves that China, whose theft of IP has become the subject of Presidential wrath, is somehow a principled defender of IP? The only reason for its adoption of a hawkish patent strategy is to economically extort the United States and make it an inferior competitor in the long run. We should be vigilant against this strategy just as much as we are against its thefts, and we should also remember the people who, in their desperate desire to screw companies like Apple, decided that screwing the United States was an acceptable side effect.",https://spectator.org/china-is-as-china-does/,2017-09-14
China’s Warning Exposes Biden’s Weakness - The American Spectator,"The world’s media captured the essence of President Joe Biden’s latest conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Headlines included “China’s Xi Tells Biden on Taiwan ‘Those Who Play With Fire Perish By It’” from Newsweek, “Beijing warned the US not to ‘play with fire’ on Taiwan” from Fox News, “China’s Xi Warns Biden Over Taiwan as a Possible Pelosi Trip Adds to Tensions” from the Wall Street Journal.

If anyone had any doubt that America’s “unipolar moment” is over, the Xi–Biden call confirms it in the worst way. Virtually all of the reports about the call leave the impression that China’s leader had no hesitancy in warning America’s president against interfering with Taiwan. The White House’s readout of the call failed even to mention China’s warning, instead using diplomatic language about managing differences and working together where the two countries’ interests align. This is the language of detente.

China senses weakness and division in the United States, and its leaders have taken the measure of a president who stumbles over words at press conferences, whose aides repeatedly have to “walk back” his remarks, and who has an historically low approval rating among the American people. More importantly, China watched as the United States under Biden botched the pullout from Afghanistan, and Chinese leaders have read, watched, and heard America’s military and political leadership identify “white supremacists,” “domestic terrorists,” and “climate change,” not China’s rise, as the nation’s greatest national security threats.

We are living in very dangerous times. The times are reminiscent of the early 1960s, when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev took the measure of President John F. Kennedy, who had botched the Bay of Pigs operation, stood by as the Soviets erected the Berlin Wall, and whom Khrushchev bullied at the Vienna Summit in June 1961. Kennedy biographer Richard Reeves remarked that at Vienna “Khrushchev walked all over [Kennedy].” Secretary of State Dean Rusk was shocked at Khrushchev’s aggressiveness toward Kennedy, especially when the Soviet leader raised the possibility of war. Historian Michael Beschloss noted that presidential aide Averell Harriman “found Kennedy ‘shattered’” by his confrontation with Khrushchev at Vienna. Kennedy himself later admitted that Khrushchev “just beat Hell out of me.” Many presidential scholars, including the late R. Gordon Hoxie (who served as president of the Center for the Study of the Presidency for more than two decades), believe that Khrushchev’s bold move to install nuclear missiles in Cuba a year later stemmed from his assessment of Kennedy’s lack of resolve during the Bay of Pigs and the construction of the Berlin Wall, and Kennedy’s poor performance at the Vienna summit.

Like Kennedy during the Bay of Pigs, Biden miserably failed his first test of foreign policy leadership in Afghanistan. Like Kennedy at Vienna, Biden was on the receiving end of his adversary’s rhetorical bullying during the recent call with Xi. Like Khrushchev at Vienna, Xi during the Biden call was the aggressor, issuing warnings over Taiwan while the White House spoke of “differences” and areas of alignment between the two world powers.

It is unlikely that Biden will be as introspective as Kennedy was — don’t expect Biden to admit that Xi “beat the Hell out of him.” But it appears that this is what transpired during the lengthy call. The big question is whether Xi’s assessment of Biden will result in China upping the ante over Taiwan the way Khrushchev did over Cuba. We may be on the verge of the most dangerous foreign policy crisis since 1962.",https://spectator.org/china-is-persecuting-muslims-and-we-should-do-something-about-it/,2022-07-30
China’s Weakened Economy Impairs Its Ability to Challenge the US - The American Spectator,"China released data on Monday that paints a bleak economic picture. In July, consumer spending, investment, factory output, real estate, and youth hiring all slowed. In response to the data, economists at Standard Chartered cut their forecast for the Chinese economy from 4.1 percent growth year-over-year to 3.3 percent.

Such a rate of growth is unacceptable in China, whose economy grew by more than 6 percent each year for 29 years before the COVID-19 pandemic and its accompanying lockdowns.

China’s President Xi Jinping is under additional pressure this year as he seeks a third term at this fall’s party congress, which he is widely expected to win. The economic woes are an impediment to his wielding of power, but they are best understood as a vulnerability that will impair China’s ability to challenge U.S. hegemony.

China wants to become the global superpower, a goal that includes developing a regional sphere of influence, challenging American power, and going after Taiwan. If it wants to be successful, it will have to do so within about two decades, as a demographic time bomb is waiting to go off due to its now-ended economically insane (and murderous) one-child policy. That means China must experience dramatic economic growth in the near-term in order to achieve its ambitions.

Perhaps the most precarious part of China’s economy right now is its real-estate market. A deflating housing bubble spurred on by Communist Party regulations is causing citizens to refuse to pay their mortgages en masse as well as triggering protests. The average price for a new home has fallen for 11 straight months.

Much of the responsibility for the economic problems lies squarely on the decision-making of the Communist Party, which voluntarily wounded the economy through intensive COVID-19 lockdowns that have dragged on into 2022.

On Monday, China’s central bank cut interest rates in an attempt to remedy the economic situation. It avoided stimulus spending, citing the country’s growing debts.

The U.S. can only hope that China’s economy will continue to spiral, making it more difficult to increase its power around the world.",https://spectator.org/china-moon-united-states-space-force/,2022-08-16
China’s Weaponization of Racism - The American Spectator,"Even as China criticizes the West for supposed racism and white supremacy, every once in a while a story slips into the American news cycle that reminds us that China is one of the most racially prejudiced societies in the world. Last week it was a series of reports of African workers in Guangzhou, a popular destination for migrants, being evicted and forcibly tested over rumors that they were vectors for coronavirus transmission. Among the examples of discrimination was a sign posted on the door of a Guangzhou McDonald’s: “Black people are not allowed to enter the restaurant,” from the same company claiming to promote “black excellence” in America.

These sorts of attitudes pervade Chinese society, from daily life to advertisements that depict Africans as dirty and contemptible. China’s rising global influence has also extended the reach of its prejudice. A viral video from February recently resurfaced of a Chinese man cajoling children in an African village to chant, “I’m a black monster with low IQ.” An investigation discovered that this video was merely one of many produced by a budding industry in which Chinese social media users pay for customized messages to be delivered by oblivious African children. Other primary sources documenting Chinese–African relations on the ground consistently show Chinese ambitions in the continent to be imperial and paternalistic as opposed to the egalitarian image promoted by state media. One example is the 2011 documentary Empire of Dust, an excellent depiction not only of Chinese infrastructure investment in Africa but also of excruciating cultural condescension.

Of course, Americans should not necessarily busy themselves worrying about race relations in another country; there are enough issues to worry about here. What Americans ought to be aware of, however, is China’s increasing willingness to weaponize the issue of racism against the West even as it downplays its own shortcomings. After Canada arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in late 2018 for breaching sanctions against Iran, the Chinese ambassador to Canada accused Canadians of “white supremacy.” After Trump referred to COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus” on Twitter, the Chinese state-run Xinhua News tweeted back that “racism is not the right tool to cover your own incompetence.”

These attacks would be significantly less notable were it not for the fact that a plethora of Western media and political figures are more than happy to signal boost these same lines of attack. The American debate over whether the terms “Chinese virus” and “China virus” were racist, as well as disproportionate media focus on discrimination against Asian-Americans, consumed several days’ worth of news cycles at a critical point early in the outbreak. In Italy, fears of being seen as racist prevented the country from taking early measures to isolate travellers arriving from Wuhan. This delay likely contributed to Italy becoming the pandemic hotspot of Europe and costing thousands of lives.

In good times and bad, Western democracies generally must answer to ethnically diverse populations. Chinese autocracy experiences no such inconvenience. The constant front-page relitigation of often trivial racism charges against Western society, if it continues unabated, will prove to be an increasingly dangerous blind spot in the ability of the West to resist Chinese propaganda.",https://spectator.org/china-moves-to-buy-off-africa/,2020-04-21
What Are China’s Wolf Warriors Afraid Of? - The American Spectator,"Admittedly, I had the all-time favorite Disney song “Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?” in my mind when I wrote this title. Remember Fiddler Pig and Fifer Pig sang the song happily, arrogantly dismissing the idea that the Big Bad Wolf is a threat? We want children to learn from the mistakes of Fiddler and Fifer. As a Chinese idiom says, “If you are too worry-free today, you must have forgotten some long-term threats.”

Unfortunately, some of our contemporary leaders do not seem to have learned from the mistakes of the little pigs. Take the case of former President Bill Clinton and leaders of the democracies in the late 1990s when they enthusiastically embraced the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with open arms and let China enter the World Trade Organization. With their confidently dismissing the CCP as a threat and with their eagerness to help, China has become the world’s largest economy with a $25 trillion GDP (as compared to the U.S.’s $19 trillion, measured by purchasing power parity) and the CCP now controls 56 percent of the GDP with no strings attached (as compared to 32 percent of the U.S. GDP controlled by the U.S. government, with many strings attached). Its enormous economic resources and totalitarian political rule have made the CCP the most powerful and feared force in the world.

In recent years, the CCP has increasingly taken a very aggressive stance against any country that dares to criticize or merely voice concerns about its violation of human rights and lawless behavior, its predatory trade practices, and its theft of intellectual property. On July 1, 2020, the CCP announced a new national security law that claims jurisdiction over the world: anyone deemed offensive by the CCP can be prosecuted by it. The CCP diplomats nowadays are hardly diplomatic at all: they curse and use mean-spirited comments when attacking other nations that question the CCP’s actions. Their behavior has earned them the title “Wolf Warrior,” which is the name of a Chinese propaganda movie promoting the superman-like power of the People’s Liberation Army. The message of the movie is that for anyone who dares to challenge the CCP, no matter how powerful and how far away they are, the wolf warriors will eliminate them.

So, it would seem that the CCP and its wolf warriors are invincible and therefore unafraid of anything.

Is that true?

If we ask the CCP’s foreign ministry spokespersons, the best-known wolf warriors, they will proudly tell us that the CCP is confident, powerful, and fearless. In fact, the CCP is so confident about itself it has created a “Confidence Doctrine” (自信论, zixinlun), which is a “signature political philosophy” of Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CCP. The doctrine orders Communist Party members, government officials, and the Chinese people to be “confident in our chosen path, confident in our guiding theories, confident in our political system, and confident in our culture.” Officially, the doctrine is termed “Four matters of confidence” (四个自信, sigezixin). The message is loud and clear: we the communists are confident.

But are they?

A recently published updated list of industries and sectors that the CCP prohibits foreign firms to enter inadvertently reveals what the CCP is truly afraid of. Below are some items from the forbidden list (in italics) and my comments:

— Not allowed: Internet information services, online publishing, online audio and video services, internet cultural operations (except music), internet information announcement, etc.

The CCP seems to be afraid of the free flow of information. If so, they must be extremely concerned about Elon Musk’s Starlink satellites, which will enable uncensored internet access from anywhere in the world.

— Not allowed: investment in law firms in China.

Indeed, there is no need for foreign lawyers to waste their time in a country where the Party’s words are the law.

— Not allowed: investment in research institutes for the social sciences and humanities.

— Not allowed: social and public opinion polls and surveys.

— Not allowed: investment in news providers.

— Not allowed: creating or publishing of books, newspapers, periodicals, audio/video products, and electronic media.

— Not allowed: radio broadcasting stations, TV stations, channels, networks, transmission stations, satellite stations, microwave transmission stations, etc.

— Not allowed: making TV programs.

— Not allowed: movie production and distribution, etc.

— Not allowed: art and cultural performance companies.

Wow, so comprehensive! Where is the CCP’s confidence?

— Not allowed: satellite and TV receiving ground equipment and key parts.

Uh oh, there goes the hope that Musk’s Starlink will bring the freedom of visiting the internet to the Chinese people. If someone in China sets up a dish to connect with Starlink’s service, he or she will be punished.

— Printing firms must be majority-owned and controlled by Chinese nationals.

Come on, even printing is controlled? The printing business is mundane, noisy, and polluting. It is a sunset industry that not many want to enter in the first place. And these firms are not content creators or providers; they are just taking orders from publishers to print their stuff! Since the CCP already has absolute, total control over content providers and publishing, why does it worry about foreign firms doing the printing? This prohibition reminds me of old communist Romania, where owning a typewriter was illegal, and of the not-so-old China of the early 1990s, when the importing of facsimile machines or copiers was tightly controlled.

These forbidden items lay bare the CCP’s lack of confidence and turns its supposedly fearless wolf warriors into a joke for all the world to see. Notwithstanding its mountains of money and huge stockpile of nuclear weapons and millions of police and powerful party machine, the CCP is actually very weak and terrified of one little word: truth.

China’s Zero-Tolerance COVID Policy Is to Protect One Man - The American Spectator,"The pandemic has been wreaking havoc in China, not due to the virus but due to the Chinese government’s policies. Shanghai has been locked down since March 28, and people are scrambling for food and other vital supplies on a daily basis. The government has ordered the city’s 22 million people to be tested for COVID numerous times. A friend of mine in Shanghai wrote on social media, “So far, the government had ordered me to do 12 antigen tests and 16 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). Furthermore, I am scheduled to do the 17th NAAT tomorrow.”

The capital city of Beijing is not spared, either. After a few cases there, Beijing is on the verge of being locked down, causing Beijingers to hoard food. The running joke is, “Shanghainese are in lockdown waiting for food, and Beijingers get food waiting for lockdown.”

Some smaller cities have fared much worse, and their plight has not even been reported. For example, Ruili, a small town in the southwest bordering Myanmar, has had lockdowns on and off for 160 days.

We all know that the newly mutated virus is more transmissible but causes less severe disease. This means that it is difficult to contain it using frequent tests and large-group quarantines, which increases the chances of cross-infection. And lockdowns do not work effectively or efficiently, either. But the damage of China’s policy is enormous: Shanghai’s economy is at a standstill, people lack supplies, and patients are left untreated and die. The cost greatly outweighs the benefit, if any.

The inhumane, anti-science, and impractical nature of China’s zero-tolerance COVID policy is clear to everyone, including the Chinese Communist Party leadership. So why is the CCP so determined to carry it out?

We cannot answer that question for sure because the CCP keeps its decision-making secret. But we can analyze using logic and observations.

The logic of dictatorship is that society serves the top ruler, not vice versa. Since the founding of communist rule in 1949, the whole of China has revolved around the top leadership. The lives of the top leaders are the most valuable and thus shrouded in secrecy, including where they live, their families, and their health status. When they travel, roads are blocked and commercial flights yield. The late ruler Mao Zedong loved to travel by train. When he rode his private train, the whole railroad system would be reserved for him, making numerous trains stop and ordinary passengers wait. Changan Avenue in the center of Beijing, which connects the CCP’s headquarters, is frequently closed to the public when party leaders travel. (READ MORE: Why China Got Away With It)

Extending from this logic, protecting the top leadership from COVID has the highest priority. Unfortunately for the powerful, the COVID virus does not discriminate between the powerful and the powerless — it loves all people equally. More unfortunately, the powerful people have a higher chance of getting COVID because they have more functions and see more people — secretaries, guards, drivers, maids, and subordinates.

All of this makes protecting the rulers from COVID difficult. The most effective way to protect them is to make sure the people they contact (the first layer) are clear of the virus. To achieve this, the first layer of people must make sure that the people they contact (the second layer) test negative for the virus. For example, China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, meets provincial leaders regularly, the provincial leaders see city mayors, and the mayors summon county heads, who eventually meet residents. If residents get COVID, they can infect the county, city, and provincial officials all the way up to Xi. That cannot be allowed to happen. Therefore, to protect Xi, the entire country must be shielded. This, I believe, is the logic behind the lockdowns.

As long as China’s political system remains a top-down dictatorship, the zero-tolerance COVID policy will continue. We will see a universal health code (without a green code, one cannot go out), COVID testing, mass quarantine, and lockdown normalized. Sure, the zero-tolerance policy will severely affect the economy, but that is secondary because for the CCP, absolute rule is the No. 1 and only goal. If the top leaders are not well protected, why do they need a good economy?

Of course, the party leaders never reveal this goal to the Chinese people. On the contrary, the CCP always tells the people that the party’s goal is “to serve the people.” Likewise, the zero-tolerance COVID policy is touted by the party as protecting the people. And many brainwashed people believe it.

While public opinion in the democratic countries is critical of China’s COVID policy and media coverage focuses on the inhumane treatment of people there, one critical fact tends to be overlooked: So far, there has been no significant mass resistance or protest against the policy. The tight control, severe punishment, and brainwashing have made most people in China quite obedient. This “success” demonstrates the great ability of the CCP to mobilize the entire population and society for its cause, be it eliminating the COVID virus, overtaking Taiwan, or rivaling the democratic world, including America. The democratic countries should take this into account in every interaction they have with China.

China’s Advance on Taiwan - The American Spectator,"The potential for bloodshed in Taiwan is rising dangerously as the Chinese government ramps up its military presence in the region. This move signifies China’s willingness to use military force to assert its claims of sovereignty over the semi-independent island nation, the Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu warned on Wednesday.

In recent months, Beijing, which considers Taiwan a part of China, has been increasing the frequency of military exercises in the Taiwan Strait. The exercises are widely believed to simulate an invasion of the island. The Chinese military conducts flights in Taiwan’s vicinity almost daily, making itself a major source of concern for the Taiwanese government.

“What it is doing now is unceasingly preparing to use force to resolve the Taiwan problem,” Wu said. “If international society does not give China a sufficiently clear signal, I believe China will take it that international society will not impede it in doing other things,” he added. “This is what we are extremely worried about.”

Taiwan has been a self-governing, democratic nation state since 1950. It was established at the end of the Chinese Civil War, when forces of the deposed Republic of China fled to the island as Communist leader Mao Zedong forcibly seized power. Today, the Chinese government insists that nations cannot have diplomatic relations with both Taiwan and China, as it does not recognize the island’s sovereignty. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan after the nation elected Tsai Ing-wen, a supporter of Taiwanese independence, as president in 2016.

Taiwan is part of an ever-growing list of countries and territories that have found themselves on the receiving end of Chinese antagonism in recent months. The situation between India and China escalated in mid-June after Chinese forces killed 20 Indian soldiers in a border dispute. India responded by limiting the operations of Chinese technology firms in the country. At the end of June, the CCP implemented a new security law in Hong Kong that has the potential to squelch the Hong Kong independence movement by imposing a maximum sentence of life in prison for promoting secession. China has also been accelerating its years-long push for sovereignty over the South China Sea by conducting military exercises and constructing islands in the hotly disputed region.

China’s aggression towards Taiwan is just the latest manifestation of its imperialist ambitions. Without America’s economic and political support, countries that value their freedom and independence will be undermined by the pernicious advance of the CCP. America must take China’s imperial aspirations into consideration when writing future foreign policy towards the belligerent Communist regime.",https://spectator.org/china-new-world-order-geopolitics/,2020-07-24
China’s Three-Child Policy and the Philosophy of Reproduction - The American Spectator,"Wang-sun Chia asked: “What does this saying mean: ‘It is better to sacrifice to the god of the stove than to the god of the family shrine’ ”? The Master said: “Nonsense. If you offend Heaven, there is no one you can pray to.” – Analects, 3.13

Of all the myriad horrors that attended China’s Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, surely none was more impious than the destruction of the Cemetery of Confucius. It was on November 7, 1966, that members of the Jinggang Shan Red Guard Corps of Beijing Normal University swore a solemn oath to “annihilate the Kong family business,” and within three days communist acolytes were pouring into the city of Qufu, in Shandong Province, home of the Kǒng lín, the “Kong Forest of Gravestones.” Situated just beyond the northern gate of the city walls, the necropolis was home to the mortal remains of some 100,000 descendants of Kǒng Qiū — better known as Kǒng Fūzǐ or Confucius — who had been laid to rest there over a span of two millennia, their burial chambers and barrows sheltered beneath imposing stands of cypress and pine trees. A place for quiet contemplation, for placating the resident spirits, and for preparing for one’s own journey to the afterlife, the site was a powerful locus religiosus, but also a social venue, where clan ties could be maintained and renewed over the centuries.

The Red Guard Shock Brigade was entirely uninterested in such high-minded considerations. Upon arriving in Qufu, guardsmen led by the dogmatist Tan Houlan established a Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Station to Annihilate the Kong Family Business, held a boisterous Mass Rally for the Thorough Smashing of the Kong Family Business, and assembled a Poor-and-Lower-Middle Peasant Grave-Digging Team to assist in the grisly work of exhuming corpses, smashing stelae, and pulling down the temple fronts and commemorative arches that lined the cemetery’s ancient spirit-ways. Revolutionary zealots then paraded through Qufu, defacing statues of the great sage, rounding up local scholars, and organizing struggle sessions. The descendants of Kǒng Fūzǐ were treated with contempt, ridiculed as “Filial Sons and Virtuous Grandsons Paying Last Respects to Kong the Second Son.” A total moral inversion was taking place, in which age-old virtues like filial piety and ancestor-worship were derided as the type of reactionary values to which only superannuated “ox-devils” and “snake-spirits” would cling.

Actually disentombing tens of thousands of human remains proved to be a rather daunting task, however, and on November 29 the Red Guard settled on a compromise: the Kong line would be laid to waste “from beginning to end,” which was to say that Confucius, his sons, and his grandsons, as well as the most recent three generations of his descendants, would be disinterred. Later that day, the Red Guard proudly drafted a telegram to be delivered to Chairman Mao:

Dearest Chairman Mao, One hundred thousand members of the revolutionary masses would like to report a thrilling development to you: we have rebelled! We have rebelled! We have dragged out the clay statue of Kong the Second Son; we have torn down the plaque extolling the “teacher of ten-thousand generations”; we have leveled Confucius’ grave; we have smashed the stelae extolling the virtues of the feudal emperors and kings, and we have obliterated the statues in the Confucius Temple!

As Sang Ye and Geremie Barmé have noted, Confucius’ grave was not actually “leveled” there and then; “the reality was that on the first day the grave was flattened, on the second day a three-metre deep trench was dug, but by the third day the rebels had run out of patience so they used dynamite to blow up the site. The grave was effectively obliterated.” Meanwhile some 100,000 classical texts were pulped or consigned to bonfires, thousands of ancient pine trees were cut down, and the famed archway bearing the inscription Wangu chang chun, or “Eternal Spring,” was vandalized. If Confucius was the voice of the ancient Spring and Autumn period, the Red Guards were bringing about a veritable cultural nuclear winter.

Yet a carnival atmosphere nevertheless prevailed in Qufu. Visitors to the demolished cemetery could take in the macabre sights, and nauseating smells, of the desecrated burial ground. Who, after all, could pass up the rare opportunity to grab a stick and poke the corpse of the 76th generation Duke Yansheng as what was left of the great man dangled from a tree? The Yansheng name meant “Honorable, Overflowing with Sagacity,” traits seldom on display in Qufu that cruel winter. Kong Fanyun later recalled, “as for the atmosphere, it was just like a temple fair, there were such jostling crowds. Some were outsiders but also members of our extended family. Some even prodded the corpses with sticks. Forget all that stuff about ours being a noble family honored by ages. No one bothered covering up the nakedness of our ancestral grandmothers, let alone bother taking them away.” I am reminded of Nicolás Gómez Dávila’s immortal aphorism: “Stupidity is the mother of revolutionary atrocities; savageness is only the godmother.”

By the following spring, some 2,000 more graves had been defiled as treasure hunters descended on the grounds in what later commentators called a pafenchao, or “grave-digging frenzy.” By late August, 1967 the Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Station to Annihilate the Kong Family Business had wrapped up their mission, summarizing their campaign in one final, contemptible dispatch:

The dog emperors of the past have all fawned over Old Kong. They declared him to the Ultimate Sage, the First Teacher and the Mentor of Ten-thousand Generations. All the plaques with these words on them in the Temple were pulled down and burnt. Then the raging torrent swept into the Confucius Cemetery where stelae were smashed and the Kong tombs dug up. Let all those saintly people in their finery and with their solemn bearing kneel before Old Kong’s grave and eat dirt!

In the Confucian Book of Rites, we are told that “the greater a wound is, the longer it remains; and the more pain it gives, the more slowly it is healed.” The self-inflicted wound of the Cultural Revolution, typified by the sick, twisted spectacle that took place in Qufu in November 1966, will take a very long time to heal indeed.

Shortly after the destruction of the Cemetery of Confucius, the People’s Daily published an editorial, submitted by the Mao Zedong Red Guard of Beijing University but reflecting the official party platform, declaring that “to struggle against Confucius, the feudal mummy, and throughly eradicate … reactionary Confucianism is one of our important tasks in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.” Mao’s so-called Anti-Confucian Campaign was thus conceived as part of the Criticize the Bourgeois Reactionary Line agenda and a continuation of the class struggle waged by the “proletariat” (rather loosely defined here) against so-called “feudal parasites.” By vilifying the ideology that had underpinned and sustained Chinese civilization from time immemorial, the Chinese Communist Party had set into motion a series of events that would have long-lasting implications not just for Chinese culture but for Chinese demographics.

Zongli Tang, in his 1995 Population and Environment article “Confucianism, Chinese Culture, and Reproductive Behavior,” observed that “traditional Chinese reproductive behavior is strongly influenced by Confucianism,” adding that in the Confucian conception of the world,

All movement in the universe is part of the process of reproduction. If reproduction stops, nothing on earth would exist any longer; society would disappear, and the world would be destroyed. The philosophical idea of “reproduction as the fountainhead of a flourishing and prosperous world” has helped to formulate the Chinese reproductive behavior: “the more the children, the more the fortune.” … It is not only the Confucian world view that is based on the thought of yin and yang, but also all Confucian fundamental ideas start from the “reproduction worship.” In a sense, Confucianism is a philosophy of reproduction.

With its fundamentally pro-natalist approach, Confucianism thus “brought an indomitable vitality to Chinese reproductive behavior. Even when the population grew beyond the capacity of natural resources, particularly the capacity of the land, the Chinese people did not change their reproductive behavior by attempting to reduce fertility.” Instead, “the reestablishment of ecological balance was achieved through violent turmoil. Civil wars which usually led to a change of dynasty caused a large number of deaths; then the population decreased to the level where a new ecological balance was established.” Tsui-jung Liu, in a wide-ranging 1985 study of the genealogies of two Chinese clans in Zhejiang province, found that “Chinese reproductive behaviour did not change markedly until the introduction of family planning in the 1950s,” notwithstanding the series of unbelievably bloody convulsions that wracked China over the centuries.

China’s “one-child policy,” begun in 1978 just as the Cultural Revolution was being officially wound down, thus represents another sort of moral inversion, another sharp break with the Chinese past. Shocked by projections that the Chinese population would reach an (admittedly) astonishing four billion by 2080, Chinese authorities implemented a Family Planning Policy aimed at curbing population growth, and quickly. In some cases, the assessment of a “social child-raising fee” was enough to persuade families to limit the number of offspring, while elsewhere more invasive measures were taken. The anthropologist Erik Mueggler, in his 2001 monograph The Age of Wild Ghosts: Memory, Violence, and Place in Southwest China, described how

Birth planning gave the state access to the most intimate of all realms. Surgeons’ scalpels made this access material as they cut into female bodies to perform IUD insertions, tubal ligations, and abortions — the predominant contraceptive methods in rural areas. The objects of these surgical incisions, wombs, were the most intimate places of all, and fundamental to every vision of social unity…. In justifying these policies, they [the state] no longer appealed to class struggle or even to personal enrichment but to the utterly abstract issues of “quantity and quality of the population.”

The notion of “population quality” is redolent of eugenics and Social Darwinism, and official expressions of concern regarding “negative selection” — higher reproduction rates of minority ethnic populations — tend to confirm this suspicion. Party apparatchiks fretted that the ethnic minority population could reach 567 million by 2048 and that “populations most deficient in quality were growing the fastest,” making the policy of invasive anti-natalism, the very antithesis of Confucian “reproduction worship,” a matter of allegedly existential national importance.

Four decades later, the effects of China’s decades-long experiment in compulsory birth planning are finally being felt. A recent New York Times analysis of global birthrates, “Long Slide Looms for World Population, With Sweeping Ramifications,” predicted

an especially sharp decline for China, with its population expected to fall from 1.41 billion now to about 730 million in 2100. If that happens, the population pyramid would essentially flip. Instead of a base of young workers supporting a narrower band of retirees, China would have as many 85-year-olds as 18-year-olds. China’s rust belt, in the northeast, saw its population drop by 1.2 percent in the past decade, according to census figures released on Tuesday. In 2016, Heilongjiang Province became the first in the country to have its pension system run out of money. In Hegang, a “ghost city” in the province that has lost almost 10 percent of its population since 2010, homes cost so little that people compare them to cabbage.

Interestingly, China’s rival Taiwan fares much, much worse in this regard, having managed to achieve the world’s lowest total fertility rate (TFR) on the planet (1.07 children per woman, as compared to China’s 1.60, with 2.1 being replacement level). Hong Kong, Macao, Singapore, and South Korea are likewise cratering, though Russia’s 1.60 TFR and the United States’s 1.84 TFR are not particularly high themselves, at least in historical terms. (Niger leads the pack with a 6.91 TFR.) Mindful of the long-term implications of the one-child approach, Chinese authorities first experimented in the 1980s with a “1.5 child policy” (hard to achieve on an individual family basis, but a common enough metric in the modern world) before adopting an outright “two-child policy” beginning in 2016. A “three-child policy“ was then announced on May 31, 2021, at a meeting of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party. There exists widespread skepticism that these refinements will have the intended effect. As the satirical Twitter account “China Nonghua News” cleverly framed it, “BREAKING: Because citizens do not want to have Second Child, our China Central Planning committee will now authorize Third Child.”

*****

China’s “one-child policy” was a product of its time. In 1972, the Club of Rome commissioned an influential study, The Limits to Growth, the same year the Ecologist published A Blueprint for Survival, which argued that overpopulation would bring about “the breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life-support systems on this planet.” These works were doubtless inspired by Paul Ehrlich, who in his 1968 The Population Bomb had gloomily predicted that the 1970s and 1980s would be marked by widespread famine. “The battle to feed all of humanity is over,” Ehrlich lamented, and it is unsurprising that the Chinese scientist and party official Song Jian, after encountering this wave of pessimistic reports, would counsel the Politburo to take steps to reduce his country’s population to an ideal 700 million. (Song was evidently gifted with considerable foresight, his projections having proven spot-on, if the above-cited Times report is to be believed.)

To address the subject of overpopulation is to tread on dangerous ground. We would do well to avoid the clinical anti-natalism of the Chinese Politburo, or that of those on the left who seek to “abolish the family” and “denaturalize the mother-child bond,” a program sure to lead to societal implosion. The Pentti Linkolas of the world, for their part, have failed to win friends and influence people by proposing that “births must be licensed,” while bemoaning how it was only “by a twist of man’s tragicomic fate, [that] at the very point when the institution of war appeared capable of taking out truly significant shares of fertile females — as was intimated by the bombings of civilians in the Second World War — military technology advanced in such a way that large-scale wars, those with the ability to make substantial demographic impact, became impossible.” This sort of misanthropy is unlikely to garner widespread popular support, even if there is a sort of internal logic at work.

At the same time, we must always keep in mind Leopold Kohr’s dictum that

Whenever something is wrong, something is too big. If the stars in the sky or the atoms of uranium disintegrate in spontaneous combustion, it is not because their substance has lost its balance. It is because matter has attempted to expand beyond the impassable barriers set to every accumulation. Their mass has become too big. If the human body becomes diseased, it is, as in cancer, because a cell, or a group of cells, has begun to outgrow its allotted narrow limits. And if the body of a people becomes diseased with the fever of aggression, brutality, collectivism, or massive idiocy, it is not because it has fallen victim to bad leadership or mental derangement. It is because human beings, so charming as individuals or in small aggregations, have been welded into overconcentrated social units such as mobs, unions, cartels, or great powers.

One does not need to accept every contention made by, say, A Blueprint for Survival to accept its authors’ fundamental premise that centralization, globalism, extreme population density, concrete sprawl, industrial overreach, and monoculture have proven highly detrimental to the public good and that “local government should be strengthened and as many functions as possible of central government should be transferred to it,” the better to avoid the situation, widespread today, in which “men, women, and children are merely consumer markets, and industries as they centralize become national rather than local and supranational rather than national, so that while entire communities may come to depend on them for the jobs they supply, they are in no sense integral parts of those communities.”

The dire forecasts of the late ’60s and early ’70s may have failed to materialize, but these days, as Merlin Sheldrake noted in his recent study of fungi, Entangled Life, “global agricultural yields have plateaued, despite a seven-hundred-fold increase in fertilizer use over the second half of the twentieth century. Worldwide, thirty football fields’ worth of topsoil are lost to erosion every minute. Yet a third of food is wasted, and demand for crops will double by 2050.” An “alarming deterioration” of the health of trees has likely been caused by “a disruption of their mycorrhizal relationships, brought about by nitrogen pollution.” Our demands on the environment, and our predilection for conspicuous consumption and promiscuous waste, will have profound ramifications in the decades to come. Heinrich Heine’s neologism comes to mind: weltkuddelmuddel, a world-engulfing mess, with no obvious way out.

Population booms and busts are nothing new, of course, regularly occurring as early as the Neolithic. Pre-modern populations were generally kept in check by disease, famine, over-exploitation of natural resources, and warfare, rather than by technology and ideology. The curious thing about our own epoch is that we are experiencing concomitant booms and busts. Emmanuel Macron notoriously suggested back in 2017 that Africa’s “civilizational” problems are not limited to “failed states” and “complex democratic transitions” but also include “demographic change,” adding that “when countries still have 7 to 8 children per woman, you can decide whether to spend billions of euros [on aid, but] you stabilize nothing.” Macron’s controversial comments came around the time Denmark’s minister for development cooperation, Ulla Tørnaes, was offering some $14 million from her nation’s coffers for family planning initiatives, on the grounds that “part of the solution to reducing migratory pressure on Europe is to reduce the very high population growth in many African countries.” The Biden administration, meanwhile, has revoked the previous administration’s enforcement of the Mexico City Policy and Kemp-Kasten Amendment, opening up funds for family planning education, birth-control distribution, and abortions abroad. At the same time, governments in Hungary, Russia, and elsewhere have been offering up “maternity capital,” tax incentives, free school meals, and other benefits to encourage the formation of larger families. A successful effort to tamp down fertility in certain parts of the globe, while boosting it in others, would seem to require something of a delicate dance.

Mark Steyn has always maintained that “the future belongs to those who show up.” It will be interesting to see whether population dirigisme — China’s three-child policy, Russia’s maternity capital policy, Hungary’s nationalized IVF clinics, or Poland’s 500-złoty monthly stipends per child, to take only a few examples — will help those nations to avoid the suck of the demographic tides. These modest programs may very well prove inadequate, given the deeply rooted source of the demographic crisis. Alexis de Tocqueville, in his passage “Of Individualism in Democratic Countries,” diagnosed the origins of the problem early on: “The woof of time is every instant broken and the track of generations effaced. Those who went before are soon forgotten; of those who will come after, no one has any idea: the interest of man is confined to those in close propinquity to himself.” Christopher Lasch similarly warned of the consequences of the modern and postmodern world’s “shattered faith in the regeneration of life,” the loss of any “sense of historical continuity, the sense of belonging to a succession of generations originating in the past and stretching into the future,” the tragic divergence of daily life from the “great biological stream.” This deracination necessarily implicates every aspect of our existence, our collective TFR included. “Humans have survived,” wrote the archaeologist Alexander Langlands in his magisterial Craeft, “because of an ancient practice intrinsically based in the local — a fundamental connection to the land on which we live. Having lost that connection, we now find ourselves at the mercy of the global winds of change, relying almost religiously on the vision of a hi-tech future to solve the crisis of ever-rising food prices and population growth” (or decline, in certain cases). These are weighty matters that go far deeper than anything your average national or transnational bureaucracy can address with a few judicious policy tweaks, economic incentives, and informational pamphlets.

Contemporary China is in the grip of something of a neo-Confucian revival. President Xi Jinping, in his 2014 keynote speech at an international conference marking the 2565th anniversary of Confucius’s birth, declared that the “values and spiritual world of the Chinese people have always been deeply rooted in the fertile soil of China’s traditional culture” and that “the Chinese Communist Party is the successor to and promoter of fine traditional Chinese culture…. We have consciously absorbed nutrition from the teachings of Confucius to those of Sun Yat-sen.” “Xi Jinping Thought” cannot be adequately understood without recourse to Confucian thought, albeit filtered through “socialism with Chinese characteristics.” Ceremonies commemorating Kǒng Fūzǐ are once more held in Qufu, and the Qufu County Cultural Relics Management Committee continues its efforts to re-purchase “funerary objects dispersed among the masses” during the madness of the Cultural Revolution. Reproduction is once again viewed as “the fountainhead of a flourishing and prosperous world.” Things have come a long way since the “Thorough Smashing of the Kong Family Business,” but will this ideological reversion accomplish its goal? Chinese authorities have long been confident in their ability to channel their subjects’ behavior through “thought reform,” re-education, and social engineering. It is one thing to influence people’s system of ideals via propaganda or their economic behavior via inducements; it is another thing altogether to reshape people’s reproductive predispositions after decades of countervailing indoctrination.

The Chinese state once sought to improve the “quantity and quality of the population,” and now it is scrambling to secure its very demographic future. Whether or not it succeeds will in large part determine the course of the century to come. The stakes are considerable: China’s ambitions will not be easily realized if it becomes a “super-aged state,” with its population pyramid turned on its apex. Perhaps China can defy the odds and increase both its standard of living and its birth rate. Or perhaps the Chinese will, like the rest of the developed world, find themselves increasingly at the mercy of the global winds of demographic change, obliged to rely on a vision of a high-tech future that helped create the crisis in the first place. What we do know is that Mao and his immediate successors took filial impiety to new heights, waging a pitiless Anti-Confucian Campaign while eradicating the age-old Chinese “philosophy of reproduction,” and today’s commissars must now grapple with China’s Confucian legacy and its communist repudiation. For this reason, it seems fitting to end on an explicitly Confucian note. “Ruin from Heaven we can weather,” Mencius wisely counseled, but “ruin from ourselves we never survive.” Surely China will not be the only country learning this lesson afresh in the years to come.",https://spectator.org/china-nuclear-arsenal-threatens-taiwan/,2021-06-13
Chris Smith on Joe Biden and China's One-Child Policy - The American Spectator,"

Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey, a Republican who’s been a leader on pro-life and other human rights issues, was on the Laura Ingraham show today to discuss Vice President Joe Biden’s comments, in China, about that country’s one-child policy. (Biden said that he “fully understands” and isn’t “second-guessing” the rule.) Here’s a transcription of some of what Smith said on the show:

This is just exposing what this administration has been doing from day one. Just like the eight years of the Clinton administration, and that is to enable dictatorship, to enable forced abortion and forced sterilization. Let’s not forget that at the Nuremburg War Crimes Tribunal, forced abortion was properly construed to be a crime against humanity. It is no less a crime against humanity today and there is our Vice President saying that he fully understands the one child per couple policy that has made brothers and sisters illegal in China.

…

Hillary Clinton, en route to Beijing, after being selected as secretary of state, said, I’m not going to allow human rights to interfere — her words — with selling or peddling our debt, as well as global warming. Obama — when he had Hu Jintao in town, who ought to be held for genocide and crimes against humanity at the world court, he said nothing, had a state dinner for this man who ought to be behind bars, be held to account for these atrocities, including those focused on women.

It is hideous. Women are hunted down, if they evade these family planning cadres into the ninth month, they are forcibly brought into a clinic and [their children] are aborted. I had a…Chinese student here in the United States, who finally got asylum, and she told her story, how they literally held her father, they held other people until she surrendered for this so-called voluntary abortion, and then she literally, roughly, had her baby removed. And, as she said, they actually put one of the body parts on her to mock her. I mean, that’s how cruel this policy is. And there’s Joe Biden, saying that he fully understands this one-child per couple policy. That is an outrageous statement. He prides himself on his combating violence against women. This is the worst, most pervasive act of violence against women anywhere in the world. It is systematic, and it is state-sponsored. And the United States of America under Obama, Hillary Clinton, and now the vice president, in this outrageous statement, is showing the world that we do not care about Chinese women and about Chinese babies.",https://spectator.org/china-nuclear-weapons/,2011-08-23
Communist China’s Plot for World Domination - The American Spectator,"Earlier this year, Ian Easton, a former China analyst with the Center for Naval Analyses and currently senior director at the Project 2049 Institute, a think tank that focuses on U.S. security interests in the Indo-Pacific region, wrote a book titled The Final Struggle: Inside China’s Global Strategy. In his author’s note, Easton describes the book as an analysis of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) “plan for world domination.” Easton contends that a close reading of President Xi Jinping’s speeches — some of them never before translated — reveals that that CCP is committed to spreading China’s communist totalitarian model of rule around the world.

Easton makes clear in the book that China’s goal of “world domination” does not envision Chinese armed forces conducting a long series of military invasions with “hordes of tanks, and fascist storm troopers swarming across the map” and “goose-stepping into fallen capital cities.” The CCP’s global strategy, he explains, “is much more sophisticated” than Hollywood visions or American novels of World War III. Instead, the CCP’s strategy involves “a protracted campaign of silent invasions to replicate on a global level what it sees as its own superior system.” The CCP’s geopolitical goal is a “totalitarian world order” led by China.

Easton calls the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) “the armed wing of the Communist Party.” It is the “largest military on earth and probably the single largest and most sophisticated intelligence collector in human history.” And he shows the integral ties between the PLA and Chinese “businesses” that in reality serve the CCP and its policy goals. Unlike capitalist enterprises, Chinese firms serve Beijing’s rulers, not private shareholders. So when American companies and firms do business with Chinese counterparts, they are really doing business with the CCP. Easton calls this “China’s Military-Civilian Fusion,” which presents opportunities for the PLA to “infect” American electronics during peacetime and wartime. It is no accident, as Marxists like to say, that strategists envision World War III beginning with Chinese cyberattacks on U.S. military facilities. Easton worries that China may achieve — if it already hasn’t — the ability to control foreign electronic networks.

In a sense, Easton’s book shows that the CCP took to heart Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin’s prediction that the capitalists would sell communists the rope with which communists would hang the capitalists. And Easton doesn’t buy the notion proclaimed for years by members of the American foreign policy establishment that China’s leaders have abandoned communism and adopted state capitalism to support the regime’s political legitimacy. In a recent article in the Diplomat, Easton reveals speeches where Xi stated that “realizing communism has been the party’s supreme ideal and ultimate objective” and that “realizing communism is an objective that happens … in stages, one step at a time.” He also urged CCP members to “struggle for communism our entire lives.” These remarks were made in 2017 and 2018. Easton also notes that Xi “has repeatedly called [Karl] Marx ‘the greatest thinker in human history.’”

The reason so many Western observers believe China has abandoned communism, Easton explains, is because “Since the late 1970s, China’s government has gone to great lengths to encourage a foreign perception that Marxism and Leninism were all but dead and China would gradually assimilate into the post-war international order and become a ‘responsible stakeholder.’” This has enabled China to “gain access to the international system without being changed by it,” Easton writes. He calls this effort — begun by Deng Xiaoping — ”a campaign of global infiltration.”

Easton describes the Central Party School of the CCP’s 2020 textbook (which, he notes, was not translated into English), titled The Fundamentals of Xi Jinping Thought on Chinese Socialism in a New Era. The book is used in nearly 3,000 training centers in China, in which “students are indoctrinated and prepared for leadership positions in government, society and business.” The training centers groom China’s elite and “mold the minds of future national leaders.” The textbook teaches that “the global economy and global markets” must be state-controlled. Free-market capitalism will be replaced by the socialist economic model, which will organically unify the market and the state. Xi Jinping thought as manifested in the textbook, Easton writes, aims to spread communism throughout the globe. “China’s foreign policy and all its strategic actions abroad — everything the CCP seeks to do and have in the world — is reportedly guided by this vision,” Easton writes. This is Xi’s “China Dream.”

Easton in his book presents a vision of what the world would be like for Americans and all other supplicants to the CCP’s world order. The CCP has constructed a “brutal system of repression through forced labor, brainwashing, systematic rape, sterilizations, invasive birth control, and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment” in China, especially against the regime’s dissident groups, such as the Uyghurs. It is an “Orwellian system” that uses technology, social media, computers, cellphones, televisions, and artificial intelligence to hyper-intrusively control the lives of its citizens. That is the system Xi Jinping wants to spread across the globe. (READ MORE from Francis P. Sempa: China Moves to Buy Off Africa)

Easton credits the Donald Trump administration for finally deciding “that the American people had a need to know about the national security threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party” after years of successive U.S. administrations attempts to “engage” China to join the rules-based international order. In 2019, Trump’s national security team — including the national security adviser, FBI director, attorney general, secretary of state, and secretary of homeland security — launched what Easton calls a “coordinated information blitz on a scale not seen since the 1980s” that sought to awaken America and the West to China’s threat. It was a concerted effort to “peer into the minds of our strategic rivals,” Easton writes. But it got sidetracked by dubious impeachment efforts and the controversial 2020 election. Easton’s book is an attempt to get this effort back on track. But there is little sense that the Biden administration — for all of its tough talk — understands the existential nature of China’s threat.

During Cold War I with the Soviet Union, there were plenty of people — especially liberals — who derided notions that the Kremlin’s leaders sought world domination. They did, but Ronald Reagan understood this and took effective steps to place the Kremlin on the geopolitical defensive and implemented policies that brought about the demise of the Soviet Union. There will be those during Cold War II with China who will be equally dismissive of claims that China wants to dominate the world. But Easton’s bona fides are supported by the likes of Mike Pompeo, Matt Pottinger, Aaron Friedberg, and Toshi Yoshihara — all serious and scholarly China watchers. If they recommend Easton’s book, it should be read and studied by America’s policymakers. Easton bases his contention on the words of the CCP’s leaders. And China’s geopolitical actions — its aggression in the South China Sea, its military threat to Taiwan, its Belt and Road Initiative, its massive military buildup, and its strategic partnership with Russia — are fully consistent with Easton’s dismal prognosis.",https://spectator.org/china-offers-no-mercy-during-the-vaticans-year-of-mercy/,2022-09-13
Communist China’s Meat Grinder - The American Spectator,"It all reminds me of July 1, 1987 when President Ronald Reagan nominated Judge Robert Bork for an opening on the Supreme Court. He had it made in the shade, said my complacent conservative friends. The result was brutal. But we do not have to look back 32 years to see how unruly the leftwing mob can be. Recall the recent fate of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Only his courage and unscotchable determinate saved him. The simple fact is that the conservatives are often slow on the draw against the American left. Only the Wall Street Journal and the intrepid New York Sun have come out swinging for Moore. It is time for the conservatives to rally around him. He can probably win with the President on his side. He apparently has the votes. Yet the coming battle would be a lot less bloody if the conservative movement were to take the field on Moore’s behalf — and make it clear that from now on they are going to wage war for the President’s nominees.

Congress Should Investigate China’s Government Over Coronavirus - The American Spectator,"Congress should turn its investigative attention on China’s role in the coronavirus pandemic. There is no doubt that coronavirus is a health and economic crisis of unique scale. There is also ample evidence that the disease began there. Finding out how great a role China’s government has had in it is central to fighting this outbreak and preventing future ones.

Coronavirus is a global pandemic. That alone should indicate its impact; but it does not begin to do it justice. Apart from its substantial and still rising death toll, its economic one follows like aftershocks behind an earthquake.

America alone has one million confirmed cases and over 56,000 deaths. Tens of millions are unemployed. The physical and economic costs are not close to fully being counted and may never be. There is reason to believe life will not return to its previous normalcy and certainly will not for some time.

Three months ago, it would have been inconceivable to say the world’s most powerful and wealthiest nation would be in lockdown. No war, no terrorist attack, no disease has ever inflicted this.

Those are just the U.S. impacts. Globally, there are three million cases and around 210,000 deaths — so far. Of course, these will climb, especially as coronavirus migrates more remotely into areas less able to combat it. The world’s economic impact could reverberate for years, living standards falling commensurately.

Clearly, coronavirus’s direct and indirect impacts are staggering and will be for some time. Equally clearly, coronavirus started in Wuhan, China. Less clear, but even more concerning, are reports that it came from a lab in China — a lab that had sparked safety concerns from U.S. diplomats just two years ago.

The Chinese government has denied any link between coronavirus and the Wuhan lab. But the Chinese government has been anything but forthcoming throughout the coronavirus crisis. Even if not directly culpable, it has not been credible, to the point that its lack of candor has made them indirectly indictable.

The seriousness of the crisis and the origin of the disease are ample reasons for an investigation of the Chinese government’s role in it. Coronavirus’s global impact has spawned a global responsibility, yet it is one the Chinese government has refused — and continues to refuse — to accept.

Their lack of transparency gave coronavirus the time needed to become a global pandemic. It is worth determining if the Chinese government went beyond this sin of omission to one of commission. What was the lab doing and why? What was its skill level? Will continue its work, or, more ominously, escalate it?

Even if the Chinese government had no direct hand in coronavirus’s release, it would be invaluable to know what was done to prevent its spread. Also, it would be useful to know how to prevent a recurrence.

These answers could help protect people’s safety now and going forward. If nothing else, America and the world deserve answers for the suffering and cost endured.

Compared to all the investigations the House undertook last year, and all they surely intend to undertake regarding the spending of CARES Act funds, the role of the Chinese government in the coronavirus crisis easily dwarfs those in importance. Pursuing such an investigation would elevate Congress from “gotcha” to “got your back.”

Critics will say such investigation will be extremely hard. The subject matter is complicated; the COVID-19 pandemic’s details are complex and convoluted; and the Chinese government will be, as it has been, uncooperative. Its very difficulty, however, argues for such investigation.

Certainly, the Chinese government will not willingly give answers, so another government must try to. The news media’s histrionic coverage has proved it utterly unfit for so important a job. The World Health Organization? It has shown itself more worthy of investigation than investigating.

There is no one else but Congress, acting in bipartisan fashion, to undertake such an investigation. Never has an investigation been more warranted. Never have there been more important questions — literally of life and death — to be answered. America’s former UN Ambassador, Nikki Haley, has launched a petition calling for just such a congressional investigation; she is absolutely correct.

It is time to discover with what we are dealing, not just in coronavirus, but in China’s government. For too long we have indulged the fantasy that China’s government is not unlike others — all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding. Coronavirus is the withstanding evidence.

The question is how false has China’s government played America, the world, and its own people. The answer is yet to come. One thing is certain: It will not come from China’s government. Absent official investigation and public details, China’s government will resume operation as before. And that is precisely what put the world at the mercy of a merciless global pandemic.

Bush as the director of communications in the Office of Management and Budget and as deputy assistant secretary in legislative affairs for tax and budget at the Treasury Department.

Corruption Haunting China - The American Spectator,"There is a practice in China that has been going on for many generations, but most prominently since the expansion of trade with the West in the 1800s. It has become accepted that whenever an advantageous exchange occurs a material or monetary “grateful thanks” will be offered. This is called a cumshaw, a foreign bastardization of the Mandarin, and it can be anything from a hotel gratuity to some special “additionality” to a multi-million dollar industrial deal. Under recent communist governments officials at all levels, including generals, have become rich by receiving cumshaws after approving certain civilian contracts and military purchases. What originally was a custom expressing thanks to an impoverished servant has led to high-level corruption — and China’s new president wants it rooted out.

If the State Department of the United States were not so pre-occupied with trying to extricate itself from its miserable performance under the last two world-traveling secretaries, it might have been able to focus on America’s greatest competitor who also happens to hold the single largest portion ($1.317 trillion) of the immense foreign debt of the United States. China is going through a period of dealing with historic corruption. Less than fifteen months ago China’s new president, Xi Jinping, warned that he considered his country infected with the disease of what he referred to as “rampant corruption and bribe-taking.”

The year-long investigation begun by President Xi purposely has centered on senior civilian officials and top officers of state-owned companies. The military connection, which is far more devastating to the nation’s economic probity, has remained one of Beijing’s most closely held study subjects. Focus is placed on rockets to the moon and the dangers posed by the U.S. Pacific Fleet when China’s greatest economic and political problems remain in its own socio-cultural infrastructure.

Tying together this practice of high level gratuities that give recognition of the special relationship between “giver and receiver” is the very active practice of guanxi. This is an activity not unlike the networking among people of the West who have similar backgrounds, economic and political ties, and club relationships that are often tied to fraternities of university days. The broader and more influential one’s guanxi, the more effective is one in his business and political dealings.

The Chinese Communist Party developed its own guanxi over the years in which having participated in Mao Tse-tung’s Long March — and later being related to someone who had been on the March — was the single most important element in post-WWII networking. This shared experience in the revolutionary development of modern China tended to fall apart during the Cultural Revolution, but has since returned with a new vigor. When President Xi speaks of bringing back “old values,” he means a reformation and reconstitution of this commitment and its relationships that were the initial factors that brought about cohesiveness in the leadership of contemporary China. It is not unlike the siloviki of intelligence and security backgrounds who helped build and protect Vladimir Putin’s post-Brezhnev rise to power.

The new guanxi of China today may be broader and more inclusive of both civilian and military leadership components within the Party, but it’s just as calculated. What makes any congress of interests work, however, is the discipline and loyalty of the participants and a careful division of the advantages gained by the special status. The fraternal links with disgraced Bo Xilai, ex-party secretary of Chongqing and son of a former prominent Long March veteran, have been tracked down and detained.

Following Xi Jinping’s general directions, the Party’s Discipline Inspection Commission has rounded up major executives in the oil and gas industries who had close ties with a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee — who was also a close friend of Bo Xilai. The former head of the State-owned Assets and Supervision Commission, part of the same “Bo club,” was also detained. High and low level managers are under scrutiny as the Office of the President keeps careful tabs on the roundup.

President Xi Jinping obviously intends to cleanse the workings of both the government and private sector. The military is undergoing a similar “purification,” even if it’s far less public. Any anti-corruption campaign of this note in China includes military relationships with private suppliers, both foreign and domestic. The relatives and friends of on-duty officers as well as many retired generals have ownership positions and/or employment in various industries and trading firms. The guanxi is extensive and intricate. China’s new and vigorous leader has his hands full.

Aside from the few branch and desk officers in Washington specifically concerned with matters of the Peoples’ Republic of China (PRC), little attention is paid by the political echelon of the Obama Administration to matters Chinese. Every now and then some interest is shown by the policy planning element of the Pentagon to the growing power of the Chinese in space and at sea — but not to the degree the issue demands.

Conflict between China and Japan regarding ownership of some small islands in the East China Sea did bring a statement from the State Department. But the muted reaction of the Secretary of Defense over Beijing’s declaration of an expanded new maritime and air defense zone in that area gives some idea of the lack of priority or even attention being paid by the White House to the largest still-communist country in the world. Somehow President Obama’s call for a “pivot to Asia” just doesn’t seem to have stirred his foreign affairs bureaucracy. It seems like a good strategic time for President Xi Jinping to do some house cleaning while attention is elsewhere.",https://spectator.org/china-prepares/,2014-01-26
Countering China and North Korea - The American Spectator,"North Korea underlined its threat to America by choosing July 4 to launch its first intercontinental missile, and followed it with another launch into Japanese waters. We had hoped China might intervene, but its continued support of North Korea showed how unrealistic that was. China regards the Kim Jong Un regime as a useful a pawn for breaking the U.S-South Korea-Japan alliance.

So some U.S. response is called for. But what? An attack on North Korea’s nuclear program would start an offensive war for which we have no plans and no objectives. Since economic relations with China are mutually beneficial, commercial sanctions on China are a double-edged sword. We should do something, but by highlighting our frustration U.S. officials have reassured China and North Korea that their plans are on track.

Instead, President Trump and Secretary of Defense Mattis could have issued one sentence: “From this day on, it is the policy of the Untied States to protect against any and all ballistic missiles coming from anywhere.” Presuming they meant it, that would have shown China’s support of North Korea to have been counterproductive. It would increase America’s security, and strengthen our alliance with South Korea and Japan.

This would represent a change because today, and since the late 1960s, the policy of the United States has been not to defend against ballistic missiles coming from Russia or China. President George W. Bush’s much ballyhooed 2002 withdrawal from the 1972 ABM Treaty masked the reality that the U.S. government has chosen to divide antimissile programs into the artificial categories of “theater defenses” — carefully designed not to interfere with Chinese or Russian missiles – and “national defenses,” carefully designed to be inefficient and un-expandable, respectively.

Much of Chinese diplomacy, and of Russian diplomacy as well, is aimed specifically at keeping this policy in place. It serves them as a trump card in major confrontation. In addition, an America that chooses not to build the equipment necessary to protect itself finds it difficult physically and politically to protect allies. That is why a reversal of this U.S. policy with regard to our defense would cut the ground from under Chinese and Russian bellicosity.

In 2017, however, it is essential to be clear about the meaning of the much abused word, “policy.” A policy is not a set of wishes or preferences, nor any discrete actions (e.g. it is our policy to do this or that). Nor is it “softness” or “hardness.” Least of all is policy to be confused with that Washington DC cleverish invention, “declaratory policy”: words advertised to mean something other than they say.

Charles de Gaulle gives us an accurate definition of policy: “that ensemble of continuing objectives, of matured decisions, of measures brought to term…” In practice, it means that the government thinks of the many ways by which to achieve what it wants, decides to do the many things that it takes, and sees them through.

Ironically, keeping America undefended against major missile threats has been very much our policy. Since the 1970s, the arms-control community and its allies in Congress have effectively policed Pentagon programs to make sure that they would not produce capabilities to defend America. Thus the Army was forced to “de-scope” its newest interceptor, which eventually became the Patriot that is now deployed from Japan to Saudi Arabia. The anti-missile system now being deployed in South Korea survived only by calling it “Theater High Altitude Air Defense” (THAAD) and curtailing its anti-missile properties. For decades, the Navy was afraid to admit that its Aegis anti-aircraft radar, fire control system, and missiles could shoot down missiles, lest they be cut back. All these systems are less than they could be.

The “national defense” arsenal was limited to one site in Alaska (plus a token force in California). That gives us a handful of super-expensive, hemisphere-spanning interceptors. But none of these are allowed to be launched before incoming warheads come over the radar horizon. The kicker? Even as North Korea gins the capacity to hit Hawaii, the U.S government prohibits the Aegis test facility on Kauai from “going operational” to protect the islands. Not defending U.S soil is a policy indeed, by now hard-wired into Pentagon managers and their industrial contractors.

If Trump and Mattis meant to reverse this, they would have to show similar thoughtfulness, employing people who understand that geography requires a decisive use of orbital space for defense of U.S. territory, and thoroughness in sorting the useful from the harmful in current programs. Changing the major policies of a major government requires intelligent stick-to-itiveness. Seriousness is the prerequisite.",https://spectator.org/china-puts-the-full-court-press-on-americans-in-nba-controversy/,2017-07-31
Public Health Elites’ China-Friendly COVID Narrative - The American Spectator,"The COVID-19 Catastrophe: What’s Gone Wrong and How To Stop It Happening Again

Richard Horton

(Polity, Second Edition, 180 pages, $17)

It is clear to everyone that the world of COVID-19 into which we have been hurled will become a turning point in our history. I started writing for this august publication about COVID in early March 2020, as the pandemic hit a nursing home within walking distance of my house. Something big was happening. We could feel it in our bones.

It is therefore inevitable that we would start logging the history of this pandemic before the pandemic is even over. In the first few months, it seemed to me that this turning point would bring us together as a nation and perhaps as a global community. But as the months went on, it became clear that there were a set of people who sensed opportunity in the air. This moment of history was not, to them, a moment to heal and unite, but a moment of leverage in which we can craft the right narrative to bend the curve of history when it is most pliable.

The COVID-19 Catastrophe was first published on June 22 of last year, when we were only a few months into this crisis. The second edition has been recently released, and it is this version that I’ll be addressing. Written by Dr. Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet and a fierce advocate for the role of the World Health Organization (WHO) in international health policy, this book stands as a rich insight into what high-level public health officials think about what has happened with COVID-19 and the global changes that will emerge from this crisis.



At first, The COVID-19 Catastrophe presents as a simple and open fact-based account of this pandemic. There is an excellent chapter that walks through the timeline of the virus from December 2019 to April 2020, and it reads like a horror movie in which the audience knows the murderer is right behind the door while the characters stroll forward with confident ignorance.

Dr. Horton documents some of the emerging realization that everything is about to change, but the book walks a tightrope between simple facts and narrative-building exercises. Winston Churchill famously snarked, “History will be kind to me, for I intend to write it,” and that desire is the engine pulling this book forward. The heroes of this book are the individuals and institutions closest to the author: the WHO, public health professionals, and, incredibly, the Chinese government.

It is in the China narrative that we raise our first eyebrow. Dr. Horton helpfully informs us of the brave Dr. Li Wenliang (please write his name down and remember him for years to come for his heroism), who warned his colleagues of COVID as it tore through his hospital. He was forced by the Chinese government to recant before he ultimately succumbed to the disease. But Dr. Horton then praises China for sharing the COVID genome as early as January 12. But he neglects to note that this was a week after it was sequenced and that the lab that released the genome was shut down by Chinese authorities in retaliation.

Herein lies my primary skepticism about this book. Dr. Horton praises “Chinese science” for the release of the genome but omits the entire story behind this. To one degree, he and I agree wholeheartedly. “Chinese science” is a hero of this story — but only if we agree that “Chinese science” was performed by brave and sacrificial Chinese scientists who were subsequently persecuted, attacked, and muzzled by the Chinese Communist Party. I want to call that out in this review because Dr. Horton does not in his book.

Like Dr. Horton, I’m trying to walk a fine line. If you want a public health insider’s account of the COVID-19 catastrophe, this book will get you most of the way there. But the history is presented as a Swiss-cheese accounting, with certain elements conspicuously missing. The subtitle promises to tell us “What’s Gone Wrong and How to Stop It Happening Again,” but we only hear about that first part. I’ve scoured the book for how to stop this happening again, and there are precious few details about what, exactly, could be done if we discovered a new virus sweeping the world tomorrow. Dr. Horton recommends enlarging WHO funding and calls on governments to police social networks and crack down on an independent press that dares to contradict professional public health advocates. He envisions an emerging world in which public health officials are an unquestioned authority and given complete control over the levers of government policy. Public health institutions are to be the main sources of truth, honesty, and the very survival of a global humanity. He laments “the world will not have a full and complete opportunity to learn from Taiwan’s success … because the country’s observer status at WHO meetings is blocked by the Chinese government in Beijing,” as if truth must necessarily come through an official source like the WHO or it cannot known.

This reliance on the WHO is the author’s downfall. In the next decade, there will need to be a conversation about how we can improve the both the quality of public health institutions and the public’s trust in those institutions. I agree with Dr. Horton’s claim that we need reliable and trustworthy public health institutions to help mitigate the next pandemic. Where we diverge is that Dr. Horton believes the problem is that the WHO is underfunded (he calls President Trump’s decision to cut WHO funding “a crime against humanity”), while I think that there is much larger-scale reform needed that reaches far past dollars and cents.

If you’re interested in what this expanded funding will buy us, you will not find it in this book. Dr. Horton evidently does not see any failures in the realm of public health during this pandemic, or, if he does, he does not highlight them. He recounts no errors on the part of the WHO, does not bring up any of the failures of the CDC, and, incredibly, does not even mention the FDA or their role in the early testing debacles or slow movement on vaccine approvals.

This book suffers from an insider bias in a way that we’ve seen repeatedly in the last year. Last March, while conducting an interview with WHO adviser Bruce Aylward, Radio Television Hong Kong reporter Yvonne Tong asked Aylward if the WHO would consider Taiwan’s membership in the organization, which has been denied in order to maintain a healthy diplomatic relationship with China. Aylward acted as if he didn’t hear the question, and, when it was repeated, he hung up on Tong. When she called back, he pretended that the call was accidentally dropped, and when she reiterated her line of questioning, he ended the interview.

The clear message was that it was not worth telling the truth if the truth would annoy the Chinese government.

We get that sense all throughout this book. Dr. Horton’s harshest words for China come when he writes that “The Chinese government owes the world a more detailed explanation of what took place in Wuhan” and then proceeds to praise Chinese scientists and health workers. Don’t misunderstand me — that praise is entirely appropriate. May I be struck dead before I impugn the heroism and sacrifice of the Chinese scientists and doctors who gave their lives and reputations to warn us all of the coming storm. But given the repeated punishment and censorship of those scientists by the Chinese Communist Party, maybe we should be a hair more skeptical of the Chinese government’s role here.

The problem here is that Dr. Horton is not able to admit to skepticism of the Chinese government. Perhaps he is, in his personal life and correspondence, skeptical about the authenticity and transparency of the CCP. But that skepticism has not made it into this book, which is intended as a history of the COVID-19 pandemic.

When I say that this is a history from the perspective of international public health officials, this is how that history plays out: Dr. Horton allows his righteous fury to flow, but only against certain targets. The Western world was unprepared for this pandemic, but he allows that criticism to rest in a certain anonymity. No one in particular is responsible for the disaster of COVID in the Western world, according to Dr. Horton. Though Italy was ground zero for the first explosion of COVID in the West, the Italian prime minister’s actions or response policies to that early crisis are not mentioned at all. There are only a few mentions of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was still shaking hands at meetings well into March. Dr. Horton has no words of rebuke for any of the French authorities, though France hosted the world’s largest Smurf convention even after the entire country of Italy was locked down. And Chinese President Xi Jinping is a non-character in this book.

In the context of the United States and the United Kingdom, however, the villains are well known. President Trump is lambasted repeatedly for his COVID response, as is British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. An undiscerning reader may come to believe that these two politicians were responsible for the entirety of the COVID crisis around the globe.

Why is it that certain targets are ripe for ridicule while others seem out of bounds? The answer is that Dr. Horton is conducting his own interview. He is attacking the institutions and individuals that he may safely attack from his position. These include the Western world in general, populist and right-wing leaders, and the cultures in the West that are widely dismissed in the elite realms of public health and academia.

When it comes time to criticize more left-wing figures or the Chinese authorities, Dr. Horton discovers his restraint. Knowing he will need the goodwill of the Chinese government in order to perform a postmortem investigation on this crisis, he chooses not to irritate them or otherwise give them reason to bar anyone in the WHO from that investigation. This is a laudable goal, as the investigation to come will require diplomacy, grace, and cooperation from the famously vindictive and censorious Chinese government. But perhaps this role makes him unsuited to write a straight history of this crisis.

Dr. Horton’s book is bold when he confronts the powers who have no sway over him, who can deliver no rebuke, and who cannot impact his future work. But his tone shifts immensely when he begins to speak of those who do hold sway, who can impede his efforts, and who actually do hold power in his world.

The COVID-19 Catastrophe is indeed a history of this pandemic, but it is a history that lives within history. We cannot possibly understand it until we understand the forces against which the author strives even to this day. When Dr. Horton writes, he writes as a denizen of the most elite world of public health. We must interpret his words as what is most acceptable in that subculture.

When he condemns the West for our response to the threat of COVID-19, we must understand that this is an acceptable opinion within his world. When he singles out the United States and United Kingdom for specific derision, we must keep in mind that this is not because the UK or U.S. have been performed overwhelmingly poorly but because it is permissible within his social context to publicly dismiss these countries. His praise of China as an abstract entity, muddling together the rebellious heroism of Chinese scientists while quietly implying that the Chinese government was their partner rather than their persecutor, is similarly intentional.

All this does not mean that I do not recommend this book. We are still in the middle of this crisis, and there are many more stories to tell. I suspect that, if there is a “final say” on this pandemic, it will be written by our children, who will be more able to hold in their minds the perspective of history as both an academic review of events and the personal experiences that will end up defining this era.

The COVID-19 Catastrophe will certainly be one of the texts upon which we rebuild our recollection of these days. But we must recall its omissions and seek to fill in the gaps. We must remember what has been omitted if for no other reason than to honor the heroes that history would rather we forget.",https://spectator.org/china-religious-freedom/,2021-02-12
COVID Come November: Lockdown/China Showdown - The American Spectator,"My previous article addressed the issues surrounding China’s role in spreading the pathogen worldwide. This November will see a broad set of policy issues arising out of the pandemic’s progress: (1) civil liberties v. lockdowns; (2) economy shutdown v. open-up; (3) what to do about China; (4) immigration; (5) traditional education’s 19th-century model v. a distance-learning 21st-century model; (6) innovation; and (7) media bias. The first three are covered in this second installment of what has become a COVID election trilogy, with the final article to be posted soon.

Civil Liberties. The Wall Street Journal’s Alyssia Finley presents Aaron Ginn, leader of the lockdown skeptic community — rejected by the pro-lockdown medical establishment, censored by the social media gatekeepers, scorned by mainstream media, but followed avidly by anti-lockdown state legislators, governors, and the White House. (Ginn’s March 20 essay, Evidence over Hysteria — COVID-19, taken down by its original online website, is here.)

Ginn, backed by credentialed medical experts, stated that with 13 percent of Americans believing that they were currently infected with the virus — a “mathematical impossibility,” he wrote — a “full-on” panic was underway. He noted that the standard 60-70 percent herd immunity would entail massive deaths, but that other estimates placed it as low as 10-20 percent. As to social distancing, Australia and Germany place the minimum at five feet, while Sweden, where schools for those under 16 were never locked down, applies a “good judgment” yardstick.

Over half of America’s 3,145 counties have zero coronavirus deaths, according to a May 4 compilation by the Heritage Foundation. The totals show 52 percent with zero, 28 percent with five or less, 9 percent with 15 or less, and 11 percent with more than 15. Sliced from the other end, 30 counties — less than 1 percent of the total — have half the cases and account for 57 percent of COVID deaths. New York and New Jersey combined accounted for 38 percent of cases and 48 percent of deaths, despite having only 14.6 percent of the population. May 14 figures provided by the New York Times show that by population density and per capita cases/deaths, blue states heavily predominate among states hardest hit.

Urbanist Joel Kotkin warns that “hygienic fascism” — turning the world into a “safe space” — amounts to a dictatorship of scientists. Kotkin quotes celebrated Brave New World author Aldous Huxley: “A truly scientific dictatorship will never be overthrown.” Kotkin writes,

Information technology monitoring can provide detailed data on the virus in America, but at possible cost to civil liberties. Thus, USC, in partnership with the University of Texas and Emory University, is creating a coronavirus contact-tracing app similar to China’s Orwellian “social credit” system. California’s Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom is activating a contact-tracing army of 20,000 regulator-snoops to enforce a mandatory quarantine regime. Pursuant to Newsom’s directive, Ventura County’s health director stated that families already are being forcibly separated:

[W]e will find everyone with COVID-19 and we will isolate every one of them and we will make sure that they stay quarantined and we will check in with them every day. In other words, what this program means is we’re going to do a more complete job, we’re going to do a more meticulous job of making it less and less possible for others in the county to run into someone with COVID-19 infection.

Newsom’s plan includes another three months of lockdown for Los Angeles County and the San Francisco Bay area. L.A. County’s population alone is greater than that of 41 states. CBS reports that armed robberies are up 50 percent in Santa Ana (in Orange County, and part of the L.A. metropolitan area), as wearing face masks are commonplace now and no longer indicate probable criminals.

Michigan’s Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who increasingly strikes me as Hillary without the pseudo-charm, has summarily detained a 77-year-old barber who refused to close his barbershop. Despite a judge’s order allowing the barber to remain open, and the local sheriff declaring he would not close the place, Whitmer sent the bureaucrats to arrest him, without even a semblance of a hearing. Quoth She Who Must Be Obeyed: “These executive orders are not a suggestion. They’re not optional. They’re not helpful hints.” The sheriff, for his part, has said he will not enforce Whitmer’s executive orders. Patients and medical professionals are suing Whitmer for creating by executive fiat a “medical time bomb”: so-called “non-essential” elective surgery postponements will soon lead to avoidable patient deaths.

Contact-tracing proposals include one that pays snitches $25/hour to report lockdown violators, who could be summarily jailed without due process. A CBS survey (3:58) of initiatives underway provides chilling evidence of how intrusive it can be, with comfortable assumptions that anonymity and privacy can be preserved and that tech companies will not abuse their access to surveyed devices. One neurosurgeon warns that face masks can harm healthy people by inhibiting oxygen intake.

South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem is the un-Whitmer. Presiding over a state whose population density is 11 per square mile versus New York City’s 26,000, South Dakota’s death rate of 4 per 100,000 as of May 4 is a micro fraction of NYC’s 161 per 100,000 — the latter number a steep increase from May 4’s 127. When, a month ago, 300 workers at a meat-packing plant tested positive for coronavirus, Noem resisted calls to lock down the state. Another milestone: the Wisconsin state supreme court vacated a bureaucrat’s decree locking down all businesses she deemed non-essential. The panel ruled that state law required consulting the state Legislature — both houses are under GOP control in such emergency decisions. Peggy Noonan writes that those protesting lockdown have had tougher lives than those imposing them. A citizen rant sums up (4:01) the revolt against the “experts.”

Kevin Williamson writes at National Review Online that those who violate lockdown laws must, per classic civil disobedience, be willing to go to jail. But should the father who played catch with his kid on his front lawn, violating absolutist Gov. Whitmer’s orders, really have to be willing to go to jail for doing so?

Williamson’s “lock them up” follows the mid-century civil rights revolution, when black people would do sit-ins at local diners, etc. That model does not fit today’s protesters and violators. Sit-ins involved a relatively small army of activists. Whitmer is acting as a Soviet commissar ruling over Michigan’s entire 10 million population. This amounts to a de facto police state.

The governor’s orders are both — cue the lawyers — constitutionally “overbroad” and “arbitrary and capricious.” Short of jail without due process, those playing on the lawn and other minor violators can be put under house arrest with ankle bracelet monitors. Sending them to jail would raise their risk of catching COVID-19. Video surveillance can detect those leaving their houses in violation.

Colorado’s department of public health has adjusted its COVID-19 death count downward, from 1,150 to 878, to take out patients who had the virus but died of other causes. This is a 24 percent reduction. The CDC’s May 15 COVID-19 tally shows total U.S. cases at 1.4 million, with 86,000 deaths; a 24 percent adjustment would place the total at 66,000. These numbers are higher than a typical flu season, but still well below the 1957 Asian and 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemic per capita equivalent figures (see my May 10 piece for The American Spectator). A number of recent studies put COVID-19’s fatality rate much lower than CDC’s 6 percent — below 1 percent. One study says 0.1 percent. The current CDC number is close to the 6.5 percent U.S. death rate from the 1918–20 pandemic that killed 675,000 out of 104 million Americans. But CDC’s current number is way high, because nearly all people being tested are symptomatic; the number of people infected will dramatically increase as testing expands to asymptomatic people.

Economy. America is being plunged into its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, with over 36 million jobless as a result. Officially dated 1929–33, the Great Depression was followed by a major recession, from May 1937 through June 1938, that sent unemployment back up to 20 percent. It took World War II to reignite America’s economic engine — what FDR called the “Arsenal of Democracy” in a 1940 speech. On the plus side, historian John Steele Gordon writes that some jobs lost will eventually be replaced upon recovery. Stellar columnist Walter Russell Mead sees American ingenuity unleashed. Massive regulatory entanglement has been removed, and one hopes there will not be a reimposition after the pandemic subsides. But the Atlanta Fed warns that the COVID-19 shutdown may shrink GDP by more than 40 percent. U.S. GDP was $21 trillion in 2019, 17.5 percent of global GDP. Thus a 40 percent fall would lop $8.4 trillion off U.S. GDP and 7 percent off of global GDP. Another harbinger of things to come: April, the first full month of COVID lockdown, saw an all-time monthly record 16.4 percent fall in U.S. retail sales, following an 8.3 percent drop in March.

Health-care maven Betsy McCaughey, instrumental in stopping HillaryCare, warns that another month’s lockdown in NYC will devastate small businesses. A prime casualty could be NYC’s legendary Strand Bookstore, one of the finest bookstores on the planet. Gov. Cuomo is proposing a new law requiring corporations to hire back all furloughed employees or return all COVID money. Many firms will go bankrupt if this passes.

China. An exchange between Fox Business Network anchor Maria Bartiromo and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) during her recently aired special America v. China offers the most plausible explanation as to why China’s rulers allowed the COVID-19 pathogen to escape their borders and wreak havoc around the world. Cotton said that the Chinese decided that “if they were going to suffer an economic contraction, they were not going to allow the world continue to prosper, and China be the only country whose economy was declining.” To which Bartiromo responded, “In other words, they didn’t want to see the Chinese economy contract 20 percent, with the rest of the world contracting 2 percent.” Cotton answered, “That’s exactly right.”

Put simply, China waged not only economic warfare, in allowing a deadly pathogen to be clandestinely spread worldwide; in doing so, China also knowingly inflicted massive harm — millions of COVID-19 cases, hundreds of thousands dead — on the global body politic. In all, it is tantamount to waging aggressive war against most of the world’s countries.

New tests reveal that COVID-19 arrived in Washington state in December 2019. The most comprehensive China coronavirus video (55:46) recounting China’s biolab research and deceptions lays the foundation for making China pay the entire cost imposed on America and other key countries. Within a couple months, public opinion turned massively against China, seen as clearly the culprit for having concealed the pandemic it created. U.S. intelligence recently concluded (correctly) that the virus originated in China’s Wuhan biolab, and escaped by accident. China slipped in a last-minute clause, requiring negotiation of any changes in the natural-disaster clause in the U.S.–China Jan. 2020 trade accord. China’s policy has been called a “new ‘Boxer’ movement” — after the 1900 rebellion by the self-styled “Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists” that was driven by intense xenophobia towards Westerners and Christians.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said that (5:05) China should be made to pay for the vast damage its lies and obstruction have caused worldwide. One possibility, she suggested, is reducing the debt we owe China. One critical manufacturing priority is to build five semiconductor fabrication plants, at $20 billion each. It is the only way to ensure that no back doors are embedded in chips if made overseas. The Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Jonathan Schanzer reveals a Mideast partial fix to exiting the China supply chain for pharmaceuticals: Egypt and Jordan. China currently is the largest exporter of medical devices, and second-largest exporter of drugs, to America.

Bottom Line. By midsummer it should be clear whether the lockdown or the reopen course is better. Courtesy of federalism, the voters will have the chance to endorse favored approaches. Come the fall, the main issues will be (a) lockdown v. opening up; and (b) what to do about China.

Immigration, education, innovation, and media bias will also figure in. These will be covered in a final COVID election article.

The only non-COVID issue that might intrude sufficiently for voters to add it to the agenda as a major concern is if one or more vacancies open up on the Supreme Court.

Critics Skeptical of U.S.-China Trade Deal - The American Spectator,"President Trump said his aides are drafting ideas for an agreement with China that could end or at least help alleviate the trade war brewing between the two countries.

“We’ll make a deal with China, and I think it will be a very fair deal for everybody, but it will be a good deal for the United States,” he said on Friday.

Trump plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1.

Analysts told Bloomberg that any deals made at G-20 would likely be more of a temporary truce than a long-term solution to the trade spat between the two countries.

Reuters reported that Trump warned he still may place more duties on Chinese goods, although some progress has been made between the two countries to resolve their differences.

“China very much wants to make a deal,” he said. “We’ve had very good discussions with China. We’re getting much closer to doing something.”

In July, the Trump administration imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports, which was matched by China. Another round of $16 billion of duties on Chinese imports was also matched. Trump added $200 billion more to the tally in August, with China responding with $60 billion in tariffs on American imports.

Trump has suggested he could slap tariffs on another $267 billion of imports.

Since the U.S. imports much more Chinese goods than vice versa, China can’t match the tariffs tit-for-tat going forward, although experts warn that the country could strike back with sales restrictions of rare materials.

Trump hopes to reduce America’s $375 billion goods trade deficit with China, as well as force the Asian nation to protect intellectual property and be more open with its markets.

The trade gap is rising. Data released last week by the U.S. Commerce Department showed the gap hit $301 billion for the first nine months of 2018, a jump of 10 percent from the same time frame in 2017. The gap is triple the deficit the U.S. has with the European Union, and six times the gap America has with Japan.

“If we can open up China and make it fair, for the first time ever — this should have done years ago by other presidents but it wasn’t — I am very much willing to do it,” Trump said.

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow was less optimistic, saying on CNBC that “there’s no mass movement. There’s no huge thing. We’re not on the cusp of a deal.”

Kudlow said a deal would only happen if China is more amenable to American demands.

“If they respond to our asks, then the president will consider making a deal, as long as it’s in America’s interests,” Kudlow said on “Sunday Morning Futures.”

The Hill reported that Xi Jinping said at a trade show Monday that he wants to lower tariffs, increase imports, and broaden market access.

Experts are skeptical. Scott Kennedy, who studies U.S.-China relations for the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., told Bloomberg that talk is one thing, action is another.

“The distance between a leaders’ statement that they would like to work something out and would like to make some progress and actually reaching a deal is ginormous,” he said.

Pride could also take its toll. Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, a group that speaks for 200 companies that do business with China, told the New York Times that it would be “difficult for any Chinese leader to accept anything that is a less-than-equal agreement” due to Chinese nationalism.

The tariffs continue to take their toll. The New York Times reported Monday that soybean exports to China are down 94 percent this year. That crop was among the American products hit with tariffs by China in response to Trump’s duties on Chinese imports.",https://spectator.org/china-russia-blank-check-ukraine-invasion/,2018-11-07
Daughters of the Flower Fragrant Garden Highlights the Tragedy of China’s Civil War - The American Spectator,"Daughters of the Flower Fragrant Garden: Two Sisters Separated by China’s Civil War

(W.W. Norton/368 pages/$27.95)

The outcome of China’s civil war between 1945 and 1949 continues to have both global and individual repercussions. The Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) victory in that war led to disastrous consequences in China and geopolitical consequences that are still being felt in the Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world. A new book by Brown University Professor Zhuqing Li about the lives of her two aunts — sisters who were separated for 30 years as a result of the civil war — highlights the human tragedies but also reveals what is at stake in the current geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States.

Li’s book tells the story of Hong (a pseudonym) and Jun, sisters whose childhood in the Chen family was spent in a compound called the Flower Fragrant Garden near the city of Fuzhou. As children, the sisters were inseparable, but the Second World War forced the family into internal exile and China’s civil war severed their relationship for three decades.

Jun was teaching school on the island of Jinman when the CCP conquered the mainland in 1949. Hong became a physician in China. Jun lived on Taiwan, married a Nationalist military officer, and began writing articles critical of the CCP. Hong and the rest of the family in China were suspected of counterrevolutionary associations. And while the book details both sisters’ lives, Hong’s experiences under communist rule take center stage and reveal the true extent of the tragedy wrought by the CCP’s victory.

Hong was one of millions of suspected counterrevolutionaries in China that had to endure “struggle sessions” and “reeducation” in order to avoid being purged or worse. Hong survived Mao’s early purges, and as a physician in the countryside during the Great Leap Forward observed first-hand the effects of a state-induced famine, even if she was unable to grasp the full enormity of the CCP’s crime that cost the lives of an estimated 30 million Chinese. The abysmal failure and the human carnage caused by Mao’s Great Leap Forward endangered Mao’s continued rule so he responded by launching the destructive Cultural Revolution which lasted from 1966 to 1976. This time Hong did not escape the communist Red Guards who tore up her medical license, exposed her to public humiliation, and sent her into the countryside with millions of others to share the fate of Chinese peasants.

After Mao died, Hong was rehabilitated and placed in a position to help oversee China’s population control campaign, which subjected women to forced abortions and forced sterilizations. She eventually became a member of the CCP. After U.S.-Chinese relations improved, Hong and her sister Jun (who by then was living in the United States) briefly reunited in 1979, but by then China and Taiwan were, like Hong and Jun, effectively separated — two independent nations. And so it is today.

Many of today’s China experts in the West have concluded that President Xi Jinping has accumulated Mao-like power within the CCP. Today’s CCP has been credibly accused of genocide against the Uyghurs, including harvesting human organs for sale throughout the world. And if generally not quite as repressive as Mao thus far, Xi nevertheless poses a greater geopolitical challenge to the region and the world than Mao ever did.

In 1950, just before the start of the Korean War, Mao was planning to invade Taiwan but the U.S. Seventh Fleet prevented that. All indications today are that Xi intends to annex Taiwan, either peacefully or by force. It is not at all clear that if the CCP chooses force the U.S. Seventh Fleet could prevent that today.

The “loss” of China in the late 1940s was once a subject of heated debate in the United States. But historians in the United States have tended to downplay its significance and reached a consensus that the CCP’s victory in the civil war was “inevitable.” They judge the presidency of Harry Truman, for example, based on his successes in Europe instead of his failures in Asia. Questions about “who lost China” have been consigned to the intellectual dustbin of “McCarthyism.”

But there are no inevitabilities in history. Li’s book, which focuses on individual tragedies, along with our current geopolitical predicament which highlights regional and global dangers, should place China’s civil war and the question of “who lost China” back at the center of historical discussion and debate. And the horrors of CCP rule recounted in the book should educate Americans about what is truly at stake in the U.S.-China geopolitical rivalry.",https://spectator.org/china-russia-diplomatic-revolution-of-2022/,2022-07-17
Deal With the Devil? Vatican Caves to China’s Demands on Bishop Appointments - The American Spectator,"This week, Bishop Antonio Yao Shun was installed as Bishop of Jining in northern China. There are thousands of Catholic bishops, but Shun’s installment was a groundbreaking event. Bishop Shun was approved by both the Vatican and the Chinese government. In the past, the millions of Chinese Catholics have been divided between the state-sanctioned “Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association” and the underground and persecuted Catholic Church, which is loyal to the Vatican. Shun is the first bishop to be appointed since a deal was made in September of last year, which gave both the CCP and the Vatican a say in appointments. While the deal is said to be a compromise, it is submission from the Church to the whims of Xi Jinping. Last year, two faithful Catholic bishops who were critical of China’s regime were asked to step down by the Vatican to help with negotiations. The Catholic Church in China will become an institution completely dependent on the approval of a regime that is virulently hostile to people of faith.

The Catholic Church might have bought itself some favor with Beijing, but it is clear that the ultimate goal of the Chinese Communist Party is the total abolition or subservience of religious belief. This means there cannot be a force that competes with the state. Time and time again, China has proven that it will discriminate against people of just about any faith. Falun Gong spiritualists are regularly imprisoned, tortured, and even have their organs harvested. In western China, Muslim Uighurs are placed in “reeducation” camps, where they are forced to commit acts that violate their faith. Their children are not allowed to attend mosques, and the Uighurs who aren’t in the camps are regularly surveilled. In Tibet, Buddhists adherent to the Dalai Lama are persecuted, and the Dalai Lama himself has been exiled from the country. Chinese officials recently stated that the next reincarnation of the Dalai Lama must comply with Chinese law. Imagine that: you’re a reincarnation of the great Buddha himself, but only if you toe the Party line. The same will be the fate of the Chinese Catholics. Comply, or die.

China isn’t the first place where communism and Catholicism have clashed. In 1937, Pope Pius XI issued an “Encyclical on Atheistic Communism,” refuting the political movement in the strongest terms. A little over a decade later, his successor Pius XII issued the “Decree Against Communism,” which declared Catholics who professed communism as apostates to be excommunicated. There was very good reason for this: across Eastern Europe, the communist Soviet Union was butchering millions, including many Catholics. Some of those martyred by the Soviets were canonized as saints, but an estimated 50,000 clergy, of many faiths, were slaughtered by the Bolsheviks from 1917 to the end of Khrushchev’s premiership.

In the past, the Catholic Church stood strong against communism. As The American Spectator‘s Paul Kengor has noted in multiple books, Pope John Paul II bravely opposed the Soviet Union. In a particularly powerful moment in 1979, thousands of Poles chanted “We want God,” defying their overlords in Moscow. A decade later, Poland’s transition to democracy became one of the final death blows to the Soviet Union.

Today, rather than standing against communists, Pope Francis praises them and accepts Hammer and Sickle crucifixes. This submission to the Chinese Communist Party’s wishes is just the latest example of disappointing behavior from the Francis papacy.",https://spectator.org/china-sanctions-americans-rubio-cotton/,2019-09-01
Department of Homeland Security Fights Back Against China - The American Spectator,"On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released a 15-page business advisory warning American businesses about data services and equipment from firms linked to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). This followed Acting DHS Secretary Chad F. Wolf’s speech to the Heritage Foundation the day before, in which Wolf previewed some of DHS’s remaining policy goals in combating China. The highlights of the business advisory and of the new policies from Wolf’s speech are below. Details of the latter will be fleshed out in DHS’s soon-to-be-released “Strategic Action Plan to Counter the People’s Republic of China.”

While a new Biden–Harris administration could completely disregard the business advisory, it does provide good common-sense practices that all businesses should follow in the event they wish to conduct business in China, regardless of who is in the White House.

The Business Advisory

CCP’s data mining from U.S. businesses. The business advisory highlights the persistent and increasing risk of the CCP stealing data by way of newly enacted Chinese laws that can compel Chinese businesses and citizens — including through academic institutions, research service providers, and investors — to take actions related to the collection, transmission, and storage of data that runs counter to principles of U.S. and international law and policy. Such activities include requiring companies to store data within China and turning over routine data to the Chinese government under the pretense of national security. The advisory also highlights the CCP’s history of manipulation, misuse, and exploitation of that data to serve the CCP’s business and economic goals.

DHS recommends that U.S. businesses do the following:

Scrutinize business in China. DHS advises organizations to remain alert when conducting business in China generally. The advisory recommends that businesses and individuals that operate in China or with Chinese firms or entities should scrutinize any business relationship that provides access to data — whether business confidential, trade secrets, customer personally identifiable information, or other sensitive information.

Safeguard personal and proprietary information. DHS recommends that U.S. businesses identify their sensitive personal and proprietary information. To the extent possible, DHS recommends that U.S. businesses minimize the amount of at-risk data being stored and used in China or in places accessible by CCP authorities. In addition, businesses operating in the PRC should develop protocols to respond to Chinese authorities’ demands for potentially sensitive information. In particular, U.S. businesses should notify the legal attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing upon receipt of any such demand.

Exercise caution with “particularly sensitive” data. DHS has flagged the following as particularly sensitive types of data: 1) technology and other data in connection to export-controlled products; 2) intellectual property, including trade secrets; 3) biotech, genomic data, and medical test data; 4) personally identifiable and other sensitive information; and 5) geo-location data.

Prioritize cybersecurity. DHS recommends that information technology operators ensure proper segmentation of their network infrastructure from any external software use. DHS advises U.S. businesses to implement appropriate cyber security safeguards and to consult the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for best practices.

Future DHS Policies

In a speech to the Heritage Foundation, Wolf highlighted several new DHS policies that will be directed at China.

Visa restrictions. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will limit the length of visas given to CCP members from a maximum of 10 years, to a maximum of one month. Wolf also pledged further as-yet-undisclosed restrictions for CCP members. In response to China’s oppression of Hong Kong, the State Department issued visa restrictions to 14 National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) members this month, as well as to other CCP members in June. In August, the Treasury Department sanctioned 11 CCP members, including Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam.

Welcoming Hong Kong refugees. The U.S. will be welcoming refugees who are nationals or “habitual residents” of Hong Kong. The Senate has yet to pass, and President Trump has yet to sign, the Hong Kong People’s Freedom and Choice Act (H.R. 8428), passed in the House last month. If signed into law, this bill would grant temporary protected status (TPS) and refugee status for those from Hong Kong who are in fear of persecution by China.

Region-wide WRO for forced labor products. CBP hopes to “soon issue” a region-wide Withhold Release Order (WRO) for products produced with forced labor in Xinjiang, home to the Uyghur ethnic minority, whom the CCP is currently imprisoning and enslaving in concentration camps. Earlier this month, CBP issued a WRO for cotton products originating from the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) based on information that reasonably indicates the use of forced labor. In September, CBP issued five WROs for products from Chinese forced labor: four were from products from the Xinjiang region (hair products, apparel, cotton, and other products from an internment camp) and one for computer parts from Anhui, China. In July, DHS, along with the State Department, Treasury Department, and Commerce Department, issued a business advisory to caution businesses about the risks of supply chain links to entities that engage in human rights abuses, including forced labor, in Xinjiang and in China generally. Earlier in July, CBP had seized almost 13 tons of suspected forced labor products made with human hair. Since 2016, CBP has issued 16 WROs for Chinese products, and 14 of those remain fully active.

Preventing CCP evasion. DHS will continue to emphasize its aim to keep Chinese nationals from concealing their CCP membership or evading disclosure requirements. According to the National Associates of Scholars, there have been 39 instances of “illegal ties to China in American higher education and government research” since 2010. In September, a former employee At Los Alamos National Laboratory was sentenced to five years of probation and a $75,000 fine for concealing to the Department of Energy that China’s Thousand Talents Program employed him.

Protecting our 5G network. DHS has also stated that it is in the process of working with U.S. partners to secure Americans’ sensitive information against the CCP’s attempts to exploit the growing 5G internet infrastructure. The State Department has recently negotiated Memoranda of Understanding and other agreements with the EU, NATO, and numerous countries on 5G security through The Clean Network.

Making it easier for Taiwanese people to travel to the United States. DHS is engaging with Taiwan regarding Taipei’s pending application for pre-clearance for U.S.-bound travelers.

The above business advisory and policies make it clear that the Trump administration is continuing to fight China through December. Yes, a Biden–Harris administration will be free to throw such common-sense reform out the window. We can only hope that wiser heads will prevail in the new administration to keep such policies, which are essential to preserving our individual liberties and national security.",https://spectator.org/china-slam-dunks-on-daryl-morey-and-the-nba/,2020-12-23
Digital Yuan: China’s Plan to Topple the U.S. Dollar - The American Spectator,"There are many qualified candidates for the title of second most consequential event of 2020, right after coronavirus and its associated worldwide economic implosion. The global reach of the George Floyd protests comes to mind, as does the still-unfolding China–India clash in the Himalayas. Perhaps North Korea or Iran will deliver another crisis unto the world. Possibly more deserving than any of these, however, is China’s planned rollout of its digital yuan, through which the Communist Party intends to upend the U.S.-led financial world order.

China has been conducting intensive research on a potential centralized digital currency since at least 2014. The Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) plan, popularly known as the digital renminbi or digital yuan, was announced by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in October 2019. In an op-ed published in the Global Times, a Communist Party mouthpiece, leading Chinese academic Huang Zhen declared that the digital yuan will “likely” become the “world’s first sovereign digital currency,” before spending the rest of the article attacking Facebook’s rival digital currency project, Libra (more on that later).

While the PBOC has yet to fully commit to a timeline for rolling out the digital yuan, its efforts appear to be well under way. Pilot trials have been conducted in several cities so far this year, and officials have indicated that the currency will be ready for use by visitors to China during the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

China aims for economic omniscience

The digital yuan can be broadly classified as a central bank cryptocurrency, a subcategory of digital currency. The central bank aspect is self-explanatory: the currency would be controlled exclusively by the PBOC, China’s central bank. The digital yuan’s most radical departure from the norm would be the use of cryptography to verify and secure currency ownership and transaction. This added layer of security means that the currency will be recognized as legal tender and exchangeable between individuals without requiring a bank as an intermediary.

Terms like “cryptocurrency” may evoke more familiar currencies like Bitcoin, and indeed the (in)famous digital asset shares one of its defining features — strong cryptography — with the digital yuan. In other respects, however, the two currencies could not be more different. Bitcoin originated, and is based on, peer-to-peer technology called blockchain. Every transaction made in bitcoin has its verification “distributed,” meaning Bitcoin’s entire history is shared and synchronized between the millions of users in its network through various consensus mechanisms. Because Bitcoin’s network is so vast, it is practically impossible for any single user to accrue enough computational power to take control of the ledger. This places Bitcoin beyond the command and oversight of any central authority, resulting in it becoming the near-universal currency of online black markets in recent years.

The digital yuan, by contrast, is not distributed: it is entirely within the jurisdiction of the PBOC. In contrast to Bitcoin, whose mission statement explicitly revolves around decentralization and dispersal of power away from government bodies, the digital yuan represents a vision of hyper-centralization that traditional cash is unable to achieve. If China is indeed planning to transition to a digital-only economy, the Communist Party would be able to achieve nothing short of economic omniscience: every cash reserve, transaction, and account would exist only with the knowledge and consent of the government.

This has, on its face, some benefits. It would hamstring unethical commerce and deter the bribes and tax evasion that characterize China’s notoriously corrupt economy. Anyone who knows Xi Jinping’s government, however, knows that the last thing it needs is yet another method through which to enact high-tech authoritarianism. The digital yuan would put the financial lives of every Chinese citizen in the palm of the PBOC’s hand. Dissidents could be tracked and instantly bankrupted. Billionaires could be made even more pliable to the whims of Beijing than they already are.

But as much as the Chinese government cares about maintaining control at home, its primary goal is spreading financial influence abroad. Its ultimate objective is to topple the dollar domination that has kept the U.S. at the top of the global financial pecking order for several decades. This process begins with introducing renminbi as an alternative international currency starting with China’s partners in the global south. For this purpose, the digital yuan serves as an ideal catalyst.

Forcing Washington’s hand

Being state-guaranteed (rather than backed by private banks like all online deposits at the moment), secure, scalable, and relatively frictionless, central bank digital currencies have the potential to outcompete traditional currencies in the development of cross-border monetary systems.

The U.S. dollar’s status as the global reserve currency has made it arguably the most potent power projection tool in history. Ordinary Iranian citizens may not conduct their transactions with dollars, but Iran’s financial institutions and importers/exporters certainly do. Washington’s ability to cripple other countries with sanctions alone exists solely because the dollar is the world’s financial lingua franca.

Writing in Foreign Affairs in May, Aditi Kumar and Eric Rosenbach ask the reader to imagine regimes like those in Iran and North Korea being able to effortlessly skirt sanctions by conducting their transactions via digital currency services centered around Beijing. Rogue governments would not necessarily have to accept the digital yuan as a new reserve currency; China could simply export digital currency infrastructure instead of the currency itself, helping countries like Iran set up their own sovereign systems that are compatible with the yuan. This way, China would be able to undermine American influence without presenting itself as a geopolitical threat, which might be key in places like Southeast Asia where many countries are suspicious of Beijing.

Washington is therefore presented with a difficult dilemma moving forward. Pushing back against the yuan’s expanding influence might require also transitioning the dollar to a digital currency format — an idea that both private financial institutions and many voters are likely to be opposed to, the former because it would threaten their own proprietary financial software, and the latter because distrust of the federal government (and the Federal Reserve) is at the highest levels in living memory. The alternative, however, seems to be to accept that the U.S. will have to gradually cede its financial leverage over friend and foe alike.

There is also a third option that few are keen to discuss: Facebook’s proposed cryptocurrency, Libra. The PBOC seems to view the Libra as the digital yuan’s foremost rival, given that the U.S. federal government has yet to even begin earnestly discussing a project of its own. Indeed, Mark Zuckerberg himself appealed to Congress in October 2019 to support Libra as a matter of national importance, saying that “China is moving quickly to launch a similar idea in the coming months…. Libra will be backed mostly by dollars and I believe it will extend America’s financial leadership as well as our democratic values and oversight around the world. If America doesn’t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed.”

Zuckerberg is correct in stating that the Libra would serve as a conduit for dollar influence. Though the cryptocurrency would be pegged to a basket of global currencies, the U.S. dollar would dominate, representing 50 percent of the basket. The remaining half would be split between the euro, the yen, the British pound, and the Singapore dollar. The Chinese yuan is conspicuously missing, reportedly a conscious exclusion meant to appease Washington. Naturally, China sees Libra as yet another American attempt to deprive it of its rightful financial influence.

Is Libra likely to win the approval of U.S. policymakers? It seems implausible at the moment. Many rightly distrust Facebook and by extension a project developed and led by Facebook. From a purely technical perspective, Libra would not confer the same benefits to the United States as the digital yuan would to China, as it would be a non-sovereign currency beyond the control of any federal organ. And even if all of these concerns were addressed, Libra remains in a relatively early stage of development. Its official launch is supposedly slated for this year, though it’s difficult to believe that Facebook’s original timeline is still in place after its recent falling out with Congress.

Of course, everything said here depends on China’s successful implementation of its digital currency plan. It may very well turn out that the U.S. made the right decision by remaining passive while Beijing rushed headlong into a self-inflicted financial crisis. As a general rule, however, the side that bets on technological innovation comes out on top. The U.S. continues to hold large full-spectrum technological advantages over China, but in the crucial field of digital currency it is presently lagging by perhaps half a decade or more. The political will to study this technology, or at least to discover ways of mitigating China’s advantages, must be amassed — or else the New Cold War may soon see a 21st-century Sputnik moment.",https://spectator.org/china-spectral-state-american-spectator-print-summer-2021/,2020-06-23
Dirty Harry Should Counsel China - The American Spectator,"If Clint Eastwood were an adviser to President Xi Jinping of China, he might quote himself as Inspector “Dirty Harry” Callahan in Magnum Force: “A man’s got to know his limitations.”

China is now learning the hard way that the pursuit of global hegemony has its limits. The country’s Belt and Road initiative is a massive infrastructural development plan announced by President Xi Jinping in 2013. China envisions expenditures of about $150 billion per year, committing nearly $1 trillion for ports, bridges, pipelines, and railway systems to link Europe, Eurasia, North and East Africa, and South and Southeast Asia to China. About 70 countries have signed up. The main Chinese objective is to establish China as the commander in chief of an economic model that is an alternative to democratic capitalism. Not surprisingly, Chinese contractors will benefit mightily and China may achieve better investment yields than on its U.S. treasuries — if all goes well with investment projections. Through its size and intimidation tactics, China will also be able to cut favorable terms of trade for itself. Further, the state of development in western China would be enhanced.

An integral part of this initiative is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor which brings Pakistan squarely into the orbit of China, at a time when U.S. aid has been further cut by the Trump administration to only $345 million for fiscal 2018. A Chinese commitment of $62 billion is envisioned to support the Corridor, which showcases the port of Gwadar built by and leased to China, situated about 375 miles from the strategic Strait of Hormuz. Earlier Chinese aid was committed to the Karakoram Highway, and Pakistan produces its main battle tank, the Al-Khalid in a joint venture with the Chinese, who have also partnered to develop Pakistan’s JF-17 multi-role combat aircraft.

But all is not well for Chinese Belt and Road planners. First, they have discovered that Pakistan is a bad credit risk. As recently reported on July 23 in the Wall Street Journal, Pakistan is already in arrears on payments to China for electricity, which is a major component of the Corridor in Pakistan. Not only that, the Journal reports that an IMF bailout of highly indebted Pakistan is anticipated to come this fall. Fundamentally a western solution for Pakistan’s financial indulgence, an IMF intervention would show Beijing that it was guilty of poor business judgment and overextension of itself. Further, IMF engagement of Pakistan would require more transparency and better governance, something that the Pakistani opposition is demanding on the eve of the July 25th general election there, with accusations of extensive corruption.

A second factor is regional security: Central Asia has a confluence of Al-Qaeda, Taliban, and ISIS elements. Pakistan’s particular inability to control and contain jihadists would not sit well in Beijing. In view of the disaffected minority Uyghur population in western China that is Muslim and of Turkic ethnicity, China has a stake in suppression of Islamist dissidents.

Once a staunch U.S. Cold War ally and partner against the Soviets in Afghanistan, Pakistan is now in the embrace of China. America’s partnership with Pakistan’s archenemy India, based on strategic alignment to counter China, suppress Islamist jihad, and benefit from trade and investment, is certainly part of the story. The irony is that it is rare to meet Pakistanis who want to study or work in China.

Historians will debate how America and Pakistan lost each other. Pakistan’s double game — doing just enough to receive continuing military and civilian aid from the U.S. but not enough to defeat the principally Pashtun jihadists — is probably its biggest mistake. And the memory of Osama bin Laden hiding in his compound in the garrison town of Abbottabad, home of the elite Pakistan Military Academy, is indelibly etched in the psyche of Congress and the American people. America’s biggest mistake was probably to view Pakistan solely through the prism of national security as so-called AfPak.

Pakistan is not the only problematic country for the Belt and Road initiative. As also reported by the Journal, China’s second largest recipient of largesse, Malaysia, has suspended a $20 billion railway project and possibly others. And Sri Lanka has been unable to pay China for construction of a port in Hambantota.

China is a newcomer to the world stage as a benefactor of foreign assistance, with much to learn about political and operating risk within its client states. A viewing of the five Dirty Harry films by senior members of the Politburo just might make their day.

Don’t Be Fooled by the Idea of China Intervening in Ukraine - The American Spectator,"Amidst the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there are increasing calls for China to intervene based on the view that China is the only country that can stop Putin’s aggression. This view is gaining popularity and thus needs to be seriously evaluated. Before I do that, I want to clarify how I use the term “China”: it refers to the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), or the party leader Xi Jinping.

First, let’s review a few facts:

In early February, China and Russia partnered up against the democratic countries at the Beijing Olympics summit, declaring a “no limits” strategic cooperation.

Since the invasion, China has refused to call Russia’s invasion an “invasion.”

In early March, China announced that it would not join sanctions against Russia.

The Western elites who believe China is the only country that can stop the Russian invasion tend to be political analysts, businesspeople, or academics who have interests in or close ties with China.

These facts should be enough to conclude that believing China will intervene is a pipe dream. But empirical evidence is not enough to understand the Chinese Communist Party. We must go into the most fundamental reasons why China will not intervene.

The two most important principles of the CCP are political ideology and economic interest.

Ideologically, the CCP worships political power and military force. As the CCP’s founder, Mao Zedong (1893–1976), put it, “Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.” For the CCP, there is no right or wrong but power and force. Thus, ideologically, the CCP stands firmly with dictators such as Putin.

Economically, the CCP is practical and pro-business. The party is very good at grabbing resources and using money as a weapon to influence the elites of the world. This is why it prefers stability. In his annual speech to the National People’s Congress a few days ago, Premier Li Keqiang mentioned “stability” 81 times.

Thus, economically, China may have some incentive to end the Russia–Ukraine conflict because wars cause instability and hurt the economic activities of the world, including China. And this seems to be the argument made by the pro-China camp, either naively or deceitfully. But either way, this view is wrong.

For the CCP, political ideology always trumps economic interest. The reason is simple: maintaining its absolute rule by force is the most important — and the only — goal. Why does the CCP care about economic benefit if it no longer rules? This sounds familiar. Putin said, “Why do we need a world if Russia is not in it?” Of course, his “Russia” is his Russia.

The overriding political ideology dictates that China — the CCP and Xi Jinping — stands shoulder to shoulder with Putin and therefore will never oppose the latter’s aggression.

If the above analysis is not enough to convince the well-intentioned people in the democracies, we can look further at what the CCP has done beyond the Russian invasion:

It is sending warplanes to harass and intimidate Taiwan on a daily basis.

It has destroyed the rule of law and human rights in Hong Kong.

It practices an ethnic cleansing policy against the Uyghur people in Xinjiang.

It has been supporting the Kim dynasty in North Korea, Venezuela’s Maduro, communist Cuba, and other dictatorships.

According to the late Soviet President Andrei Gromyko, in 1958, Mao Zedong suggested that China lure the U.S. troops into China and then attack them with Soviet atomic bombs.

Since its founding in 1921, the CCP has waged numerous political campaigns that killed millions of people.

All these show that CCP is a brutal political and military machine that does not hesitate to use force to achieve its goal.

Compared with the political system of Russia, the CCP is categorically more dictatorial and powerful. As Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) put it, we are “50 times more vulnerable to China than we ever have been to Russia.” (READ MORE: Ukraine: China to the Rescue?)

But the CCP is also opportunistic and deceitful. It has many faces; it tells Putin that it is firmly behind his invasion, sends some humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and at the same time tells the U.S. that “sound China-US relations bring benefits to both countries and beyond.” It also mobilizes the world’s elites on its payroll to sing along that “only China can stop Russia and save the world.”

The democratic countries have fallen to these tricks many times, just like the trusting Charlie Brown always believes that he will kick the football held by Lucy this time.

It is time we quit wishful thinking and stop being fooled by China, again.

Don’t Blame Nixon for China’s Rise - The American Spectator,"Nick Lindquist, a conservative freelance writer, has a piece in Law & Liberty in which he essentially blames Richard Nixon for China’s rise. Provocatively titled “Nixon’s New Red Century,” the article claims that Nixon hoped to bring China “onto the world stage with hopes that they will eventually become a friend rather than a foe — a prosperous, democratic business partner rather than a bitter, isolated communist rival.” Instead of fulfilling Nixon’s hope that the opening to China would be a “great leap forward,” Lindquist writes, China “has taken the world backward.” This is an oversimplification and misreading of Nixon’s geopolitical design.

In international politics, context is everything. Nixon came into office and inherited a growing quagmire in Vietnam, a Soviet enemy who had achieved nuclear parity with the United States and whose leaders believed that the “world correlation of forces” were moving in their favor, and a fracturing NATO alliance whose leading European member (Germany) was forging an independent Ostpolitik policy toward the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe. The Sino-Soviet split was real and growing, as evidenced by a border clash in March 1969 near the Ussuri River. It is true, as Lindquist points out, that Nixon believed, as he wrote in his famous 1967 Foreign Affairs article “Asia After Vietnam,” that the U.S. could not afford “to leave China forever outside the family of nations,” but Nixon’s primary reason for the opening to China was geopolitical.

Nixon and his top foreign policy adviser, Henry Kissinger, understood that American national security in the face of Soviet hostility depended on the geopolitical pluralism of Eurasia. Kissinger called it “triangular diplomacy,” and it featured both the opening to China and détente with the Soviet Union. The immediate goal of triangular diplomacy was to position the United States closer to the Soviet Union and China than they were to each other. The long-term goal was to embrace China in a de facto alliance against the Soviet Union and thereby sustain and enhance the geopolitical pluralism of Eurasia. Nixon’s strategy worked. Without China as a U.S. ally, it is doubtful that the Soviet Union would have collapsed in 1989-1991. In this sense, as Kissinger claimed in the third volume of his memoirs, Years of Renewal, Nixon set the stage for the Reagan administration’s policies that won the Cold War.

Lindquist correctly notes that after the Berlin Wall fell, “Democratic and Republican administrations saw bilateral relations with China as a benefit rather than a detriment.” Presidents from Clinton through Obama failed to appreciate that the U.S-China “alliance” was a marriage of convenience during the Cold War — for both countries, the enemy of my enemy was my friend. That should have ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union, but on our side it didn’t. U.S. policy toward China in the post–Cold War years helped fuel China’s rise economically and militarily.

Lindquist criticizes those “American elites” who believed that “once the Chinese people got a taste of westernization and a higher quality of life, they would begin to demand certain things of their government — among them, more rights and democracy.” “[T]hat hasn’t happened,” Lindquist writes, “and never will.” Here, Lindquist ignores Tiananmen Square in 1989 and the current protests over COVID lockdowns, which have included calls for the CCP to surrender power. It also ignores the vibrant democracy in Taiwan that puts the lie to Lindquist’s suggestion that “Eastern and Confucian tradition” causes Chinese citizens to have no desire for self-governance.

But Lindquist is right to criticize Western political and business elites who saw (and see) only dollar signs when they view the Chinese market. Their political hubris and economic greed blinded them to geopolitical realities. “While our leaders over the last several decades smiled and shook hands with Chinese officials,” Lindquist writes, “the CCP built an empire of oppression, military might, and fear, standing in complete opposition to our values.”

The “Red Century,” Lindquist writes, “has turned out to be the 21st century.” If that is so — and it’s probably too early to tell — it isn’t Nixon’s fault. Nixon dealt with China during a particular time period in the context of specific geopolitical circumstances. Nixon understood that it was geopolitics, not values, that brought the U.S. and China together during the latter years of the Cold War. He also knew that after the fall of the Soviet Union the geopolitical arena changed. He foresaw China as a potential rival — a 21st century peer competitor to the U.S.-led global order.

As Josh Rogin noted in his invaluable book Chaos Under Heaven, the Trump administration, especially in its last two years, shifted U.S. policy from engagement to containment, recognizing that great power rivalry had replaced terrorism as the geopolitical center of gravity. But while the Biden administration sometimes sounds Trumpian in its rhetoric toward China, its actual China policy has more in common with Trump’s predecessors.

Neither Trump nor Biden has the geopolitical mind of a Richard Nixon. Nixon, as Time’s observer of presidents Hugh Sidey once wrote, “understood the men, the ingredients, the glory, the brutality, the action and reaction of power as well as anyone else of our time.”",https://spectator.org/china-syndrome-blues-greens-gaze-longingly-at-the-reds/,2022-12-04
Doubts Arise on End of U.S.-China Trade War - The American Spectator,"The Trump administration is expressing doubts that China will kowtow to its requests as part of its effort on a new comprehensive trade agreement.

The Independent reported that officials are “pessimistic” that the trade deal being discussed will be enough to put a stop to the current trade war between the U.S. and China.

China’s vice premier, Liu He, and a Chinese delegation with meet with Trump administration trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer and Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin next week.

The two nations have paused their escalating tariff impositions to allow time for negotiations, but March 2 is the deadline to reach some sort of deal. Trump plans to increase duties on $200 billion in Chinese goods after that date.

Trump is attempting to do what no U.S. president before him has been able to achieve: narrow the import-export gap between the U.S. and China, convince China to be more open with its markets for foreign investments, and stop forcing American companies to “pay for play” by providing trade secrets as a condition of doing business there.

Trump expressed optimism recently when he tweeted that China had posted the slowest economic growth numbers since 1990 in the fallout of the trade war.

“Makes so much sense for China to finally do a Real Deal, and stop playing around!” he wrote.

But others, including anonymous sources inside the Trump administration, have said there is less reason for optimism.

“I would have a hard time, especially considering what’s happening in Washington, believing that this will be wrapped up in a little bow by March,” Charles Freeman, senior vice president for Asia at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told the Independent.

Data from the Commerce Department shows that in 2015 American exports to China supported more than 900,000 domestic jobs. The imports from China — the United States’ top source for capital goods — helps drive American output and economic growth.

The tit-for-tat between the U.S. and China is harming the global economy, recent reports show. The International Money Fund (IMF) recently lowered its economic growth projections for 2019, particularly singling out the trade war.

“An escalation of trade tensions and a worsening of financial conditions are key sources of risk to the outlook,” wrote Gita Gopinath for IMG. “Higher trade uncertainty will further dampen investment and disrupt global supply chains. A more serious tightening of financial conditions is particularly costly given the high levels of private and public sector debt in countries.”

Stefan M. Selig, under secretary of commerce and international trade at the Commerce Department under President Obama, wrote on CNBC that “we must acknowledge that a perfect deal is simply not on the table. Every modern American presidency has harbored the hope that the U.S.-China commercial relationship can be transformed.”

Why hasn’t it happened? Selig said it’s because China has not truly developed into a market economy and neither the U.S. nor China has enough leverage over the other nation to dictate terms of a deal.

“This creates a fundamental reality: the U.S.-China commercial relationship will continue to be one of managed struggle, which will be defined by the constant navigating of persistent challenges and mitigating the occasional crisis,” he wrote. “At best, we can expect for the foreseeable future a commercial relationship that may be functional but will be far from optimal.”

Selig said Trump is right to focus on the complexities of the commercial relationship between the U.S. and China, but his administration should conduct an honest assessment of what can actually be achieved.

“U.S. and Chinese negotiators should do what successful dealmakers do — drop the provocative rhetoric, adopt realistic negotiating goals, create a win-win outcome for both parties, and close the deal,” Selig wrote.",https://spectator.org/china-taiwan-origins-chinese-civil-war/,2019-01-24
Dreams of Splendor: The Decline and Fall of Traditional China - The American Spectator,"F rom our vantage point overlooking a broad, closely forested river valley, we gaze across the slow eddies of the watercourse towards an expansive horizon. A picturesque sylvan scene presents itself, with groves and coppices and undulating hillocks all around, but there are precious few signs of human life here, just a hamlet, a tumbledown bridge, an abandoned rowboat, a lonely muleteer with his five straggling animals, all shrouded in mist. In time our eyes alight upon on a winding procession as it emerges from a distant thicket. The cavalcade is comprised of nine porters, two of whom strain to support a tall wooden palanquin enclosed in silk curtains, together with a well-dressed rider on horseback, his hand steady on the reins as he maintains a four-beat gait. These 10 figures are following the bend in a willow-lined footpath, passing on their right a thatched farmhouse with its contentedly lowing cattle, while to their left lies a dilapidated compound, where another willow tree has grown through a section of collapsed roof, its “sparse branches so long and slender that one might think it suffered from the plague,” to borrow an appropriately haunting image from Ryūnosuke Akutagawa’s “Chûto.”

Everywhere we look there are willows to be found, their pliant branches, entirely denuded of leaves, beckoning menacingly. Even the palanquin being carried through the forest is bedecked with willow branches, while one of the porters carries yet more willow boughs on his shoulder pole. These omnipresent trees and tree limbs tell us all we need to know: it must be the 15th day after the Spring Equinox, the day of the Qīngmíng jié, the Qingming Festival or Tomb-Sweeping Day, when in an outpouring of filial piety the Chinese traditionally repair their family burial mounds, clear the ancient tombs of weeds and dust, lay out sacrificial vessels, and hang willow branches from lintels and gates. Willows takes pride of place on this day, in part because their branches, when wielded by the Bodhisattva Guanyin, Goddess of Mercy and Perceiver of the World’s Sounds — who dwells, it is said, not just in moon-lit pools and rocky outcropping but also in Salixgroves — can sweep away the three calamities and seven disasters wrought variously by fire, water, wind, and the abandonment of “correct teaching.” And when it comes exorcising mogwai (devils) and guilao (ghosts), nothing is handier than a trusty willow bough. The myriad willows we see here us do not, however, merely commemorate the beloved Goddess of Mercy; they are also meant to remind us of the grisly end of the unfortunate Han-era aristocrat and poet Jie Zhi-Tui, who retired to the forests of Jin to live out his days as a hermit, only to be burnt to death when Duke Wen, hoping to flush out the recluse and bring him back into government service, recklessly started a blaze in the woods. Jie’s charred corpse was later discovered beneath a willow tree, alongside a note written in blood: “I cut off my own flesh to dedicate it to you, and only wish that my king will always be clear and bright.” He was promptly declared a Taoist immortal, and the Qingming Festival (along with the Cold Food Festival that immediately precedes it) was thereafter marked by a ritual avoidance of fire, and a particular fixation on willows in all their beauty and eeriness. It is not for nothing that the very word for willow, liu, also means “slaughter,” hence the dark little joke in the ancient Book of Song’s minor ode on the “Leafy Willow-Tree,” as translated by Arthur Waley:

Very leafy is that willow-tree,

But I would not care to rest under it.

God [i.e. the emperor] on high is very bright;

Don’t get too close to him!

Were I to reprove him,

Afterward I should be slaughtered by him.

It was a lesson poor Jie Zhi-Tui learned the hardest way imaginable.

We may safely assume, therefore, that the procession we see slowly making its way through the woods is returning from a visit to the family tomb. Having tidied up the tumulus, poured the appropriate libations, and venerated the ancestors in a fitting and time-honored fashion, the members of the party are now free to return to their home in the city, first passing through a series of riverside villages, and then through the massive gates of what we can now recognize as the glittering city of Bianjing. By now, festivities in the city and its outskirts are in full swing, with vendors hawking snacks, mud figurines, and miniature paper buildings, all hallmarks of Tomb-Sweeping Day, while the outdoor markets are filled to brimming with holiday shoppers perusing the copious mounds of foodstuffs, fabrics, artifacts, and artwork on display. One merchant ship, it would seem, is coming perilously close to the wooden Rainbow Bridge that spans the River Bian, but other than that minor hiccough the lively mise en scène before us seems quite untroubled, with pastoral serenity perfectly balanced by urban vigor, and with timeless religious devotion paired with the sensory pleasures of the quotidian. The onlooker could be forgiven for wishing to dwell here in perpetuity.

This pageant is not, lamentably, one in which we could partake today. It must be enjoyed vicariously, via what is arguably the most renowned painting in the history of Chinese art, Qingming Shanghe Tu, or Along the River During the Qingming Festival, a 12th-century masterpiece by Chang Tse-tuan currently housed in Peking’s Palace Museum. On a silk hand-scroll a mere 10 inches high but almost 6 yards long, Chang Tse-tuan managed to depict an entire civilization in captivating panoramic and kaleidoscopic detail, and it easy to see why the work is now regarded as “China’s Mona Lisa,” at least in terms of cultural import and influence. Along the River was frequently reproduced by painters of later dynasties, with the Yuan-era Chao Meng-fu attempting a faithful copy, while the Ming-era artist Ch’iu Ying began the tradition of elaborating upon the original in an attempt to improve upon it — a hopeless task, it must be admitted.

During the Qing dynasty another version was commissioned, this time making use of Western perspective. The result, now a major attraction in Taipei’s National Palace Museum, lacks the brio of Chang Tse-tuan’s Song-era version, with its quick brushstrokes and distinctive atmosphere, sometimes haunting, sometimes carnivalesque. Victor Segalen, the French archaeologist, poet, and ardent Sinophile, rightly insisted that Chinese painting should not rely on “any organized ‘effect’; not one of those fugitive mirages with which western ‘perspective’ makes play and defines without hesitation: whether parallel lines join or not at infinity … (wretched infinity where two lines are reduced to one point): if the personages drawn here have one dimension in space, or two or three … (bah! that’s something for a competent tailor!).” The 18th-century remake is definitely too “organized,” but it is also too flat, too busy, and even a bit too cartoonish, to challenge its source material.

Yet the “Qing Court Version,” while inferior from an artistic standpoint to its progenitor, is remarkable in its own way, for its rightmost edge is graced by a sublime poem composed by the Ch’ien-lung Emperor himself, and written out in a semi-cursive script by the emperor’s close companion Liang Shih-chêng:

A wall of gold has been mounted on Shu brocade.

Craftsmen from Wu collect spare change

To pay tribute to the abundance of a myriad of families.

The watchtowers of the city rise to great heights.

The bustling scene is truly impressive.

It is a chance to explore vestiges of bygone days.

At that time, people marveled at the size of Yu,

And now, we lament the fates of Hui and Qin.

Even as we relish the sight of the “bustling scene” so impressively displayed in Chang Tse-tuan’s Along the River During the Qingming Festival, we cannot — and indeed even an omnipotent emperor could not — escape that gnawing sense that the depiction unfurled before our eyes is that of a bygone era never to be recovered, and never to be matched.

When the 15-year-old Meng Yuanlao arrived at the gates of the Northern Song capital of Bianjing in the year 1103, he soon found himself caught up in all the raucous alarums and excursions that characterized daily life in that vibrant city, those which Chang Tse-tuan depicted in such marvelous detail. In the thronging bazaars Meng could obtain anything from falcons and fresh herbs to bolts of silk and polished jade, while the vendors at the night markets proffered sumptuous quantities of sweets (jujube cakes, candied seeds, lychee paste) and savouries (chopped lamb’s head, rabbit belly, eel buns). Towering over it all was the renowned Iron Pagoda, as well as the Gate of Morning Radiance, the Temple of Precious Scriptures, and the extraordinary astronomical clock tower designed by the polymath Su Song, with its intricate chain drive, known as the “celestial ladder,” and its 133 clock jacks sounding the hours. Meng, who had been born into an influential clan that included Meng Changling, a well-respected member of the Board of Public Works, was free to take in such marvels at his leisure, while visiting the many teahouses, wineshops, theaters, and perhaps (though we really ought not speculate) some of the less savory establishments situated in the so-called “pleasure precincts.”

For the next 24 years Meng Yuanlao would reside in this metropolis, until the invading Jurchen Jin barbarians put an end to Bianjing’s glories in a veritable orgy of rapine and massacre. The hum of urban life was, after a brief siege, replaced with the crash of huopao incendiary bombs, the clanging of swords, the screams of the slaughtered, and the silence of the mass grave. Emperor Ch’in-tsung, the “Qin” whose fate was lamented in the Ch’ien-lung Emperor’s poem, was captured and carried away to the Jurchen heartland in utterly humiliating fashion, along with much of his court, and also the disassembled components of Su Song’s clock, never to be repaired and never to chime again. Those fortunate enough to escape, including Meng, made for the city of Lin’an (now Hangzhou), where the Southern Song Dynasty would rise, phoenix-like, once again. But Meng Yuanlao never stopped pining for his lost homeland, and so he took up his “four treasures of study” — brush, paper, ink stick, and ink stone — and set about producing one of the most extraordinary literary works of China’s postclassical era, the Dongjing Meng Hua Lu, or Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital, a prose counterpart to Chang Tse-tuan’s Along the River During the Qingming Festival.

While Meng humbly begged forgiveness for his “coarse and vulgar” prose, his goal was never strictly speaking to produce a literary masterpiece. It was simply to re-create in vivid detail the daily life of Bianjing on the eve of the barbarian invasion, taking readers on a tour through the streets, alleys, and gardens, and then all throughout the calendar year, punctuated as it was with innumerable festivals and celebrations, including above all the Qingming Festival. For Meng, Bianjing had been a place where “peace stretched on day after day,” where “people were many and all things were in abundance,” and where “season and festival followed one upon the other, each with its own sights to enjoy. Lamplit nights there were and moonlit eves, periods of snow and times of blossoming, beseeching skills and climbing heights, training reservoirs and gardens to roam in.” It deserved a proper memorial, and Meng Yuanlao had given it one, but as is the case with viewing Along the River, reading the Dreams of Splendor mostly leaves one with a profound longing for those bygone days of abundance.

The artists of the Southern Song found themselves positively steeping in melancholy, afflicted as they were by that sense of saudade or desiderium that lingered after the heyday of the Northern Song had passed. Exile had long been a central theme in Chinese poetry anyways, with the Northern Song writers Huang T’ing-chien and Su Shifollowing in the footsteps of their illustrious T’ang predecessors Li Po and Tu Fu in their quest to perfect the art of Xiaoxiang, or exile poetry. It would be the Southern Song poet, musicologist, and calligrapher Jiang Kui, the “Hermit of the White Stone,” who came as close as any to mastering that genre, owing to his unique style, described by contemporaries as that of “clouds that leave or stay without a trace.” One of Jiang Kui’s finest works was “Chang Ting Yuan Man,” or the “Lament on Parting,” which I have inadequately attempted to render thusly:

As the wind breathes, slow and fragrant

Wafting blossoms from the willow strands

In the green depths of the garden

With twilight falling and the waters churning

The distant sails are tossed about

Many people have I known

But none are like those willow trees

That shade the gate through which I left

If trees had human hearts

They would not grow so green with life

At sunset the lofty city fades from sight

And mountains now surround me

Endless, scattered, tumbling down

Like Wei Lang, I left you

And in my place, a ring of jade

When we parted, you begged me to return

Fearing for the fate of our crimson flowers

Now, without your shears

How will I ever cut away

These thousand silken strands of sorrow?

The Qing scholar Wang Sen was right to praise Jiang Kui’s “lapidary verses and refined words that return to purity and elegance,” and there is certainly no arguing with Zhu Yizun’s assessment that “people say that one must praise the song lyric of the Northern Song; however, only in the Southern Song did the song lyric reach the ultimate craft, and only at the end of the Song did it reach its ultimate transformation. Jiang Yaozhang [Jiang Kui] is the most outstanding [song lyric writer].”

It is altogether surprising, then, to find that Jiang was unappreciated in his own time, and that his laudable attempts to bring the “12 tones of antiquity” back into favor were derided by the officials of the Taichang Si, the Song dynasty’s “Office of Great Constancy” that looked after rites and musical traditions. Later poets could only bemoan the official repudiation of Jiang Kui’s cultural preservation program; as the historian Douglas Howland summarized it, as “a consequence of his failed ideals — China has lost its ancient music.” Defeat, exile, nostalgia, cultural decline — you can see why the poets of the Southern Song dynasty grew increasingly heavy-hearted. “How can the one word sadness,” Li Ch’ing Chao pondered, “embrace it all?” The great Song general Hsin Ch’i-Chi, one of the rare leaders to put up a decent fight against the invading nomads, was rewarded with little more than the “taste of woe, sorrow, and bitterness,” and like Jie Zhi-Tui took to living in seclusion. His most moving poem, to my mind at least, “Che-ku T’ien,” or “Partridge Sky,” concludes this way, in C. H. Kwock and Vincent McHugh’s incomparable translation:

Musing over bygone things

I

sigh at my present state

Never spring wind

will turn

this white beard black again

and instead of my

ten-time-ten

thousand-word memorials

re

Destroying the Tatars

what do I read?

My eastern neighbor’s handbook:

How

to

Plant

Trees

Which in turn reminds me of Edward Lear’s uncharacteristically sensical and pointed query:

When “Grand old men” persist in folly

In slaughtering men and chopping trees,

What art can soothe the melancholy

Of those whom futile “statesmen” teaze?

Here the estimable Hsin Ch’i-Chi has given us as good an answer as any to this eternal question, in a poem that represents the melancholy apotheosis of Song civilization, and which amply demonstrates the essential truth of Shelley’s maxim that “our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.”

A little more than a hundred miles southwest of Kaifeng (as Bianjing is now known) lies the city of Pingdingshan, where from time immemorial the Sanguan folk religion temple has provided a space for ancestor worship, sacrifice, thanksgiving, and various rites of passage that would still be recognizable to Chang Tse-tuan or Meng Yuanlao. But on May 7, 2020, as reported by the online human rights magazine Bitter Winter, worshipers arrived there only to find a notice barring entry to the eastern courtyard on purportedly pandemic-related grounds. Two weeks earlier, it is worth noting, the local authorities had caught the temple manager in the act of making a jìngxiāng (incense offering) at the temple’s altar. Communist party officials ordered the gate to be closed at all times, while further threatening that “the temple would be destroyed if he was found burning incense there again,” making it abundantly clear that the subsequent lockdown was merely a pretext for the suppression of traditional religious activity. Curiously enough, the western courtyard remains wide open, leading as it does to a separate whitewashed hall, sparsely furnished but otherwise quite unaffected by social distancing measures, where celebrants are still free to light incense and kowtow to three kitschy little statues of Chairman Mao, Zhou Enlai, and the warlord Zhu De, each grandiosely sporting a celadon-colored robe beneath a blue cape, but nevertheless coming across a bit like the Supermarionation puppets from Team America: World Police.

“Under Mao Zedong’s rule,” one folk religion adherent told Bitter Winter, “all deities had to be swept away, and all people were told to love the Party. All temples without portraits of Mao were doomed to be demolished. We are now regressing to the times of the Cultural Revolution.” And the deities are certainly being swept away, with every day bringing new enormities. In recent months we have seen Buddhist statues of Guanyin, Amitabha, and other religious figures demolished in places like Dali and Mile in Yunnan, and Meishan in Sichuan, while folk religion temples and ancestral halls have either been torn down or converted into propaganda centers. All this, of course, is in addition to the well-known cultural genocidal “sinicization” campaigns being carried out against the Tibetan and Uyghur populations, and the less well-known crackdowns on ethnic minorities in Southern Mongolia, the Utsuls of Hainan Island, and so on.

It is here that we are rudely awakened from the foregoing dreams of Song splendor to the aesthetic and spiritual hell of modern China, wondering all the while, as Shakespeare put it in his 65th sonnet, “How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea?” When we fix our attention on the Sanguan Temple, with its grossly divergent eastern and western courtyards, we see the tragic juxtaposition between the world of Chang Tse-tuan and Meng Yuanlao and the world of Mao and Xi Jinping, between the world of Along the River During the Qingming Festival and the Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital and the world of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and forced sinicization. A grotesque bacchanalia of cultural destruction is proceeding apace, and at this rate it will soon be next to impossible to adequately “explore vestiges of bygone days.”

When I think of the Song and their dreams of splendor, one anecdote in particular comes to mind, as related by Victor Segalen, which concerns a master-painter from that era who had the habit of climbing up the terraces of vineyards, equipped with a flagon of wine, and of passing the day mildly drunk, staring and meditating. Do you know what he observed? Clearly a spectacle, since he was a Master, and a Painter. The commentators say, “That he looked for the bond of light joining ultimately once and forever joy and life, life and joy … ” This inebriated vision, this piercing gaze, this clairvoyance can replace for some people — to whom you belong? — all the reason of the world and of god.

How many civilizations — aside from the Song, and perhaps the Minoans and Etruscans — have managed through their artwork to join life and joy in such a successful and perdurable fashion? And yet how many societies today are willing to obliterate the glorious bequests of the past for the sake of the short-sighted agendas of the present, inspired by twisted ideologies the 19th-century Austrian playwright Eduard von Bauernfeld eloquently called “rein negatives: die Furcht vor dem Geiste, die Negation des Geistes, der absolute Stillstand, die Versumpfung, die Verdummung [purely negative: the fear of spiritual things, the negation of spirit, absolute stasis, waterlogged, stultified].”

For all that, we can still obtain a certain amount of comfort from the T’ang-era poet Wang Fan-Chih’s musings on human frailty and artistic posterity:

Hundred-year men?

None in the world

But we slave to make

thousand-year songs

beating out iron

to bar out death

Seeing,

the ghosts

clap hands

"Eileen Gu, an American-Born Skier Who Sold Out to China, Wins Gold for Xi Jinping - The American Spectator","Eileen Gu, 18, was crowned the winner in the Olympics’ first-ever Big Air Freeski event after landing a double cork 1620 on Monday. In the daring event, skiers perform tricks in the air after shooting down a 60-foot-long ramp.

Gu, who is estimated by the Beijing News to have earned $15 million in 2021, is currently the third-highest-paid female athlete in the world, trailing only tennis players Naomi Osaka and Serena Williams. She has contracts with companies like Tiffany, Louis Vuitton, and Victoria’s Secret, and works as a supermodel when she’s not on the slopes.

The secret behind her massive wealth is that Gu switched from representing the United States to representing China in 2019 at the age of 15. That opened the gates to a market with few winter-sport athletes with whom to compete. It also gave her the opportunity to possibly receive payments from the communist government — which is known to reward athletes, especially Olympians, who succeed in representing the country.

Gu has become a sensation in China since switching her allegiance. She recently appeared on the covers of the Chinese editions of Vogue, Marie Claire, and Elle. The sportswear company Anta even set up an Eileen Gu theme park in a Shanghai mall. Canada’s Globe and Mail reports that she is now making $20 million a year off of endorsements from Chinese companies. On Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, she has over 2.6 million followers. After she won gold, the entire site crashed because so many of her fans were rushing to gush over her victory.

Of course, while the switch made her wealthier, it also made her a propagandist tool for an authoritarian and repressive regime. The same week that she made the announcement, she appeared with Chinese President Xi Jinping as he addressed Chinese winter athletes and told them that their success was vital to “the nation’s great rejuvenation.” And while Gu trumpets herself as a powerful voice for racial justice united in solidarity with Black Lives Matter, she refuses to utter a peep about the Chinese government’s genocide against the Uyghur people. That is not to mention the forced abortions, sterilizations, massive surveillance, repression of religious freedom, and much more carried out by the Chinese regime. (Her publicist once told the Economist that she would not do an interview with them unless they agreed to allow her team to review the article prior to publication to ensure that there was nothing in there negative towards the Chinese regime. “If [Eileen] participates in an article that has two paragraphs critical of China and human rights, that would put her in jeopardy over there. One thing and a career is ruined,” her publicist, American Tom Yaps, told freelance reporter Brook Larmer.)

Gu has repeatedly refused to answer pointed questions about whether or not she has renounced her U.S. citizenship. Olympic rules require that an athlete have citizenship in the country they compete for, and China does not allow dual citizenship. But there is some speculation that China might have granted her a special exemption. Either that or she just refuses to admit she treacherously renounced her country.

Gu’s newfound allegiance to China is part of a deliberate propaganda campaign by the Communist Party. At the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, China won nine medals, including one gold, while the U.S. came away with 23 medals, including nine gold medals. Communist officials were embarrassed by the country’s 14th-place ranking in the medal count as they felt it detracted from their efforts to make China the global superpower.

The Chinese government thus set out to recruit athletes from foreign countries to compete for the Chinese flag in the 2022 winter Olympics, which they would be hosting. They concentrated their efforts on athletes with Chinese ancestry. Gu is the crowning jewel of that recruitment effort. Alysa Liu, a figure skater from California, was another athlete they approached, but she rejected the offer. But the Chinese found more success with figure skater Zhu Yi, who is also from California. Unlike Gu, who is considered the best freestyle skier in the world, Zhu probably wouldn’t have made it to the Olympics if she’d had to compete against Americans for a spot. And Zhu’s Olympics has thus far been an utter disaster. She scored 47.03 in the team short program after falling, crashing into a wall, and failing to complete a jump. Compare that to Russia Olympic Committee’s Kamila Valieva’s 90.18. As a result, Zhu received fierce and abusive comments from Chinese viewers who were displeased with her performance.

Gu is defiant about her decision to join forces with the Chinese regime. She brushes aside any suggestion that she’s become walking propaganda for an evil regime by mocking anyone who says it. Speaking at her press conference after her gold-medal win, she said, “I’m not going to waste my time trying to placate people who are 1) uneducated, and 2) probably are never going to experience the kind of joy and gratitude and just love that I have the great fortune to experience on a daily basis. So yeah, if people don’t believe me and if people don’t like me, then that’s their loss. They’re never gonna win the Olympics. So.”

She goes on, saying that she has a “good heart,” so anyone who criticizes her decision “does not have the empathy to empathize with a good heart, perhaps because they don’t share the same kind of morals that I do.”

She repeatedly uses the same line that her goal is to use sport “to foster connection between countries.”

While Gu was 15 when she joined forces with China and may have been pressured by her mother to do so, as an adult, she is capitalizing on her role as a representative for the Chinese regime and boldly dismissing as uneducated anyone who questions that role. (Gu went to a $41,000-a-year private high school in San Francisco and plans to start classes at Stanford University in the fall.)

Gu still has two more opportunities, half-pipe and slopestyle, to bring home more gold for her dear leader, Xi Jinping, and perhaps earn a big payout from the communist regime.",https://spectator.org/china-theft-foreign-policy/,2022-02-09
Evergrande Crisis Highlights Vulnerabilities in China’s Economy - The American Spectator,"Last week, China Evergrande suspended its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Evergrande is China’s second-largest real estate developer. The company has been in crisis for months, having repeatedly missed interest payments on its debt. Now, the company, which owes $300 billion in debt, including $19 billion to foreign investors, has defaulted.

In December, the S&P labeled Evergrande as being in default, joining credit rating organizations Fitch and Motley Fool, who also both downgraded Evergrande’s debt late last year.

The Evergrande crisis threatens homebuyers in China, as well as investors big and small around the world. Some experts fear that Evergrande’s implosion can have a ripple effect, both across the Chinese real estate sector and its broader economy. Real estate makes up 30 percent of China’s GDP.

In a recent report, the Federal Reserve warns that Evergrande, which has been stressed by Chinese regulators, can derail the entire Chinese economy.

“Stresses [in the real estate sector] could, in turn, propagate to the Chinese financial system through spillovers to financial firms, a sudden correction of real estate prices, or a reduction in investor risk appetite,” it said.

The report also warns that the ongoing Evergrande situation in China threatens the world economy, including the United States: “Given the size of China’s economy and financial system as well as its extensive trade linkages with the rest of the world, financial stresses in China could strain global financial markets through deterioration of risk sentiment, pose risks to global economic growth, and affect the United States.”

Because Evergrande is such an indebted company and is publicly traded in foreign countries, including the United States, its collapse has already cost overseas investors substantial capital. The firm defaulted on $1.2 billion in debt owned by overseas investors.

Even if Evergrande does not prove to be another Lehman Brothers, its downfall is an indictment of the Chinese political economy.

While debt has burdened the Chinese real estate sector for years, it was regulators’ recent crackdown on borrowing that ignited the current crisis. Evergrande was highly leveraged (indebted) but had it been allowed to continue borrowing money, it would have financed its projects that way and simply kept building.

Already, Evergrande and other Chinese real estate giants have built entire “Ghost Cities” — tens of thousands of empty apartment complexes with no renters. Why did this happen? Because supply did not equal demand. Chinese government officials’ policies incentivized the construction of new buildings despite no one having the capital to buy them. Thus, the Evergrande crisis reveals the mismanagement of not only one company but China’s entire economic system.

Eswar Prasad, a professor at Cornell University who previously served as the head of the IMF’s China division, told the Financial Times that China’s central planners’ attempts to rein in large companies in order to reduce inequality is very costly.

“Beijing is discovering the huge costs of rectifying imbalances in a sector that it had long relied upon to prop up growth, boost local government revenues and contribute to household wealth accumulation,” he told the Times.

“The [real estate] sector’s influence over practically every aspect of the economy, financial markets, and society makes it a hugely thorny issue to fix.”

China, often portrayed as a rising economic and military power by its leaders, is inflicted with its own domestic struggles and challenges.

Already, the Evergrande crisis has had some contagion, with developers Sinic Holdings and China Properties Group recently defaulting on $250 million and $226 million in debt, respectively.

The Evergrande crisis reflects not just mismanagement at one firm, but rather systemic flaws inherent in China’s “State-Capitalism” model. For decades, government policies encouraged the construction of new apartments that no one moved into. The scheme was kept going by Chinese companies’ seemingly endless ability to borrow more debt. However, now that Chinese regulators are attempting to crack down on large firms and reduce China’s growing inequality, the jig is up.",https://spectator.org/china-threatens-nuke-japan/,2022-01-11
Fauci Flip-Flops Further on China and COVID - The American Spectator,"Having previously praised China’s transparency early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci has called on the Chinese Communist Party to release the medical records of multiple Chinese citizens who fell ill with COVID-like symptoms prior to the global spread of the virus.

Fauci has recently begun to humor the notion that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have, in fact, originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology after working to discredit the lab leak theory throughout the pandemic.

In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Fauci voiced a desire to see the medical records of six Chinese laborers who fell ill with COVID-like symptoms in 2012 after they visited the Yunnan Cave, along those of three medical researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology who also developed similar symptoms in 2019, just before the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the interview, Fauci expressed a newfound skepticism towards the information from the Wuhan lab, asking, “Did they really get sick, and if so, what did they get sick with?”

Fauci added, “It is entirely conceivable that the origins of SARS-CoV-2 was in that cave and either started spreading naturally or went through the lab.” This represents a newfound openness to the lab leak theory after months of dismissing and flat-out ignoring its legitimacy.

These statements come as the left-wing and legacy media suddenly begin to entertain the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology after a prolonged period of labeling the theory with any number of pejoratives.

There are, of course, those in the media who stand by the argument that the lab leak theory is nothing more than a conspiracy theory. Shi Zhengli, a researcher specializing in SARS-like coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, insists that the medical records Fauci is requesting do not exist as there were no infections at the lab, and thus there is no possibility of a lab leak. Prominent microbiologist Peter Palese — who previously denounced the lab leak theory as a conspiracy theory — has recently come to recant his claim that COVID-19 is a naturally occurring phenomenon.

At the bare minimum, an independent investigation into the matter seems warranted, especially considering that the World Health Organization’s own query into the matter was ineffective.

On May 26, 2021, the United States Senate unanimously passed a bill introduced by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) to declassify all American intelligence on possible links between the COVID-19 pandemic and the Wuhan lab.

If COVID-19 was man-made, the United States needs to know how and why so another pandemic can be prevented. If COVID-19 occurred naturally, then we need to prove it conclusively so we can better study how it happened. Either way, we cannot definitively defeat this virus until we learn the truth of its origins.",https://spectator.org/china-three-child-policy/,2021-06-04
Fauci Continues to Mislead Us About China - The American Spectator,"As chief medical adviser to President Biden, Dr. Anthony Fauci is extremely influential. People worldwide look to the U.S. for leadership, and he is the face of the U.S. in fighting the deadly virus originally discovered in Wuhan, China.

As new evidence increasingly points to the possibility that the coronavirus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Fauci, who had been singing along with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in an attempt to dismiss such a possibility, has now admitted a lab leak is possible. But even after such a belated admission, he continues to mislead us about China.

In a recent interview, Fauci said, “It’s obviously in China’s interest to find out exactly what it is,” and China “obviously” wants “openness and cooperation.” The world should not be “accusatory” towards China over its hiding evidence, he added.

When I read this, I could not believe my eyes — is he on some kind of drug from the CCP, or is he lying with a clear conscience?

The CCP, which owns the whole of China, covered up the outbreak, and allowed the virus to spread to the entire world, strongly denies it came from Wuhan. It officially announced that the virus originated in the U.S. and is now threatening to retaliate against any country that calls for an open and objective investigation into the virus’ origin. After the U.S. announced a probe into the origin of the virus, Chinese state media declared that the country “must prepare for nuclear war with U.S.”

Despite all this, Fauci still believes the CCP “obviously” wants the world to find out the origin of the virus? And he still praises China for its “openness and cooperation”?

And we are too “accusatory” towards China?

The world has given the CCP time to erase evidence and get away with its wrongdoing precisely because we have not been accusatory enough toward the CCP for releasing the virus on the world (intentionally or not), for its coverups, and for its bullying.

Does the CCP ever behave nicely and follow the rule of law? Does it ever respond in kind to our patience and cowardice? No! Never. In a previous article for The American Spectator, “What You Need to Know About the Chinese Communist Party,” Wei Zhang and I show that the CCP never keeps its promises; doesn’t believe in rules, laws, or reasoning; propagates false information; monopolizes power; and uses any and all means to keep its monopoly, legal or illegal.

The only way for the world to obtain the truth about the origin of the virus from China is by uniting and using all its political and economic leverage to demand that the CCP allow an objective, impartial, and independent investigation.

Yet, in another recent interview, Fauci said he trusted Chinese scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology: “They’re very… trustworthy scientists,” he said. He further assured us that he did not believe they attempted to modify viruses to make them more contagious.

Once again, I am completely dumbfounded by his naïveté or outright lies.

Yet who would dare to rebut Fauci by saying that Chinese scientists are not trustworthy? That would be racist. But this politically correct generalization shows how clever and calculating Dr. Fauci is. He misleads us by invoking our universal respect for scientists across borders: even if the Chinese regime is dictatorial, its scientists are the same as scientists in free and democratic countries, and therefore must be trustworthy, right?

Wrong.

The Chinese Communist Party exerts total control over every aspect of Chinese society. It runs the entire country as a giant corporation. Living and working in China is not a right but a privilege granted by the party, with one condition: all the people in China must obey and support the party. Chinese scientists are no exception. In fact, the CCP owns the life, family, work, and career of all scientists in China. If the party orders them to hide evidence, mislead, and tamper with data, they have no choice but to do so.

Evidence supporting this argument abounds. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, to support Mao Zedong’s crazy ideas, scientists in China falsified grain yield data by about a hundred times, from hundreds of kilos to tens of thousands of kilos per acre. The fake harvest resulted in one of the greatest man-made famines in human history, during which tens of millions died of starvation. And scientists in China altered data to hide it. Today, scientists in China hide information on the coronavirus and on clinical trials of Chinese coronavirus vaccines.

Most scientists in China are trustworthy, if they can behave honestly without fear. Unfortunately, that “if” makes all the difference. The CCP systematically turns all the people and organizations in China into party tools. Under such a regime, telling the truth is highly risky, as the fate of coronavirus outbreak whistleblower Dr. Li Wenliang showed us. He was punished by the CCP and eventually killed by the virus.

So, when Dr. Fauci tells us that China is open and cooperative in helping the world to find the origin of the coronavirus and that we must trust scientists in China with the investigation, I can’t help but wonder for whom he is working: the American people or the Chinese Communist Party.

Dr. Fauci, your misleading claim must be corrected and applied to you: You are not trustworthy.",https://spectator.org/china-throws-iran-a-400-billion-lifeline/,2021-06-08
"China and G7 Spar, NATO Weighs In - The American Spectator","Heads of state from the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France, and Japan at the Group of Seven (G7) Summit this past week have issued tougher messaging on China compared to their relative silence in recent months. The Biden–Harris administration has also confirmed that the allied democracies discussed China’s history of economic malfeasance and human rights abuses.

The G7 leaders also called for an additional investigation into the origins of COVID-19 after collectively pledging over two billion doses of the COVID vaccine to the world.

At the end of the three-day summit, the diplomats released a 25-page written statement with a title that is suspiciously similar to much of President Biden’s campaign and administrative sloganeering: “Our Shared Agenda for Global Action to Build Back Better.” Among other things, the communique specifically mentions China’s handling of COVID-19, its disregard for human rights in the Xinjiang Province and Hong Kong, and demands the country respect maritime law and international waterways. There are no enforcement mechanisms or consequences mentioned in the document, simply things the G7 did not particularly appreciate that China did.

The Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, the country where the G7 Summit was held, decried the statement as “slander” and a “serious violation of the basic norms of international relations … which further exposed the sinister intentions of a few countries such as the United States.”

The Chinese Embassy issued a statement affirming their frustration that a small group of nations make decisions affecting the world. An embassy spokesperson said, “The days when global decisions were dictated by a small group of countries are long gone.”

Upon the conclusion of the G7 Summit, President Biden met with leadership from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to affirm the group’s “sacred alliance” to defend its members militarily. NATO leadership is expected to announce that China is being reclassified as a security risk to Western nations.

Secretary-General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg said,

China is coming closer to us. We see them in cyberspace. We see China in Africa, in the Arctic. But we also see China investing heavily in our own critical infrastructure and trying to control it. We have seen the discussions about the 5G Huawei. And that’s the reason why the NATO 2030 agenda is so important. Because that agenda is about strengthening our resilience. It’s about investing more in technology. And it is also about making sure that we step up when it comes to cyber defenses.

Whether or not action materializes beyond issuing press releases and jet-setting across the globe remains to be seen, however. China continues to facilitate its global market dominance while the rest of the world seems to believe it can ward it off by wagging a finger.",https://spectator.org/china-totalitarianism/,2021-06-15
Google's Hard Line on Free Speech Violations in China - The American Spectator,"Today Google announced on its blog that it had been the target of a China-based cyberattack in mid-December. David Drummond, a senior vice president of the firm, wrote the hackers succeeded in stealing some intellectual property seemed to be aimed at accessing the GMail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. The unwritten assertion is that the Chinese government backed the attack in some way. Google is responding by refusing to continue censoring search results in China and preparing to cease operations in China entirely if necessary to maintain that policy:

These attacks and the surveillance they have uncovered–combined with the attempts over the past year to further limit free speech on the web–have led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in China. We have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all. We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China. The decision to review our business operations in China has been incredibly hard, and we know that it will have potentially far-reaching consequences.

It is a momentous decision, and it seems that Google deserves great credit for refusing this latest despotic act.

Sadly, Drummond found it necessary to provide cover for China-based Google employees by including this disclaimer at the end of the blog post:

We want to make clear that this move was driven by our executives in the United States, without the knowledge or involvement of our employees in China who have worked incredibly hard to make Google.cn the success it is today.

The original decision to expand into China while censoring search results was a calculated one, and it raised questions about the extent to which Google was willing to compromise free speech in order to capture that potentially vast market. This announcement sends the message that the company is not willing to go far at all, at least any longer.

UPDATE:

Of course, Google is still a business, interested in making money. The best case scenario is that Google is betting that they are too important in China for the government to call their bluff and refuse to let Google stop censoring searches. Obviously Google has information that we don’t. Hopefully what they’re seeing is that they can find a way to provide uncensored web searchs to the Chinese without horribly compromising human rights.

Needless to say, it would be nice to see Bing and Yahoo announce that they are also not willing to compromise…",https://spectator.org/china-toxic-dog-food/,2010-01-12
What China’s Persecution of Minorities and America’s Newly Passed Hong Kong Human Rights Act Tell Us About LeBron - The American Spectator,"On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The next day the House passed it 417-1. It now goes to President Trump, and he is expected to sign it promptly. The Human Rights and Democracy Act would require the secretary of state to certify annually that Hong Kong continues to preserve enough autonomy from China’s communist tyranny so as to justify its continuing to benefit from special trade status with America. Otherwise the president is authorized to impose sanctions. The act further declares solidarity with student protesters fighting for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong.

1. Chinese Communist Persecution of Minorities and Suppression of Freedom

The act’s passage comes on the heels of revelations in more than 400 leaked pages from inside the Chinese government’s highest echelons that China has been pursuing a concerted campaign of genocide against its Uighur Muslim population, accompanied by torture, concentration camps, and instructions to show “absolutely no mercy.” Meanwhile, China now is crushing dissent over repression in Hong Kong, with some 600 pro-freedom student activists holed up in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, surrounded by riot police using tear gas and rubber bullets to crush their resistance.

People of conscience understand the power of condemning evil. For most of us, alas, we simply do not enjoy benefit of a public platform large enough to impact a tyranny like China by speaking out against their communist evil. Others have the platform but not the opportunity. Recently, the National Basketball Association (NBA) played some games in China, with the Los Angeles Lakers playing against the Brooklyn Nets in Shanghai. Only days earlier, the general manager of the NBA’s Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey, created an international stir by tweeting his condemnation of China’s suppression of freedom in Hong Kong. Now the opportunity and platform presented itself to Lakers star LeBron James to speak out on Chinese soil for freedom. James has a history of speaking out on politics, appearing at Hillary Clinton rallies, regularly attacking President Trump, recently stomping off a basketball court while yelling in the middle of the national anthem, and even telling a talk show host that “I mean too much to society” to be silent on political issues. So this was his moment, while being feted in China, to speak a word for freedom and democracy in Hong Kong.

And, given the opportunity of a lifetime, he proved to be a gutless coward. By cowering and backing down, LeBron James publicly conveyed to the Chinese dictatorship that voices in the West will remain silent and that China is free to persecute and murder millions while James and his corporate sponsor, Nike, rake in their respective millions, devoid of conscience.

2. The Power of Voices of Conscience Speaking out for Freedom: The Soviet Jewry Experience of the 1970s

When I was in college I marched for freedom for Soviet Jewry. The issue dominated my college years and my social conscience. Communism is the world’s blight, and every people who encountered it learned it. The Ukrainians were mass-murdered in the millions during the mass starvation, the Golodomor, that was covered up by Walter Duranty and the despicable New York Times. The East Germans. The Poles. The Hungarians. The Georgians. The Armenians. The Latvians. The Romanians. The list is longer than the current field of Democrat candidates for president.

Many were surprised when activists in the American Jewish community emerged as the most anti-communist street activists of all. Stereotypes take time to fabricate, and they take even more time to fracture and demolish. Inasmuch as certain Jewish apostates were part of communism — the viciously anti-Semitic Karl Marx; the despicable Leon Trotsky, who so hated Judaism that he changed his name from Lev Bronstein to dissociate and then devoted himself to murdering Jews; and others of that apostate ilk who comprised the communist Yevsektsiya, which persecuted rabbis, closed down synagogues and yeshiva schools, and banned Judaic practices — many needed some time to grasp that Jews were mass-marching against communism and were in the forefront of protesting at Soviet “cultural events” brought to America because communism at its ideological core always has aimed to destroy Judaism.

We demanded an end to American “cultural exchanges” with the USSR as long as the communists would not let Jews leave the accursed Soviet Union. We did not even bother asking the Soviets to “improve conditions”; we just demanded that they let Jews get the hell out of their Soviet Hell and “workers’ paradise.” In that battle, a great, subtle war unfolded as the Soviets tried sending America the Moscow Circus, the Bolshoi Ballet, violinists, opera performers, Russian ice hockey teams, and others who would aim to fool Americans into thinking that the communist Hell was a place of culture. As Hitler had done successfully during the 1936 Olympics, they wanted to use cultural and sport performances to con the gullible ignoramuses of the West, already bombarded with endless left-wing propaganda from the Corrupt Journalist Corps, into believing that communist Russia and the USSR was a fine place being maligned by fascist falsifiers. But we were determined not to let the Soviet Union build cultural bridges over the bodies of Soviet Jews.

During our fight, we felt it imperative to find allies in the American cultural and sports worlds to speak openly against Soviet repression. It was hard because the Corrupt Journalist Corps is controlled by leftists, and leftists resist to this very day conceding that their socialist ideals are corrupt, corrosive, and murderous. Just as the corrupt leftist New York Times hid the Golodomor from its readers and falsified Stalin’s mass murder of Ukrainians, with their lying Moscow Bureau Chief Duranty winning a Pulitzer Prize for his lies, so it was that the New York Times even hid the Nazi Holocaust against Jews. The Times by and large refused to report on the unfolding Nazi Holocaust of six million Jews. Between 1939 and 1945, the New York Times published more than 23,000 front-page stories. Of those, 11,500 were about World War II. Only 26 — in six years — were about the Holocaust. The Times was passively complicit. They buried stories on back pages, denied even more critical stories the light of day, and published outright lies.

In such a world, it takes powerful and strong voices to cut through the leftist blackout by the Corrupt Journalist Corps in every generation. It often takes media heroes, celebrities prepared to speak out for freedom and truth, no matter the personal cost. When they do, it means they will be making enemies among the Corrupt Journalist Corps and may even be compromising their standing with fans. It may cost actors movie roles and athletes product endorsements because it is the American Left who impose professional blacklisting. But that is one way that heroism manifests itself.

3. The Nonsense and Disgrace of Blithely Describing Skillful Athletes as “Heroes”

It is a paradox that sports athletes often are called “heroes.” Really? Because a lug can throw a football accurately and with consistency, or can run with it over tackling defenders, or can catch it while other defenders are trying to block him, that makes him a hero? Because a lug can hurl a ball 60 feet and 6 inches consistently with pinpointed accuracy at 98 mph, occasionally varying his delivery with a ball that curves or slides or knuckles, that makes him a hero? Because he can hit a home run once every 10 times at bat or has a unique ability to get the big hit when it matters most, that makes him a hero? Because he has a muscular body and can bounce a ball and contort his torso in the face of defenders in driving towards a basket and then can dunk the ball 10 feet high or can toss it through a hoop from a distance of 24 feet, that makes him a hero?

Forgive me, but I just solemnly observed Veterans Day last week. I define “hero” differently. People who landed in Normandy in 1944 were heroes. People who went to Afghanistan to kill Taliban and to Iraq to capture Saddam Hussein and to Syria to kill ISIS and to Pakistan to kill Bin Laden were heroes. Thousands upon thousands of others in our armed forces — Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and the various associated units — were and are heroes, even if they were not assigned to the most dangerous of missions but simply gave up their freedoms to stand in harm’s way, always at the risk of their limbs and even lives, and sometimes at the cost of their limbs or lives. Those are heroes. Nathan Hale was a hero. Alvin York was a hero. Tibor Rubin was a hero.

By contrast, LeBron James is a gutless coward. A worm, a helminth feeding off the public trough.

4. Distinguishing a True American Patriot and Hero Who Happened to Be an Athlete From a Gutless Coward Like LeBron James

If I want an example of a sports hero, I look to Hank Greenberg, who hit 331 home runs during his extraordinary career but who missed four full years of baseball during the apex of his career to serve in the United States armed forces from 1941–44. His salary dropped from $55,000 a year ($984,000 in today’s numbers) to $21 a month ($400 in today’s numbers). He said, “I made up my mind to go when I was called. My country comes first.” When he was discharged upon reaching age 28, the age limit for military service as per army regulations at the time, he then reenlisted in the air force. He rose in officer ranks and ended up devoting 47 months in the service, longer than any other active major league player in history.

During those years he had been hitting more than 50 home runs annually. He had hit 58 in 1938, in a campaign that almost made baseball history. During his last month of that incredible season, Hank Greenberg was “intentionally walked” in 20 percent of his plate appearances, often by anti-Semitic pitchers who simply did not want to allow a Jew to break Babe Ruth’s 1927 record of 60 home runs. Had Greenberg avoided the service, he would today be celebrated in baseball’s annals among the very few who ever hit 500 or more home runs. But he was a hero. On the very first day that he returned to the Detroit Tigers after the war, after four years away, he hit a home run.

Likewise, as a Jew, although he decidedly was not religious, he heroically sat out a critical end-of-season game in 1934, when the Tigers had everything on the line, to make the point that, as a Jew, he would not play baseball on Yom Kippur. In his biography, Greenberg wrote,

The team was fighting for first place, and I was probably the only batter in the lineup who was not in a slump. But in the Jewish religion, it is traditional that one observe the [Rosh Hashanah] holiday solemnly, with prayer. One should not engage in work or play. And I wasn’t sure what to do.

Greenberg consulted with his moronic Reform rabbi, who ignorantly said that playing would be acceptable on that holy day. As a result, he played and hit two home runs, winning the game for the Tigers, with the second one in the ninth inning. Yet Greenberg thereafter recalled contemporaneously,

I caught hell from my fellow parishioners, I caught hell from some rabbis, and I don’t know what to do. It’s 10 days until the next holiday — Yom Kippur.

He decided correctly that his Reform rabbi was an idiot, and he took upon himself, despite being non-religious, to sit out Yom Kippur. In the words of Hank’s father, “Yom Kippur was different. I put my foot down, and Henry obeyed.” Father and son attended Kol Nidre services together. When Greenberg entered the Detroit temple on the Holy Day, the congregation stood and applauded him. In Edgar Guest’s famous poem published on the front page of the Detroit Free News,

The Irish didn’t like it when they heard of Greenberg’s fame

For they thought a good first baseman should possess an Irish name;

And the Murphys and Mulrooneys said they never dreamed they’d see

A Jewish boy from Bronxville out where Casey used to be. In the early days of April not a Dugan tipped his hat

Or prayed to see a “double” when Hank Greenberg came to bat.

In July the Irish wondered where he’d ever to play.

“He makes me think of Casey!” Old Man Murphy dared to say. And with fifty-seven doubles and a score of homers made

The respect they had for Greenberg was being openly displayed.

But on the Jewish New Year when Hank Greenberg came to bat

And made two home runs off pitcher Rhodes — they cheered like mad for that. Came Yom Kippur — holy fast day worldwide-over to the Jew —

And Hank Greenberg to his teaching and the old tradition true

Spent the day among his people and he didn’t come to play.

Said Murphy to Mulrooney, “We shall lose the game today!

We shall miss him on the infield and shall miss him at the bat

But he’s true to his religion — and I honor him for that!”

That is a hero. Through four years he did not evade the service, and on Yom Kippur he did not evade the services. (In contrast, contemporary zhlubs like Alex Bregman of the Astros, Max Fried of the Atlanta Braves, and Joc Pederson of the Los Angeles Dodgers, shamelessly played post-season games — and lost — this past Yom Kippur. In the post-Greenberg/Koufax era of America, there are no Jewish heroes in baseball.)

5. LeBron James: A Gutless Coward Who, When Given a Chance for Greatness, Could Do No More Than Shut Up and Dribble

All this brings us back to LeBron James. He is such a “hero” that Nike, the sponsors of Colin Kaepernick and other dregs who dwell beneath society’s bottom feeders, manufactures an athletic shoe called “LeBron 11 Elite Hero.” In an article in Salon, titled “LeBron James Is a Hero,” he was idolized for playing well in the dwindling minutes of an Olympics basketball game. USA Today calls him a “Cleveland hero.” The NBA website calls him a “hero.” And yet I call this “hero” a gutless coward.

Why? Because he has a world stage, and this dribbler has used that platform to speak on easy political matters that he does not necessarily understand but that resonate simplistically with his sycophants and acolytes, like when he endorsed “President Hillary Clinton” at a Cleveland rally the night before she lost Ohio to Donald Trump. And then he had a chance on the world stage, as the NBA recently engaged communist China, to speak out on human rights abuses, persecutions, and political murders in China. Human rights abuses in China go far beyond freedom issues in Hong Kong. For example, thousands of Muslim religious sites have been destroyed, over a million Uighurs have been confined, and others are forced to violate or abandon their faiths.

After Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey bravely tweeted his support for the pro-democracy rights movement in Hong Kong, the NBA’s big money sponsor, Nike, rushed to crush basketball voices for freedom in China. It was a moment in history, like the Soviet Jewry Freedom moment of the 1970s, when we needed just one or two powerful celebrity voices to join our call. And at the moment in history when he unexpectedly held center stage — or center court — this was LeBron James’s statement to reporters, commenting on Morey’s heroic tweet:

I just think that when you’re misinformed or you’re not educated about something — and I’m just talking about the tweet itself — you never know the ramifications that can happen. We all see what that [tweet] did — not only for our league but for all of us in America, for people in China as well.

The gutless coward chickened out and silenced the pro-freedom movement. As reported on CNN,

Speaking to reporters before a game in Los Angeles Monday, James called it “a very delicate situation, a very sensitive situation.” When asked whether Morey should be reprimanded for his tweet, James responded, “I think when we all sit back and learn from the situation that happened, understand that what you could tweet or could say, and we all talk about this freedom of speech — yes, we do all have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you’re not thinking about others and you’re only thinking about yourself. “I don’t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke. So many people could have been harmed, not just financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say and what we do, even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.”

LeBron James, even without prompting, could do no more than shut up and dribble.

I will always remember Hank Greenberg, who was active before my time, as a hero — not for the home runs he hit but for those he never got to hit because he was a patriot who volunteered and reenlisted to fight for our country and freedom, and I further always will honor him for the game he missed to respect his religion — honoring both his Father and his father — even though he personally was not observant. And I always will despise LeBron James as a gutless coward, a worm, because, for all his posturing over domestic political matters, he had one opportunity in his lifetime to make a difference for the freedom for millions — and he made the cowardly choice to wallow in his Nike millions instead of speaking for the human millions because, despite his $300 million–plus endorsement deal, he did not have enough cash already.

He may be a “hero” in a world where Susan Rice could describe Bowe Bergdahl as having “served the United States with honor and distinction.” But for those who can tell the difference between a great man and a worm, LeBron James always will stand out as a dribbling gutless coward.",https://spectator.org/china-under-stress/,2019-11-22
How to Make China Pay and Prevent the Next Pandemic - The American Spectator,"President Trump now acknowledges that there must be a strong response to China’s perfidy in setting loose the COVID-19 coronavirus on the civilized world. Whether Chinese officials intentionally allowed a naturally occurring virus to spread to the rest of the world to gain geopolitical advantage — as I and a few others believe — or they were simply lax in preventing the spread to other countries does matter, but not that much. Both possibilities require a strong response to prevent recurrences in the future.

Personal injury law recognizes a difference between an intentional act done for the purpose of harming others and a negligent act that may harm others but is not done for that purpose. Both require that wrongdoers compensate their victims, however. A purposeful act intended to cause harm — an “intentional tort” — may merit a greater penalty, such as punitive damages or criminal sanctions, to punish as well as to deter similar actions in the future. Either way, however, there have to be consequences, not only to compensate victims but also to deter others.

The legal theory developed by the last generation, “law and economics,” teaches that the costs of harm, whether caused intentionally or by failing to take sufficient precautions, should be borne by the wrongdoer; if not, what economists call an “externality” will be created. If wrongdoers, whether polluters or rogue nations, get away with not bearing the full costs of their actions or failures to act, others are invited by their example to behave badly in the future. Unfortunately, the converse is not necessarily true; sadly, making a person or institution pay for the harm it has caused does not necessarily ensure that similar harmful conduct will not occur in the future. More about that later.

The most charitable characterization of the Chinese government’s actions is that it failed to take precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 that were commensurate with the level of risk to the rest of the world. To prevent this from ever happening again, a multinational legal regime should be put in place that insures that the next time an incipient virus or other contagious disease occurs, governments will behave differently. The response should be multinational; one lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic is that no nation acting alone can protect itself in this era of globalization and widespread international travel by air.

The first step should be to require China to pay for the harm that it has caused if we can. That is necessary, but not sufficient, to deter future risk-taking with the lives and livelihoods of other people around the globe, but also for compensating victims and what philosophers call “retributive justice,” to give the survivors the satisfaction that those who harmed them and their loved ones didn’t get off scot free. But that is easier said than done. Countries are usually immune from lawsuits in the courts of another country. This legal principle, called “foreign sovereign immunity,” is embodied in a 1976 federal statute in the United States. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) have proposed a bill to create an exception that would allow victims of the coronavirus to sue China in the U.S. courts.

If enacted, there might just be a way to force China to pay compensation to victims. China holds over $1 trillion of U.S. government debt and perhaps that can be turned into a two-edged sword by paying victims instead of repaying our debts to China. An old common-law writ called “garnishment” is a “legal procedure by which a creditor can collect what a debtor owes by reaching the debtor’s property when it is in the hands of someone other than the debtor.”

In other words, in theory, if a case could get past the sovereign immunity hurdle, it might be possible for a court to order the U.S. government to pay some of the $1 trillion that it owes to China to coronavirus victims instead and to credit those payments against our debts to China. I am not aware that this has ever actually been done with sovereign debt owed by one nation to another, and the consequences for future international lending to the U.S. might be dire.

President Trump maintains a better course would be to raise tariffs on China (again) and use the money raised to pay victims. That approach has the advantage of creating a stream of revenue; the U.S. does not actually pay back the debt that we owe the Chinese and other holders of our bonds; we simply roll over the debt by issuing more bonds.

Another option would be to set up a “foreign claims tribunal” to pay the claims of the injured, either by voluntary agreement or by seizing the property of the guilty party. For example, following the Iran hostage crisis, the United States seized Iranian assets in the U.S. and the two countries then agreed to set up an international tribunal that has paid $2.5 billion out of the seized Iranian assets to settle 4,700 claims by victims. Similarly, Germany has paid over $80 billion to victims of the Holocaust.

Compensating victims for their injuries and financial losses would be a good thing to do if we can find a way to get the Chinese to do it. So far, however, the Chinese government calls the demands for compensation “preposterous,” “blackmail,” and “political farce.” They do have a point that international law is currently weak on the obligations of one country to act decisively to prevent the spread of contagious diseases to others. For example, the World Health Organization’s International Health Regulations, first adopted in 1951 and amended several times since, only apply to three diseases — cholera, plague, and yellow fever — and only require countries to “report” to the WHO, not to take decisive action to prevent the spread worldwide.

In addition, unfortunately, experience shows that merely making a person or an institution pay for the harm that they cause — “internalizing” the cost of the harm on the wrongdoer — does not necessarily prevent a recurrence. That’s the sad lesson of the 2010 Deep Water Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

The Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in 1988 was supposed to be the oil spill that ended all oil spills. In its wake, the United States passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), which embodied the legal theories of the lawyer economists of the last generation such as Yale’s Guido Calabresi and Chicago’s Richard Posner about “internalizing” the economic costs of accidents on those in the best position to prevent them. In addition to compensating victims for the harm that an oil spill causes, OPA90 also imposed large per barrel financial penalties to deter future spills. The principal owner of the well involved in the 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill paid out $61.6 billion (with a “b”) in damages and penalties, about one-third of the total value of the company before the spill. But even when threatened with these enormous monetary consequences, the spill still occurred. What lawyer-economists call “general deterrence,” the threat of having to pay large sums, did not prevent that spill.

Moreover, the key decision-makers on the drilling platform ended up in the water 52 miles from shore surrounded by burning oil, and 11 of their colleagues died. They certainly had strong personal incentives not to take undue risks. Without going into too much technical detail, it appears that decision-makers on the rig were subject to immediate pressures to get a costly, long overdue job done quickly. They took a number of shortcuts that had worked at other wells without adverse consequences, but which in retrospect they regretted and which collectively allowed the blowout to occur.

What this should teach us is that human beings — even if properly incentivized — sometimes fail to take proper precautions against harm. This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in complex situations with multiple links in the chain of causation, such as an oil spill or a pandemic. We humans find it difficult to predict the long-term consequences of our actions, including failing to shut off international air travel promptly, particularly when we are confronted by immediate incentives that cut in the other direction, such as embarrassment and the economic costs that come from shutting off international travel at the first sign of trouble. We as a species tend to avoid immediate unpleasant consequences and “hope for the best” regarding possible long-term harms, particularly when those possible future harms are primarily to others.

What is the solution? There have been numerous after-action reports about the Deep Water Horizon spill. The best is by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), Macondo Well Deepwater Horizon Blowout: Lessons for Improving Offshore Drilling Safety (2011). It makes numerous recommendations, but the most important one for present purposes is that some decisions are too important to be made by fallible human beings on the scene who may be subject to a variety of pressures and unable to foresee the consequences of their decisions accurately. Better to agree in advance on hard-and-fast precautionary rules rather than rely on fallible human judgments in the moment.

Thus, for example, the NAS committee recommends that a cement log bore test — a $10,000 procedure that probably would have prevented the Deepwater Horizon spill — should be required in every case rather than left to operator discretion as it was under the government regulations in effect at the time of the spill.

One of the safest complex human systems, the air traffic control system, illustrates this principle. It includes mandatory precautions in the form of spacing requirements between planes, and replacing critical components of aircraft before the end of their expected useful life to prevent failures. These decisions are too important to be left to ad hoc judgments by fallible human beings with short-term interests in getting there faster or getting one more flight out of an engine before an overhaul.

Yes, make the Chinese pay for the harm that they have caused if we can. But that’s not enough. The world also needs to come together around a convention of mandatory best practices to prevent pandemics. Unless there is a reliable test to identify the contagious and prevent them from traveling, an International Pandemic Prevention Convention should prescribe mandatory precautionary measures such as cutting off international air travel at the first sign of trouble to prevent the spread rather than waiting until there is “clear evidence” of human-to-human transmission, as Chinese officials claim they did. A convention should also include a clear obligation by countries that fail to prevent the spread of contagion internationally to pay compensation for the harm that they cause. An International Pandemic Prevention Convention could be enforced by the nations of the world refusing to allow air travel (including through intermediate destinations) from any country that does not abide by the convention’s rules. This type of multilateral international response will no doubt be expensive and inconvenient, but far less so than experiencing another pandemic, the costs of which both economically and in human suffering are incalculable. The civilized world has a moral obligation to future generations to put a new international legal regime in place that will ensure that nothing like this pandemic ever happens again.

The philosopher John Rawls has written that we humans are most likely to agree on just solutions when we are behind a “veil of ignorance” and so do not know whether we will be winners or losers from the rules adopted. We do not know what countries will be the next victims of COVID-like pandemics. Now is the time to put in place an international regime of mandatory precautions that will prevent something like this from ever happening again. That won’t bring back the dead, but they will not have died in vain.",https://spectator.org/china-vs-trump-covid-19-2020-election-charlie-gerow-mark-singel/,2020-05-02
First-Ever ‘Human-less’ Restaurant Opens in China - The American Spectator,"“Excuse me, waiter” may soon be a saying of the past. Last week, the Qianxi Robot Catering Group opened a restaurant in the city of Shunde in China’s Guangdong Province. A few key takeaways regarding the new restaurant are its 21,527 square-foot space, its diverse menu — and the fact that there will be no waiters, hosts, food prep staff, or human employees.

Yes, you read that right: The new, futuristic Chinese restaurant will be entirely operated by robots. The facility is home to 20 different robots that are capable of seating guests, making drinks, taking orders, prepping food, and every other task done by traditional waiters.

The (human) owner of the restaurant said that this concept could be a cutting-edge solution in China’s fight against the spread of COVID-19. Customers could have a sit-down meal without interacting with another human while eating food that has not been touched by another person.

The machines have the capacity to make anything from traditional Chinese cuisine to a cheeseburger and fries. Additionally, the fully robotic staff has the ability to serve more than 600 customers at once. Meals can be ready in a matter of seconds.

The owners of the restaurant released a video showcasing the restaurant’s automated capabilities, which can be found here.

The video shows the robots preparing meals on an assembly line as well as interacting with and serving its dining customers. It also displays children having a great time with the robot as it serves them ice cream.

Through artificial intelligence technology, each robot learns how to make certain dishes by observing the behaviors of human chefs. Quanxi Group’s general manager, Xiao Ran said, “The cooking robots ‘learned’ how to prepare complicated Chinese dishes by imitating the actions of experienced human chefs, then had their operations improved through a lengthy trial-and-error process.”

Automated food production technology has been tested and implemented for years in China and across the globe. Here in the United States, restaurants have already begun using robots to assist in the food production process.

Spyce Restaurant in Boston has a fully automated kitchen where customers order their meals on a kiosk and it is then prepared by robots. The only role humans play in the culinary process is ingredient preparation at an off-site kitchen. So much for the culinary arts!

Qui Mi, of the Qianxi Group, said, “During 2020, the group plans to build more centralized kitchens to further expand in the cities of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area while achieving mass production of robots with an expected output of some 5,000 units per year.”

On the same day of the restaurant’s opening, the Qianxi Group entered a long-term strategic agreement with Siemens (China) to accelerate this new automated culinary concept. In recent years, the Chinese food service industry has had issues of overcommitting and over-investing in next-generation technology concepts.

While some technologies such as “Flippy” the robotic hamburger flipper have begun to catch on, many automated culinary technologies have been a flash in the pan.

The obvious pros of this new technology are the contactless component in the midst of a global pandemic as well as the higher rate of efficiency produced at a lower cost as compared to a human worker.

While the United States continues to raise its minimum wage and the cost to operate a business, companies have begun to turn to automated alternatives to lower their operating costs. Companies such as McDonald’s have installed kiosks in stores across the world.

As labor costs increase and Americans begin to desire more contactless forms of customer service, there is certainly a possibility that technologies such as human-less restaurants could one day come to the United States.",https://spectator.org/china-warfooting-space/,2020-07-02
IBM Lies to Trump While Selling Out to China - The American Spectator,"Near the tail end of last year, President Trump (then only President-elect Trump) seemed to have made some headway with the formerly recalcitrant tech industry. Along with an apparently successful meeting with tech executives, the new president had received assurances of cooperation with his plan to reclaim American jobs from those very executives.

The most visible such assurance came shortly after the president’s election, in the form of a letter from IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, who promised to expand hiring by 25,000 over the next four years. Along with this, Rometty also offered Trump a great heaping of unsolicited (and unhelpful) advice on how to create “new collar” jobs. (Spoiler alert: it involved selling out American workers to their new would-be tech masters.) Further, the company’s already documented friendliness with China, the geopolitical rival most often at loggerheads with the new president, remained a very live concern.

Given all this, there was ample reason for Trump to be skeptical of IBM’s promises, and to ignore their disingenuous suggestions. Nevertheless, an optimistic observer could have suggested that perhaps IBM was sincere and that, in any event, Trump should give them a chance to live up to their promises.

We now know how utterly empty those promises actually were. On Trump’s first Monday in office, Bloomberg and the San Jose Mercury News reported that, far from its promises of expanding employment by 25,000, IBM has actually gone on a firing spree. Indeed, according to the IBM employees quoted, the open letter from Rometty was only ever a bit of smarmy corporate PR intended to cover up the fact that IBM was planning on shipping far more jobs overseas than it had any plans of creating at home. Per Bloomberg:

Rometty’s hiring pledge prompted current and former IBM workers to vent on message boards and Facebook groups. Some complained that the new recruiting drive wouldn’t offset jobs sent overseas in recent years. Others said Rometty had neglected to mention whether and how many people would be fired in the meantime. Some urged online communities to contact the Trump transition team and educate his aides about IBM’s history of layoffs and outsourcing. “Ginni Rometty is terminating thousands of IT workers and touting herself as some hero who’s out to hire 25,000 workers,” says Sara Blackwell, a Sarasota, Florida-based lawyer and advocate for Protect U.S. Workers, who represents about 100 IBM ex-employees who have filed discrimination and other complaints. “To me, that’s hypocritical.”

Ah, what a devilish thing fine print can be!

In reality, there was no reason to suspect that IBM would do anything else. The success of their stock in recent years has come almost entirely from not merely ignoring American interests, but arguably from acting against them. Nowhere has this been more true than China, where former Chinese officials have openly touted IBM’s perverse willingness to practically give away their own technology to the Chinese government in exchange for fleeting access to the Chinese market. Never mind that, thanks to IBM’s help, those same officials gleefully gloat about their ability to create “a domestic tech industry that in the long run will no longer need to buy American products.” Rometty will likely have her golden parachute and speaking spot at Davos nailed down by the time that “long run” comes around.

President Trump has yet to weigh in on this particular betrayal, though he obviously should. The president’s inaugural address stressed that his administration will follow the simple dicta that one should “buy American” and “hire American.” IBM is ensuring that China will not follow the former while openly thumbing their nose at the latter. Trump obviously prefers a dual carrot and stick approach to keeping industries at home, and for that he deserves commendation. But in the case of IBM, it may be more appropriate, to paraphrase the words of the man whose bust now adorns Trump’s oval office, Teddy Roosevelt, to tweet loudly and wield a big stick.",https://spectator.org/china-weather-covid-lockdown/,2017-01-26
We Need to Back India in the Tech Cold War Against China - The American Spectator,"China and India scaled back operations in the Line of Actual Control (LAC) region of the contested Galawan Valley on Monday. Three weeks ago, the valley was the site of the bloodiest altercation between China and India since the 1970s, resulting in over 50 reported deaths. These tensions have played out both on the front lines and in the competitive tech sector in India.

While direct military tensions between India and China may be easing, the brewing tech cold war is not. For the past month, Indians have waged virtual battles against China through app stores like Apple’s App Store and Google Play.

India began boycotting Chinese apps and goods in early June, after Google Play took down a viral app titled “Remove Chinese Apps,” which identified Chinese software in smartphone apps.

This week, tensions flared as India banned the internationally popular Chinese video app TikTok. The app, which many national security experts conclude is a cybersecurity threat, has been sharing user data with China. TikTok, along with messenger app WeChat, was among 59 apps with developers based in China that India banned.

National security experts concluded long ago that 21st-century warfare would be fought in the digital realm. For now, there is no outright war between India and China, but if or when it happens, we best be prepared to back up India.

With the prevalence of Chinese tech in the world, we need strong allies that have taken the first steps in countering Chinese influence. Working side by side with Canada, we have held Huawei, a Chinese tech conglomerate, accountable for stealing trade secrets and user data by detaining their CFO. Adding the massive Indian market to our alliance against China is a strategic necessity if we are to combat the hegemony of Chinese tech. The coalition between Canada and the U.S. has already resulted in serious pressure for Boris Johnson to roll back the U.K.’s 5G partnership with Huawei. Ensuring our allies’ digital infrastructures are free of Chinese interference allows us greater control over our own tech centers.

In the days following India’s decision to ban Chinese apps, the U.S. has taken promising steps in standing with India. Secretary Mike Pompeo announced on Fox News Monday night that he is considering bans on TikTok and other Chinese apps. Supporting India, not necessarily militarily, but by matching their movements on the digital front, is a key strategy in building global support against Chinese tech.

One way to support India is to promote alternatives to Chinese products, such as Instagram’s Reels app. Indians are already using the American app Reels as a replacement to TikTok. By promoting Indian and American alternatives to Chinese apps, we can diminish China’s cultural and digital influence without engaging in physical conflict.

This is, of course, the first step. Looking at sourcing of hardware and software is an ideal follow-up. We should prioritize American, Indian, and other allies’ hardware over those that are made in China. In order to decouple ourselves from China, we have to rely upon alternatives from trustworthy supply chains.

The U.S. ought to take a serious look at what Chinese companies we are exposing ourselves to via smartphone apps. Chinese companies are subsidiaries of the CCP, and any app developed is likely going to contain some form of spyware. By deleting Chinese apps, we can accomplish the first step in a long campaign against Chinese tech rulership.",https://spectator.org/china-world-island-geopolitics-belt-road/,2020-07-08
"India Hedges Its Bets With the U.S., Russia, and China - The American Spectator","Receiving limited attention in mainstream media is India’s recently expressed desire to hit the “refresh” button in its relations with the United States. As recently reported in USNI News, a publication of the U.S. Naval Institute, the Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, formerly ambassador to the U.S., stated at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., that India needs more latitude also to increase engagement with both Russia and China. Jaishankar moderated this suggestion by referring to the Malabar maritime exercise hosted by Guam, “shifting coalitions,” and India’s need for “greater customization.”

India is a remarkable success story for U.S. foreign policy, spanning three U.S. and three India administrations and currently ending a chill-out between Washington and New Delhi that lasted throughout the Cold War. As I have written in these pages, our common interests include concern over China’s military ascent, the Belt and Road Initiative, disrespect for a rules-based international order, fear of Islamist jihad, and trade and direct investment.

The U.S.–India Civil Nuclear Agreement, signed in 2008 by the Bush administration, consolidated cooperation — provided for the construction of nuclear reactors and supply of uranium fuel, as well as collaboration in technology and outer space. Now it appears to be back on track after the bankruptcy filing of Westinghouse in 2017. Major joint ventures in aerospace and defense have also evolved for leading U.S. and Indian companies. Boeing and the Tata Group manufacture Apache helicopter fuselages, while Boeing and Mahindra & Mahindra make the F/18 fighter; and Lockheed Martin has a joint venture with the Tata Group to manufacture the F-16. Further, the U.S. has several operating protocols with India that benefit naval logistics and the sharing of encryption and information.

The obvious reason for India’s position is that Russia represents 58 percent of India’s military imports in recent years, with $12 billion of contracts in the offing, while China is India’s leading source of imports with a 16 percent market share. Moreover, China has provided massive assistance for Pakistan’s road and port infrastructure and joint ventures for its main battle tank and combat aircraft.

But what is not said is that India must fear the possibility of a takeover of Kabul by the Taliban, once the U.S. and NATO withdraw. And India is planning ahead. In recent years, India has sought strategic depth in Afghanistan. This has included economic aid and reconstruction , training for the Afghan military, and the use of soft power — all to keep Pakistan in check.

The Taliban with the platform of a nation state would increase India’s vulnerability in Jammu and Kashmir, previously a state but with its autonomy recently revoked and now to be controlled by the government of India. The Taliban is substantially of the Pashtun or Pathan tribe, and about 32 million Pashtun live in Pakistan, representing an estimated 70 percent of the total Pashtun population. Pashtun nationalism has been a potent force since the British presence in South Asia, and the Taliban has longstanding ties with the Pakistan Army and ISI, the intelligence service. A Taliban government in Kabul can pressure Pakistan to adopt more Sharia practices; a more pro-Taliban government in Islamabad would be seen as a grave threat to India, which has over 180 million Muslims, as well as claims by Pakistan over Jammu and Kashmir.

India must recognize that the U.S., which has given Pakistan over $34 billion of security and economic aid since 9/11, has failed to moderate Pakistan’s working both sides of the fence. While Pakistan has accepted U.S. aid for decades, there is nonetheless the view that it has not done enough to suppress Islamist jihad, given the fact that the Pashtun will be around long after the U.S. and NATO are gone.

Accordingly, in view of the virtually failed U.S. relationship with Pakistan, India needs its historical ally Russia and now China for support and containment of what could become a vehement anti-India ideology and threat to its national security.

Is the U.S.-China Relationship Worth Saving? - The American Spectator,"Presidents Trump and Xi’s decision to resume trade talks at the G20 Summit is a step in the right direction. But the “hold” on List 4 tariffs is temporary, as far as we know, and it keeps businesses guessing in a world of uncertainty. Today, the tech industry loses $1 billion per month to tariffs on Chinese imports. We must continue to push for a trade deal that removes all tariffs.

By almost every measure, China and the U.S. need each other. We need their rare earth minerals, their investments in our government debt, and their huge purchases of our farm products. As China buys agricultural commodities elsewhere, cuts rare earth mineral production, puts huge tariffs on our products, discourages visits to the U.S., and murmurs about selling U.S. debt, we are seeing real American pain.

But the Chinese are hurting as well. China’s sales to the U.S. have dropped. Manufacturers and foreign investors are looking to Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia to build and grow. The Chinese economy is slowing.

Both countries are suffering. Here are three reasons we must salvage our relationship with China and negotiate a settlement that removes all tariffs:

1. It will affect the world. In the past month, I’ve visited countries in both Asia and Europe, and business and government leaders on both continents are concerned the U.S.-China trade war will drag the world into another recession.

2. No one wins a trade war. I know of only one American economist who thinks tariffs are an effective tool and a trade war can be won. Sadly, he is in the White House advising President Trump. As with reaction to the Smoot-Hawley Act — the 1930 congressional mistake that sparked the Great Depression — today’s economists overwhelmingly think a trade war and tariffs are bad ideas.

3. It ignores our investment in China. By almost every measure, the U.S. has helped China become an economic powerhouse. We’ve helped the Chinese government become a first-world country with help from U.S. agencies, including the Center for Disease Control and the Federal Aviation Administration.

We supported China joining the UN Security Council and the World Trade Organization. We gave China Permanent Normal Trade Relationship (PNTR) status, allowing them to sell products to us with zero or low tariffs. We became their major market for exports of low-cost consumer electronics, hardware, housewares, textiles, and clothing. And each year, our colleges and universities take in over 300,000 Chinese students. In short, we have helped tens of millions of Chinese citizens shift from poor to prosperous.

And China has reciprocated. Like Japan a generation ago, China fed Americans’ need for low-cost, high-quality products. Yet while we competed with Japan economically, we kept a warm relationship. Japan shared many American values, while China does not. China has taken American intellectual property. Its government has no respect for privacy and aims by next year to have social ratings of every citizen, affecting their travel, employment, and even dating. The Chinese people have no recourse through voting. China doesn’t allow freedom of speech, freedom to access other views on the internet, or freedom of religion. It has even created re-education camps for religious minorities.

These are big issues, and we need to bear them in mind as we negotiate a deal. But we cannot be foolhardy. Any hasty action could risk the stability of our supply chains and the health of our economy.

In the near term, let’s preserve our relationship — at least until the elections are behind us — to skirt a recession. A reprieve from escalating trade tensions will give U.S. companies more time to consider how to move more of their eggs out of the China basket.

For now, we must find a way to work with China, or we risk plunging both our countries and the world into recession, conflict. and even depression.

Israel Needs to End Its Romance with China - The American Spectator,"It looks like Israel is the latest U.S. ally to fall victim to China’s problematic mask diplomacy (which I have discussed earlier) in the wake of the coronavirus. The declaration of Israel’s Health Ministry of being able to conduct 15,000 tests per day, down from earlier aspirations of 20,000, can be attributed in part to the stalling of a deal between Israel and the Chinese firm BGI for testing. BGI is the largest genetics and DNA testing company in the world, and it has a test for coronavirus that reportedly has a three-hour turnaround time. Israel signed a NIS 90 million deal with BGI for at least 10,000 tests per day on April 8. Once up and running, the Health Ministry believed that BGI could perform up to 20,000 tests per day. But the BGI deal was frozen on April 12 and renegotiated (details are not public) on April 17. While many in Israel’s establishment, including Mossad Chief Yossi Cohen, support finalizing the BGI deal, Israel’s largest health maintenance organization, Clalit, and its CEO Johanan Locker are holding out, believing that BGI and the Chinese government could gain access to sensitive personal information to Clalit’s 4.9 million customers. Critics of the deal have noted that BGI, like Huawei Technologies, has a close relationship with the Chinese government.

BGI is one of several not-so-independent Chinese companies that Israel is welcoming within its borders. A report released in April by RAND Corporation, “Chinese Investment in Israeli Technology and Infrastructure: Security Implications for Israel and the United States,” found 11 Chinese companies doing business in Israel’s technology and infrastructure sectors that are potentially problematic for both Israel and the United States. Concerns include that these companies have “connections with the Chinese military or government; issues related to security, privacy, and censorship; and business activities involving Israel’s adversaries, such as Iran.”

Recent Chinese investment in Israeli technology and infrastructure has drawn the consternation of the Trump administration. In March 2019, President Trump told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that U.S.–Israeli security relations can be impaired if Israel does not limit its relationship with China. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and then–National Security Adviser John Bolton later echoed this message. In March 2019, Pompeo expressed concerns that state-owned companies like Huawei can spy on Israel. In October 2019, responding to U.S. concerns and with the support of the head of Israel’s General Security Service Shin Bet, Israel formed a committee similar to the American Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to monitor foreign investment.

Chinese Investments in Israeli Technology

The RAND study looked at 87 Chinese investments in Israeli companies from 2011 to 2018, 54 of which were in Israel’s technology sector and totaled $5.7 billion. Of these 87 investments, RAND found nine Chinese companies to be potentially problematic. Specifically, Chinese entities ZTE and Huawei have been criticized in the U.S. “for their less-than-transparent connections to the Chinese government and military.” According to RAND, ZTE was part of a $25 million investment in Israel’s Rainbow Medical in 2015. RAND noted two Huawei investments in Israeli technology firms, both in 2016: $42 million in Israel’s HexaTier for database security and an undisclosed sum in Toga Networks for IT and telecom. Additionally, RAND noted that Chinese companies Lenovo, Tencent, and Xiaomi all use technologies with known security issues, with the latter actually sending information to Chinese servers in 2014.

Chinese Investments in Israeli Infrastructure

RAND also looked at four Chinese infrastructure projects in Israel contracted or sub-contracted by China’s state-owned companies, totaling over $4 billion. These projects have been staunchly opposed by the Israel Builders Association. RAND noted concerns with the following projects in particular:

An expansion project for Ashdod’s port. China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) and subsidiaries, such as China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) have worked for China’s armed forces. CHEC is suspected of building a site in Argentina to track satellites above the Western Hemisphere. Partial construction of a terminal by the Haifa port, along with operation rights for 25 years. The U.S. has long been concerned that China can use the port to spy and wage cyberwarfare on the U.S. Navy Sixth Fleet stationed in Haifa. Critics within Israel have maintained that outsourcing port construction, in Haifa, Ashdod, or elsewhere, poses an “existential threat to Israel’s security.” Construction and operation of Tel Aviv’s light rail. China Railway Tunnel Group (CRTC) conducts business in Iran and would provide an opportunity for China to spy on the IDF’s headquarters in the Kirya area of Tel Aviv. Former National Security Adviser Yaakov Amidror argued that CRTC could install a “red button” that could allow China to disable the light rail. Former head of Mossad Efraim Halevy stated that he believes China would not be sufficiently deterred from doing this.

Additionally, RAND noted that CCCC Dredging, a Chinese state-owned company, has submitted a proposal to construct a rail line between Ashdod in the Mediterranean and Eilat for approximately $2 billion. CCCC Dredging has been reported to be a participant in China’s South China Sea land reclamation project.

Some have maintained that China controls about 15 percent of Israel’s economy. But several of the Chinese firms currently operating in Israel pose real threats to the privacy, security, and intellectual property of Israel and the United States alike. Israel should start thinking about halting and rolling back its business with these problematic Chinese firms and work with the United States to develop ways to combat and prevent malicious behavior. Israel should expand trade with other countries like India and Singapore, as well as other Asian countries like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and even Mongolia and Thailand. Distancing itself from these Chinese firms is in the best interest of Israel, as well as the United States.",https://spectator.org/chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-expands-to-cuba/,2020-05-01
"It's Chinatown, Jake - The American Spectator","Yesterday, ABC News White House correspondent Jake Tapper had this exchange with White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs:

TAPPER: One last thing, I’m sorry. Congressman Joe Sestak last week said that the White House offered him a high-ranking job in the administration to not run against Arlen Specter. Do you guys have any comment on that?

GIBBS: I was traveling for a couple of days, as you know. I have seen some stuff that he said. But I have not looked into this, Jake.

As noted here on Monday, what Congressman Sestak reveals, and he is standing by his story, is in fact a federal crime — offering a federal job in return for a favor (Sestak’s withdrawal from the Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race, in this case).

Japan’s New Defense Strategy Driven by China’s Threat and Biden’s Weakness - The American Spectator,"On Friday, Japan released its new national security strategy, which the Financial Times characterizes as overturning “six decades of postwar security policy and arm[ing] itself with one of the world’s largest defense budgets to counter ‘an unprecedented and the greatest strategic challenge’ posed by China’s military aggression.” And, one might add, to counter the mixed signals that the Biden administration has been sending to China about “engagement” and “competition.” Japan’s dramatic move is a response to China’s threat and Biden’s weakness.

Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who announced the new strategy at a press conference in Tokyo, said that the unstable security environment around Japan requires upgrading Japan’s military capabilities to deter threats to his country and the broader Indo-Pacific region. The new strategy pledged to work with “allies and like-minded countries to ensure peace and stability in the region” and included among those allies the United States, India, England, Australia, France, Italy, Germany, Canada, New Zealand, South Korea, and countries in Southeast Asia.

Japan’s new strategy, the first since 2013, was set forth in three documents — the National Security Strategy, the National Defense Strategy, and the Defense Buildup Program. The strategy calls for Japan to boost defense spending to $314 billion (43 trillion yen) between 2023 and 2027 and includes the planned acquisition of Tomahawk cruise missiles, the development of hypersonic weapons, and the enhancement of air and missile defense capabilities and space and cyber defense programs. This will give Japan the capability to strike targets inside China and North Korea.

Nikkei Asia notes that Japan’s action highlights “the need for Japan to build an independent system of defense that is not solely reliant on the U.S. military.” That is a diplomatic way of saying that Japan lacks confidence in the Biden administration’s approach to China, which has consisted of the president’s statements that the U.S. would defend Taiwan against a Chinese invasion/attack and of White House “clarifications” intended to “walk back” the president’s statements. Sadamasa Oue in the Japan Times similarly opines that the decision to implement the new strategy was based in part on Japan’s view that the United States is in “relative decline” and rife with domestic political divisions. Japanese leaders, Oue notes, realize that Japan cannot wholly rely on the United States for its defense and for ensuring stability in the region. Japan, Oue writes, “must … build a strategy to defend itself proactively and drastically boost its defense capabilities.” And Politico reports that at the heart of the new strategy is “a genuine fear about the crumbling order in Asia and the world more broadly.” And that crumbling order in Asia can be traced to a post–Cold War policy inertia that clung to the hope that engaging with China would transform the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) into a “rules-based” nation willing to join a U.S.-led world order.

Kishida’s approach builds on policies promoted by the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who repeatedly called on Japan and the United States to end the policy of “strategic ambiguity” with regard to a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan. The Trump administration in its 2018 National Defense Strategy shifted the U.S. focus from small peripheral wars to the emerging great-power rivalry with China and Russia. And while Biden has continued some of the Trump administration’s confrontational rhetoric toward China, he has not sufficiently supported the rhetoric with force deployments to ease the fears of Japan’s leaders.

Biden administration spokespersons praised Kishida’s announcement of the new strategy, as did members of Congress, seemingly unaware that Japan’s new strategy is designed in part to make up for U.S. deficiencies. Ironically, it was Donald Trump who vigorously called on America’s allies in both Europe and Asia to provide more for their own defense — an approach for which he received unrestrained criticism from Democrats and the foreign-policy establishment. The allies — first Germany and now Japan — have responded, though not as a result of Trump’s urging but instead as a reaction to China’s increased aggressiveness in the face of perceived U.S. decline. Japan’s new strategy shows the prescience of Edward Luttwak, who, in The Rise of China vs. the Logic of Strategy, predicted that China’s aggressive moves in the Indo-Pacific would eventually solidify and strengthen U.S. alliances in the region. U.S. regional security in the western Pacific will benefit from Japan’s new strategy not because of Biden’s policies but in spite of them.",https://spectator.org/chinas-bloody-taiwan-procedure-shaomin-li-editorial-cartoon-american-spectator/,2022-12-19
Jeb Ex Machina? - The American Spectator,"In a recent 60 Minutes interview, Barack Obama assessed his own Presidency in the following delusional terms: “I would put our legislative and foreign policy accomplishments in our first two years against any president — with the possible exceptions of Johnson, FDR, and Lincoln.” Fortunately, the voters have a firmer grasp on reality. More than half of the respondents to last week’s AP-GfK surveysaid the President should be voted out next November. Nonetheless, he may well win a second term. How? Obama obviously can’t run on his record, so his consiglieres will have to base his reelection campaign on a combination of demagoguery, personal vilification, and race-baiting. And it’s difficult to imagine a group of candidates more vulnerable to this line of attack than the top contenders for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination.

Newt Gingrich is, of course, the most vulnerable target. He has been on every side of every issue and has taken many positions that cannot be differentiated from those of the president. On health care alone he has publicly agreed with Obama on the individual mandate and government-subsidized end-of-life counseling. And, though Gingrich’s messy love life has little to do with his ability to lead, there isn’t the slightest possibility that Obama’s minions or the “news” media will allow the voters to forget about it. Finally, if he gets on the stage next to Obama during a debate, the voters will see an old, rich, white southerner with a condescending expression speaking in patronizing tones to the country’s first black president. It will be child’s play for Axelrod & Co. to portray Gingrich as an unprincipled, morally dubious racist.

Mitt Romney won’t fare any better. Like Gingrich, he has been all over the place on the issues and many of his positions mirror those of Obama. His biggest liability is Romneycare, of course, which will render him unable to credibly debate the president on one of the most important issues of the campaign. As to his personal life, Romney seems OK, but Obama’s media toadies will make much of his Mormonism. They will, as Ann Coulter has predicted, insinuate that he belongs to a bizarre and un-American cult. And, if Romney ends up on the debate stage beside Obama, the viewers will see a rich, white, Wall Street plutocrat lecturing the African-American son of a single mother about the virtues of capitalism and creative destruction. Obama’s minions will easily transform him into a combination of Jim Jones and Gordon Gekko.

Ron Paul is even more vulnerable than Gingrich and Romney. His claim to be the campaign’s man of principle notwithstanding, he has been no more consistent on the issues than they. He claims the mantle of libertarianism, but has supported government price fixing. He pronounces himself the sworn enemy of overspending, but never fails to line up with his fellow congressmen at the earmark trough. The credibility gap caused by such hypocrisy is exacerbated by occasional bouts with insanity. “Dr. No” has, among other things, compared Ronald Reagan to Josef Stalin and associated with 9-11 “truthers.” And then there are those mysteriousracist newsletters. On a debate stage with the President, he will look and behave like everyone’s crazy old uncle. Obama’s henchmen won’t need to anything but watch and rub their hands together.

The rest of the GOP field will never get the chance to face the attacks of Obama’s Chicago sleaze merchants. The best of this lot is Michele Bachmann. She’s far better on foreign policy than most expected and she’s been remarkably consistent on most domestic issues, including Obamacare. Moreover, as demonstrated during her recent debate performance, she’s not afraid to go after an opponent when he says something crazy (Ron Paul) or factually inaccurate (Newt Gingrich). For whatever reason, however, she can’t gain any real traction. Perry is also a good candidate, but has an uncanny knack for looking like a doofus. As to Rick Santorum, his irritating solipsism and incessant whining are lethal. And it’s hard to see the eyebrow-waggling study in pomposity known as Jon Huntsman surviving the cold Iowa caucuses.

All of this leaves us with a Republican nomination race featuring three front runners, none of whom has the slightest prayer of beating Obama in the general election, and a group of second-tier candidates who will soon be gone. It would seem, then, that the GOP’s only hope lies with some as yet undeclared candidate. And there are a few potential entrants who could theoretically enter the race this late and still have at least some hope of winning the nomination and beating Obama in the general election. This is, however, a very exclusive club. Its members do not include Gary Johnson, Sarah Palin or Donald Trump. Its only card-carrying members are Paul Ryan, Bobby Jindal, Marco Rubio, and Jeb Bush. In fact, if we’re going to be realistic about this thing, only the last would have any real chance of going the distance.

There are some observers with a great deal of hands-on political experience who have argued that the voters are just not ready “to return to the Bush leagues.” This may well be the “smart” position, and it may even be correct. But it ignores a growing desire among the electorate to find any plausible replacement for Obama and, more importantly, the purely pragmatic question of money. Jeb Bush is probably the only Republican in the country with the name recognition and connections required to raise the kind of cash it will take to compete with an incumbent whose 2012 war chest will likely contain $1 billion, not including union money. Ryan, Jindal, and Rubio are good men. But, even if they could be talked into running, they wouldn’t have a hope of raising such sums after entering the race this late.

There is no guarantee, of course, that Bush would suffer himself to be lowered onto the political stage in order to resolve the ridiculous plot dilemma the Republicans have written for themselves. He is well-endowed with good sense, and might run for the hills upon learning that a “draft Jeb” movement was afoot. On the other hand, his column in yesterday’s Wall Street Journal has the tone of a man who might listen if the idea were pitched in the right way by the right people. And he may well be the GOP’s only hope. Thus, the wisdom of political veterans andHorace notwithstanding, the Republican Party would be wise to get busy attaching him to the block and tackle.",https://spectator.org/chinas-cashless-revolution/,2011-12-20
Keep China Off Our Carriers - The American Spectator,"Describing his approach to dealings with the Soviet Union near the end of the Cold War, President Reagan famously warned, “Trust, but verify.”

A version of that wise caution should be used in dealing with the increasing efforts by the Chinese Navy to cultivate more cooperative military relationships, particularly in seeking greater access to U.S. aircraft carriers: “Cooperate, but very cautiously!”

China’s navy chief, Adm. Wu Shengli recently urged his counterpart U.S. Admiral Jonathon W. Greenert to bring the USS George Washington, an aircraft carrier based in Japan, to a mainland Chinese port and allow the crew of the newly commissioned Chinese carrier to take a tour. Asked for his reaction to that request, Admiral Greenert replied, “I’m receptive to that idea.”

Excuse me, but not so fast, Admiral. Let’s go slow on exploring cooperation with the Chinese navy.

To be sure, there are considerable advantages to an increasingly cooperative relationship on a military-to-military basis with other nations. Those kind of relationships have been developed by the Navy Department over the years with NATO allies, SEATO nations, and other naval forces around the globe. But our relationship with the Chinese Navy is a vastly different situation that requires extreme caution and finely tuned diplomacy. In dealing with China on the naval operational level, our Navy brass is walking a high wire without a net.

Needless to say, China’s massive increase in domestic defense spending and new emphasis on building a modern navy has enormous implications for security and stability in Asia and a direct impact on our important allies in the region. China’s navy is still maturing and the longer it takes for China to gain a true blue water capability the more “soft power” time the U.S. Navy’s Pacific Command (PACOM) will have to influence current and future leaders in China to be more open and honest about their true intentions.

To maintain stability in the Pacific rim, PACOM has an interest in retarding China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) modernization and professionalization. Yet at the same time, PACOM should engage with the PLAN where possible to build trust and relationships that can positively influence the trajectory of China’s rise in directions favorable to the United States. It would be a grave mistake to treat China as an enemy and stop all cooperation.

By the same token, it would be extremely imprudent to take any steps that could advance the development of China’s blue water fleet and naval footprint in the region. Military cooperation with China should be limited to only those activities that do not present China with insights that will enable its PLAN to mature at a quicker pace. A proper level of cooperation should be designed to reduce misunderstanding and prevent miscalculations in international waters, not to share technology, training, or tactical planning.

In short, a careful balance must be struck between the laudable goal of increased cooperation and understanding between Chinese naval forces and the U.S. Navy, while avoiding any acceleration of China’s military footprint and influence in the Pacific.

Striking this balance will require that all military contacts at the working level when PACOM forces are training, operating at sea, or in an exercise be minimized. This includes prohibiting any access to command and control, intelligence, or joint exercises — in short, no visits to U.S. aircraft carriers. Period!

U.S. Navy leadership should continue high level PACOM military officer and civilian exchanges with China to help foster cooperation and understanding. However, Chinese leadership access to U.S. naval platforms, technology, and operations should be prohibited or strictly limited.

The stakes in this international military diplomacy couldn’t be higher. The future of U.S. interests in the Pacific and the security of our allies in the Pacific rim area hang in the balance. No doubt, Admiral Greenert will proceed cautiously with regard to Admiral Wu’s request to tour our nuclear aircraft carriers. To do otherwise would be a monumental miscalculation that could have dire national security implications for generations to come.

Lying Flat: China’s Demographic Decline - The American Spectator,"Communist China’s guiding ideology, epitomized first by “Mao Zedong Thought,” and now by “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,” has always been predicated on the notion of unceasing struggle. “Marxism,” Chairman Mao maintained, “can develop only through struggle, and this is not only true of the past and the present, it is necessarily true of the future as well.” Class struggle, factional struggle, the struggle against foreign invaders, the struggle against obsolescent traditions, and the struggle for production, all these struggles were meant to pave the way for a new social system upon which the very salvation of the world was said to depend. These struggles were meant to be invigorating. In his 1940 treatise On New Democracy, Mao likened capitalism to a “dying person who is sinking fast, like the sun setting beyond the western hills,” an ideology “soon be relegated to the museum,” so different from Chinese scientific socialism, which was “full of youth and vitality, sweeping the world with the momentum of an avalanche and the force of a thunderbolt.” Mao’s mixed metaphors threatened to overpromise and underdeliver, however, and his ideological successor, Xi Jinping, in a Jan. 5, 2013 speech to the Central Committee, acknowledged that “the consolidation and development of the socialist system will require its own long period of history…. it will require the tireless struggle of generations, up to ten generations.”

Modern society, with its tendency toward presentism and instant gratification, is not particularly well-suited to an incessant struggle figuring to last an estimated 250 years. “The near future,” wrote the 20th-century Colombian philosopher Nicolás Gómez Dávila, “will probably bring extraordinary catastrophes, but what threatens the world most certainly is not the violence of ravenous crowds, but the weariness of boring masses…. The pessimists prophesy a future of rubble, but the optimistic prophets are even more horrifying when they proclaim the future city where baseness and boredom dwell, in intact beehives.” The “boring masses” in their urban “beehives” are seldom inclined to the sort of everlasting agonism envisioned by scientific socialists, and it was inevitable that the supposedly unstoppable force of the communist avalanche would be met by an immovable object, which is precisely what has come to pass in present-day China.

First came the so-called Sanhe Gods (三和大神), those predominately male migrant workers who ventured from the increasingly depopulated hinterlands to Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and other teeming metropolises in search of gainful employment, only to find themselves slaving away in Dickensian “shady factories.” Disenchanted with China’s “struggle culture” (奋斗文化), the ironically named Sanhe Gods adopted cynical mottos like “work one day and play for three” or “pick up your bucket and run,” in direct and provocative contrast to the motivational propaganda posters that line Chinese streets, bearing messages along the lines of “Struggle in youth, a brilliant future to come,” “Fight unrestrainedly, chase dreams,” and “If you don’t work hard, no-one can give you the life you want.” And then, in the spring of 2021, after more than a year of stifling coronavirus lockdowns, the insouciant credo of the working-class Sanhe Gods started to infect white-collar workers tired of hypercompetitive corporate “wolf culture” and the demands of the “996” lifestyle (working from 9 a.m. until 9 p.m. six days a week).

It began with a wave of memes washing over online platforms like Zhihu and Baidu, all promoting a novel ideology called tangping or “lying flat” (躺平). Cartoons of lazily recumbent individuals with captions like “You want me to get up? That won’t be possible in this lifetime” were widely shared alongside more philosophical musings. “I can be like Diogenes, who sleeps in his own barrel taking in the sun,” one anonymous individual wrote in a viral post entitled “Lying Flat Is Justice,” a sentiment echoed by other young professionals, evidently weary of Xi’s beloved “continued struggle,” who suggested that “only by lying flat can people become the yardstick of everything,” and that via “low material desire and low consumption” one can achieve a “slow-paced life” with “more time to be alone and think” and no need to “bear the pressure of comparing oneself with others.”

It is impossible to conceive of anything more antithetical to communist China’s guiding ideology than the passive resistance inherent in tangping. Wang Xingyu, an apparatchik at the China University of Labor Relations, sympathetically suggested that “attending to those ‘lying flat,’ and giving them the will to struggle, is a prime necessity for our country as it faces the task of transitioning development,” but official organs like the Nanfang Daily took a much harsher line, declaring that “in the face of pressure, choosing to ‘lie flat’ is not only unjust, but shameful. There is no value whatsoever in this poisonous chicken soup.” Tangping-themed merchandise was pulled from online vendors, the term was removed from WeChat searches, and discussion groups devoted to the phenomenon were swiftly suppressed. With Xi Jinping exhorting China’s youth to “constantly strive for the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” a popular movement adopting the slogan “Don’t buy property; don’t buy a car; don’t get married; don’t have children; and don’t consume” presents a serious threat to the communist regime.

Lying-flat-ism’s distinctly anti-natal rhetoric is disturbing, all the more so in light of the recent news that China’s population has, for the first time since the Great Chinese Famine of 1959–1961, actually dropped, with 9.56 million people born in the country in 2022, as opposed to 10.41 million people perishing, a net decrease of by some 850,000 souls, according to Beijing’s National Bureau of Statistics. This has prompted increased discussion of China’s ongoing “demographic crisis,” a wholly predictable consequence of the one-child policy that the Communist Party pursued between 1980 and 2015. By writing drastic population planning measures into the very constitution of the People’s Republic of China in 1982, and by demanding a total fertility rate of 1.0, the authorities upended thousands of years of Confucian “reproduction worship,” in which the propagation of the species was viewed as the “fountainhead of a flourishing and prosperous world.” Government interventionists thereby unwittingly unleashed a “silver tsunami” that figures to leave a “super-aged state” in its wake. It has been estimated that by 2050, roughly one-third of China’s population will be over the age of retirement, a state of affairs that will put considerable strain on China’s economy and social services. (READ MORE by Matthew Omolesky: China’s Three-Child Policy and the Philosophy of Reproduction)

Realizing the dire effects of its one-child policy, China has desperately been trying to pull out of its self-inflicted demographic nosedive, implementing a two-child limit in 2015 (a 2.1 total fertility rate being replacement level), a three-child limit in May 2021, and a removal of all limitations two months later. Yet the number of Chinese newborns continues to plummet all the while, no doubt exacerbated by years of lockdowns. Dramatic news of the 2022 population net decrease has prompted further soul-searching. Lu Jiehua, professor of demography at Peking University’s Institute of Sociology and Anthropology, has stated that:

The negative population growth is likely to become the new norm, requiring us to make full preparations and change our mindset and development mode for a relatively young society. The negative population growth will definitely impose a huge challenge to economic growth, especially to those heavily dependent on demographic dividends. To promote childbirths, China should build a pro-childbirth system covering not just childbirth policies, but also love marriages, employment, housing, medical care and elderly care. Only by building an all-around pro-humanity system and environment, can we help boost willingness among couples to have babies.

It is highly unlikely that China’s “perfect dictatorship,” with its omnipresent surveillance state, suffocating social credit system, and heavily circumscribed religious expression, can ever amount to anything resembling a “pro-humanity system,” and one suspects that “love marriages” and reasonable working hours — which are prevalent in the West but have hardly resulted in a demographic dividend — will not in and of themselves do much to reverse China’s population decline.

It is often said that demography is destiny, and nowhere is this more the case than in China. Between 1626 and 1646, as the Ming dynasty collapsed in the face of civil strife and the Manchu invasion, the population of China decreased by 11.4 percent, while the civil wars that wracked the Qing dynasty in the middle of the 19th century saw an even greater decline of 18.6 percent; The Golden Age of the High Qing, on the other hand, was marked by a rapidly increasing population, which was considered indisputable evidence of the bestowal of Tiānmìng or the Mandate of Heaven (天命). Mao’s Great Famine took as many as 55 million lives, leading to a loss of population in Anhui and Chongqing of 18 and 15 percent respectively, every bit as bad as the Ming and Qing catastrophes. Deng Xiaoping, speaking in the aftermath of the chairman’s death, could only conclude that Mao had thereby “committed many grave errors,” and that “much disgrace was brought upon the party, the country, the people.”

There may come a day when Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is viewed similarly, but in the meantime, the regime will continue extolling the virtues of “continued struggle” in the interest of “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” even as the country is beset by a demographic crisis unknown in modern history. “In the long run, we are going to see a China the world has never seen,” the sociologist Wang Feng has concluded. “It will no longer be the young, vibrant, growing population. We will start to appreciate China, in terms of its population, as an old and shrinking population.”

It was not so long ago, back on May 17, 2018, that an image of the U.S.-China trade negotiations went viral on platforms like Weibo. On the left, viewers were presented with the Chinese delegation, mostly young or middle-aged, and on the left were six American negotiators, all of them grey, balding, and hunched over their talking points. This image of (relatively) youthful Chinese politicians staring down the American gerontocracy was further contrasted with a famous photograph of the signing of the humiliating 1901 Boxer Protocol, when Western diplomats in their prime faced off against the superannuated Li Hongzhang and other mandarins who were so enfeebled that they had to be helped out of their chairs. “Over the past 100 years, American officials have gone from young to old, and Chinese officials have gone from old to young,” responded one Weibo user, which “has a lot to do with the current state of the two countries. America today is just as closed off as China was 100 years ago.” As China approaches “super-aged” status, its populace will have to wrestle with a national rejuvenation that has proved to be something of a mirage.

There remain those, like Yuan Xin of Nankai University’s Research Center for Strategic Studies on Aging and Development, who remain sanguine, given that by 2050 China still figures to have a population of 1.2 billion, with “600-650 million people in the age group of 16-59 years by the middle of this century, larger than all the labor force in developed countries combined. So, China can still enjoy demographic dividends.” Others, like Guillaume Marois, Stuart Gietel-Basten, and Wolfgang Lutz, authors of the 2021 study “China’s low fertility may not hinder future prosperity,” contend that pessimistic “prognostications are partly based on a simplistic and misleading concept of age dependency that assumes that everybody above age 65 is an economic burden and every adult below this age is an (equally) productive asset,” and that we must factor in the “massive improvement of human capital that China has experienced” in order to assess the country’s “demographic metabolism.” Yet even Marois et al. admit that “China will almost certainly have challenges associated with managing adjustments to population decline and increasing size of the older population, in particular, if fertility should have levels of 0.8 as currently observed in South Korea. China does not yet have adequate pension coverage, particularly in rural areas, and to expand social welfare systems will be more challenging.”

China has been in a race to improve its infrastructure, welfare systems, and overall human capital before the arrival of the “silver tsunami” — a race to grow rich before it grows old, in other words — but now UN experts are estimating that China’s population will shrink by some 109 million by 2050, more than triple the decline forecasted back in 2019. Wang Feng has postulated that “in less than eighty years China’s population size could be reduced by forty-five percent. It will be a China unrecognizable by the world then.” More ghost cities, more real estate bubbles, more societal dysfunction brought about by a massively imbalanced gender ratio — these will all represent significant challenges for the Chinese authorities going forward. The outgoing premier Li Keqiang was fond of insisting that “consumption is now the primary engine driving growth” in China, and that government stimulus is required to “to support the increase in people’s income through direct or relatively direct means in order to spur consumption and energize the market.” But a rapidly declining population will struggle to maintain prior levels of both production and consumption, and the evident weariness of the masses in these regards will not help matters much.

Those who have embraced lying-flat-ism often describe themselves as “leeks” or “leek people,” arguing that “leeks that lie down cannot be harvested so easily.” Tangping, according to one practitioner, is a “non-violent movement of non-cooperation by the leek people, and the most silent and helpless of actions.” Combined with the disruptions of the Sanhe Gods, the recent anti-lockdown protests, and the precipitously-declining birthrate, the lying flat movement is indicative of an all-consuming malaise pervasive in Chinese society, brought about by the unending struggle for existence required by scientific socialism. Communist China is not quite yet a “dying person who is sinking fast, like the sun setting beyond the western hills,” an experiment “soon be relegated to the museum,” but there is something deeply amiss there, as ostensibly helpless people make their displeasure felt in ways exceedingly subtle, undoubtedly effective, and ultimately profoundly destabilizing.

Money No-Ball in Red China - The American Spectator,"Of Steve Simon, president of the Women’s Tennis Association, you can say he is a sports entrepreneur who puts his money where his mouth is. He has been expressing urgent concern for the safety and well-being of Peng Shuai, the Chinese tennis star who vanished early in November after posting an accusation of sexual aggression against a Red Chinese big-shot. Now he has removed the Chinese leg of the women’s tour to show he means business.

Miss Peng’s post disappeared inside 20 minutes. The ex-No. 1 in doubles who also was well within the top 20 in singles at the top of her career in the mid ’teens, has been heard from once or twice, but Mr. Simon doubts the credibility of her emails and reported phone calls to Thomas Bach, the International Olympic Committee president.

It is unlikely that Miss Peng, with loud support from world-famous athletes and others, has been shipped off to a concentration camp to be worked and starved to death. Her fame protects her from the ordinary communist way of dealing with nuisances. But you never know until you know, and her case signals the regime’s insistence on wielding unchallenged power.

Mr. Simon’s decision to take the WTA out of the Red China segment of the women’s tour represents a serious economic sacrifice: early estimates by sports economists suggest it is worth about $100 million to his organization when the epidemic abates sufficiently to allow the resumption of full attendance tournaments.

This is quite amazing considering that China has only in the past few years emerged as a tennis power. But the Chinese tennis phenomenon is itself a spectacular demonstration of the Red Chinese development model: police state plus an offer the world’s capitalists cannot refuse. Greed never fails. Disrupt other countries’ economies, get rich and richer, keep your own people quiet and obedient — or imprison them — and they will not complain. They will even sell you the rope.

Thus, for the Red Chinese, Mr. Simon’s China initiative must come as a jolt. The Turkey-born Enes Kanter Freedom, the Celtics player who just recently added Freedom to his name to underscore and affirm his choice to become an American citizen, has been waging a one-man protest movement against the silence of the NBA regarding Chinese human rights abuses. He also has called out big stars, including LeBron James and Michael Jordan, and their sponsors, especially Nike, which he accuses of making use of Chinese slave labor. He has called for a boycott of the forthcoming Winter Olympic Games, or for moving them out of Beijing, which would be unrealistic at this late date.

Mr. Bach, the IOC president, says he has been in touch with Miss Peng, and is protecting her safety “behind the scenes.”

Comrade Zhang, the vice-premier whom Miss Peng names as her aggressor and multi-year abuser, was a member of the committee that brought Beijing’s application to the IOC. The Red Chinese surely would be displeased by the cancellation or a massive boycott of the Winter Games; but this does not mean they will make any concessions to please Western governments or athletes with human rights agendas.

Enes Freedom’s position is undeniably principled and reflects his courage in defending his beliefs. He cannot return to his native Turkey, where his family is harassed due to his criticisms of the dictatorial Erdogan regime. He believes you must put your money where your mouth is — he sponsors youth basketball camps lavishly out of his own pocket — and not put money over morals, which is how he views the NBA’s craven attitude toward Red China.

Actually, the position he defends would have sports organizations actively protesting against the persecution of minorities, notably Uighurs, who are a Muslim population in the Chinese far-west, and Christians, less ethnically and geographically concentrated. The Red regime also has crushed liberal democracy in Hong Kong and noisily threatens to conquer Taiwan (Free China) by force and teach Australia and the Philippines who is master of the Pacific Rim.

Mr. Simon’s position is not necessarily less radical or a more prudent one, but may be more realistic. Olympic boycotts and broad moral condemnations do not have a high win-percentage record. There was a movement to boycott the 1936 Berlin Olympics to deny Hitler’s Nazi regime the glory it expected to derive from them, but it fizzled when a cynical and bigoted American Olympic Committee denounced the boycott as traitorous. As it happens, the amazing athletic feats of Jesse Owens, Ralph Metcalfe, and other American athletes showed up the Nazis better than any boycott would have.

More recently, a U.S. boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics to protest the Soviet Union’s assault on Afghanistan had zero strategic consequences, although it did put the South Asian country on the mental maps of U.S. strategists, with consequences that cost us.

The Red Chinese threat — to its own people, individually and as groups, as the respective Peng and Uighur cases show — to its neighbors, and to the U.S. is the doing of many misconceived policies of many governments the world over, including our own. We allowed our policy makers to delude themselves (and us, consumers) that making China rich would tame its political style. Until, or more likely if ever, there is a coherent Free World strategy to contain Red China, the realistically successful strategy may be to take one case at a time and make it as costly as possible to Empire. Apparently modest, this could, incrementally, damage their prestige and influence around the world. It cannot work, of course, without a defense program like the one Ronald Reagan used to exhaust and demoralize the Soviets.",https://spectator.org/chinas-communist-government-catches-coronavirus/,2021-12-03
No Fear of China: US Operates From Position of Strength - The American Spectator,"It’s been only a month since China’s Xi Jinping strode forth as a master of the universe. He had vanquished his enemies and secured a third term as Chinese Communist Party (CCP) secretary general. The 69-year-old likely was set to rule for life.

He packed the Politburo with lackeys and the Central Committee with supporters. An impressive propaganda apparatus sang his praises. He had clearly eclipsed immediate successors Hu Jintao, who was tossed from the meeting, supposedly for ill health, and Jiang Zemin, who obviously was unhealthy and died last week. Xi collected the party and government titles eschewed by famous “paramount leader” Deng Xiaoping. Only Mao Zedong, who made both the CCP and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) his own, stands above Xi. And who knows? Perhaps Xi will gain that final summit by the time he leaves office.

Or not.

As November was ending, protesters hit the streets in a dozen cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, the country’s political and commercial hearts. Students also turned out at some 80 universities to demonstrate, reviving a long history of activism that had largely disappeared after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.

The regime quickly dispersed the protesters, offering conciliatory words on COVID, sending students home early from school, and threatening or detaining people who could be identified. However, the regime cannot rest easy. Xi and his enforcers have lost the young, who are frustrated with declining economic liberties, intrusive personal restrictions, lack of public accountability, and destructive zero-COVID policies. Having challenged the regime once, they are likely to return more vocal and active.

And that’s only the latest problem faced by Xi and the CCP. Beijing poses a significant challenge to free peoples around the world, but Americans should feel confident. Despite the obvious problems at home, the U.S. retains important strengths, and the PRC suffers from important weaknesses. Policymakers should bear this balance in mind and avoid mimicking Chinese policies in response.

For instance, despite spending more on internal security than on external defense, establishing a formidable surveillance system, and steadily shrinking the space available for independent expression, the regime just saw its streets fill with discontented protesters. Although initially animated by COVID authoritarianism, people began denouncing Xi, the CCP, and dictatorship. They also called for human rights, democracy, and freedom of expression. So much for Xi’s recent demand that the population shut up and follow him.

China remains a poor nation, despite years of economic growth. Mao and the early revolutionaries imposed totalitarian economic controls, hobbling an otherwise productive people. After Mao’s death, the new leadership, led by Deng, opened up the economy, but Xi is moving in reverse. Even if the PRC ultimately matches the U.S. economy in size, with four times as many people China’s per capita wealth will remain far behind.

This year, the PRC population is beginning to shrink, and it likely will fall behind India next year. China has a rapidly aging population and diminishing workforce. To that is added the social problem of too many men. Although the government is desperately pushing to increase fertility rates, many of the nation’s young are disdaining marriage and childbearing. Ominously, the PRC is growing old before it grows rich.

Beijing is essentially friendless in the world. Who else on earth is committed to Han ethnic superiority, a Leninist state, and Maoist revival? Russia’s Vladimir Putin clings to Xi out of desperation. Even the North Koreans don’t get along with the PRC. Antagonism toward the U.S. has driven them together, but it is easier for them to explain what they are against than what they are for.

China does have clients, customers, suppliers, agents, factotums, and others involved in transactions, big and small. However, even many of them have been insulted and sullied by Beijing’s confrontational “wolf warrior diplomacy.” Once friendly populations in Australia and South Korea, for instance, have turned sharply hostile.

Chinese economic policy is wretched and getting worse. Economic growth exploded after Mao’s death not because the PRC did so much right but because it stopped doing so much wrong. Relaxing agricultural controls freed up rural labor to staff factories. Allowing creation of private businesses reduced the role of inefficient, overly indebted state enterprises. However, state interference remained significant, only less destructive.

Today, economic productivity remains low. Xi is enhancing state control over even nominally private enterprises. The real estate market, which traditionally has accounted for nearly a third of Chinese economic activity, is overbuilt and in crisis. There no longer are surplus workers to employ; instead, the number is shrinking along with the population. Younger Chinese are dropping out, promoting such memes as “lying flat” and “let it rot.”

To move forward, real reform is necessary. Observed Zeng Xiangquan of the China Institute for Employment Research, “The structural adjustment faced by China’s economy right now actually needs more people to become entrepreneurs and strive.” However, Xi is going in the wrong direction. Indeed, his concerted attack on Chinese industry and entrepreneurs is driving the most productive producers abroad: For instance, Alibaba’s Jack Ma, whose public rebuke and disappearance from view caused some analysts to fear his arrest, now lives in Tokyo.

Beijing’s effort to seize the commanding technological heights is an expensive muddle. China spends more than any other nation on industrial policy — and more than on its military defense — but remains a couple generations behind the U.S. on semiconductor chips. Many subsidized enterprises have gone under. And despite the Xi government’s celebrated campaign against corruption, the tsunami of government cash has had its predictable effect. Some industry leaders face corruption investigations.

Internationally, the PRC has driven its neighbors together and toward Washington. Give former Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi credit for honesty. He bluntly explained to those who resisted Beijing’s demands that “China is a big country and you are small countries, and that is a fact.” The destruction of Hong Kong’s liberal system, which the PRC had agreed to respect for 50 years, undermined belief in Chinese government promises. Any lingering support in Taiwan for unification has dissipated. Japan is talking about doubling military outlays; South Koreans elected a government determined to take a tougher stance toward the PRC; and even the Philippines, after the bizarre presidency of Rodrigo Duterte, is snuggling closer to the U.S., negotiating expanded military access to Filipino bases.

China’s military has grown dramatically but remains well behind the U.S. The PRC does not threaten the American homeland or neighborhood. Rather, the contested grounds and waters are near China. If war comes, the battleground will be there. Although there is doubt that the U.S. could still impose its will on Beijing from thousands of miles away, the PRC would be fighting to prevent that rather than to dominate America. And the future is not over.

What might be the most ominous aspect of China’s political transformation, Xi’s reincarnation as Mao II, will weaken the PRC. As we discovered with the spread of demonstrations across China, Xi’s consolidation of power does not mean political stability. Dictatorships typically isolate the leader and leave him perilously ill-informed about anything he might not want to hear. There is little accountability for failure. And brutal autocracy is no friend of dynamic economic growth. The Soviet Union ranged from the terrifying brutality of Joseph Stalin to the enervating stasis of Leonid Brezhnev. Mao Zedong produced the terrifying brutality in China. Now Xi Jinping risks delivering the enervating stasis.

None of these factors mean that Americans should underestimate China. It’s an ancient civilization whose people have proved enormously productive around the world. Even the young are nationalistic, proud of and loyal to their nation. A Leninist state capable of conscripting private people and resources poses a unique challenge to America. Even good free marketeers must consider possible compromises to confront potentially malign Chinese ambitions.

Nevertheless, Americans should proceed with confidence, not fear. Despite some talk suggesting that Beijing already has won the bilateral struggle, nations that bet against the U.S. tend to lose. And the PRC’s very nature as a communist state undermines its efforts to dominate its neighbors, let alone the rest of the globe.

“Do not be afraid,” intoned Pope John Paul II long ago to people living in the shadow of what President Ronald Reagan called the Evil Empire. Soon thereafter that system ended up in history’s trash bin. Similarly, today Americans should not be afraid when dealing with China.

Not Quite Inscrutable China - The American Spectator,"After a final count it appears that 2,268 party members attended the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of China in Beijing this past week. They clapped appropriately during and after each speech and gave every appearance of complete agreement and uniformity. But the only thing uniform about these “chosen ones” is their dark black and blue suits. Each has his own agenda — and political patron. Secrecy, however, is the guiding principle that links all these representatives — and yet there are signs that expose much of the conflict within.

If there was a theme to this congress that could not be hidden, it had to be corruption. The specter of the dismissed politburo member, the popular and powerful Bo Xilai, and his deals with the British businessman who was killed by Bo’s wife, hung over the entire session. Premier Wen Jiabao’s family had been charged in a New York Times article as having accumulated $2.7 billion during his political career. The Times‘ Chinese language website was blocked as punishment, but the damage had been done and most observers could not find strong reasons to disagree with the general figures.

Without pointing to a specific example, Hu Jintao, the outgoing president, acknowledged the corruption problem in general by forcefully calling for indictment of all corrupt officials no matter their rank. Hu went so far as to warn the congress that corruption could cause the fall of the state. This was a message that everyone understood and it is expected that quite a few foreign bank accounts will be undergoing review.

All this was done to great applause, of course, except for the most senior Party member, the retired former leader, 86-year-old Jiang Zemin, who rarely has been seen in the last ten years. Jiang, whose presence at the congress surprised the entire foreign press, conspicuously kept his clapping in approval to a very limited degree. His careful lack of enthusiasm made Jiang’s appearance even more impressive. The fact that the expected new Party leader and China’s presumptive next president, Xi Jinping, has long been characterized as a protégé of Jiang signified not only the latter’s continued influence, but a division in Politburo direction.

Supposedly that direction is to include a return to a greater emphasis on what is referred to as “market –oriented economic policies,” as opposed to Hu Jintao’s tendency to encourage more centralized, large government-owned industrial and commercial institutions. The warning that such a shift might be in the making came when Zhang Ming, a well-known political science professor at Renmin University, Beijing, publicly stated that “China’s economic situation is not very good…To fix this the best method for China would be to open its state-owned enterprises (SOEs) by breaking them down into private enterprises.” He then suggested obscurely that this action would bring in “enough capital for actual political reform.” This reform, he said without clarification, is necessary as inaction would produce severe consequences.

Provocative statements such as Professor Zhang’s are viewed as purposely exaggerated in order to draw public attention to the broader political concept of the economic issue he sought to address. Political science academics in China do not strike out on their own to attack the principles of state enterprise without strong backing. It has been suggested that Jiang Zemin was more than willing to come out of his “retirement” to stimulate a return to market-oriented policies for which he had become so famous in his presidency. Prof. Zhang effectively set the scene.

The body that directs the operations of the Politburo is its Standing Committee. Here, too, Mr. Jiang seems to have waved a political wand and produced a majority of the candidates for the projected seven spots. Most important is the reported alignment with Jiang Zemin of the next Communist Party chief and presumptive President of the PRC, the youthful (59-year-old) Xi Jinping. It will not be easy sailing for Xi even with the support of the reinvigorated Mr. Jiang. The Chinese press has noted there will be twenty ex-Standing Committee members, all of whom will want to exert their influence in some manner.

Theories abound in Beijing over what exactly will be the new direction in China’s administration. How long will the aged Jiang continue to exert his renewed interest and political strength? Will Xi Jinping, having been well launched, simply proceed along on his own? Strengthening market orientation may not be as assured as might be expected. Jiang’s support for five of the seven men in the Standing Committee does not necessarily guarantee that even this player roster will maintain a deep commitment to major change from centralized state enterprise to greater private ownership driven by market principles. Hu Jintao’s acolytes may yet fully respond.

More clarification is likely between now and next March, when Xi Jinping is to be formally installed as president. There’ll be a strong effort to avoid goring too many important oxen while, however, making sure that the proper advantages are distributed and important positions divided along the most effective lines.

This is China, after all, where sophistication and stark reality mix in an arcane political stew. It is certainly not an environment for the faint of heart nor the marginal talents of the current Washington foreign policy leadership.",https://spectator.org/chinas-covid-surveillance-state-and-its-western-imitators/,2012-11-16
Nuclear Weapons and China’s Foreign Policy - The American Spectator,"In an important article in the current Washington Quarterly, Evan Braden Montgomery and Toshi Yoshihara of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (CSBA) explore the foreign policy implications of what they describe as China’s “significant quantitative and qualitative nuclear buildup.” China’s nuclear buildup includes strategic and tactical weapons which the authors believe may have both immediate and long-term effects on regional and global balances of power.

First, the numbers and trends. According to the authors, China has about 350 nuclear warheads, mostly land-based and sea-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). And that number is changing based on reports that China is constructing hundreds of new ICBM silos and is busy modernizing their missiles, each capable of carrying multiple warheads. Both the United States and Russia are believed to have deployed about 1550 nuclear warheads each. The authors note that China’s inventory includes road-mobile ICBMs and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and it is developing an air-launched ballistic missile capable of delivering nuclear warheads. And its new DF-26 intermediate-range missile is capable of precision strikes. The authors believe that the balance of theater nuclear forces in the western Pacific is shifting in Beijing’s favor. Ominously, Montgomery and Yoshihara report that China is constructing “fast breeder reactors and reprocessing facilities for the production and separation of plutonium, which would enable it to increase its warhead numbers, perhaps substantially.” They note that the Pentagon estimates that China may deploy more than 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030, and some U.S. officials see these developments as China’s “nuclear breakout strategy” and warn that China may be seeking a “first-strike capability.”

The authors, while convinced that China has “revisionist objectives” based on its actions in the South China Sea and East China Sea, do not find plausible or probable the notion that China is seeking a first-strike capability vis-à-vis the United States. However, they fear that China’s nuclear build-up may increase the risk of conventional regional war due to a belief that increased mutual vulnerability would deter both sides from using nuclear weapons in, say, a war in the South China Sea. And China believes that it would have the edge over the United States in a conventional war in the western Pacific due to its “geographic, technical and operational military advantages.”

But even more worrisome to Montgomery and Yoshihara is that the “emerging asymmetry in the Sino-US theater nuclear balance” may convince China’s strategists and leaders that their growing theater nuclear arsenal will deter the United States and its regional allies from fighting a conventional war in the western Pacific. They write:

[T]he threat of low-yield nuclear strikes against US allies, US overseas territories, or US forward-operating forces would raise many of the same extended deterrence concerns that bedeviled American policymakers and their foreign partners during the Cold War.

In short, China’s edge in theater nuclear and conventional forces in the western Pacific could be used both to keep the U.S. out of a regional conventional war and to undermine the credibility of the U.S. extended deterrent in the western Pacific.

Montgomery and Yoshihara suggest that the recent receptiveness among South Korean and Japanese leaders to possible “nuclear sharing mechanisms” with the U.S. may be a reaction to those countries’ assessment of the shifting theater nuclear balance in Beijing’s favor. And the authors urge Washington policymakers to improve our theater nuclear capabilities in the western Pacific by deploying nuclear weapons on Guam and by modifying allied tactical aircraft, surface combatants, and submarines to deliver nuclear payloads. Such actions would make more credible our extended deterrent to Japan and South Korea, while also decreasing China’s theater nuclear advantage.

What Montgomery and Yoshihara are saying is that U.S. policymakers and strategists need to relearn the Cold War lessons on the impact of nuclear weapons on foreign policies. The “massive retaliation” doctrine of the Eisenhower years is not credible. Neither is the “mutual assured destruction” (MAD) doctrine of the McNamara years. Our nuclear and conventional posture in the western Pacific needs to be robust and credible enough to convince Chinese leaders their theater nuclear threats will not force us to sit on the sidelines while they use conventional military means to attack our regional allies. This means, they write, that “Washington would … have to assume more risks and responsibilities in an intensifying nuclear rivalry,” including reviving “nuclear brinkmanship in future confrontations with China.”

What we need are modern-day Bernard Brodies, Albert Wohlstetters, and Herman Kahns who thought and wrote about nuclear doctrines and their relation to U.S. foreign policy. And it wouldn’t hurt to consult Henry Kissinger’s book Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy (1957), which explored the relationship of nuclear weapons to U.S. foreign policy at a time when the Soviet Union, like China today, was beginning to challenge U.S. nuclear superiority. Kissinger argued that the United States needed to deploy a wider spectrum of nuclear weapons to pose the “maximum credible threat” to our potential enemies. Threatening mutual suicide, he wrote, was not credible. In words that Montgomery and Yoshihara would likely echo, Kissinger wrote that to support a credible deterrent “we require a continuous spectrum of nuclear and nonnuclear capabilities.”

Montgomery and Yoshihara conclude with a summons for U.S. policymakers to “shed habits of thought — reinforced over the past three decades of great power peace — that have disinclined them to consider escalation as a tool of statecraft.” In the nuclear realm, Cold War II is beginning to look a lot like Cold War I.",https://spectator.org/chinas-cyber-militia/,2023-01-23
"America Can’t Contain China, But Maybe Proliferation Can - The American Spectator","The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the confrontation between the U.S. and People’s Republic of China. So far the challenge is more economic and political than military, though the U.S. Navy recently sent two aircraft carriers into the South China Sea in an attempt to intimidate Beijing. The PRC, however, hopes to develop anti-access/area denial capabilities to prevent America from using such vessels in the future to coerce China in its own neighborhood.

Washington continues to possess the larger and more capable armed forces. But present doctrine, which presumes that America will continue to dominate every nation on every continent, no longer is realistic. The cost of extending military power is far greater than that of deterring intervention. America was running a trillion-dollar annual deficit before COVID-19. Now that number should exceed $4 trillion in 2020. Next year the deficit will be over $2 trillion, and perhaps much more after Congress approves a third bailout. Washington must set priorities.

The simplest and smartest strategy would be to expect allied and friendly states in the region to create their own deterrent forces. The PRC is surrounded by countries with which it has been at war: Russia, India, Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. All but the first are at least friendly to Washington, sharing its concern over Beijing’s ambitions. And rapprochement by the U.S. to Moscow could dampen the latter’s burgeoning partnership with the People’s Republic of China.

Moreover, East Asia is filled with states capable of constraining Chinese adventurism. Japan has assembled capable armed forces, called a “self-defense force” for constitutional purposes, despite limiting military expenditures to 1 percent of GDP. South Korea could handle defense against North Korea and contribute to regional security. Australia and Singapore possess competent militaries. Indonesia and Vietnam have significant potential. Even before India’s recent border flare-up with China, New Delhi was increasing its regional involvement, also promoting a peaceful balance of power.

There is one further step the U.S. should take, however, to encourage greater regional capabilities. Reconsider Washington’s commitment to nonproliferation.

Admittedly, such a change would send shock waves through Washington’s foreign policy-making community. And it would be a dramatic change. Yet today’s policy, reflexively backed by liberal internationalists and conservative war hawks alike, should be viewed suspiciously.

Proliferation creates additional risks for conflict and leakage, both of which could prove dangerous. Yet the nuclear age is more than 75 years old and has proved to be remarkably stable. No country has used nuclear weapons since World War II, no nuclear powers have gone to war against each other, despite persistent concern over India and Pakistan, and no great power has attacked another great power or a weaker state that possessed nukes, despite occasional threats, such as by Washington against North Korea. This result is evidence of the stabilizing impact of nuclear weapons.

Still, the U.S. might reasonably prefer to resist proliferation, except for the problem of extended deterrence. That is, many if not most of America’s allies expect the U.S. to risk its homeland on their behalf. Which in most cases makes no strategic sense for America. Few of these relationships warrant taking that kind of risk.

During the Cold War, Washington’s nuclear guarantee for Europe had some credibility. War-ravaged Europe was vulnerable to the victorious Red Army. Moreover, Soviet domination of Eurasia would present America with a threatening international environment. The U.S. had intervened in Europe twice in little more than two decades to prevent a hegemonic power from conquering that continent and left a garrison to defend its allies at the second conflict’s end. To thereafter test the U.S. would entail unacceptable risks for the Soviet Union, which had no compelling reason to invade its distant neighbors.

But none of these factors apply today. The Europeans are well able to arm themselves. Russia is not poised for European let alone global dominion. The PRC cannot easily dominate Asia, let alone Eurasia. The Korean peninsula has lost much of its strategic significance for America — it no longer fits within a larger global struggle, such as the Cold War. The stakes simply are not worth the potential destruction of American cities.

Still, it is in Washington’s interest to preserve the independence and freedom of China’s neighbors, which individually look small compared to the emerging colossus. If the U.S. is not prepared to guarantee nuclear deterrence for others, then it could stop objecting to proposals that they develop their own arsenals.

Current policy has perverse consequences. Rather like gun control, it ensures that only bad guys in East Asia are armed: North Korea, China, and Russia. In response, Washington has put the American homeland at risk in confronting all three. Yet friendly states are interested in developing countervailing nuclear arsenals.

For instance, polls indicate that a majority of South Koreans favor creating their own deterrent. The political class, including President Moon Jae-in, is less enthused, but the DPRK’s continued development of its arsenal might shift opinions. The issue is more difficult for Japan, but in his prior premiership Prime Minister Shinzo Abe seemed open to the idea. Abe already has pushed to increase Tokyo’s military role in response to a growing threat from both China and North Korea. And if the ROK moved to develop nukes, Tokyo would be forced to debate the issue.

Other possible nuclear states are Taiwan and Australia. The former genuinely needs nukes, though acquiring nuclear weapons would dramatically exacerbate tensions with the PRC. Beijing would be tempted to preempt any Taiwanese attempt to exercise the nuclear option. Direct transfer from the U.S. would be an admittedly highly controversial option. Canberra is dependent on China economically yet has challenged Beijing on the latter’s role in COVID-19 and crackdown in Hong Kong. With increasing uncertainty over America’s long-term commitment to Australia and the region, nuclear weapons might eventually look attractive Down Under.

Merely broaching the possibility would have geopolitical value: faced with the possibility of multiple potentially hostile nuclear powers, the PRC might press North Korea harder to limit or eliminate its program. Although the two governments are not close, their relationship improved once the Trump–Kim summit loomed. As negotiations with the U.S. have stalled, China’s role in the North has grown.

Washington and Beijing have no intrinsic conflicts that warrant war. Threatening a major geopolitical clash is the seemingly inevitable confrontation between a much stronger PRC determined to assert a Monroe Doctrine with Chinese characteristics and prevent U.S. coercion along its borders, and a still powerful but increasingly financially strapped America attempting to retain the ability to dictate to China, like every other nation, in its own region.

Rather than place such a burden on the American people, Washington should shift defense responsibilities to those with the most at stake in limiting Chinese dominance in East Asia and adjoining waters. And the most cost-effective way for them to do so is to develop their own nuclear deterrents. They might reject such an option. But it is time to confront the issue directly, instead of foreclosing the policy due to inertia, allowing the dead hand of past policymakers to set American security policy in the future.

Obama Agrees to Cut U.S. Carbon Emissions While Allowing China To Increase Theirs - The American Spectator,"So I guess this is what President Obama meant when he said he wanted to take U.S.-China relations to a new level.

Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping have come to an agreement on carbon emissions (H/T Patrick Brennan at NRO). The U.S. will commit to reducing emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels while China’s carbon emissions will peak “around 2030.”

In other words, while this country has to reduce carbon emissions above and beyond what we have previously committed (17% below 2005 levels by 2020) for the next 15 years, China gets to increase its emissions unabated for the next 15 years give or take.

How exactly does this agreement advance American interests one bit? How does this help our economy?

Is Obama entering this agreement unilaterally? Or does the Senate get a say here? If they do, this agreement is dead on arrival just like Kyoto. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called the agreement “unrealistic”.

Of course, should that happen, it would give Obama yet one more thing for which to blame Republicans. Well, better Obama use his hot air against the GOP than using his hot air to enforce this bad agreement.",https://spectator.org/chinas-doing-it/,2014-11-12
Ohio State Professor Says China Poses No Threat to the US - The American Spectator,"Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin contemptuously called Western intellectuals who unwittingly served communist objectives “useful idiots.” Ohio State University political science professor and Cato Institute senior fellow John Mueller may be auditioning for that role with his article in the National Interest titled “The United States Does Not Need to Contain China.”

Chinese President Xi Jinping has not been shy about his desire to reunify Taiwan with the mainland, if necessary, by force. And, as evidenced by the recent 20th Party Congress, Xi has acquired Mao-like control over the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). China’s decades-long conventional and nuclear weapons buildup proceeds apace. And Xi has managed to forge a strategic partnership with President Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Yet, in the face of these developments, Mueller advises U.S. policymakers to take a “mellower” approach to China’s challenge because, if we just wait patiently, he writes, the Chinese economy will stagnate, forcing the CCP to look inward instead of seeking global hegemony. And, in any event, Mueller argues, “China does not really present a significant threat,” so trying to contain it “scarcely seem[s] necessary.”

Mueller argues that China’s “wolf warrior” diplomacy has backfired, alienating other regional powers, and claims that its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has not lived up to expectations and has contributed to “rising Sinophobia” in the region. Mueller predicts that China’s internal problems — economic stagnation, an aging population, trade protectionism, environmental degradation, corruption, and domestic repression — will hamper its efforts to replace the United States as the world’s leading power. But then, Mueller is not convinced that China has that as a goal of its foreign policy.

While conceding that China may want to take over Taiwan and “establish some sort of regional ‘primacy’ as a springboard to global power,” Mueller writes that “these goals scarcely suggest a threat that is Hitlerian.” He believes that a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan “has already been deterred” by present Taiwanese deployments, and he predicts that China “seems likely to remain sensibly content with the present arrangement.” And Mueller doesn’t think that China “should be considered an ‘enemy.’” (READ MORE from Francis P. Sempa: Are We on the Road to Another Pearl Harbor?)

Mueller tips his hand early in the article by invoking Strobe Talbott, a former Soviet “expert” who got just about everything wrong in the 1980s. Talbott was a chief critic of President Ronald Reagan’s approach toward the Soviet Union, blaming Reagan for worsening U.S.–Soviet relations by trying to “roll back” communism in Eastern Europe.

When Reagan succeeded in doing precisely that, Talbott, as Mueller notes, argued that Reagan (and others) exaggerated Soviet strengths and underestimated Soviet weaknesses — which has it exactly backward.

Reagan understood the geopolitical danger posed by the Soviet Union — which was real — and exploited Soviet weaknesses to undermine its empire in Eastern Europe. Talbott was wrong about Reagan all along but wouldn’t admit it. Mueller applies Talbott’s belated assessment of Soviet weaknesses in the 1980s, which Reagan supposedly overlooked, to what he characterizes as an overstated China threat today.

But the China threat today is as real as the Soviet threat was in the 1970s and 1980s, only greater, because, unlike the Soviet Union, which then posed solely a military threat to America and its allies, China today poses a multidimensional warfare threat to the United States and the West — economic, cyber, regional-naval, and informational. The last thing the United States needs to do is let down our guard — but that is what Mueller says to do.

Like the old “useful idiots” of the first Cold War, Mueller suggests that China’s assertive policies and rhetoric may be “a reaction to what it views as hostile provocations by the West, and particularly the United States.” Sounds a lot like Strobe Talbott in the 1980s.",https://spectator.org/chinas-exhortation-to-study-and-conquer/,2022-11-29
Ostpolitik Returns to Germany — This Time With China - The American Spectator,"Shannon Tiezzi, editor-in-chief of the Diplomat, assesses German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s recent trip to Beijing in which Scholz was accompanied by 12 CEOs of German companies, including Volkswagen, Merck, and Siemans. Tiezzi writes that the trip indicates that Scholz is returning to his predecessor’s “business-first” approach to China, even as rising tensions between China and the United States threaten to ignite a kinetic war in the South China Sea. But Scholz’s trip may be more indicative of a return to Willy Brandt’s Ostpolitik of the 1970s, in which German foreign policy toward the Soviet Union, in the words of Brandt’s closest adviser Egon Bahr, sought “Wandel durch Annaherung” (“change through rapprochement”).

Superficially, Brandt’s Ostpolitik shared some elements of the Nixon administration’s policy of détente. But Nixon and his top foreign policy adviser Henry Kissinger viewed Ostpolitik warily, concerned that Germany’s separate approach to the Soviet Union could divide NATO. It had long been Soviet strategy to weaken NATO by a combination of threats to Berlin and economic and political inducements. In the first volume of his memoirs, Kissinger included a memo he wrote to Nixon warning that Ostpolitik could be used by the Soviets to pry Germany away from the Western alliance. The Soviet price for allowing its East German satellite to renew relations with West Germany and dangling the prospect of German reunification might be German neutrality or at least a German foreign policy conducted independently of Washington. But instead of trying to disrupt Ostpolitik, Nixon sought to, in Kissinger’s words, “embed it in a wider framework” of détente.

Critics of détente, of course, were also critics of Ostpolitik. David Gress of the Hoover Institution noted that Brandt’s goal of German reunification would only come about by the “rollback of Soviet power.” James Burnham was one of America’s chief critics of détente and Ostpolitik. In his “Protracted Conflict” columns in National Review, he warned that Brandt’s opening to the East could lead to the “Finlandization” of Germany (a situation where German foreign policy did not oppose Soviet foreign policy). He wrote that “Brandt’s Ostpolitik is only the latest expression of the fact that everyone is anxious to come to terms with Communism” and “implies acceptance of the so-called Brezhnev Doctrine of the right and duty of all socialist states to defend any socialist state against a threat to socialism.” Détente and Ostpolitik arguably gave the decrepit Soviet system a lifeline that extended its existence into the 1980s.

In her article in the Diplomat, Tiezzi notes that Scholz has approved a deal for China to own a portion of Germany’s port of Hamburg. She quotes from an op-ed written by Scholz defending his trip to Beijing: “China remains an important business and trading partner for Germany and Europe. We do not want to decouple from it.” Tiezzi notes that for China, Scholz’s trip and remarks indicate that Germany and Europe can be persuaded to distance themselves from U.S. policy in the Indo-Pacific, and will hopefully “ensure China’s access to European research and goods that can help advance [President] Xi’s new focus on cutting-edge tech.” Chinese media, Tiezzi noted, was “triumphalist” in commenting on Scholz’s visit. The Global Times noted that Scholz and Xi “agreed on enhancing cooperation and maintaining dialogue, rejecting decoupling and bloc confrontation, vowing to further expand cooperation beyond traditional areas into new sectors such as energy and digitalization and increasing mutual political trust for a stable China-Germany relationship.” It called the visit a “touchstone for European strategic autonomy” that will frustrate U.S. efforts “to gang up for forming anti-China small cliques.” The article noted that the two leaders “expressed clear opposition” to U.S. efforts to decouple from China.

Scholz’s visit is also an indication that one of our most important NATO allies feels free to embark on an independent policy toward China. At least Nixon and Kissinger sought to shape and guide Brandt’s Ostpolitik toward Soviet Russia in the early 1970s. There is no sign that the Biden administration feels similarly about Germany’s Asia-version of Ostpolitik. Perhaps that is because, rhetoric aside, the Biden administration’s policy of competitive engagement is not that different from Scholz’s new Ostpolitik. It is détente with a communist giant all over again.",https://spectator.org/chinas-hazmat-suit-terror-shaomin-li/,2022-11-06

Pakistan and China: Strengthening Ties - The American Spectator,"As U.S. military operations in Afghanistan drag on, a strengthening relationship between Pakistan and China has emerged as tensions between the former and the United States continue to grow.

Of particular interest are the trilateral meeting just held between Chinese, Saudi and Pakistani intelligence officials in Islamabad and a two-day visit to Pakistan by the Chinese Deputy Prime Minister Meng Jianzhou. Both of these developments come in the midst of growing concern among U.S. officials about the problem of ISI (Pakistani intelligence) support for a militant group known as the Haqqani Network, which has bases in Pakistan and conducts operations against American and Indian targets in Afghanistan.

For example, the Haqqani Network is widely suspected of being behind the bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul in 2008, and more recently cell phone trails have established that members of the organization were in contact with Pakistani intelligence before and during the assault on the U.S. embassy in the Afghan capital this month.

Pakistan’s response, however, has been to deny any links between the ISI and Haqqani Network, while accusing the United States of creating the group in the first place. In fact, Jalaluddin Haqqani, the godfather of the organization, was already a devotee to jihadist ideology by the mid-1970s, aiming back then to overthrow the government of Mohammed Daoud Khan, who had seized power from King Zahir in 1973 and established an Afghan republic.

Thus, the militants behind the Haqqani Network (including some Chechen, Palestinian and Yemeni fellow fighters) were already active well before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent joint CIA-ISI enterprise of providing support to various mujahideen warriors in their jihad against the Soviet occupation forces in the 1980s.

Although the leadership of the Pakistan Army is now firmly refusing to take any action against the Haqqani Network in the form of a military offensive in North Waziristan, Pakistan’s Interior Minister Rehman Malik has vowed to attack and pursue Muslim Uighur militants who operate in China’s western province of Xinjiang but take refuge and undergo training in Pakistan’s border areas with Afghanistan (often in cooperation with al-Qa’ida and other Islamist militant groups that have firm footholds in Pakistan). As Malik himself put it, “We will strike very hard against them [the Uighur militants]. Anybody who is the enemy of China is the enemy of Pakistan.”

Strengthening ties extend to the realm of arms deals, and now even entail the deployment of Chinese troops in Pakistani territory. For example, in May, China agreed to provide 50 new JF-17 Thunder multi-role fighter planes to the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) “immediately” (a deal had been signed earlier, but during the Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Gilani’s visit to China discussion was also raised over the possibility of further Chinese supplies to the PAF of J-20 Stealth and Xiaolong multi-purpose light fighter aircraft). It would appear that as Pakistan increases its military cooperation with China, the country is distancing itself from American military support and aid. Indeed, it is expected that the presence of U.S. military personnel in Pakistan will be halved.

As for the stationing of Chinese troops in Pakistan, it is estimated that there are currently around 11,000 soldiers of the People’s Liberation Army in Pakistan’s northern province of Gilgit-Baltistan and in Pakistani Kashmir, facilitating the opening of branches of Chinese banks and construction of concrete residential houses for these troops. This development should primarily be understood in light of the fact that engineers are working on a railroad that is intended to extend from the port of Gwadar in the southwestern province of Balochistan (a port that will be very important for future Chinese proximity to the Persian Gulf) all the way into western China.

Once Pakistan’s strengthening alliance with China in opposition to what is perceived as a U.S.-India axis is taken into account, the policies of the Pakistani military and intelligence towards the various Islamist militants based or operating in Pakistan become very easy to explain. The inconsistency of refusing to launch an offensive against the Haqqani Network while vowing to hunt down Uighur militants has already been noted. Beijing certainly has no problem with ISI backing of the Haqqani Network: so long as the group harms Indian influence and interests in Afghanistan, so much the better for China. China, after all, feels the need as an ever growing economic power to compete with India for Afghanistan’s vast mineral reserves, having already invested $3 billion in the vast Aynak copper mine.

Now we can also see why the ISI and Pakistan Army safeguard and protect the Taliban Shura and other Islamist militants based or operating in Balochistan (especially in and around the provincial capital of Quetta), for they serve as good proxies against the Baloch nationalist insurgency. The Baloch insurgency not only regards Pakistani rule and the presence of Punjabi settlers as an occupation but also is justifiably outraged at the fact that the indigenous population is largely deprived of income from Balochistan’s massive copper reserves, which are being developed and exploited by China and the Pakistani central government.

Pakistan’s desire to counter India applies to Punjab province as well, where a host of Islamist militant organizations (e.g. Lashkar-e-Taiba) enjoy the patronage of the ISI and the provincial government headed by Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif.

These groups have often provided safe havens for militants returning from Afghanistan (as well as those in the border regions who have been given escape routes and early warnings by the Pakistani security forces during operations as part of a double game to win American financial support), allowing many Islamist militants to set up their own seminaries in south Punjab. The predictable result of all this has of course been the increasing destabilization of Punjab itself, giving rise to a phenomenon known as the “Punjabi Taliban” that has bombed Sufi shrines, inter alia.

The emerging picture is clearly one of a Sino-Pakistani partnership aligned against what is seen as a U.S.-India axis designed to limit Pakistan’s assertion of its interests in Afghanistan, Kashmir and parts of India on account of an expansionist policy known as “strategic depth,” which has always been espoused by the Pakistani military and intelligence and is rooted in Pakistan’s perception of its identity as an Islamic state. These developments could well lead to what some analysts have termed a “looming superpower clash” between the United States and China over Afghanistan and the wider regon, triggered by Pakistan.",https://spectator.org/chinas-investment-strategy-editorial-cartoon-shaomin-li/,2011-10-04
Pakistani Senator Downplays Threat of China - The American Spectator,"The National Interest just published an essay by Pakistani Sen. Mushahid Hussain urging U.S. policymakers to accommodate China’s achievement of Indo-Pacific hegemony. The senator, who studied at Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service and chairs the Pakistani Senate’s Defence Committee, doesn’t put it that bluntly in his essay, but that would be the consequence if the United States followed his advice.

Sen. Hussain blames the United States for starting a “new Cold War” with China. U.S. policymakers, he writes, “created” the false idea that China is “the enemy,” and “couch[ed] the confrontation in ideological terms, democracy versus autocracy,” in order to “sell” countermeasures to the American public. “[A]nti-communism,” Hussain contends, “still sells.” He describes the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as having “formal Marxist trappings,” but claims that it “exudes the vibrancy and creativity of a thriving Asian free-market economy pushing globalization.”

American policymakers, Hussain continues, “demoniz[e]” the CCP, just as they did after World War II when the U.S. rebuffed overtures by Mao Zedong and Ho Chi Minh, who he labels “Asian freedom fighters.” Mao, Ho, and Zhou Enlai, Hussain assures us, admired Franklin Roosevelt and Thomas Jefferson, yet U.S. policymakers called them “enemies,” too.

Chinese President Xi Jinping’s policies, Hussain writes, stem not from ideology but from “two historical traumas”: the “Century of Humiliation” when China was under foreign domination and the unraveling of the Soviet Union. Xi is doing nothing more, Hussain writes, than protecting China’s core interests, which include “Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and the South China Sea.” Above all, Hussain explains, Xi wants to protect the primacy of the CCP which is “pivotal to the country’s unity, stability, and prosperity.”

Sen. Hussain criticizes America’s “military-driven, security-centric approach” to China. China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), he explains, “has won hearts and minds” by building a “huge global infrastructure of trade, investment, and regional connectivity driven by the economy, energy, ports, pipelines, roads, and railways, roping in willing partners, ranging from the Solomon Islands to Saudi Arabia, Panama to Pakistan, Israel to Indonesia” while the United States forms security alliances that seek to maintain the Indian and Pacific Oceans as “American lakes.” (READ MORE from Francis P. Sempa: Secretary of State Blinken ‘Blinks’ in Our Eyeball-to-Eyeball China Challenge)

Hussain criticizes Presidents Obama, Trump, and Biden for pushing China closer to Russia. China was once America’s ally in the original Cold War against the Soviet Union, and it could once again be America’s partner if only U.S. policymakers would abandon their emerging policy of containment. “[O]n balance,” he writes, “there is greater convergence of Chinese and U.S. interests on key global issues, than divergence.”

That a Pakistani politician supports the CCP in its efforts to extend its political reach and control throughout the Indo-Pacific region should surprise no one. The surprise here is that Hussain’s pro-CCP propaganda essay appears in the National Interest instead of the Global Times (China’s English-language mouthpiece). Anyone who calls Mao and Ho “Asian freedom fighters” should not be taken seriously, let alone given a featured place on the website of a respected American foreign-policy magazine. And anyone who urges the United States to willingly surrender its global leadership to the CCP — the most murderous regime in human history — is promoting what Winston Churchill called a “new Dark Age.”",https://spectator.org/chinas-morally-hollow-economy/,2022-07-13
Pakistan’s China Problem - The American Spectator,"The bloom is off the rose for the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, the crown jewel of China’s vaunted Belt and Road Initiative — designed to economically link Europe, Eurasia, Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia to Beijing.

About 70 countries have signed up for this Initiative, which seeks to promote commerce and investment, and develop infrastructure such as railways, pipelines, roads, and ports. Besides Pakistan, one of the expected winners would be Xinjiang in western China, a largely undeveloped region situated on the old Silk Road of the Han dynasty and explored in the 13th century by Marco Polo. In strategic terms, the Initiative would cede grand influence to China as the controller of protocol and terms of trade and investment in much of the world.

By necessity, and in view of the U.S. strategic partnership with India, Pakistan has turned to China for sponsorship: China has in recent years provided massive aid and military support. Examples are the construction of the Karakoram highway, joint venture development of the JF-17 combat aircraft and the Al-Khalid main battle tank; and construction and operation of the port of Gwadar. Several years ago, China also committed $62 billion to Pakistan, to showcase the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative there.

In recent decades, however, Pakistan has been beset with internal security problems. It has lacked a strategy for self-development, and has instead chosen to cling to the coattails of others. First it was the United States, and now it is China, although it is now evident that China’s largesse is a form of subterfuge to build dependency through indebtedness and assistance from Chinese state-owned companies. Pakistan’s current fiscal distress is well known, with Saudi Arabia, China, and the UAE recently coming to the rescue with financial largesse. A bailout from the International Monetary Fund estimated at $12 billion by a unit of Fitch is also expected shortly to address Pakistan’s deficit current account. Although it has improved in recent months, it nonetheless has a restraining effect on economic growth, as will austerity measures that the IMF typically demands.

The new romance with China is now showing signs of strain. Pakistan is resisting completion of various envisioned projects to build infrastructure, as the country’s exchequer is unwilling to guarantee indebtedness to Chinese contractors. As recently reported by the Wall Street Journal, Pakistan’s new prime minister, Imran Khan, has postponed much of the $62 billion in committed financial aid. And as I have written in these pages, Pakistan is not the only country that is disaffected with China’s smothering embrace and strategy of entrapment. Malaysia suspended a $20 billion railway project and indebted Sri Lanka ceded a port to China in Hambantota.

But there is some good news for Pakistan. Of late, the country is emphasizing economic development, balancing national security — this has also given Imran Khan some leverage to pursue transparency in governance. Further, in recent years, terrorist attacks have also declined, according to London-based IHS Markit (which owns Jane’s Information Group, among other firms). And following the recent Indian reprisal for a terrorist attack in Kashmir, and the subsequent Pakistani aerial engagement with the Indian Air Force, both Pakistan and India managed to control the situation leading to de-escalation rather than another war. Pakistan is also seen to be adopting a constructive role in recent U.S. efforts to establish peace discussions with the Afghan Taliban. And reports of a major oil and gas discovery in Pakistani waters by ExxonMobil are promising.

The Belt and Road Initiative has been called a Trojan Horse. Pakistan needs to get real about China’s disingenuous intentions to connect much of the world, creating a dependency upon Beijing. Moreover, Pakistan has no intrinsic affinity for China. It would be rare for Pakistanis to wish to live or pursue the professions there — preferring the U.S. or Great Britain instead.

Moderating the addiction to China, as well as to Saudi Arabia, cannot be accomplished by Pakistan’s political leadership alone. It will require the buy-in of the Pakistan Army, the sixth largest in the world and most respected institution in the country — also characterized as its largest commercial conglomerate.

However, with a popular prime minister, Pakistan has the opportunity to start to define its own agenda, rather than to be China’s acolyte.

Patent Trolls: Now Made in China - The American Spectator,"Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump is fond of impugning the character of companies that move overseas to China. However, recent news suggest that some companies may be about to leave whose backs the United States should be very happy to see. I speak of the industry referred to in kinder language as Non-Practicing Entities (NPEs), and in more accurate verbiage as patent trolls.

A recent report from Bloomberg BNA explains the Dickensian suffering which many patent trolls are experiencing here in the United States, the public having finally cottoned onto their parasitic practices. So, what’s a put-upon bloodsucker to do? Well, to quote Erich Spangenburg, a man referred to in the article itself as “one of the most notorious patent trolls in America,” the answer is “focusing on licensing and litigation in Europe and China rather than the U.S.”

Now, dear reader, you may well pause in shock. “Patent trolls are moving to China?” I hear you ask incredulously. “Isn’t that the very place they warn the United States will imitate if it decides to curb their abuses?” Actually, yes! Which is yet one more reason why, if you were under the impression that people who profit from frivolous lawsuits are honest, then you should hastily readjust your opinions. Despite what you may have heard, not only are patent trolls more than willing to do business with the boogieman they try to paint for gullible free marketers, but their far Left backers (such as trial lawyers and university presidents) would probably be more comfortable in a communist country like China anyway. After all, they produce nothing of value, and communist countries love producing just that.

But not as much as they love hurting the U.S., which is yet one more reason the trolls might find China a more amenable business environment: because rather like trolls themselves, China loves enriching itself at the expense of United States business while turning the very weapons of our own legal system against the capitalist system.

Exhibit A: In 2014, the Independent Institute reported that China had created a government-sponsored patent trolling firm known as Ruichuan IPR Funds, which it seeded with $50 billion to attack U.S. business using patent lawsuits. Prior to that, the blog Techdirt reported that China had begun subsidizing the legal costs for its companies to file patent lawsuits overseas, all as part of a strategy to weaken U.S. business.

The irony of all this is that China itself remains a massive intellectual property thief, as most policymakers on all sides of the intellectual property debate will readily admit. However, what its sponsorship of patent trolling in the U.S. shows is that it will also use any and all laws of U.S. and global governance to try to handicap its economic rivals while refusing to abide by those laws itself. So be it: Everyone knows China is a ruthlessly self-interested nation.

However, the fact that U.S.-based patent trolls see China as a land of opportunity for this blatantly amoral behavior speaks volumes about what patriotism is worth to the trolls when it stands between them and a meal ticket at the expense of American business. The one advantage of this coming mass diaspora of the patent parasites is that the defenders of our broken patent system will no longer be able to hide behind the fig leaf of protecting American business, or American property rights. And without that, perhaps the long-overdue reform that our patent system requires will finally come to pass.

And if it does, and the trolls have gone to China? Well, let’s see how the Chinese like it when Leftist trial lawyers decide to feed on their pocketbooks. And let’s see how trial lawyers like it when their opponent is the Chinese government, rather than the doddering Republican establishment. Odds are, one of them will end up losing that fight, and whichever one it is, America wins.",https://spectator.org/chinas-one-child-policy-two-cases/,2016-07-11
Pence Slams Biden on China: Stop ‘Rolling Over’ to the CCP - The American Spectator,"Former Vice President Mike Pence returned to the international policy stage to slam the Biden administration’s handling of China.

Pence reminded the international community that “China has emerged as America’s greatest threat” in a Heritage Foundation lecture on Wednesday. “The American people recognize today what our administration brought to the fore,” said Pence at the Heritage Foundation’s B.C. Lee lecture, asserting that the Trump administration had “changed the national consensus” on the communist regime.

But this consensus, says Pence, does not seem to be shared by the current administration. The former vice president asserted that America’s current relationship with China has enabled the Chinese Communist Party’s growth, including recent military aggression in the Indo-Pacific region.

Pence attacked the Biden administration’s concessions, including the rejoining of the World Health Organization and the Paris climate agreement, as “roll[ing] over” to the CCP.

The former vice president was clear: “My sense is that China senses weakness in this administration.”

Pence focused on indicators of weakness in the United States armed forces, including an inability to counteract the CCP’s growing military influence. He mentioned recent negative trends in America’s military, such as an increased focus on wokeness and a decrease in defense spending.

He also scolded the Biden administration in the wake of China’s recent claim to have repelled the U.S. Navy while American ships were engaged in lawful maritime operation. This weakness in America’s Navy has been highlighted as of late — a recent report indicated “numerous cultural and structural issues” in the force, including “insufficient focus on warfighting skills” and “over-sensitivity … to modern media culture.”

In keeping with the general tone of the Trump administration, Pence called for the increased “readiness” of American armed forces: “The Western Hemisphere is off-limits to Chinese neocolonialism.”

Pence also pushed Biden to stand up to the CCP on the information front, including the unclear origins of COVID-19. He referenced growing evidence of the lab leak theory, slamming the CCP’s “recklessness, incompetence, and corruption.” Pence asserted that America’s funding of Chinese gain-of-function research left America “complicit” in the rise of Chinese influence, compromising American independence both in medical research and drug production.

Adding to the theme of American independence from China, Pence called for the Biden administration to take action to protect American intellectual property. He referenced the administration’s recent move to expand distribution of visas to workers in “specialty occupations,” including Chinese nationals. Pence said that, until the CCP can be trusted, the practice must be terminated, along with support of the Confucius Institute, a cultural center suspected of stealing American intellectual property.

Pence went on to decry the hypocrisy of American businesses “preach[ing] social justice” while doing business with China: “The China problem was made and manufactured right here in the U.S.”

But the former vice president ended his remarks on a note of hope. In the wake of the Biden administration’s tense meeting with Chinese officials, Pence issued a call to stand firm against enemies of American values, even powerful and commercially advantageous ones: “We will never abandon our values for the sake of commerce.”

As a summit between Xi Jinping and Biden becomes more of a possibility, Pence exhorted the U.S. to see the present moment as an opportunity to push for a freer China, quoting an ancient Chinese proverb: “Men see only the present, but heaven sees the future.”

The Vatican Must Take a Strong Stance Against Religious Persecution in China - The American Spectator,"Since his elevation to the papacy in 2013 Pope Francis has continued the Church’s staunch defense of religious freedom and human rights for all, a key theme of every pope since Dignitatis Humanae. As such, even as the Church’s moral authority has suffered in other areas and veered from what many might consider its proper role, the Holy See remains the most important international guardian of the universal, inalienable rights proclaimed in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is regularly and deliberately violating this universal declaration today, as it restricts freedoms of speech, movement, association, and, most pertinent to the Holy See, freedom of religion.

This important legacy, and the role of the Catholic Church in defending inalienable rights, is gravely imperiled by the Vatican’s decision to renew the Sino-Vatican accord. Signed in 2018, the accord has utterly failed to achieve its stated goals of unifying the Chinese Church into one, speeding the appointment of Vatican-approved bishops, and normalizing the lives of Chinese Catholics. Instead, since 2018 Beijing has increased its persecution of Chinese bishops and priests, the bulldozing of countless churches, and the cowing of lay Catholic faithful. Beijing has, for the most part, ignored Vatican wishes on the appointment of bishops. Some 50 Chinese sees remain vacant — a matter of indifference (at best) to the communists, but a crisis for the Catholic faithful.

Unfortunately, this is one of many agreements that the CCP has manipulated or ignored in recent years. The recent National Security Law in Hong Kong has resulted in the imprisonment of Catholic lay advocates for democracy. Protests against this law earlier this year drew crowds of over a million to the streets in opposition to policies that would weaken Hong Kong’s autonomy. This sweeping new law allows for warrantless searches, imposes maximum sentences of life in prison for dissenters, and stifles freedom of speech, of religion, and of the right to peacefully protest.

It is clear that China has successfully used the accord to silence the Vatican and the Holy Father even as President Xi Jinping carries out his plan of absorbing all China’s religions, especially Catholicism, into the state. Xi’s goal is to remove the last real vestige of internal opposition to communist rule — religious citizens and their communities, who have a profound allegiance to something or someone greater than the communist state. Domestic consolidation of power is a classical move by an autocrat like Xi, whose strategy is to increase Chinese power in the Pacific region and in the world.

The accord has also lamentably silenced the Holy Father as other Chinese religious communities are brutalized. The Chinese attack on Uighur Muslims is in effect a 21st-century version of Mao’s cultural revolution. Some one million Muslims have been thrown into detention camps, tortured, and subjected to “reeducation.” For the head of the Roman Catholic Church to allow anyone to believe that his silence on this savagery has been purchased by the accord is a scandal that goes beyond China.

Whatever the terms of the accord, which at this writing remain secret, the Vatican must — for the sake of the Church and its own moral authority — find its voice in the identification and rebuke of evil, and of evil acts, wherever they occur. The Catholic Church and its claims about God and man cannot afford anything less.

Francis Rooney was elected to represent Florida’s 19th Congressional District in 2016. Prior to serving in Congress, Rooney served as United States Ambassador to the Holy See from 2005 to 2008.

Private Sector Must Ride to the Rescue of China’s Uyghurs - The American Spectator,"Sam Brownback is worried. On March 20, the United States Ambassador at Large for Religious Freedom tweeted,

Reportedly, the PRC forces #Uyghurs to work in environments that risk #COVID19 exposure. These actions are not in step with a nation acting in the best interests of its people. China must reverse course, act responsibly, & ensure the safety of all religious and ethnic communities.

Is the Chinese communist government exploiting the raging coronavirus pandemic as a biological weapon of persecution against the Uyghurs, a Muslim ethnic minority in remote Western China? In an interview, I asked Brownback the basis for his concern. He told me that there is “no doubt” about the oppressive conditions to which Uyghurs are subjected. “We have multiple eyewitnesses. We have satellite photos of the camps,” by which he means mass-incarceration “re-education” facilities where detainees are forced to renounce their faith and are subjected to political indoctrination, torture, rape, and other physical and emotional forms of oppression. Brownback’s many private conversations with activists and “multiple public reports from reliable human rights groups and Western media” have convinced him that imprisoned Uyghurs face, if not intentional infection, at the very least sharply increased unnecessary risk of disease.

I asked Nina Shea, Director for Religious Freedom at the Hudson Institute — one of the world’s premier experts on China’s suppression of its religious minorities — whether or not she shares Brownback’s concern about the Uyghurs and coronavirus crisis. Absolutely, she said, and identified the potential reason to the government’s reckless indifference of its own people. “Religious practice is the only area which the Chinese Communist Party doesn’t have full control over,” Shea told me by email. “The disease has a silver lining for Xi [Jinping] and the [Communist] party. It has corralled food-deprived Uyghur Muslims in squalid detention centers and work camps where the virus can be expected to take a toll.”

A disturbing article published in The Diplomat, a respected international current affairs journal that focuses on Asia, adds heft to the alarm expressed by the diplomat and think-tank scholar. “Grave human rights abuses in the [re-education] camps suggest the region could become a breeding ground of coronavirus,” Munawwar Abdulla, co-founder of the Tarim Network, which advocates for defending Ughyur heritage internationally, wrote:

Detainees are held in extremely overcrowded cells where it is at times impossible to stretch without touching the person next to you. Accounts from survivors suggest many in the camps are left extremely weak from malnutrition, and terribly unhygienic conditions of the camps and physical, mental, and sexual abuse. They are therefore at a much higher risk of being infected and dying from the coronavirus.

The coronavirus is an extremely communicable disease. How would authorities quarantine inmates imprisoned cheek to jowl?

That’s very bad. But even worse news about the treatment of Uyghurs by the communist government is slowly emerging out of Western China. In addition to the brutal conditions in the detention prisons, and beyond the potential for the highly communicable virus to devastate the camps, able-bodied Uyghur men and women are systematically Shanghaied into forced labor in factories and manufacturing facilities in their home region and throughout China — a human rights abuse that, Brownback fears “produces products that find their way into broad commercial use.” If true, the prices of the electronics and clothes we purchase — much of which are partially or wholly manufactured in China — are subsidized by Uyghur quasi-slave labor. That makes us all unintentionally complicit in profound evil.

That is certainly a conclusion reasonably drawn from reading Uyghurs for Sale, a shocking study published by the prestigious Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI). The 51-page detailed report — including a detailed appendix and 287 endnote citations — describes with great clarity the exploitation of Uyghur forced laborers. From the report:

There is mounting evidence that many Uyghurs are now being forced to work in factories within Xinjiang [the province in northwestern China where most Uyghurs live]. This report also reveals that Chinese factories outside Xinhiang are sourcing Uyghur workers under a revived, exploitive government-led labor transfer scheme. Some factories appear to be using Uyghur workers sent directly from “re-education camps.”

The report claims that between 2017 and 2019, 80,000 Uyghurs were so exploited “under a central government policy known as “Xinjiang Aid.” Not only is it almost impossible for victims to escape being impressed into such involuntary servitude, but according to the report, labor brokers “are paid a price per head by the Xinjiang provincial government.” Money is a great motivator.

A quoted advertisement describes the systematic transfer of workers in and out of the factories and declares, “Those employed need to receive a thorough ideological education and remain in their jobs.” Uyghurs often live in segregated housing and are deprived of free movement. In other words, Uyghur conscripts can’t refuse work assignments, they can’t hold true to their religious practices while performing coerced labor, and they can’t quit.

Making matters worse — and echoing Brownback’s fears that our product supply has become tainted by these abuses — the report “identified 27 factories in nine Chinese provinces” that exploit Uyghur forced labor victims. These factories “claim to be part of the supply chain of 83 well-known global brands.”

An even more recent report released by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China offers further evidence of the veracity of the “forced labor” allegations against China. The Commission, created by federal statute in 2000, is legally “mandated to monitor human rights and development of the rule of law in China.” In March 2020, the commission’s staff report reached strikingly similar conclusions as the ASPI finding. From “Global Supply Chains, Forced Labor and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region” (my emphasis):

Global supply chains are increasingly at risk of being tainted with goods and products made with forced labor from XUAR [Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]. Intrusive surveillance, restrictions on movement, and the inability to obtain reliable information from workers at risk of detention and other reprisals makes it increasingly impossible to conduct due diligence. The risk of complicity in forced labor is high for any company importing goods from the XUAR or those partnering with companies in the region.

The report charges that Uyghur workers “are often paid well below minimum wage. In some cases they are not paid at all,” conditions that the report concludes may meet the international legal definition of “crimes against humanity.”

Brownback notes that the solution to the crisis is easy to identify but hard to compel in a country with the power, wealth, and international influence of China. “Free prisoners from the camps, let all religions practice their faith freely, open the doors to Western journalists, NGOs, and the State Department to investigate the allegations,” i.e., freedom.

Some may shrug their shoulders at all of this in the belief that remedying human rights abuses of the kind being inflicted against Uyghurs thousands of miles away are the responsibilities of national governments, the United Nations, and nonprofit NGOs. Those organizations should act with vigor and clarity, of course. But in this particular circumstance, I believe the soft power of the private sector would have a greater chance of ameliorating Uyghur suffering more effectively and with greater alacrity than often sclerotic efforts at international diplomacy.

Consider: Western companies profit tremendously from the inexpensive manufacturing paradigm offered by China. That being so, they also have the moral and legal responsibility to ensure that labor practices from which they benefit do not violate internationally mandated human rights standards. Moreover, the private sector may have greater influence on these matters than governments and international organizations. After all, China is dependent on them too, if only to maintain the country’s improving standards of living that contributes significantly to social stability. China’s need is real and gives these private companies clout — if they choose to deploy it.

It’s not as if the private sector doesn’t regularly flex its considerable fiscal muscles against social policies with which company executives disagree. Remember when North Carolina passed a “bathroom law” requiring people to use the public restroom of their biological sex? Some of our largest corporations boycotted the state. Ditto when Indiana passed a Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Corporate America all but promised to withdraw from the Hoosier State because of the supposed bigotry the law would allow against the LGBT community, a threat in which Apple — which is hip-deep in China — vocally participated. These actions by the business community were successful in forcing both states to moderate their policies.

Whatever one thinks of those statutes, they are nothing compared to the “Fourth Reich” brutality mounted by China against the Uyghurs and other minority religions, actions such as forced organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners and social excommunication of Christians. If companies doing business in China focused their energies on ensuring that they do not participate and/or benefit from these atrocities, much good could be done for the suffering victims of Chinese oppression.

Brownback agrees that the private sector could significantly contribute to mitigating Uyghurs’ suffering. “China is being exposed now for oppressive practices that have been going on for years,” he told me. “If the private sector told China’s business and government leaders that it was not going to accept products manufactured or supplied with forced labor, it would have a huge impact.”

How do we induce companies doing business with China to do that? The congressional study suggests several cogent actions, such as the administration “issuing a comprehensive import ban on all goods produced, wholly or in part, in the XUAR.” But how likely is that to happen with President Trump so focused on the next phase of trade negotiations with China? I am not optimistic.

But why wait for the administration to engage more muscularly than heretofore? Congress could immediately administer some proverbial sunshine disinfectant by inviting CEOs of corporations suspected of benefiting from forced/slave labor in China to testify before committees and detail their companies’ efforts to prevent directly or indirectly participating in quasi-slavery. That would get the moguls’ attention — and that of the tyranny — without a law being passed or a regulation being promulgated.

As the president likes to say, what have we got to lose? The lives and liberty of helpless Uyghurs await our moral clarity.

Punishing China - The American Spectator,"All available evidence points to the conclusion that the COVID-19 virus originated in a Chinese laboratory in the city of Wuhan. Whether it was created as a biological weapon or was the natural evolution of other viruses being studied in the lab, it’s apparent that through negligence of those involved in the research, the virus was released into Wuhan and then spread around the world.

Even in the most favorable light, the pandemic is a direct result of the Chinese government’s intentional acts or gross negligence.

The staggering toll the pandemic has taken — so far, 2.2 million cases of infection, more than 150,000 deaths, and tens of trillions of dollars’ damage to nations’ economies — isn’t the end of the story. There will almost certainly be more rounds of infections and deaths before a vaccine and effective treatments are devised.

An increasing number of politicians and pundits are demanding that China somehow be held accountable and punished in some manner for its actions causing the COVID-19 pandemic. To have China recompense the world for those actions would be a just result. But how that can be required of China — and whether it can be done at all — is very much in doubt.

In dealing with less powerful nations, such as Iraq, the remedies for a nation’s severe misconduct can be international — UN economic or military sanctions — or similar responses taken by individual nations or groups of nations.

The UN — which has taken positive actions so few in number they can be counted on the fingers of one hand — isn’t going to impose international sanctions on China, nor will any of the UN’s various organs and agencies, for one simple reason. China is one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and thus has a veto of any UN action, ranging from economic sanctions down to mild resolutions of concern. There is no doubt that China would veto any move, by the U.S. or any other nation, to impose any sanction or even a mild rebuke.

China would also quash any action by any UN organization, be it the International Court of Justice (ICJ) or the UN Human Rights Council.

The ICJ theoretically has jurisdiction over such matters, but, like all other UN agencies, it’s a political joke. One of its pending cases is a suit brought by the Palestinians against the U.S. over Trump’s relocation of the U.S. embassy to Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Just as we should and will ignore any ICJ decision against us, so would China in any case about the pandemic.

President Trump could attempt to rally a few other nations to impose economic sanctions on China. Were he to do so, China would threaten us — and our prospective partners in sanctions — with its own economic sanctions. The fear of Chinese retaliation would leave us without any partners in attempting to sanction China.

Trump’s first-round trade agreement with China, under which it is supposed to purchase billions of dollars’ worth of food from U.S. farmers, would be the first casualty.

So much for international measures against China. Whatever actions we take, China will retaliate against them. We should be prepared for that and, to the extent possible, devise our actions to minimize the damage China will cause us in retaliation.

There are several actions we have to take immediately to at least prevent further Chinese leverage over our economy. For example, the Thrift Savings Plan (a retirement system for federal employees) reportedly plans to invest a significant portion of its funds — in excess of 11 percent — in Chinese firms. That planned investment should be canceled forthwith.

U.S. government aid and grants — one previously went to the same Wuhan lab that the virus emanated from — should also be canceled immediately.

Those are short-term actions. In the medium term — meaning before the year is out — there is much more to do.

The pandemic has led to disclosure of the fact that the United States is dependent on Chinese production of many commonly used medicines and medical equipment. China, highly sensitive to any criticism by the U.S., has reportedly imposed new trade restrictions on those items, preventing them from being shipped to the U.S.

U.S. companies producing medical supplies in China should be compelled by tax penalties to move their production back to the United States. Tax incentives should also be enacted to assist in the move. A carrot-and-stick approach should be enough to achieve the goal of making us independent of Chinese medical supplies.

Trump hasn’t yet proposed such tax incentives and penalties. It is highly unlikely that the Democratic House will pass any such legislation simply because Trump would propose it. The House Democrats won’t propose any such actions themselves.

China has been stealing hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of American intellectual property — ranging from military secrets to research done by American companies — every year for decades. We are dedicating billions every year to computer security to prevent those thefts, but that hasn’t stopped them.

U.S. companies seeking to do business in China have been required by the Chinese to share their technologies. That must be stopped by legislation. Nothing short of that will even slow China’s theft of our secrets. Lawsuits against Chinese companies or the Chinese government will have no effect except to publicize, in a small way that the media will ignore, China’s malfeasance.

Foreign governments are immune from suits in U.S. courts under the sovereign immunity doctrine. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ariz.) and Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) have introduced legislation to amend the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to allow U.S. citizens to sue China in federal court for damages sustained from the COVID-19 pandemic.

That bill, if passed, would be beneficial in only one sense. It would put the United States on record as recognizing China’s responsibility for the pandemic. We have done far too little to counter China’s massive disinformation campaign denying responsibility for the pandemic. Passage of this legislation would be a beginning of a response.

There is an inapposite precedent for such lawsuits. Victims of Iranian terrorism were permitted to sue Iran for the damages they sustained by virtue of several Iranian actions ranging from the 1983 Marine Barracks Bombing in Beirut to the seizure of 52 U.S. personnel in the Tehran embassy in 1979.

That precedent is inapposite because Iran had at least $2 billion of funds that had been seized by the U.S. after the 1979 Iranian revolution against which judgments could be levied. The Supreme Court has allowed those suits to continue, but Iran, predictably, refuses to pay the $53 billion in judgments against it beyond the $2 billion held.

It is also inapposite because Chinese funds are not held by the U.S. government to pay judgments and because Chinese investments in the U.S. are not provably investments by the Chinese government.

There are very substantial Chinese-owned properties in the U.S., including the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York City (bought for $2 billion in 2014 by the Anabang Insurance Group), AMC, the largest chain of movie theaters in America (bought for $2.6 billion in 2012 by the Wanda Group), and Smithfield Foods (bought for $7.1 billion in 2013 by the WH Group). But they are immune from levies for damages in lawsuits against China because the Chinese government’s ownership of these assets cannot be proven.

Proving that those assets are owned by the Chinese government will be virtually impossible because the “discovery” of evidence, the principal tool of litigation in the U.S., will be stonewalled by the Chinese.

The same is true for discovery of the most important facts demonstrating Chinese actions that caused the pandemic. The sine qua non of liability is responsibility. The assertion that the COVID-19 virus originated in a Chinese laboratory in the city of Wuhan is no longer in doubt. But proving the origin in court — and China’s negligence or intent in creating the pandemic — is another matter.

Courts cannot take media stories as evidence. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that we were trying to gain access to the Wuhan lab, which the Chinese will either deny outright or after a cleanup of the lab — and destruction of its relevant records — before U.S. inspectors can examine anything. They will also instruct — on pain of imprisonment or death — all of the Wuhan lab scientists and staff to not admit anything to us. That assumes we can obtain access to them, which is inconceivable.

There are sanctions for failing to answer discovery in federal court. But the Chinese don’t care. Without documents and/or witness testimony from responsible Chinese, the lawsuits proposed by Messrs. Cotton and Crenshaw will fail.

In sum, China is not going to pay anyone for its negligence and intentional actions in causing the pandemic. But that’s not the end of the story.

President Trump has failed to effectively counter China’s massive disinformation campaign that has denied its responsibility for the pandemic, claimed the source of the virus is the United States, and claimed leadership in fighting the virus. The best he’s done so far is to say that if the Chinese were “knowingly responsible” for the pandemic they should be liable for the damage it has caused.

That’s not nearly good enough. The president — as well as his COVID-19 task force and other government leaders — should be blasting China every day for what it has done and deriding its claims of global leadership. No one outside China should go to bed at night without having heard the truth about China’s responsibility for the pandemic.",https://spectator.org/chinas-securities/,2020-04-20
Red China Never Went Away - The American Spectator,"Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has again taken to the pages of Foreign Affairs to warn the West that President Xi Jinping has brought back Marxism to China. Rudd’s article, “The Return of Red China,” contends that Xi at the 20th Party Congress “administered the last rites to Deng [Xiaoping]’s reformist era.” With all due respect to Rudd, “Red China” never went away.

Rudd, as Australia’s prime minister from 2007 to 2010 (and for a brief period in 2013), pursued engagement with China. Perhaps his best-remembered foreign-policy speech as prime minister was on April 9, 2008, at Peking University, which he delivered in Mandarin. Rudd’s speech came during a four-day visit to China where he met with Chinese President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao.

Rudd praised China’s “reform and open up” policy change since the 1970s, which he described as the start of China’s “re-connection with the world.” “The world began to see China … in new ways,” Rudd said. He praised China’s economic development and “social transformation,” which he described as “unprecedented in human history.” He anticipated Australian–Chinese partnerships to deal with “climate change.” He predicted that the students at Peking University “will see China’s full integration into global society, the global economy and the overall global order.” He welcomed China to full participation in the “global rules-based order” and looked forward “to China making active contributions to the enhancement of that order in the future.” China, he predicted, will become a “responsible stakeholder” in the “rules-based order.” China Daily characterized Rudd’s speech as “turn[ing] on the charm,” and the speech was widely applauded.

Rudd also served as minister for foreign affairs from 2010 to 2012, and he was described as an “advocate for an expanded and diversified Australia–China economic relationship.” Rudd was attacked as a “Manchurian candidate” by political opponents who questioned his friendship with a Chinese businessman and donor to Australia’s Labor Party. After Xi came to power in China, however, Rudd turned more hawkish.

Rudd’s current Foreign Affairs article reflects that new hawkishness, but it neglects the continuity of the worldview of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leaders from the 1980s to 2012, which historian and China expert Frank Dikötter details in his new book China After Mao: The Rise of a Superpower. Dikötter shows that every post-Mao Chinese leader remained committed to Marxism-Leninism, despite public pronouncements of “reform” and “openness.”

Rudd claims that Xi has a “Manichaean worldview, pitting China’s blend of Confucian and Marxist-Leninist values against the liberal democracy and liberal internationalism of the West.” Rudd calls this a “broad ideological shift,” a “Marxist economic turn,” and accuses Xi of “reproducing parts of the Maoist playbook.” But, as Dikötter reveals in his book, it was the “reformer” Deng who set down the four cardinal principles of the CCP: “We must keep to the socialist road. We must uphold the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must uphold the leadership of the Communist Party. We must uphold Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.” Deng’s main preoccupation, Dikötter writes, was ideology, not the economy. Deng and his successors launched a “renewed effort to suppress anything that smacked of ‘bourgeois liberalism.’” (READ MORE from Francis P. Sempa: Democrats Refuse to Learn From the Failure of Engagement With China)

Any doubt as to the ideological and political priorities of the CCP should have been shattered by the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 and the subsequent crackdowns against protest throughout China. Dikötter describes Jiang Zemin, who served as general secretary of the Communist Party from 1989 to 2002, and also as chairman of the Central Military Commission and president of China, as a “staunch Marxist-Leninist.” To grow the Chinese economy, Jiang promoted an approach of “capitalist tools in socialist hands.” So-called “private” enterprises in China were in reality state-owned or state-controlled companies that did the bidding not of shareholders but of the CCP. Party cells were established in businesses whose job was to “unite, educate, and guide the work of ‘private entrepreneurs’” to serve the CCP.

The primacy of Marxism-Leninism continued under Hu and Wen, Dikötter writes, who turned over to Xi “a thoroughly entrenched dictatorship with a sprawling security apparatus and the world’s most sophisticated surveillance system.” And Dikötter notes that all this time “respected politicians” were announcing “the imminent arrival of political reform.” One of those “respected politicians” was Rudd. But he was not alone.

By claiming in his Foreign Affairs article that Xi brought back Marxism-Leninism to China, Rudd lets himself and the many other Western engagers off the hook. He and other Western political leaders misread China’s post-Mao worldview. It has cost us dearly.",https://spectator.org/chinas-security-blanket/,2022-11-11
Red China Persecutes Tennis Star - The American Spectator,"In early November, the Chinese (PRC) tennis star Peng Shuai wrote on her blog that she had been aggressed in 2018 by a Communist Party boss and vice-premier, Zhang Gaoli, who made her his concubine. The blog post, on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, was removed in less time than it takes to play a set, 20 minutes.

Peng’s glory days as an athlete were in the mid-teens, when she was the first Chinese tennis player to reach a no. 1 ranking; hers was in doubles. In that format she won Wimbledon 2013 and Roland-Garros 2014, partnering with the Taiwan (Free China) player Hsieh Su-wei (at a time when the Chicoms were offering Hsieh big bucks to defect to their side); Peng was also strong in singles, ranked no. 14.

Peng has not been seen in public or heard from since her blog was censured.

A transparently faked message that she is well, at home and resting, was put out on a Communist-controlled social media platform over her signature, but it has gained no credibility.

Peng’s broadcast was, it seems, the last cry of a still-born Chinese me-too movement, the authorities having squashed the efforts by Chinese women to speak out about rape and abuse in their country, especially when they concern the ruling class. Peng has been effectively “disappeared” and communist Chinese authorities refuse to answer questions about her. Imprisoned? House arrest? Tortured and brainwashed?

The tennis establishment reacted with swift expressions of alarm and dismay, denouncing the Chinese communist authorities for hiding the affair. The players’ associations, WTA and ATP, joined by the voices of many players, among them Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, Andy Murray, and Novak Djokovic, have called for removing mainland Chinese tournaments from their circuits.

By contrast, with the winter Olympics scheduled for next February, the International Olympic Committee has stayed quiet on Peng.

So has the NBA, as expected: the basketball establishment has been at best ambivalent and at worst craven in its response to communist tyranny. Coaches and players have been rebuked and censored for calling attention to Beijing’s brutal repression of democrats in Hong Kong, the slave labor practices from which such companies as Nike and Apple benefit, the persecution of minority groups like the Uighurs, religious believers (notably Christians), and more.

The Biden administration, after several weeks, made a pro-forma request by the White House spokesman that the communist authorities come clean about Peng’s whereabouts.

The tactical question when reacting to gross human rights violations is: will it work? Decades ago, the tennis circuit boycotted South Africa to signal its disapproval of apartheid, but Arthur Ashe, who had suffered from Jim Crow tennis as a junior and risen to the no. 1 ranking in U.S. tennis, insisted on playing there. Criticized for this at the time, in historical perspective his gesture is viewed as contributing to the wearing down of apartheid.

The Biden administration might be wise to reconsider its position in a not unrelated matter, which is the “Summit for Democracy” planned for December 9-10. Obviously, conferences on governance are different from athletic competitions. For one thing, they draw less interest. President Biden mentioned the summit in his first major address last February, and everyone, including he, apparently forgot about it until last week, when a list of invitees was released, with the caveat that it was only a draft. Nothing has been heard yet on how much of the virtual meeting, managed by State Department and White House officials, will be accessible to the public.

The leaking of the tentative list, however, moved the media’s interest, to the degree there was any, from the substance of the thing toward a game of who’s-in-who’s-out, like in a high school hallway before a big dance. It seems to have occurred to no one this might be an opportunity for the administration to go on a war of ideas offensive. Instead of taking, as may be feared, an apologetic approach to the shortcomings of democracy (especially in America), a robust and confident U.S. government would argue that democracy is a means to an end — freedom — which governments are organized to protect.

One need not partake of the catastrophism that views the U.S. today as threatened with the loss of our liberties to recognize the issue is always of concern. Freedom is always only a generation away from being lost, Ronald Reagan famously said, and he surely was not the first American president to voice this worry.

To many on the conservative side, the current occupant of the White House is off to a weak start as a guardian of freedom. He could, however, play a bit of catch-up at his democracy sit-down. Specifically, he could invite Red China. Get the reds in the meeting and then put it to them: Free Peng!

The shortsighted idea that only democratic regimes should be invited to a meeting on democracy and that rogue or evil regimes can be shown up simply by not inviting them, has a petulant feel. Are we talking about key political ideas and issues or who controls the guest list? Many in the State Department and White House undoubtedly would prefer to keep Taiwan out, surely they bristle at the thought of Hungary or Poland being in.

These are countries that know what if feels like to be in mortal danger. Should Poland be off the list because its government believes in defending its borders, or does this go against “democracy” as defined today in Washington’s power places?

But would not the purpose of a meeting for and about democracy be advanced by clear and graphic contrasts between freedom and tyranny? Consider the educational value of having Red China there and asking its party stooges to account for Peng and explain why it is threatening little Taiwan (and Australia, e tutti) because they are not worshipping a supreme helmsman nor implanting electronic chips in kids’s heads, nor, come to think of it, testing biological warfare on their own people and the whole world.

In the same vein, why should Cuba be disinvited? The regime’s reps should be asked why the singers of the hit Patria y Vida are in jail. The song, racing around Latin America like an anthem of liberty, should be the theme music of the conference.

Unfortunately, there is reason to doubt whether raising such questions can do more than demonstrate — again — that American foreign policy lacks the sense of purpose shown when Franklin Roosevelt boldly went to sea to meet Winston Churchill “somewhere in the Atlantic” and draft the freedom manifesto known as the Atlantic Charter.

Still, one of the virtues of free societies is that there is always room to correct errors. On December 9, President Biden could, in welcoming the attendees to his summit, invite them to reflect on some words of Abraham Lincoln, pronounced on another, far bleaker, December day.

We — even we here — hold the power, and bear the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free — honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth.

He might do well to reflect on them too.",https://spectator.org/chinas-share-of-ukraine/,2021-11-21
"Reject China, Inc. — Not Trading With It - The American Spectator","In its just-released annual report on China’s WTO compliance, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said that China has failed to follow “market-oriented principles” and instead pursued a “state-led, non-market approach to the economy and trade.”

Based on a similar complaint about China, President Donald Trump demanded that the Chinese government increase buying agricultural, industrial, and energy products from America in what is known as the Phase 1 trade agreement of January 2020, which the Chinese government is failing to live up to.

While fighting back on China’s unfair trade practices is a good start, I want to point out the irony in the U.S. demanding that the Chinese government buy products. Obviously, being a free market economy, the U.S.’s government is in no position to buy huge quantities of grains, oil, or consumer products from China or anywhere — only private firms and consumers can buy them. The very complaint the U.S. has against the Chinese government is that it acts like a giant firm. And yet, the trade deal further endorses the role of the Chinese government as a corporation.

This shows that although U.S. policymakers recognize the threat posed by China, their understanding of the threat is deficient, and their policies on China are conflicting. For example, the Biden administration calls the China model a “state-centered economic system,” implying that we should support private firms in China. As I will show, this is wrong and dangerous.

The CCP does not ban private businesses as Biden’s “state-centered economy” label implies; the CCP owns China. Here is the evidence.

The right to form a company is owned by the CCP. If it does not like someone, this person cannot start a business. The CCP also owns the right to name a company. The words “China,” “Chinese,” and “National” are monopolized by the CCP. The government has direct access to the bank account of firms and can establish its branch in firms.

The CCP owns the stock market. Through “window guidance,” the party instructs private stock brokerage firms to sell if the market is too hot and to buy if it is too weak.

Recently the CCP has increasingly manifested its ownership over many industries, including hi-tech, tutoring, delivery, entertaining, gaming, and real estate. Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba and fintech giant Ant Group, made unflattering comments about the government, and the CCP stopped Ant Group’s IPO. The U.S. IPO of ride-sharing giant DiDi displeased the CCP, and the CCP ordered it to delist. De jure, Ma has the right to criticize the government, and DiDi has the freedom to list in the U.S. But de facto, the owner of these firms is the CCP. And the CCP must remind them who the owner is from time to time.

This de facto ownership by the CCP applies to all firms in China. State-owned firms are business units of the party-state; firms with close ties with the CCP, such as the hi-tech giant Huawei, are the CCP’s subsidiaries; private firms, such as Ant Group and DiDi, are joint ventures with the CCP, with the party having the control right; foreign firms must have a good relationship with the CCP to be there. While having more freedoms, they operate under the auspices and are the franchisees of the CCP. The closer a firm is to the CCP, the more privileges and fewer freedoms it has, and the more obligated it is to fulfill the party’s orders.

People in China cannot freely choose where to live. Without the government’s approval, they cannot go to school, work, or purchase an apartment. Rural people who live in a city without the government’s permission are illegal immigrants in China. Exchanging foreign currencies is tightly controlled, too. The yuan people hold is more like internally circulating coupons. All these make people more like employees of the CCP rather than citizens.

Living, working, and doing business in China are not rights, but privileges granted by the CCP. The CCP has transformed China into a giant corporation. The central committee of the party is the headquarters, the leader of the party is the CEO, and the ministries are like the functional departments of China, Inc. For example, the State Security Ministry can help China, Inc. to obtain economic intelligence, and the United Front Work Department can help China, Inc. to identify investment opportunities and recruit talent overseas.

The industrial policy of the Chinese government has become the business strategy of China, Inc. The party identifies industries deemed important, selects domestic players, shields foreign competition, obtains needed technologies, and mobilizes the resources of the entire country to develop them. The large domestic market enables the Chinese firms to quickly achieve economies of scale. Once they achieve low-cost production, they will go out to dominate the world’s market. For example, in the high-speed rail industry, China banned foreign entry and yet took technologies from Germany, France, and Japan, and produced its own trainset called the Fuxing. Now CRRC, China’s gigantic rail monopoly, is the largest rail company in the world, exporting trainsets to many countries, including the U.S. China’s dominance in electric vehicle batteries and solar panels was achieved in the same way.

China, Inc. puts the democratic countries at great disadvantages. In state-to-state affairs, the Chinese government can act swiftly without checks and balances like a firm; in firm-to-firm competitions, the Chinese firms can act like a state, relying on the government in funding and other state assistance that is forbidden in the democratic countries, such as economic espionage or hostage-taking. The success of China, Inc. relies on the tolerance of other countries. But many countries have begun to realize that China, Inc. cannot continue as it damages other countries, and thus ask the CCP to make changes toward respecting human rights, the rule of law, and fair and open markets.

Unfortunately, the CCP, Chinese firms, and people enjoy the advantage of China, Inc. and do not want to change. But they should understand that such changes would benefit not only the world, but also China, because if China keeps taking advantage of the democracies, the latter will eventually be forced to delink with China. Delinking will hurt China more than the democracies, as the latter can benefit by trading with each other. In contrast, dictatorships cannot maintain mutually beneficial trade relationships. Now China and Russia have teamed up to counter the democracies, but it is a “marriage of convenience” primarily for geopolitical and military purposes; they still heavily rely on the democracies for trade. Latest figures show China’s annual export volume to Russia was $54 billion, or 4.6 percent of what it sold to the democracies ($1.2 trillion), and Russia’s export to China was about $60 billion, or 22.6 percent of what it sent to the democracies ($266 billion). In fact, their newly drummed-up effort to forge a closer tie shows that the increasing effort to reduce the economic relationship with China by the democracies is working.

Worst of all, if a dictatorship is closed, the ruling and ruled will infight, as shown in the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Therefore, the democracies should stand firm in their demands and be ready to drastically reduce links with China.

Demanding China, Inc. change is a multistage process, and the goal is not complete delinking. In the first stage, the democracies should push the CCP to make changes, and the CCP may refuse and retaliate. In the second stage, the democracies should raise the pressure and delink further, making China increasingly isolated. Facing the prospect of internal turmoil resulting from the isolation, the CCP should make meaningful structural changes to relink China with the advanced economies. The most important structural change for the CCP is to embrace the rule of law.

Filling the Biden Vacuum: Russia and China - The American Spectator,"It’s lonely at the top, doubly so when you have the kind of power and responsibility that only an autocrat can attain. Yet Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, arguably the world’s two most powerful men (Joe Biden is barely in the running), have cultivated what appears to be a blossoming friendship.

Affection abounds. The two made pancakes together during a visit to Russia’s far east in 2018. A year later, Putin presented Xi with a chest full of ice cream on the Chinese president’s 66th birthday, shortly after Xi had bestowed Putin with the title of his “best and bosom friend.”

Yet the physical mismatch — the ponderous Xi always dwarfs his lean and hungry-looking companion — as well as the army of interpreters, dignitaries, and aides following the duo around, serve to give their public moments together a touch of surreal comedy.

Their relationship is in many ways analogous to the international situation between the countries that they rule. There, geographical and strategic mismatches abound between Russia and China, two powers that have nonetheless closed ranks against what they perceive as a common threat from the United States.

The “New Cold War” between the United States and China looks set to evolve into a more serious confrontation between the West and a Eurasian bloc. Such a Sino-Russian alliance would be perilous for the American-led order.

Indeed, even the mere existence of such an anti-American front testifies to two of Washington’s greatest policy failures in living memory. Russia, following the Soviet collapse, had ingratiated itself with the West until its skeptical turn in the 2000s. China, having opened its economy to investment and its politics to rapprochement, was meant to have developed into a liberal democracy. Both countries were, in a sense, “lost” by Washington. Could either of them be won back?

A match made in pragmatism

Recent events have brought the Russia-China friendship into relief. As of the writing of this piece, Russia has amassed a sizeable army on its border with Ukraine and is threatening to use it unless its former Soviet vassal is permanently barred from joining NATO. Earlier this month, massive anti-regime protests in Kazakhstan, a de facto client state of Russia, were swiftly crushed by Russian forces despite timid objections by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. In the east, China’s own territorial ambitions in Taiwan and its surrounding seas are well-known and a source of perpetual anxiety for world leaders.

To be clear, Russia and China are not quite World War II-era Germany and Italy, scheming to divide their neighbors between themselves. Neither country gives overt sanction to the other’s claims. China has not voiced support for Russia’s annexation of Crimea, nor does it recognize Abkhazia or South Ossetia, two self-proclaimed states that are widely considered by the international community to be Russian-occupied regions of Georgia. Russia, in turn, has not endorsed Beijing’s claims in the South China Sea.

Nonetheless, the close relations between the two assist with their respective territorial ambitions in other ways. For Russia, economic integration with China partly compensates for the pain inflicted by Western sanctions in the wake of the Russian annexation of Crimea. Most notably, China is a ravenous consumer of Russian energy. While the U.S. may seek to dampen Russia’s vital oil exports — such as by attempting to block the startup of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Europe — China is Russian oil’s biggest customer, with a 31 percent share of exports that would certainly grow if prices were to fall from sanctions. China has also served this sanctions relief role for an array of other states hostile to the West, including Venezuela and Iran, both of which sold vast quantities of oil to the manufacturing giant despite American sanctions.

Even more severe measures, such as the threat of excluding Russia from SWIFT and the global financial system, would also be a boon for China. Beijing has been seeking an opening to knock the U.S. dollar from its position as the undisputed global reserve currency. It has been preparing its own alternative system, the digital yuan, for such an occasion.

All the above may give the impression that the two countries are only close as a sort of hedge against American influence. There are, however, many other points on which Moscow and Beijing find common ground. They have emerged as the leading state skeptics of liberalism and democracy, despite Washington’s naïve prior attempts to integrate them into its global system. Materially, Russia is a resource-rich country with a middling industrial base while China is relatively resource-poor but possesses nearly a third of the world’s manufacturing output. Even if America were a non-factor, Russia and China would likely still have indispensable economic and political ties. It just so happens that Washington’s pushback has made the two believe that a more explicit partnership is necessary.

With friends like these

Despite their current arrangement, not all is rosy between the dragon and the bear. No matter how deep the friendship comes, the two powers are old expansionist empires with a storied shared history and the world’s sixth-longest land border; some friction is inevitable.

Any territorial claims that the two have on each other have, in theory, been settled: in 2004, Beijing accepted modest land concessions by Russia and ceased to claim Outer Manchuria, a massive portion of the Russian Far East that was annexed from the declining Qing Dynasty in 1860.

Despite the formal ending of claims, however, dissatisfaction and anxieties abound. Chinese ultranationalists, Han and Manchu alike, continue to agitate for the return of the ancestral Manchu homeland. And Russia, despite the Chinese government’s assurances, knows that the issue is buried but not dead. Moscow looks on warily to Heilongjiang, the Chinese border province whose population singlehandedly dwarfs the headcount of the entire Russian Far East six times over, and sees a frightening future in which demographic and economic gravity pulls the sparse east into China’s orbit.

In the meantime, territorial friction heats up elsewhere. Central Asia, long considered by Moscow to be within its exclusive sphere of influence, has seen engagement with Beijing soar as China aggressively expands its trade network westward. Both countries are also jockeying for influence in the Middle East. And both are hungrily eyeing the Arctic, which Russia sees as a golden meal ticket that is to be guarded closely and shared as little as possible, much to China’s chagrin.

Another fly in the soup, at least from China’s perspective, is the question of other relationships. Despite Russia’s awful reputation in the United States, it has managed to maintain cordial, or at the very least workable, relations with a diverse array of countries. In 2017 and 2018, U.S. policymakers and diplomats were rebuked by Germany when they attempted to dissuade their European ally from continuing the construction of the Nord Stream 2 oil pipeline from Russia. Likewise, Chinese leaders fume in private about Russia’s weapons sales to India and Vietnam, states that Beijing considers to be hostile. This cultivation of alternate potential allies gives Russia crucial leverage over the much more politically isolated China.

This hedging of bets is necessary because ultimately, Russia sees China as a potentially existential threat. Though neither country’s leaders would say so publicly, Russia is undeniably the junior partner in the relationship; its economy is roughly an order of magnitude smaller and in those areas in which it is still ahead, such as certain military technologies, its lead is eroding rapidly.

This last point is the Achilles’ heel of the partnership. It is for this reason that any Russia-China front is unlikely to evolve into a formal alliance, and unlikelier still to become a fully integrated bloc. Moscow is not about to spurn the West for being a supposed threat to its sovereignty only to become subordinate to a powerful former enemy with many territorial grievances and a growing reputation for aggressive maneuvering. Indeed, China’s ruthless pragmatism in general precludes it from establishing the kind of benevolent hegemony that the United States enjoys with its immediate neighbors.

In light of this fact, U.S. and European politicians and think tanks have begun pondering ways in which to peel off Moscow from Beijing. Some have proposed a so-called “reverse Kissinger” in reference to U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger’s strategy of rapprochement with Mao’s China in the 1970s in order to further isolate the Soviet Union. Now, it is said, Russia is the more pliable member of the duo, with more anxieties to play to and more modest ambitions to compromise with.

Of course, there are some complications with this proposed strategic pivot. By the time Kissinger had boarded his secret flight from Pakistan to Beijing in 1971, Mao’s China had spent over a decade drifting away from the Soviets, and the two had relations that were tense at best. Any similar split is only a hypothetical in the modern Russia-China relationship, and the two are currently growing closer, not further apart.

America’s foreign policy decision-makers, therefore, find themselves in the awkward position of bridging the gap between their vision of an amenable, Sinoskeptic Russia and the present reality of a hostile power that is threatening Eastern Europe.

President Joe Biden, not the most decisive man in the best of times, has struggled with this gap more than anyone else. Last week, he attracted derision from commentators in the U.S. and shock from European allies when he pondered out loud about what an appropriate response would be to a “minor incursion” by Russia into Ukraine, as supposedly in contrast to a full-fledged invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pushed back publicly, declaring on Twitter that “there are no minor incursions.”

This swift backlash is Washington’s conundrum in microcosm. More room for Russia at the table means less for America’s allies, particularly those that are most vulnerable and therefore most sensitive to any change in strategy. A more reconciliatory tone toward Russia means more tiptoeing around topics like its authoritarianism or human rights violations, weakening the liberal-democratic framework through which America engages the world.

To be fair, such compromises are conceivable and have ample historical precedent. Nixon’s reconciliation with China meant withdrawing support for Taiwan, a choice that seems questionable in retrospect, but which at the time helped to accelerate America’s victory in the Cold War.

But pursuing such a strategy would only make sense in an environment akin to the Cold War. During the 1970s, the U.S. — from its leaders to its voters — understood that it was engaged in a “twilight struggle” against the Soviet Union and communism more broadly. It was only in this context that a decades-long strategic gamble, as rapprochement with Mao certainly was, could have conceivably paid off.

Does the United States’ leadership possess that kind of conviction now? With Biden in charge, certainly not. But what about more generally? Despite talk of Cold War 2.0, many American politicians, media figures, and business leaders remain unconvinced. Without a coherent grand strategy for China, there is little chance of one for Russia.

It’s difficult to imagine “best friends” Putin and Xi texting each other in their spare time. Likewise, the Russia-China relationship will likely remain an alliance of necessity for the foreseeable future. But so long as the United States vacillates in its actions and priorities, changes tack from one short-lived administration to another, and seeks to be simultaneously “collaborative” and “adversarial” (to quote Antony Blinken), this otherwise fragile Eurasian pact may survive to define the direction of the 21st century.",https://spectator.org/chinas-two-front-ip-war/,2022-01-25
"On Russia and China, Welcome Back to the 19th Century - The American Spectator","Western statesmen better start reading or re-reading British historian A.J.P. Taylor’s classic historical work, The Struggle for Mastery in Europe, 1848-1918 (1954). The current war in Ukraine and rising tensions among great powers in the Far East should pour cold water on the notion that the world has progressed from the bad old days of the 19th century. Far too many Western statesmen and commentators share the sentiments of former Secretary of State John Kerry’s embarrassing indignant rhetorical response to Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014, when he scolded Vladimir Putin for acting like some 19th-century power. This was the same John Kerry who responded to terror attacks in France by having musician James Taylor travel to Paris to sing “You’ve Got a Friend.” Perhaps Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, hopefully, finally have opened our eyes. Welcome back to the 19th century.

In the introduction to The Struggle for Mastery in Europe, Taylor noted that Europe owed its 19th-century periods of peace to the maintenance of the balance of power, when no one state or alliance of states was strong enough “to eat up all the rest,” and “the mutual jealousy of the Great Powers … preserved even the small states, which could not have preserved themselves.”

Taylor wrote that statesmen “have not always acquiesced in the perpetual quadrille of the Balance of Power.” Instead, they “have often wished that the music would stop and that they could sit out a dance without maintaining the ceaseless watch on each other.” Sometimes, he explained, they looked to some “universal authority which would overshadow the individual states and deprive them of sovereignty.” At other times, statesmen have looked to a “universal moral law” to restrain the appetites of states. Neither has worked. It is only when the leaders of the great powers pay ceaseless attention to the balance of power that the world has enjoyed periods of relative peace.

Taylor wrote that the European balance of power “worked untrammeled in the seventy years between the fall of Metternich and its several repudiations by Lenin and [Woodrow] Wilson.” To be sure, there were smaller regional conflicts — some of which, like Prussia’s wars of German unification, affected the balance of power — but careful, prudent attention to the balance of power prevented the outbreak of a general war until 1914.

The European statesmen who populate the pages of Taylor’s book were not miracle workers or foreign policy demigods. They made mistakes and errors. Their judgments were not always sound. They suffered from misconceptions about their allies and adversaries. But they had several important things in common: a modest view of human nature, a devotion to their respective nation’s interests, an understanding of the limits of power in a multipolar world, a distrust of permanent solutions to international disputes, and a shared belief in the benefits of stability.

They included Austrian Foreign Minister Felix Schwarzenberg, whom Taylor called the “first of the ‘realists’ ” who shaped European affairs; Britain’s Lord Palmerston, who famously remarked that England had no permanent friends and enemies, only permanent interests; Prussian and later German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, whose shrewd diplomacy and geopolitical wisdom jump off the pages of Taylor’s book; British prime ministers Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Salisbury, who skillfully navigated Britain’s imperial and continental interests; and Russia’s Count Sergei Witte, who Taylor notes sought to strengthen the empire internally while preserving the continental balance. (READ MORE from Francis P. Sempa: Biden’s Colossal Misreading of Putin’s Motivations in Ukraine)

The lessons of 19th century diplomacy are relevant to today’s world crisis, yet there is little sense that the Biden administration or many European leaders grasp their significance. The world’s leaders who are daily dealing with developments in Ukraine and the Far East would benefit by studying the methods by which Palmerston, Bismarck, Disraeli, and other statesmen of that period pursued their nation’s interests while being ever mindful of the need to maintain the balance of power and preserve a general peace. One looks in vain today for leaders of the caliber of those 19th-century statesmen. And if today’s statesmen fail to avoid a broader European war and continue to lurch toward great power conflict in the Far East, as their predecessors did in the early and mid-20th century, the consequences may be catastrophic.",https://spectator.org/chinas-warning-exposes-bidens-weakness/,2022-04-06
"Russia, China Rush Through Potentially Faulty Vaccines - The American Spectator","COVID-19 vaccines are being hurried through the approval process in Russia and China despite lack of testing and potential dangers, scientists have warned. Corner-cutting has come to define the vaccine research and development process in both countries as the search for a way to stop the pandemic has become entangled with geopolitics and great power rivalry.

Two leading vaccine candidates being rolled out for emergency use, one developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute and the other by Tianjin-based CanSino Biologics, have been criticized for being potentially ineffective for large swaths of the population. Both are based on a common cold virus called adenovirus type 5, or Ad5. Because the common cold is so ubiquitous, Ad5 immunity is found in up to half of adults in the U.S. and China. This immunity could cause the bodies of subjects to attack and destroy administered vaccines, rendering them ineffective.

There are also potential side effects. The CanSino vaccine uses a particularly large amount of Ad5 and could induce fevers. There is also concern among scientists that Ad5-based vaccines may increase patient vulnerability to HIV, though this has yet to be confirmed outside of HIV-specific vaccine trials.

Neither the CanSino nor the Gamaleya effort made it through large-scale trials, which are often multi-year affairs involving thousands of participants, before rollout commenced. Indeed, China has already begun negotiations for use of its vaccine in partner countries before even efficacy at home has been established. Beijing’s motives are suspicious from a domestic health perspective: the pandemic is supposedly contained in the country, with zero officially recorded deaths from the virus since May. Its great hurry is evidently a matter of national prestige and geopolitical maneuvering.

Whoever arrives at a working vaccine first stands to control the momentum of the U.S.-China-Russia great power competition. A foreign power in control of such a resource would enjoy substantial international goodwill, and also place the American government in the embarrassing position of accepting aid (and therefore admitting the inadequacy of its own vaccine development programs such as Operation Warp Speed). And that’s assuming a willingness to share. Analysts have described a Chinese victory in the vaccine race as a “nightmare scenario” for the U.S.

No wonder Moscow and Beijing are ready to cut corners. Unfortunately for them, there is no reason to believe that such shots in the dark are likely to work. There is no extant vaccine for any kind of coronavirus — well-funded attempts to produce one for the likes of MERS and SARS have all been fruitless despite years of effort. China, for its part, has already proven to be an unreliable partner during the pandemic, selling faulty masks and tests that don’t work. An overhyped dud vaccine would do its international image no favors.",https://spectator.org/chinas-weakened-economy-impairs-challenge-us/,2020-09-01
Russia-Ukraine: China and India Could End the War - The American Spectator,"China and India are now trying to distance themselves from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine, which commenced in February of this year. This is a powerful combination of two countries that have the standing, especially in partnership, to influence the Russian president in a way no other countries have.

On Friday, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India told Putin that “today’s era is not of war.” This low-key but pointed statement came a day after Putin acknowledged that President Xi Jinping of China had “questions and concerns” about the war in Ukraine. Some members of the mainstream media are predictably reading too much into Modi’s statement, saying that he is “assailing” Putin, even though the prime minister’s statement was relatively mild and stopped well short of a condemnation.

Nonetheless, this could be interpreted as the start of a shifting of an opinion that has previously been supportive of Putin: For nearly seven months, both China and India have hesitated to join the West in its outrage against the Kremlin. Russia, as the junior partner in the Russia–China relationship, is now the leading supplier of China’s oil — about 2 million barrels per day. Further, in August, Russia was reported to be India’s third-largest source of oil, after Iraq and, by a small margin, Saudi Arabia. In June, India’s oil imports from Russia reached 950,000 barrels per day, with Russia offering discounts in recent months.

China imports more than twice as much Russian oil as India. China would appear to be in a relatively stronger position than India; oil is a global commodity and sources of supply can be restructured. The war in Ukraine is detrimental to China’s strategic interest, especially to its massive export model, which allows it to amass foreign currency reserves that it uses for its own investment and for the development of countries that subscribe to the Belt and Road Initiative. A slowing Chinese economy, disruption from its massive COVID lockdown, a distressed and overbuilt real estate sector, and fears of a global recession (as expressed earlier this week by FedEx, which may be viewed as a bellwether or “lead steer” in the world economy) do not bode well for Beijing.

India, on the other hand, is currently also dependent upon Russia for its military equipment. As I have written in The American Spectator, nearly half of such current equipment is of Russian origin, with over 2,000 of the country’s T-72 tanks dating to the Soviet era. And with a 4,000-mile border to defend against Pakistan and China, India will be reliant on Russian arms for years to come.

Extensively sanctioned by Europe and the United States, failing in capturing Kiev, and suffering what appears to be a dramatic military reversal in the Kharkiv region of northeast Ukraine, Russia is seeing its economic and military misfortunes beginning to affect public opinion within Russia, with some public officials now calling for Putin’s impeachment. Allowing further disgrace and humiliation of Putin, in spite of legitimate Ukrainian cries for revenge, is not in the world’s best interest: The events of the 20th century demonstrated that Germany’s humiliating surrender terms at the end of World War I eventually led to a cataclysm. One can speculate that the use of a tactical nuclear weapon by Putin would assure his near universal status as a pariah, but who is to know the mind of an isolated Russian strongman, who has destroyed his country’s future for many years and knows he might be going down with it?

The time has come for Xi Jinping and Modi, acting in concert, to call for a summit of the two direct combatants, plus NATO and the U.S., and themselves — and some of the former Soviet republics in Central Asia, where both Russia and China have vested interests in the oil and gas sectors. Ukraine must also be made to realize that militarily ousting Russia from all Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine is an unreasonable operational objective that could prolong the war indefinitely and increase the risk that, out of spite and desperation, a nuclear weapon could be used.

NATO and the U.S. may not be enthused about having China and India inside the tent. After nearly seven months of a high-intensity conflict, however, economic sanctions, the supply of state-of-the-art artillery and other equipment, and diplomatic initiatives have not changed Putin’s course.

It would be highly problematic for Putin to decline such an invitation from a couple of his best friends. If he did, he would be met with shrieks of execration from friend and foe alike.

Some Belated Thoughts on Obama's Trip to China - The American Spectator,"Here are some belated thoughts on President Obama’s trip to China last week.

Remember when Obama said it would be easier for him if he were President of China?

That stemmed from a New York Times article co-written by Mark Landler and Helene Cooper in March 2011 titled, “Obama Seeks a Course of Pragmatism in the Middle East”. Judging by both the title of the article and its content, it is nearly indistinguishable from the thousands of puff pieces written in the pages of The Gray Lady about the 44th President. The opening paragraph describes Obama as “the transformative historical figure”. Not a transformational historical figure mind you, but the transformational historical figure.

Yet even these puff pieces one can occasionally find kernels of revelation. In the article’s concluding paragraph, Landler and Cooper ponder how President Obama will balance idealism and pragmatism when it comes to the Middle East:

How Mr. Obama manages to do that while also balancing American interests is a question that officials acknowledge will plague this historic president for months to come. Mr. Obama has told people that it would be so much easier to be the president of China. As one official put it, “No one is scrutinizing Hu Jintao’s words in Tahrir Square.”

It would be no doubt easier for Obama to be President of China. He could throw Republicans in jail, shut down Fox News and send Jon Gruber to a re-education camp and deny he ever existed. Although personally, I think Obama would be partial to placing Gruber in front of a firing squad. If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan. Oh, how President Obama wishes no one would scrutinize his words. Not that there has been much scrutinizing of Obama’s words by the liberal press until this past summer. But from where Obama sits, one act of scrutiny is one act too many. It was Chairman Mao who said the press are “necessary handmaidens of the Party”. There can be little doubt that Obama shares these sentiments although in his case he views the press as a necessary handmaiden not to the Democratic Party. As evidenced by the mid-term elections, he could care less about the fate of his fellow Democrats. Rather, Obama views the press as a necessary handmaiden to himself.

During his visit to China last week for the APEC Summit meeting, President Obama got to at least dress the part as he donned a purple silk shirt. O.K., Vladimir Putin had to wear the thing too, but put a purple silk shirt on Obama all that is missing is a green hat with a red star and a certain little red book. While Obama didn’t quote Chairman Mao, he did quote Deng Xiaoping when he exclaimed, “Seek truth from facts.” These words ring hollow from the man who coined the phrase and the man who repeated it. The Chinese government has never told the truth about Tiananmen Square nor has President Obama told the truth about Obamacare. Lack of political transparency is a huge political advantage indeed.

Purple silk shirt or not, Obama acts more like a Chinese President than an American one. How else does one explain the secretly negotiated bilateral agreement on carbon emissions. Obama can argue all he wants that China has committed to capping their carbon emissions. But when the Chinese say they’ll cap their emissions “around 2030” they might as well say 2130. So while the Chinese can continue their emissions, Obama has committed us to reduce ours 10% beyond what we already agreed to five years ago. If Obama led China then I’d say he’d done a good job. But he’s supposed to represent our interests. Of course, it may be that in his mind, representing American interests would be offensive to China.

Obama is also careful not to offend Beijing where it concerns pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. “We don’t expect China to follow an American model in every instance, but we’re going to continue to have concerns about human rights,” said Obama, “Obviously, the situation between China and Hong Kong is historically complicated and is in the process of transition.” I cannot help but think that Obama’s outlook would be a lot different if the protesters in Hong Kong wore kafiehs and if Chinese President Xi Jinping converted to Judaism and changed his name to Netanyahu.

Needless to say, Obama is also in simpatico with China where it concerns Tibet. This, of course, should come as no surprise considering when The Dalai Lama visits Obama he has to leave the White House by a side door and walk past piles of garbage. Like the protesters in Hong Kong, Tibetans don’t blow themselves up on buses nor do they ram their cars into strollers carrying American infant girls. If they did, I suspect their aims and objectives would be a much bigger priority for Obama.

Yet perhaps the most dubious thing Obama did in China was to announce his administration’s net neutrality policy. Announcing America’s new policy on the Internet in China is akin to Obama announcing our policy on women’s rights in Iran. What we have here is yet another case of bad optics. Or in this case bad fiber optics.

Well, President Obama is back on American soil where he is expected to take executive action on immigration policy this week. When he makes this announcement will he be wearing the purple silk shirt underneath his suit?",https://spectator.org/chinas-wolf-warriors-afraid-of-free-speech-information-chinese-communist-party/,2014-11-17
More Trouble in the South China Sea - The American Spectator,"On Saturday, the U.S. Navy deployed two aircraft carriers from the Philippines to the South China Sea to engage in dual-carrier exercises. This marks the first time that the United States has conducted military exercises in the region since 2014.

The move comes after China staged exercises in the region starting July 1, blocking maritime trade routes in the vicinity of the engagements.

China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian swiftly condemned America’s exercises. “It is completely out of ulterior motives that the US flexes its muscles by purposely sending a powerful military force to the relevant waters for large-scale exercises.” he said during a July 6 press conference. “The U.S. intends to drive a wedge between regional countries, promote militarization of the South China Sea and undermine peace and stability in the region”.

In recent years, China has been seeking to expand its sovereignty to the strategically important region. As early as 2015, the Chinese government began building islands in the South China Sea, building airstrips and military installations to support its claims of sovereignty over the sea.

Chinese expansion has antagonized neighboring countries who claim portions of the region, like Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. They rely upon the fisheries, oil reserves, and trade traffic of the sea to support their economies. There is reasonable suspicion that China may leverage its control of regional maritime traffic and natural resources to apply economic and political pressure, effectively limiting their economic power.

The importance of the South China Sea to American economic interests cannot be underestimated. In 2016, $3.37 trillion in exports passed through the region. Approximately one-third of global shipping volume is carried through the South China Sea. While only 14 percent of American maritime trade passes through the region, that number is much higher for our trading partners and allies in the South Pacific.

The South China Sea is also home to an abundance of highly valuable natural resources. Over half of the world’s fishing vessels are in the region, providing food millions and constituting a large portion of local economic output. Additionally, the sea is estimated to contain 11 billion barrels of oil reserves and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. If China is able to assert sovereignty over the area, it will be able to gain drilling rights to the extensive energy reserves underneath the sea’s waters.

Gaining access to the South China Sea’s energy resources is of the utmost importance to Chinese interests. China is the world’s top energy importer, relying on nations in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to supply the vast majority of its energy resources. Energy independence would grant China even more global economic power than it already has, furthering its Asian imperial aspirations.

The American military exercises in the South China Sea are an escalation of years-long conflict over the area’s strategic shipping lanes and natural resources. If America seeks to remain an economic player in Asia and limit Chinese economic imperialism, we must stand with our Asian allies to ensure that the region remains free and open for global trade.",https://spectator.org/chinas-zero-tolerance-covid-policy-is-to-protect-one-man/,2020-07-10
Speed-Lacing the South China Sea - The American Spectator,"C hina under President Xi is finding it easy to give the U.S. under President Obama a swift boot in the rear.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has succeeded in gaining more power than any Chinese leader has had since that nation suffered the upheavals of the 1970s. His success in doing so is attributable to Barack Obama and Sun Tzu.

To say that eight years of Obama’s — and Hillary Clinton’s — foreign policy has left power vacuums around the world is a rather important cliché. China, under Xi, is one of the two powers most eager to fill them, the other being Putin’s Russia. Putin is more impatient than Xi, seizing the Crimea and a good chunk of Ukraine, venturing into Syria, in partnership with Iran, to ensure the survival of Assad’s terrorist regime.

Xi is more patient, clearly more successful and less eager to show off before the news cameras. He’s satisfied with building China’s enormous military to achieve greater capabilities and to install the ability to speed-lace the South China Sea. As Sun Tzu wrote about 2300 years ago, the greatest general is he who can win the battle without fighting. That’s the strategy behind Xi’s ability to fill the vacuum left by Obama.

Good hiking boots replace eyelets with rounded hooks which laces can be looped around to put the boots on and get going much faster than the wearer could otherwise. By building miniature military bases around a dominant quadrangle in the South China Sea, on territory that’s not China’s but is also claimed by a variety of nations, Xi is putting in the rounded hooks that will soon enable China to lace up and control that sea.

Grab a map and take a look. Scarborough Shoal is less than 200 miles from Manila. The Chinese are planning to build a base there, probably within the next two years. That would put Chinese aircraft in easy range of whatever American forces may return to the Philippines, both at the former Clarke Air Base (or what’s left of it) and the former naval base at Subic Bay.

If you go south from there to the Spratly Islands, you’ll find the second point on the triangle. According to the Pentagon’s recent report on Chinese Military Power, China has built more than 3,200 acres of new space on and near the Spratlys over the past two years. If Chinese aircraft and ships aren’t already stationed there, they soon will be.

From the Spratlys, trace a line up to Woody Island, in the Paracel Islands about 200 miles southeast of Vietnam. Woody Island already sports a large Chinese base at which fighter aircraft are stationed.

Northeast of Woody Island are the Senkakus, close to the Japanese island of Okinawa. China hasn’t built anything there — yet — but is planning to move oil drilling equipment there soon to tap the large undersea oil field. Chinese patrol boats often approach the Senkakus to enforce China’s claim to those otherwise worthless rocks.

If you deface your map by drawing these lines, you have to conclude that the Chinese quadrangle could dominate the South China Sea. But you’d be wrong: these mini-bases, unless they are grown huge and have strategic forces — long-range missiles and aircraft — based on them, they are only the beginning. With enlargement of those bases, and deploying significant assets to them, China could easily dominate the South China Sea and prevent any ships it chose from transiting those waters.

As Business Insider reported, “The oil transported through the Malacca Strait from the Indian Ocean, en route to East Asia through the South China Sea, is triple the amount that passes through the Suez Canal and fifteen times the amount that transits the Panama Canal.” China, Japan and South Korea are dependent on that oil supply. By controlling that oil flow, China can control those nations.

The Pentagon’s report describes the Chinese military buildup in terms that parallel China’s assertions of territorial rights around the South China Sea. No one knows how large the Chinese military budget is (other than the Chinese government), but China already has the largest navy in Asia, including 300 surface ships that will soon be paralleled by a submarine fleet that includes some 78 ballistic missile subs.

And, of course, China is continuing to build its cyberwar capabilities (which have, for more than a decade, surpassed ours) and its anti-satellite weapons arsenal. It knows that our military relies so heavily on secure communication, navigation and intelligence from our satellites that crippling even a few key satellites will cripple our ability military strategies.

Last week, after another of the commonplace incidents when Chinese (or Russian) aircraft intercept U.S. surveillance flights over international waters, China’s foreign ministry spokesman demanded that the United States immediately cease reconnaissance flights near the Chinese bases built and being built in contested areas of the South China Sea.

It’s always unclear what Obama will do in the face of these threats and demands. He landed in Vietnam yesterday and will proceed to Japan to visit Hiroshima. Obama won’t clarify anything. It’s just a matter of how much more confusion he spreads.

The Philippines — like our other allies — know that neither he nor Clinton can be relied on to defend them. In February, while running for the Philippine presidency, Rodrigo Duterte said, “America would never die for us.” He added, “If America cared, it would have sent its aircraft carriers and missile frigates the moment China started reclaiming land in contested territory, but no such thing happened.” Duterte has been elected, but nothing else has changed.

So what do we do? It’s fun for pundits to castigate Trump when he says that maybe South Korea and Japan should have nuclear weapons to defend themselves. But their point is valid. To allow — or enable — those nations to so arm themselves is another sort of isolationism. For America to abandon them, as Obama has, increases the probability that they will have to obtain nuclear weapons. Trump’s answer would decrease (and probably nullify) America’s influence over when and how such weapons could be used.

America’s nuclear triad — ground-based and submarine-based ballistic missiles and nuclear-capable aircraft — has been neglected and reduced substantially by Obama. His policy, in his nuclear weapons deal with Iran and the preceding nuclear weapons treaty with the Russians — has had the effect of increasing the threats of war rather than reducing them. So have his feckless responses to North Korean nuclear and missile tests. In the Middle East, a nuclear arms race is well under way. Abandoning Japan and South Korea has increased the likelihood that the same sort of arms race will begin soon in Asia.

Had Obama not so reduced our military capabilities, arms, and strategy we could try to form closer alliances with Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines to neuter the Chinese threats. That may become possible if we invest the trillion or more that it would take to rebuild our navy and air force to make such alliances attractive to those nations.

Right now, such alliances are more of a risk than those nations are willing to take. It will take at least a decade — and a level of military investment that Trump, Clinton, and Congress are unwilling to make — to make Xi’s strategy unworkable. Making deals with China won’t even slow that strategy.",https://spectator.org/chinese-taiwan-advance-joseph-wu/,2016-05-23
"Squaring the Triangle: America, China, and Taiwan - The American Spectator","The U.S. and China recently held their third annual Strategic Dialogue. Limited economic and security agreements were reached. Perhaps more important, Chinese military officers joined the discussions and toured American military facilities afterwards. Relations between the two nations appear to be thawing.

However, bilateral controversies remain. Washington and Beijing disagree on much, including trade, North Korea, and maritime rights in China’s “Near Seas.” But nothing causes greater discord than the status of Taiwan, which is pressing the U.S. to sell submarines and advanced fighters.

After being detached from the mainland by Japan more than a century ago, the island of Formosa was under effective Chinese authority only during the short interregnum between the end of World War II and the Chinese Revolution. In 1949 the defeated Kuomintang Party moved the Republic of China government to Taiwan.

During the Cold War the two Chinas were bitterly at odds. As the People’s Republic of China has grown economically and moderated politically, Beijing surged past Taipei on the international stage. Even the U.S. recognizes only the PRC and formally acknowledges but one China.

However, Washington retains a quasi-embassy in Taipei, enjoys a profitable trading relationship with Taiwan, and has promised to sell the latter weapons for its defense. China’s patience with both the ROC’s separate existence and America’s arms sales has been declining. Last year Beijing ended military contacts with the U.S. in retaliation for the latter’s announcement of a $6.4 billion arms package for Taiwan.

Despite the recent uptick in U.S.-China relations, acceding to Taipei’s latest weapons request could spark Chinese retaliation. Nevertheless, Washington should help its democratic friend defend itself.

The U.S.-China relationship likely will be the world’s most important bilateral connection this century. The two nations are tightly linked economically. They share many other interests: stability in East Asia, freedom of the seas, open global economy, cooperative international institutions.

Perhaps the most important objective between the existing superpower and the potential superpower is to avoid war. When faced with two rising powers in the late 19th century, Great Britain accommodated the U.S. and confronted Germany. The result was two world wars involving the latter. Similar conflicts between the U.S. and China would be catastrophic.

In fact, there is little over which Beijing and Washington might fight. The PRC has demonstrated little interest in overseas military expansion or attacking the U.S. Economic competition between the two is growing in Asia, Africa, and even South America, but Washington’s best response would be to liberalize the American economy, not deploy the U.S. Navy.

A clash is possible in East Asia, however. Today the U.S. dominates the region, even along China’s border. But the PRC is building deterrent forces, particularly missiles and submarines capable of sinking U.S. carriers.

The Pentagon’s latest assessment of Chinese military spending speaks of “anti-access” and “area denial” capabilities. Notably, the PRC poses no threat to the American homeland. But Beijing doesn’t want the U.S. to be able to threaten its homeland. One can imagine the U.S. reaction if the Chinese navy was patrolling America’s coasts, prepared to intervene in, say, Washington’s struggle with Hawaiian secessionists.

Unfortunately for the U.S., it is far cheaper to build defensive than offensive weapons. America could bankrupt itself attempting to protect its carriers and buy additional platforms in order to maintain its ability to attack the Chinese mainland.

Nevertheless, Washington should not abandon Taiwan, as tempting as that option might be to some. Even if the U.S. does not formally recognize the ROC, the Taiwanese people have made a separate identity for themselves.

Whatever the technical, juridical issues surrounding the China-Taiwan relationship, Taiwan is entitled to decide on its own destiny. Certainly Beijing is not justified in attempting to coerce the Taiwanese people.

The best solution would be a negotiated settlement when China institutes political as well as economic reforms. The two states and peoples have been drawing steadily closer. However, the PRC will make itself politically attractive only when it accepts a free society as well as a freer economy.

In the meantime, the U.S. should permit arms sales that enable Taipei to maintain a military deterrent just as China is building a deterrent to America. Taiwan is wealthy, but falling further behind the PRC in overall economic strength. Thus, Taipei should not “try to match the PRC ship for ship, plane for plane, or missile for missile,” as the Washington-based Taiwan Policy Working Group observed. Rather, Taipei should build a small but deadly force capable of exacting a high price from any attackers.

Last year’s weapons package included Harpoon and Patriot missiles, mine-detection ships, Blackhawk helicopters, and communications equipment. Washington put off any decision on advanced F-16s and diesel submarines. But Taiwan is now pressing for the fighters and subs.

The Obama administration should say yes.

China might retaliate diplomatically. But empowering Taiwan is worth risking tenser relations with the PRC. After all, arms sales do not put America and China on a path to war. Rather, they create a disincentive for Beijing to consider war as an option, irrespective of Washington’s perceived willingness to intervene.

Moreover, while U.S.-Chinese ties may be warming, Beijing remains recalcitrant on important issues like North Korea. Indeed, the North’s “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il has made another visit to the PRC, his third in a year, presumably to beg for more aid.

Indeed, China has been expanding ties with Pyongyang even as the latter has provoked South Korea almost to war. Beijing also subsidizes other pariah regimes, such as Burma and Zimbabwe. The PRC is determined to pursue what it perceives to be its national interest. So should the U.S.

Ultimately, a reasonable accommodation between China and Taiwan is more likely if Taipei possesses the ability to defend itself. Of course, Taipei should not be purely reliant on America. Then its security will depend on the vagaries of politics in Washington as well as the state of U.S.-Chinese relations. Noted Liu Yu-jiun of Taiwan’s Fo Guang University: “If you put too much emphasis on imports and something goes sour between importer and exporter, you end up with an empty hand.”

Taiwan recently deployed its third generation of Brave Wind anti-ship missiles. Taipei also is considering production of the Hsiung Feng-2E ballistic missile. Even a small strategic deterrent would force the PRC to hesitate before threatening Taiwan.

Ultimately, Washington’s objective in helping enable Taipei to defend itself is to ensure that the latter never actually has to do so. Peace is in the interest of Taiwan, China, and the U.S. Washington should promote a good relationship with the PRC. But the U.S. should view continuing arms sales to Taipei as perhaps the best means to maintain stability and peace across the Taiwan Strait.",https://spectator.org/chinese-three-child-policy/,2011-06-01
Storm in China's Seas - The American Spectator,"The proprietary manner in which Beijing treats the South China Sea is based on strategic and economic considerations. The Chinese want to control this large waterway as a first line of defense, and enjoy exclusive access to minerals, oil and gas reserves, and fishing rights. This is in addition to the leverage it seeks over the immense shipping traffic that flows through to Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Taiwan. Obviously none of those countries supports the Chinese ambitions. Recently, however, Beijing has sought to use a bit of American history as precedent for its claims and actions.

The thesis has been put forth by Chinese academics attending international security conferences that the PRC’s official attitude toward the South China Sea is really no different than America’s past perceptions of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Apparently they are referring to the Monroe Doctrine and the 1904 Roosevelt Corollary. The former of course was aimed at ending European intervention in both North and South America, with particular attention to the large body of water separating the two continents. Teddy Roosevelt extended this policy, however, to allow the U.S. to intervene in countries south of its borders in order to protect its strategic interests.

The Chinese academics suggesting the relevance of this history do so with a straight face even though the precedent they cite is clearly a non sequitur in today’s post-colonial world. From the Chinese point of view, though, the strategic justification is just as strong for Beijing today as it was for President Theodore Roosevelt’s Washington in the beginning of the 20th century.

Recent Pentagon reports have emphasized China’s investment in increasing the size of its navy. This theme has been repeated in most defense publications along with warnings concerning China’s ambition to eventually — if not sooner — dominate the Western Pacific. This hyperbole has played right into the hands of the PLA’s political offensive that desires to inflate the Asian and American perception of Beijing’s naval growth.

The fact is that Beijing has not invested in a massive naval buildup appropriate at least to nearing equality with the U.S. Pacific Fleet, which has been the post-WW2 “protector” of that part of the world. The prowess of Communist China’s military might is always a prime subject of Chinese propaganda, but the reality is that PLAN (People’s Liberation Army’s Navy) is held back by a lack of money and talent. Naval design and engineering has played a subordinate role to ground and air force development while China’s space program has gobbled up the “best and the brightest” of the country’s scientific and technological brains.

The availability of skilled and experienced maritime workers has been limited, which has had an impact on quality control more than production numbers. At international conferences foreign analysts have noted they agree with their American counterparts that China has launched about 40 new submarines (attack and SSBN) in the last 20 years. They add, though, that it does not mean these boats are equipped with the advanced technology appropriate to modern undersea warfare.

According to reports emanating from Russian naval sources, there has been considerable debate/argument within Chinese naval commands over the priorities given to the creation of the new aircraft carrier from the old Soviet-era ship that was towed from the Black Sea. The emphasis placed on giving the PLAN one carrier relatively quickly has been a source of serious conflict within professional ranks. No one can afford to argue over the highly publicized and expensive Chinese space program.

Perhaps of even more importance is the development of a highly protected submarine repair and docking facility on Hainan capable of providing berths for 20 subs. It all sounds very impressive until one realizes that today’s missile capability is such that in wartime these pens present an interesting target rather than a safe harbor.

As large as the South China Sea is, it’s not the Pacific Ocean, and that’s where the vastly superior U.S. fleet holds sway. Nothing in the development plans of the Chinese navy indicates an ability to seriously challenge the American control of the blue water of the Pacific in the foreseeable future. The same can not be said for control of the South China Sea. The Chinese have what they think is an ace up their sleeve in that regard. China’s naval mine technology is quite advanced and a vast store of mines is available to blockade the principal channels of the waters off southeast China. The Chinese have also made public their increased number of coastal-based anti-ship missiles.

Beijing’s military aim is eventually to control the trade routes through the South China Sea as well as use that large body of water for forward defense purposes protecting the coastline of the PRC from Fuzhou to the Gulf of Tonkin. This is very old-fashioned thinking that envisions a sea borne invasion that will never occur. Still stuck in a mentality that justifies a massive land force to prevent attacks along its borders from India to Siberia, China pursues a strategy that now includes a defensive posture protecting their southeast maritime provinces.

All this would suggest a fanciful defense plan were it not based on the political need to justify the maintenance of a vastly over-indulged military. In the end, the PRC’s leadership depends on the PLA to maintain the political power of the Politburo. Turning to archaic American historical precedent may have an academic appeal, but that’s all.",https://spectator.org/chris-smith-on-joe-biden-and-chinas-one-child-policy/,2012-08-24
Support Trump or Biden? China Will Tell You - The American Spectator,"President Trump commented that Beijing “will do anything they can” to make him lose his reelection bid in November. As expected, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) denied it. The spokesperson of its foreign ministry replied that “we have said many times that the US election is an internal matter for the United States, and China is not interested in intervening.” However, as Secretary Pompeo pointed out, regarding the CCP, we must “act not on the basis of what Chinese leaders say, but how they behave.”Recently I stumbled upon something that may help us prove that, indeed, they are not only interested in the U.S. election, but also interfere with it.

A few days ago, a friend shared a couple of screenshots of a Chinese search engine searching results about the two candidates of American election: one is “Support Trump,” and the other “Support Biden.” The photos show that for “Support Trump,” the search result is “Sorry, no related results were found,” and for Biden, it showed a list of the results that were found. In other words, “Support Trump” was banned and “Support Biden” was not.

Screenshots 1 and 2, Search results for “Support Trump” (top) and “Support Biden” (bottom) by author’s friend, circa August 30, 2020

I found this very interesting. The search engine is Weibo.cn owned by Sina.com, one of the largest online portals in China, and, of course, it is closely regulated by the CCP. So, the discriminatory treatment between Trump and Biden is a clear evidence of bias by Sina.com. While we know that Sina.com, as a commercial media, has no incentive to ban postings because doing so hurts its revenue. Thus, such a policy can only come from the CCP, either through explicit decree or an informal phone call from the Department of Propaganda.

To verify these two screenshots, I visited Weibo.cn and searched for these two phrases. For “Support Trump,” yes, I found the same “no related results were found,” zero, nothing. As for “Support Biden,” I found something different from what my friend found earlier. My search result was, “According to relevant laws, regulations, and polices, the search results are not shown here.”

Screenshots 3 and 4, Search results for “Support Trump” (top) and “Support Biden” (bottom) by author, August 30, 2020

This is even more intriguing! Moments ago, “Support Biden” was permitted, but now the results of such a search, while not zero or nothing, cannot be shown. This is still different from the search result for “Support Trump,” which is a resounding null, nothing! What had happened between the searches by my friend and me? As I can only guess, I think the CCP, through digital surveillance, had quickly found people like my friend discovered the different treatments between Trump and Biden, and thus was concerned that the U.S. might use this as evidence that the CCP interferes with American election, so it ordered Sina.com to hide the search results for “Support Biden,” for the time being, anyway. But even for being banned, the treatment in each case is different: it is harsher on Trump (none) than on Biden (have results, but cannot be shown now).

What can we learn from this online fieldtrip? First, it adds to the mounting evidence that the CCP suppresses the free expression of opinion. Second, the different treatments between Trump and Biden provide evidence that the CCP is interested in and interferes with U.S. election, and third, the spokesperson of China’s foreign ministry lied, again.

China’s Threats to Taiwan Are Threats to American Prosperity - The American Spectator,"The dictatorial, repugnant, and repressive Chinese government has ended freedom in Hong Kong. Now it threatens Taiwan, the most important producer of semiconductors for American products — jeopardizing America and her prosperity.

Most American producers are suffering shortages of semiconductors, and if China prevails in its quest to take Taiwan, China will be positioned to shut down American industry by refusing to ship semiconductors to the United States. A Sino-American embargo would precipitate the shuttering of automobile, appliance, and military equipment production, the internet, and processors in virtually every product and industry.

With laser focus, China’s government strengthens its military and economy, as our federal government officials — the most mendacious and incompetent since the FDR depression — weaken American manufacturing and commerce, subvert truth, and squander time and resources on the vacuous follies of gender politics and climate change.

Green energy in California and Texas have caused blackouts and increased the cost of energy, which is imperative for a thriving economy.

The potential semiconductor crisis proves that Jean Baptiste-Say was correct in 1803 when he surmised that supply creates demand. When John Maynard Keynes reversed this truth with the specious theory that demand creates supply, it unleashed a lunacy that is manifesting itself in harsh economic reality today:

An acute American worker shortage, sponsored by federal unemployment benefits, is undermining every industry from food service to critical industrial components. Over nine million jobs are waiting to be filled.

U.S. ports, rail cars, and trucks are at full capacity. They do not have the manpower to distribute resources. As a result, supplies and critical parts are delayed for weeks on end in harbors, railway cars, and storage units.

Increased tariffs put taxes on the users, undermine free markets, drive up costs, restrict supply, and make indigenous industries weaker.

Federal spending exceeds 31 percent of the GDP, causing inflation and shortages and undermining the producers. As a result, the Producer Price Index (PPI) is up 6.6 percent in the last 12 months, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 5 percent in May. But government officials deny the data with the term “transitory inflation” — though “transitory” could mean 10 months or 10 years.

America must protect Taiwan and refocus national priorities to develop a robust economy based on investment and production, not government largesse, which undermines people’s work ethic and creates massive deficits and debt.

Freedom, truth, morality, work ethic, and market-based economics created “American exceptionalism.” So it’s time to ignore the malcontents and barbarians who are destroying our cities and refocus on the basics by respecting and embracing the contributions of hard-working producers of goods and services.",https://spectator.org/communist-chinas-meat-grinder/,2021-06-18
The Biden Administration Is Losing Ground to China - The American Spectator,"At first glance, it might appear that the U.S. is starting to score some wins in its China policy. Last week, five members of Congress visited Taiwan President Tsai Ing-Wen in a show of support, the Biden administration convinced the United Arab Emirates to halt construction of a Chinese military port in Abu Dhabi, and the Federal Communications Commission revoked China Telecom America’s Telecom Services Authority.

But on China, the Biden administration misses the forest for the trees. While the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center issued a warning to U.S. businesses recognizing that China seeks to steal U.S. technology, the report did not recommend economic decoupling with China. More disturbingly, recent developments show that the Biden administration is completely ill-equipped to address increased Chinese incursions and capabilities against Taiwan, and China’s recent game-changing improvements in its hypersonic missiles and nuclear weapons.

No Solution for Increased Chinese Mobilization Against Taiwan

The Biden administration continues to lack a policy to address China’s grey-zone warfare against Taiwan. On Sunday, China sent 27 planes into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone. China has been incessantly deploying this tactic since September 2020, with the incursions increasing in frequency and intensity. In response to China’s invasions of Taiwanese airspace (and the growing North Korea threat), Japan has increased its military budget by $6.75 billion. Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi stated Japan would “weigh the various possible scenarios that may arise to consider what options we have, as well as the preparations we must make.” Analysts believe that this marks a much more active, vocal role for Japan in defending Taiwan. But Japan lacks support from the United States as the Biden administration has been waffling on developing its own coherent policy towards Taiwan’s defense.

Experts have become increasingly dire about the feasibility of China invading Taiwan, especially starting in 2024. A recent report issued by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission stated that China currently has the capability to successfully establish an “initial landing force of 25,000 or more troops.” Chen Ming-tong, the director of Taiwan’s national-security bureau, claimed recently that according to his intelligence, China considered attacking Taiwan’s Prata Island, but ultimately decided not to go forward with the idea until at least 2024. But China’s likelihood of success in invading that small island is high. While a small contingent of Taiwanese troops is reported to be stationed there, the island is “almost impossible to defend” given that it is “so small and flat,” according to Yoshiyuki Ogasawara, a professor at the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies. Former national-security adviser Robert O’Brien also predicted that it is unlikely China would attack Taiwan before the Beijing Olympic Games. Army Gen. Mark Milley said earlier this month that China was “clearly and unambiguously” developing a capability to invade Taiwan, while also stating that “I don’t think it is likely in the near future, being defined as six, 12, maybe 24 months, that kind of window.” In March, Adm. Phil Davidson, head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, stated that China could invade Taiwan “in the next six years.”

Underestimating China’s Hypersonic Missile and Nuclear Threats

Like China’s policy and actions towards Taiwan, China’s breakthrough hypersonic missile technology seems to have similarly dumbfounded the top brass of the United States defense agencies. The Financial Times recently reported that in a test in July, China fired a missile from space mid-flight at five times the speed of sound, which shocked analysts at the Pentagon. In a recent interview, Space Force General David Thompson conceded that “the Chinese have an incredible hypersonic program,” which is “a very concerning development,” and that the United States had less developed hypersonic weapons than China or Russia. Gen. John Hyten, the outgoing vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated that this weapon could give China a surprise nuclear attack strike ability against the United States. While the U.S. has conducted only nine hypersonic tests in the past five years, China has conducted hundreds, according to Hyten. China can now attack from space, and “the United States has no dedicated, active countermeasure” to it, according to The Hill.

The American defense establishment also appears to have grossly underestimated China’s nuclear weapons potential. A Department of Defense report released in November indicates that China seeks to have 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030, which far overshoots Department of Defense estimates from last year that China has warheads “in the low 200s,” which will double by 2030. The report also states that China may have already developed a “nascent ‘nuclear triad,’” enabling it to deploy nuclear weapons by land, sea, and air. But in the midst of this, Biden has at least at one point considered a “No First Use Policy,” and is now being pressured by progressives to adopt this posture as his administration reviews the U.S.’ nuclear policy. Adopting the “No First Use Policy” would “be akin to having poker players show their cards,” according to John Rossomando of the Center for Security Policy.

As the Biden administration scores incremental wins against China and secures a joint policy to combat climate change with the country, it is fast losing ground to China in bigger picture issues regarding Taiwan and game-changing weapons. A durable, effective policy against the CCP can only come from tackling these larger issues.",https://spectator.org/congress-should-investigate-chinas-government-over-coronavirus/,2021-12-02
The Death of a China Love Affair? - The American Spectator,"I’ve found that the easiest way to shock the typical Chinese university student is to note that my first visit to China occurred in 1992, before they were born. Needless to say, it was a very different country then.

Separate trips that year brought me to Beijing, Shanghai, and a bit beyond. The country was much poorer. Far less sophisticated.

Westerners were an unusual sight. There were few tall or modern buildings. And not many Western-friendly toilets. There still was a lot of traffic, but mostly bicycles and motorbikes. The nation was great with potential, but the development road ahead looked very long.

I returned often over the years. Indeed, a couple years ago I realized that I’d traveled to the People’s Republic of China more often than to any other nation. (So long as I didn’t count transiting through Munich and Frankfurt airports as trips to Germany!) Most of my PRC visits were for academic conferences on everything from U.S.–China relations to North Korean policy to Asian economic development, but there also were journalist junkets, a couple stops on my way to Pyongyang, one transit through Beijing to another country, and even a travel-writing trip.

There have been many high points: jogging through Tiananmen Square at dawn when the Chinese flag was being raised, a visit to the Three Gorges Dam and Yangtze River boat trip, visiting Mao’s Mausoleum, exploring the Forbidden City, going to a political poster museum in Shanghai, acquiring a cheap, oversize driftwood eagle at a flea market, running along Shanghai’s Bund, boating along the fetid canals of Suzhou on my first China trip, and watching the PRC grow in size, reach, sophistication, and energy on every trip.

But most of all meeting Chinese people in all walks of life, especially students. They have been uniformly bright, inquisitive, engaging, lively, friendly, determined, and scholarly. Patriots all, they are proud of their country, unhappy with controls over their own lives, committed to enjoying life, and ready to seize opportunities their parents lacked.

While I never expected China to become America, I hoped that the Chinese people would enjoy ever-greater freedom. The consistent increase in personal autonomy was striking and rapid after the death of Mao Zedong. Responsibility for everyday actions people in America took for granted, such as choosing a job and getting married, shifted from the omniscient and omnipotent state to individuals.

So did many commercial decisions. While the resulting economy was not exactly free, it was far freer than before. That accounted for the staggering growth, most evident in cities, obviously, but also changing the rural landscape. Although the political system remained closed, life became more open and vibrant. And authoritarianism, though still very real, nevertheless was loose so long as the primacy of the Chinese Communist Party was not challenged.

Ideas at least could be discussed. People at my think tank engaged Chinese academics and other professionals and discussed the PRC’s future. While censors might quickly terminate social media debates on sensitive subjects, students were not afraid to ask — in public in front of classmates — challenging questions about both America and China. The latter’s direction remained uncertain, but its future looked solid. And that gave me hope.

Alas, any sense of optimism dissipated with President Xi Jinping’s determined quest to close the Chinese mind. It is a striking mission by someone who suffered during the Cultural Revolution, a period of political madness unleashed in a totalitarian system animated by rigid ideology and staffed by regime automatons. The result was death, torture, and prison for many. For even more Chinese the mix of party purge, civil war, and Mad Mao crusade created an intellectual vacuum, within which independent, creative, and challenging thought was impossible. At least, its expression would result in punishment as well as humiliation. Friends who lived through that period suffered in ways that I cannot understand, or even imagine.

Now the Cultural Revolution has returned. Not in form, of course. Thankfully, there are no Red Guards roaming the streets of Chinese cities, dragging hapless victims from homes and offices. Back then, however, official China was divided, since Mao was using his most rabid followers to wage a personal power struggle. In some areas hostile local officials were able to limit if not halt the resulting human depredations.

Today’s Cultural Revolution is more legal in form and appears to have CCP enforcers solidly behind it. State-directed efforts to remold and socially engineer human beings have become pervasive and, in some ways at least, more brutal than those carried out a half century ago.

There are reeducation camps in which masses of people, mostly Uyghurs but others too — the dispute over numbers only accentuates the outrage — are locked up because of who they are and what they believe, and are expected to become a new mass man holding homogenized views imposed by Beijing. Churches are being forced to remove religious imagery and expression, to be replaced with pictures of Xi, supplanting Jesus as messiah, and communist propaganda, constituting new official holy writ.

Most any expression of free thought has been punished. Party discipline has been tightened. Independent journalism has been largely eradicated. Members of the human rights bar have been dispersed and imprisoned. Internet censorship has been toughened, with harsher punishments meted out on those who post forbidden sentiments on social media. Conference invitations require national permission. Independent non-governmental organizations have been disbanded and outlawed. Unlimited one-person rule has been established.

And now the new Cultural Revolution is being exported wholesale. In Hong Kong, freedom of thought and expression are being wiped out with the application of the new “National Security Law.” Tighter controls over the media and internet seem inevitable. In time the once rambunctious and free society of Hong Kong will look like most any other Chinese city: economically vibrant but intellectually drab. Pictures of the new political messiah will proliferate as he enforces his will and closes the independent Chinese mind there as well. And if Xi gets the chance, Beijing will do the same in Taiwan.

My reaction is overwhelming sadness as much as anger. Totalitarian rule by one, with the determination to crush independent thought as well as action, is a true crime against humanity. The nature of the human person requires being allowed to learn, experience, think, understand, discuss, debate, opine, and freely apply accumulated knowledge throughout life. For rulers to use the state to force their views — conveniently shaped for their political and economic benefit — on others is an outrage, whatever the excuses offered.

Still, hope remains. Some of Xi’s efforts may backfire spectacularly. For instance, ongoing persecution ensures that tens of millions of Christians secretly hate their ostentatiously ungodly regime. Indeed, when they retrieve their hidden Bibles after the security personnel depart a church raid, believers may turn to the book of Revelation. It describes the rise of two allegorical Beasts, political systems/leaders that demanded worship, blasphemed God, and marked the people. But then evil loses — decisively and dramatically. Through this imagery Chinese Christians likely will see their own government and its eventual fall, which will reinforce their faith.

In the meantime problems will continue to bedevil the Chinese state as it attempts to extend its authority. There appears to be no answer to the demographic cliff toward which the country is heading. The one-child policy was a moral abomination and practical disaster that continues to weaken China long after its repeal.

Moreover, both Hong Kong and Taiwan demonstrate that ethnic Chinese people who live in free systems with unrestricted information and open debate overwhelmingly reject communism and demand liberty. Support for the CCP is vanishingly small among younger generations. They see Xi’s way as that of the past, not future. The PRC dictatorship can survive only so long as it starves people of information about the world around them.

Punishing inquisitive minds will hamper economic innovation. The CCP’s determination to control much of the economy and extend political influence over nominally private enterprise inevitably will do the same. Someday bad debts and property bubbles will have to be accounted for. If economic growth slows noticeably the CCP, which lacks democratic or moral legitimacy, will find its role roughly questioned by a population still waiting to enjoy the good life.

Moreover, Beijing’s abandonment of its “peaceful rise” policy has triggered second thoughts in many nations that had welcomed the PRC, especially for commercial benefit. There no longer is any doubt about what rule by Beijing means in practice. “One country, two systems” has been revealed as a contemptible fraud. Particularly noteworthy is rising fear and hostility in Australia and India for very different reasons, but which may have similar results. The international environment has become much more hostile toward an aggressively ambitious Chinese government.

Indeed, prior totalitarian episodes in history tended to end badly and often relatively quickly. While the CCP might prove resilient, control by one leader, an extreme and brutal one at that, might not. He may be simultaneously standing on the political mountaintop and at the edge of a political precipice. Mao’s blunders cost the latter his dominant party position, which is one reason why he triggered the Cultural Revolution. After his death the CCP raced to eliminate his impact though not his name.

Once Xi goes, there could be an equally swift campaign to eradicate his influence, and memory too, since he, in contrast to Mao, was not essential to the creation of the PRC. In fact, Xi’s once dominant presence could prove surprisingly ephemeral, leaving little trace, becoming a nightmare everyone desperately tries to forget.

And disappear he eventually will. Xi has created a large if disparate group of enemies. He dares not peacefully retire lest his successors do to him what he did to those before him.

Tragically, Xi risks the future of the Chinese people as well as his own. Contrary to critics of American engagement with the PRC, the opening to China should be judged a huge success. The escape of hundreds of millions of Chinese from immiserating poverty over the last four or so decades is a huge and undoubted moral good. Many friends have benefited from that change and now enjoy the advantages, economic, cultural, social, and personal, that resulted.

But the Chinese state, as presently constituted, will misuse any additional power that it gains. So long as the regime seeks to extend totalitarian controls, its strengths are a vice, not a virtue. And the West must address Beijing with that understanding.

What should the U.S. do? Adopt growth-enhancing economic policies to raise American living standards. Improve the U.S. educational system, which badly fails those in the greatest need. Elect leaders who promote domestic and international cooperation.

Avoid war — whether hot or cold, military, or economic. Stop wasting lives and money on foolish, counterproductive interventions worldwide. Don’t treat policy toward Beijing as a campaign weapon. Work with, rather than dictate to, other liberal states concerned about the PRC’s totalitarian transformation at home and increased belligerence abroad. Avoid demanding that others choose between the U.S. and China: Washington might not like the decisions made. Emphasize the responsibility of Beijing’s neighbors to work together to dissuade the PRC from attempting a violent rise. Assist them in doing and cooperating more.

Finally, play the long game. Invite the PRC to play a larger, more responsible role internationally. Increase engagement with the Chinese people. Welcome students and scholars while addressing legitimate security concerns. Promote the free flow of information into an otherwise increasingly closed land. Avoid demands for regime change, insults to China, and other rhetoric and behavior likely to inflame nationalism in a people proud of their civilization and progress. Unashamedly promote the inherent rights of the human person to life, liberty, and dignity. Emphasize that political systems might vary, but every human being remains unique and of special value that transcends any aspiring empire and emperor, irrespective of how red.

China’s emergence is not ephemeral, even though there are legitimate questions how far and fast it will continue to rise. The end of the Century of Humiliation was long overdue. So will be the eventual end of the totalitarian state being constructed today. China deserves its place in the sun, to use a cliched and much abused term. But the Chinese people deserve much more, a political system directed by, concerned about, and accountable to them.

Through it all I will continue to admire China — civilization, people, and land. There is much to love, though not the government in control today. I look forward to the day when the ruling regime that oppresses its own people finally disappears.

"The God of Plague Returns: Snail Fever, COVID-19, and China’s Emergency Disciplinary State - The American Spectator","I

It is the morning of July 1, 1958, and a bleary-eyed Chairman Mao Zedong is rising from his double bed, having passed a restless night in his official residence at the Zhongnanhai’s Library of Chrysanthemum Fragrance. The 64-year-old Great Helmsman shuffles past a row of glass-front bookshelves on his way to the large square table where he works and takes his meals, usually alone. Outside the window, in the courtyard of the former imperial gardens, ancient cypresses sway in the summer wind as the sun ascends over the Forbidden City. Now comfortably ensconced in his chair, Mao reaches for his trusty hard-tipped brush pen. Aside from being a revolutionary, a political visionary, and a sociopathic mass murderer, Mao is also something of a calligrapher, having recently begun experimenting with the so-called “wild” cursive script, and so, in an undeniably expressive hand, he begins to write:

When I read in the People’s Daily of June 30, 1958 that schistosomiasis had been wiped out in Yujiang county, thoughts thronged my mind and I could not sleep. In the warm morning breeze next day, as sunlight falls on my window, I look towards the distant southern sky and in my happiness pen the following lines …

Two poems would follow in quick succession, Farewell to the God of Plague (I) and Farewell to the God of Plague (II), both in the classical lüshi verse form with eight lines of five, six, or seven characters, and both inspired by newspaper reports of the successful public health campaign against schistosomiasis, a devastating parasitical disease prevalent in water-logged rice-growing areas. The first poem sets the scene, describing

So many green streams and blue hills, but to what avail?

This tiny creature left even Hua To powerless!

Hundreds of villages choked with weeds, men wasted away;

Thousands of homes deserted, ghosts chanted mournfully.

In these early days of the Great Leap Forward, Mao Zedong has already accomplished what even the renowned Eastern Han dynasty-era physician Hua To, China’s answer to Hippocrates or Galen, never could — he has defeated the Schistosoma japonicum worm, a loathsome parasite that had tormented Chinese peasants for more than two millennia, which to this day afflicts more than 200 million people living in rural and peri-urban areas throughout the developing world. So profound is this medical breakthrough that Mao concludes the second of his poems with the memorable lines:

We ask the God of Plague: “Where are you bound?”

Paper barges aflame and candle-light illuminate the sky.

Wen Shen, the God of Plague governing Heaven’s Ministry of Epidemics, has thus been ceremonially dispatched to the next world, no longer to trouble Mao’s increasingly fortunate subjects.

The chairman’s inspirational poems will be published and distributed far and wide, destined to rank among his best-known compositions. Fu Baoshi, a preternaturally talented landscape painter, will be so moved by them that he will pick up his own brushes, creating After Mao Zedong’s “Saying Farewell to the God of Plague (II)” (1958), a watercolor depiction of a winding column of determined peasants armed with the myriad tools of their respective trades, marching beneath red banners, traversing rivers, valleys, and forests in riotous springtime bloom, as they return to fertile paddy fields now mercifully free of blood fluke infestation. Fu Baoshi’s painting is now part of the Nanjing Museum’s permanent collection, but I can still recall encountering it when it was included in the Cleveland Museum of Art’s 2011 international loan exhibition “Chinese Art in an Age of Revolution: Fu Baoshi (1904–1965).” The picture is modest in size, roughly 34 by 50 centimeters, but is beautifully executed, and seems to stretch out towards infinity. Fu, who trained at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts in the ’30s and would go on to direct the Jiangsu Province Chinese Painting School, was possessed of unquestionable genius, but he was also an eager propagandist. After Mao Zedong’s “Saying Goodbye to the God of Plague (II),” while an artwork of the first water, is still a pictorial paean to the Great Leap Forward which, schistosomiasis eradication programs aside, would kill as many as 55 million men, women, and children through famine and violence in the years to come.

All that human suffering still largely lay stored up in the womb of time that summer day in 1958, when Mao Zedong’s reveled in his victory over schistosomiasis, his brush gliding effortlessly along the page, the morning sun shining on his capacious brow. The Chinese Communist Party chairman had good reason to exult in the performance of the public health commissars and cadres in Jiangxi’s Yujiang county. After all, schistosomiasis represented one of the God of Plague’s more sinister creations. Also known as bilharzia or snail fever, the disease is spread by the Schistosoma japonicum trematode worm, which first infects diminutive freshwater Oncomelania hupensis gastropod mollusks, then finds its way into the intestines of mammalian hosts, before emerging in manure, droppings, and nightsoil, ready to start the cycle all over again. Stricken individuals, be they of the bovine, rodent, or human variety, experience three phases of the disease: an acute stage with distinctly malarial characteristics, a chronic stage sometimes asymptomatic, sometimes causing fatigue and diarrhea, and then an agonizing late stage with its trademark massive stomach fluid retention, portal hypertension, and esophageal varices, among a profusion of other debilitating and often grotesque symptoms. Snail fever had been decimating Chinese rice-growing regions like rural Yujiang county from time immemorial, and by the mid-20th century was affecting an estimated 10 million people per annum, with a 4 percent fatality rate. In some hard-hit regions, like Qingpu outside of Shanghai, the rate of afflicted villagers ranged from 40 to an astounding 90 percent. The communist authorities, by extirpating snail fever, hoped not just to save lives, but to reclaim tens of thousands of productive hectares that had been reluctantly ceded to the teeming escargatoires of freshwater snails, and the deadly blood fluke parasites that lurked in the glistening, seemingly innocuous slime trails they left behind.

The fight against intestinal worms was also a matter of national security. As Miriam Gross noted in Farewell to the God of Plague: Chairman Mao’s Campaign to Deworm China (2016), the soldiers of the People’s Liberation Army who fought in the Chinese Civil War and the Korean War “were heavily infected with worms. Over 14,000 troops, or 38 percent of the top soldiers in China, were incapacitated due to snail fever. Additionally, about 50 percent of the troops had hookworm, 50 percent had roundworm, and 27 percent had whipworm.” Wei Wenbo, a member of the Central Committee’s leadership small group devoted to eradicating schistosomiasis, put it bluntly: “the elimination of snail fever impacts on whether our people survive or perish; it is related to the existence of our nation; to thrive or wither depends on it.” The Great Leap Forward would never succeed, and true socialism would never be realized, if China’s population was incapacitated, and its most fertile farmland rendered uninhabitable, by these endemic parasites. Officials in Jiangxi Province were confident that “socialism will bring a happy new society,” but wondered “how can we have big belly disease in it? If people are lying flat on their backs in bed, how can they be happy?” Hence we can readily grasp why Mao spent the night of June 30, 1958 restless and “thronged with thoughts.” He had already conclusively demonstrated his power over his fellow man, ruling mainland China unopposed for almost a decade, but this was different. Now he had put the God of Plague himself to flight, and even Dimǔ Niángniáng, Lady Mother Earth, could be expected to bend to his will.

Schistosoma japonicum had proved a worthy adversary, but soon Mao was ready for a new challenge, announcing the opening of the Chú Sì Hài, or the “Four Pests Campaign” against flies, mosquitoes, sparrows, and rats. Posters appeared bearing the slogan “Exterminate the four pests!” alongside an image of a blood-sucking mosquito, a blowfly, a Eurasian tree sparrow, and a brown rat all impaled kebab-like on a sword. Chinese peasants were given (nonmonetary) rewards for each rat tail they handed in, while, as Jasper Becker set forth in Hungry Ghosts: Mao’s Secret Famine (1996), they tried with varying levels of success “to kill the insects at night by setting up huge lamps in the middle of the fields so that the insects would fly around them until they dropped down dead,” but it was the “smash sparrows” campaign that was pursued with particular vigor, the better to safeguard Chinese farmers’ grain seed and fruit. More propaganda posters went up in schools and public squares, conveying messages like “Everybody must get to work to eliminate the sparrows,” “Everybody comes to beat sparrows,” and “Eliminating the last sparrow,” the latter showing a party of gun-toting peasants gathered in an eerily denuded landscape of dirt and bare-branched trees, gawking at a lone sparrow sprawled out dead in the dust. Tens of millions of birds were shot out of the sky and poisoned, millions of nests were smashed, and flocks of sparrows were harassed by townsfolk banging pots, gongs, and drums until the little birds dropped lifeless from the sky. In one infamous incident, the Beijing authorities demanded access to the Polish embassy grounds, which had become a rare avian refuge. Refused entry, the ornithophobic communist zealots instead camped outside the embassy walls, banging drums day and night until the besieged sparrows all perished of fright, and had to be disposed of, it was said, by the shovelful.

Chairman Mao’s environmental authoritarianism was clearly getting results. The trematode worm and their molluscan hosts had been brought under control, and the Chinese countryside was relieved of irksome songbirds. In his August 30, 1956, address to the Eighth National Congress, Mao had lamented how “China used to be stigmatized as a ‘decrepit empire,’ ‘the sick man of East Asia,’ a country with a backward economy and a backward culture, with no hygiene.” Now the people were free of snail fever, their grain was safe from marauding birds, the countryside was being cleansed, the economy transformed, and the Second Five Year Plan that began in 1958 was shaping up to be a veritable Great Leap Forward for the Chinese nation.

It would not take long, however, for the Four Pests Campaign to be revealed as one of the most catastrophic government interventions of all time. Murdering sparrows en masse did nothing to alleviate the suffering of the peasantry, indeed quite the opposite. Common sense began to seep back into the discussion of the “smash sparrows” campaign in the spring of 1960, when the Beijing Natural History Museum ornithologist Tso-hsin Cheng (1906-1998) sensibly, but in the perfervid political climate rather bravely, pointed out the obvious: tree sparrows eat locusts and other harmful insects, so killing hundreds of millions of them will necessarily result in a severe environmental imbalance followed by famine, which is precisely what came to pass, as tens of millions of Chinese peasants died for lack of grain. The irony could not have been lost on even the most obtuse commissar, and eventually the regime was forced to relent in its anti-sparrow campaign, even importing a quarter-million sparrows from the Soviet Union in a bid to restore ecological stability. Yet as late as 1967, observed the French writer and diplomat Paul Morand, the streets of Beijing featured posters exhorting good communists to “Kill the birds!”, which is just about as revolting a slogan as has ever been devised, at least from the standpoint of this ardent ornithophile.

By way of compensation for his sage counsel, Cheng was informed that “birds are animals of capitalism,” and was required to wear a badge with the word “reactionary” written on it. His salary was slashed, he was given demeaning janitorial tasks, and his museum committee played inane pranks on him, for example demanding he identify a specimen sewn together from various species, and then giving him a failing mark to be included in his permanent record. During the Cultural Revolution, he would be sentenced to solitary confinement in a cowshed for six straight months, but somehow Cheng survived, spending the later years of his long life advocating for the protection of migratory bird species. When the furtive Sichuan bush warbler was discovered in the central Chinese highlands in 2015, it was given an altogether fitting scientific name, serving as a sort of posthumous vindication for the heroic ornithologist — Locustella chengi.

II

All the abuse heaped upon Tso-hsin Cheng could not disguise the abject failure of the Four Pests Campaign, and the Great Leap Forward as a whole, but at least nothing could take away from Chairman Mao’s victory over schistosomiasis, an unprecedented achievement everyone could share in. Junli Zheng’s 1962 film Kumu fengchun, or A Withered Tree Meets Spring, would thrill audiences with the tale of the orphan Ku Meizi, stricken with snail fever, and the two doctors, Liu Xiang and Liu Hui, who used socialist principles to discover a cure. A Withered Tree Meets Spring, like Fu Baoshi’s After Mao Zedong’s “Saying Goodbye to the God of Plague (II),” is a minor artistic masterpiece, the director’s virtuoso right-to-left camera movements creating the impression that one is reading a traditional scroll, but like Fu’s landscape, it is also a flight of fancy. Snail fever cannot be “cured” so easily as all that, and even today schistosomiasis patients must be given annual doses of praziquantel, which can kill adult schistosomes, but cannot eliminate eggs and immature worms.

Regardless of its questionable verisimilitude, the critical and popular success of A Withered Tree Meets Spring, combined with years of government propaganda, meant that Mao’s anti-snail fever campaign would thenceforth be treated as sacrosanct. In the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak, Chinese publications urged their readers to seek out Mao’s Farewell to the God of Plague, and in early April 2020 CCTV aired the documentary Fight the Epidemic and Annihilate Schistosomiasis, which related how “after the founding of New China, the people’s government led by the Communist Party mobilized thousands of troops and horses to annihilate schistosomiasis and save thousands of lives.” Given how efficiently the communist authorities had “annihilated” snail fever, the Chinese populace could rest easy when it came to the spread of COVID-19, which the authorities and state-controlled media organs were then misleadingly calling Yěwèi bìngdú fèiyán, “viral pneumonia caused by wild animals.”

So central is the Yujiang anti-schistosomiasis campaign to the narrative of CCP competence, and even omnipotence, in matters of public health that when Miriam Gross began researching her book on the 1956–1958 deworming campaign, she was met with incredulity. “What is there to find out? It was a hugely popular campaign that totally eliminated the disease,” she was told. When Gross responded that “close to a million people in China have the disease now,” most of her interlocutors simply “shook their heads at my ignorance, reiterated that everyone loved the campaign, and promptly changed the topic.” It seems hard to deny the assertion that Mao did not actually “annihilate” schistosomiasis; a February 2022 study of 16 rural Chinese villages published in Parasitology, “Schistosomiasis in the People’s Republic of China – down but not out,” found that the “prevalence of schistosomiasis in humans was 1.8% in Jiangxi and 8.0% in Hunan determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), while 18.3% of animals were positive by digital droplet PCR.” Progress has obviously been made since the mid-20th century, albeit in no small part thanks to urbanization and the consequent depopulation of the countryside, but it was clearly premature to hold a funeral for the God of Plague.

There was always something suspicious about Mao’s anti–snail fever campaign. Much was made of the successes in Yujiang county, but that just so happened to be a region not particularly hard-hit by schistosomiasis in the first place, with only 12 percent of the land infested with snails, and 17 percent of the populace afflicted with snail fever. As Gross noted, “by way of comparison, almost twenty times as many people were infected in the Shanghai suburb, Qingpu (157,232), as in Yujiang, and snails covered an area seventy-seven times greater in Qingpu (74.3 km) than in Yujiang. Thus, Yujiang’s snail fever problem was limited to a few very bad spots surrounded by lightly hit areas.” Xun Zhou, a historian at the University of Essex, would dig deeper into the details of the campaign, only to come away even less impressed. Interviewing a grassroots health cadre who was active at the time, she was informed that “We simply made up the figures. Officials from higher-ups knew it all along. To avoid getting into trouble or being sacked from office, they needed us to inflate or forge figures … It’s an open secret.” In her book The People’s Health: Health Intervention and Delivery in Mao’s China, 1949-1983, Zhou wryly notes how “international health stakeholders came to view it [China] as a statistical outlier in its ability to achieve better health outcomes with limited resources.” Outlier, or simply liar?

It was claimed that snail fever was wiped out thanks to “a new cure which shortened the disease’s duration from months to a few days,” but peasants were in fact treated with dangerously high, and often deadly, doses of antimony potassium tartrate, a powerful emetic with a horrific side effect profile, often causing Adams–Stokes syndrome (high-grade arrhythmia and intermittent complete heart block, which is just as bad as it sounds). The methods by which the communists sought to eliminate freshwater snail populations — land reclamation and irrigation — were equally ill-judged, and according to Zhou:

not only proved extremely costly and wasteful, they also caused problems of water logging and water supply, contributing to severe flood and soil degradation that still haunts impact regions to this day. In the end, the reclamation initiatives had to be abandoned. The subsequent switch to killing the snails using special pesticides further damaged the natural ecosystem, with long-lasting negative consequences on the environment.

By 1985, the Cultural Revolution safely in the past, Chinese researchers like Bian Hongxiang and Gong Xunli could describe in the pages of Acta Geographica Sinica how the land reclamation projects had invited “the drastic revenge of nature,” but there was never any real reckoning with the corruption and failures that marked the anti–snail fever campaign, the deceptive accounts of which so warmed the remaining cockles of Chairman Mao’s withered black heart. Zhou, after citing Hannah Arendt’s dictum that “what convinces masses are not facts, and not even invented facts, but only the consistency of the system of which they are presumably part,” argued that:

By identifying with the victory narrative of the Maoist anti-schistosomiasis campaign, the otherwise hapless and frightened people in a totalitarian state could at least feel proud for being a member of a heroic nation that they believed was the first and only country to have eradicated schistosomiasis. By placing the struggle against COVID-19 within a victory narrative of improving health, the Chinese government continues to create a false sense of security and cohesion — one they require to ensure the stability needed to remain in power.

The deadly schistosomes, for their part, went on reproducing just as they always had, in the intestinal tracts of farmers and wild animals alike. And as Mao Zedong wrote in Farewell to the God of Plague (I), before his premature send-off of the God of Plague,

Should the cowherd ask tidings of the God of Plague,

Say the same griefs flow down the stream of time.

III

The campaign against schistosomiasis was the first, though far from the last, occasion in which the Chinese Communist Party politicized public health in the midst of an epidemic for its own absolutist purposes. Xiaoping Fang, in his 2021 study China and the Cholera Pandemic: Restructuring Society Under Mao, demonstrated that during the struggle against the seventh cholera pandemic of 1961–1975:

The interventionist prevention scheme to control the pandemic not only harnessed opportunities provided by the broader social restructuring initiatives but also directly contributed to them. The role of social, production, and epidemiological data in this reciprocal process further enhanced social control and political discipline and facilitated the formation and top-down imposition of a new, wide-reaching social structure via a specific form of statistical politics. This impacted government systems, local cadres, medical professionals, and the ordinary masses. The global cholera pandemic significantly contributed to the rise of an emergency disciplinary state in China through the integration of health governance and political governance.

This “emergency disciplinary state” was born under Mao, evolved over the decades, was further refined during the first SARS outbreak, and is now reaching its end state under Xi Jinping.

No official Chinese document better illustrates the cynical intertwining of public health and totalitarian politics than the one released by the state-sanctioned Protestant Three-Self Patriotic Movement on March 30, 2020, composed by Lu Dezhi and given the somewhat ungainly title of “Looking at the ‘prevention of differences’ during the epidemic from the perspective of the ‘epidemic prevention’ work during the epidemic.” The reader is urged to devote himself to “the battle of epidemic prevention and control,” and to “cooperate with the epidemic prevention and control work,” but also to be on the lookout for those taking advantage of the opportunity to “slander the church, confuse pure faith, disrupt the order of the church, and capture believers through QQ groups, WeChat groups, and other online platforms.” The struggle against the novel coronavirus, and against novel heterodox thought, are presented as one and the same. “Heresy cults are like viruses, trying to ‘infect’ more people,” but such a mind virus, like SARS-CoV-2, can spread asymptomatically, so the Chinese churches must:

improve the vigilance of all believers in screening “hidden infected people,” actively open up the channels for all believers to report suspicious personnel in the church in a timely manner, mobilize the strength of all believers to broaden screening methods, and strengthen the screening of hidden or latent “hidden infected people,” so as to ensure that the “hidden infected people” no longer have a foothold.

The communist authorities, having amply demonstrated their ability to “annihilate” diseases like snail fever and cholera with “omnipotent medicine,” will surely do the same to the novel so-called “viral pneumonia caused by wild animals.” And if they can do that, they will have no trouble stamping out the pesky house churches and democracy activists in their midsts. The medical struggle against the novel coronavirus, which Chinese government agencies maintain somehow arrived in China from abroad via “cold chain food contamination” (and definitely not bat coronavirus gain-of-function bio-engineering experiments), is thereby analogized with the ideological struggle against “exotic” or “foreign ideologies,” which undermine good old-fashioned traditional Chinese doctrine like Marxism-Leninism.

It is one thing to fill in some ponds and lakes in far-flung Yujiang county, to have “barefoot doctors” provide advice on salubrious defecation methods and the perils of nightsoil fertilizer, and to administer (over)doses of antimony potassium tartrate. It is another thing entirely to lock down hundreds of millions of people, welding some of them into their homes, forcing others into jerry-built quarantine camps, all in an attempt to defeat an aerosolized, endemic coronavirus. “Zero-COVID” measures are destined to fail, just as “zero-schistosomiasis” measures did, but on an even grander scale. And in the meantime, there will be an onslaught of negative externalities: international isolation, economic damage, loss of social cohesion, deaths from despair, immunological naïveté, women forced to give birth in the snow outside maternity wards if they lack the requisite negative test, accidents like the quarantine bus crash that killed 27 and injured 20 more in Guizhou Province back in September, and the entirely preventable fire in a locked-down, fenced-in Urumqi apartment building that took as many as 44 lives on Nov. 24, 2022.

Massive anti-lockdown protests and individual acts of public resistance have broken out in at least 28t cities across China since the infamous Urumqi fire, from Beijing to Guangzhou, and from Shanghai to Chengdu. The authorities are less and less able to rely on what Xun Zhou called a “victory narrative,” and the regime’s “false sense of security and cohesion” is gradually disintegrating. A concocted victory narrative can readily be fashioned out of an anti-snail fever campaign that ended three generations ago, as few people are likely to delve into the marshlands of Jiangxi and Hunan to see for themselves whether schistosomiasis was indeed annihilated, or if it is still in fact endemic. Maintaining a similarly spurious victory narrative in the face of COVID-19 is far more demanding, requiring as it does either never-ending quarantines and systematic violations of civil rights. The alternative to holding the entire Chinese populace in durance is to admit that the Omicron variant is not particularly dangerous (the state-controlled Guangzhou Southern Daily has already admitted that 90 percent of Omicron infections are asymptomatic), but this would mean bowing to popular pressure and abandoning a powerful tool of social control, which those in power are unlikely to do willingly.

The disconnect between propaganda and reality has meant that Chinese protestors are increasingly able to see through the Communist Party’s newspeak, with one Beijing dissident with a bullhorn holding the following discussion with a masked pro-government interlocutor during a late November protest:

– I want to ask: the foreign forces you are talking about, are they Marx and Engels? Is it Stalin? Is it Lenin? – I want to say to you, I will always love my country. I also think the current policy has problems. I really do, so that’s why… – Don’t change the subject! Think for yourself! Hello, can I ask, was it foreign forces who started the fire in Xinjiang? Was the Guizhou bus overturned by foreign forces? – I totally agree with what you’re saying… – Was everyone told to come here by foreign forces? No! We can’t even access the foreign internet, how are foreign forces meant to be communicating with us? We have only domestic forces not allowing us to govern ourselves! Can we leave the country? Or can we the foreign internet? Neither! How are they meant to communicate with us? They can’t! Where are these foreign forces, from the moon? We just want freedom.

The extent to which China, in its current incarnation, has become a veritable welter of internal contradictions is becoming ever more apparent. A neo-Confucian state in thrall to Marxism-Leninism and rife with corruption; a communist country in which, according to the World Inequality Lab, “the richest 10 percent of China’s population owns nearly 70 percent of total household wealth”; a nation dependent on global trade but increasingly insular and quarantined, its populace subjected to seemingly permanent spiritual and physical lockdowns; an avowedly atheist government with a predilection for bizarre personality cults; a diverse polity governed by Han chauvinists; a utopian political project propped up by intrusive surveillance and concentration camps; and a regime that claims to wield “omnipotent medicine” but has turned the entire country into a vast, stifling lazaretto — all these are the hallmarks of present-day Red China.

It was Chairman Mao who, in his 1937 treatise On Contradiction, perceptively observed that “before it explodes, a bomb is a single entity in which opposites coexist in given conditions. The explosion takes place only when a new condition, ignition, is present. An analogous situation arises in all those natural phenomena which finally assume the form of open conflict to resolve old contradictions and produce new things.” There is a distinct irony in the prospect that unrest over COVID-19 might serve as the new condition, the ignition, that threatens to shatter the dominance of a communist Chinese regime that has heretofore used public health measures as a pretense to implement a tyrannical political program. In his Farewell to the God of Plague (II), Mao boasted of how

Crimson rain swirls in waves under our will, Green mountains turn to bridges at our wish. Gleaming mattocks fall on the Five Ridges heaven-high; Mighty arms move to rock the earth round the Triple River.

and of how he had banished the God of Plague himself, or so he would have his subjects think. Perhaps one day, and perhaps even sooner than we know, the Chinese will bid farewell not to the God of Plague and his Ministry of Epidemics, who are not going anywhere, but instead to the Communist Party officials, cadres, apparatchiks, génocidaires, and willing executioners who have proven worse than the plague, turning their country into an open-air prison from which there is, here at long last, some chance of escape.

The Hollywoke China Syndrome - The American Spectator,"Communist China is a rotten, anti-human, tyrannical state very much admired by the American Left, as the Soviet Union was for its entire sordid existence. Progressives dream of a similar omnipotent government here that can crush conservative dissent by either depriving objectors of their freedoms — life, liberty, speech, religion, guns — or converting them to their fantasies: That racism built this evil country. That math, hard work, and ambition are white supremacist. That taxation can create wealth. That fewer police will mean less crime. That life begins at birth. That men can become women via surgical butchery, and then give birth. That humiliating defeat is historical victory. And other lunacies. Yet by defying reality, they only ensure their own destruction. As the protagonist of my second novel, Paper Tigers, says, “What they don’t realize is — in the kind of world they’re pushing for, they will be the first to go.”

While the leading purveyor of liberal self-immolation, Hollywoke, pushes intersectional madness — where featherweight women thrash scores of muscular brutes, opposite sex attraction is “heteronormative,” and real men are “toxic males,” China has taken the opposite route. Its leaders understand what leftists always have, and conservatives are finally starting to — that culture drives morality, or immorality. But unlike Hollywoke, the ChiComs live in the real world, which they plan to dominate.

Thus, they’re creating a cultural sphere in which boys will be inspired to be manlier by television male role models, and not the metrosexual wimps populating all U.S, network and cable drama series, late-night television fare (Colbert, Fallon, Corden), and news shows (Acosta, Stelter, Lemon, and almost every man on CNN and MSNBC). Last Thursday, the Chinese Communist Party announced an eight-point plan aimed at its entertainment industry that will ban “sissy idols” and “effeminate men” from TV. If Hollywoke followed suit, 90 percent of their male talent would be out of work.

The Chinese understand unmanly role models cultivate worthlessly androgynous government and military leaders such as President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Congressmen Eric Swalwell, Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler, Adam Kinzinger, and dozens more, Governors Gavin Newsom (California), Jay Inslee (Washington), J.B. Pritzker (Illinois), and Mike DeWine (Ohio), and officers Colonel Alexander (“It’s Lieutenant Colonel Vindman”) Vindman and General Mark (“white rage”) Milley. All are men the Chinese know are easy to beat. They actually planted a Chinese spy on Swalwell, and relish how Milley helped create the American military catastrophe in Afghanistan, while frothing at the abandoned high-tech weaponry they’ll soon be able to study and duplicate.

Meanwhile, Hollywoke TV will continue to showcase unmasculine losers, usually in subservient support to stronger, tougher, and phonier women leads (see — or better yet don’t see — Olivia Liang in Kung Fu, Queen Latifah in The Equalizer, Katey Sagal in Rebel, etcetera). That few regular people and fewer boys will watch these characters is secondary to the higher cause – uplifting feminism. And there may be no sadder, weaker specimens in this country than the male feminists now in charge of it, much to Red China’s delight.

So an entertainment alternative to Hollywoke that will match China’s new traditionalist cultural revitalization — minus the murderous oppression — would be not only lucrative but patriotic. But what would such an entity look like? To imitate Rod Serling, World War II combat hero turned brilliant screenwriter and creator-narrator of The Twilight Zone:

Imagine, if you will, a motion picture company unfettered by minority quotas, progressive content control, or union demands. Call it Crusade Pictures, a politically incorrect name sure to cause elitist pearl-clutching yet entice regular folks, the intended audience. Crusade would have to survive on an initial studio-laughable budget of $20 million, enough for three films that will either make or break the company.

For this reason, it could not be based in cost-prohibitive, ideologically unfavorable California (unless Larry Elder wins next week) but in a red state. Texas would be the most welcoming, since Hollywoke noisemakers like Reese Witherspoon, Alyssa Milano, Kerry Washington, and many others have condemned the state because of its wonderful new heartbeat law restricting early baby killing. Bette Midler is calling on women to sex strike over the law, being quite the wrong ambassadress for this ploy.

And what would be the three films that would best launch Crusade into the black? They would need to be stories that Hollywoke would never provide to a deprived, hungry audience — like about real men and beautiful, smart, feminine women who actually appreciate each other and America. If I ran Crusade Pictures, these would be my first three productions:

Accountability (Drama, $6 million). Marine Colonel Stuart Scheller, a Bronze Star-winning veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, is repelled by the total horror that the political-military establishment created in Afghanistan and demands accountability from his woke, incompetent leadership at the expense of his sterling career.

Welcome to the Catacombs (Drama, $5 million). When a national cemetery bans religious expression at burial ceremonies, a deceased veteran’s family calls on the St. Ives Law Center (SILC) to fight the ban, and the SILC lawyer recruits the dead man’s agnostic law student granddaughter, who soon encounters Cancel Culture from her Ivy League orbit and even her fiancé. Based on an actual case.

The Christmas Spirit (Romantic mystery, $5 million). A jaded women’s magazine writer becomes obsessed with the mysterious lighthouse keeper who rescued her at sea just before Christmas and then vanished, so she sets out to do a story on him, much to her rich fiance’s displeasure, only to find the mystery may have a more spiritual, romantic Christmas twist.

The New York Times Discovers China - The American Spectator,"The latest revelations about Biden family influence-peddling in China are having an adverse effect on the patriarch’s prospects of becoming president. Despite the best efforts of the Fourth Estate and the big social media platforms to censor the story, it is eroding Biden’s lead in the polls and has driven his campaign back into its Delaware hideout. Thus, with the grim inevitability of Greek tragedy, the New York Times has suddenly discovered that President Trump is the true villain of the piece. Before he became president, it seems, Trump pursued a few unconsummated business deals in China and has a dormant bank account there.

This soporific Times story has received more coverage by the media during the past 48 hours than the Biden corruption story has received during the past 48 months. Breathless headlines have appeared in virtually every major “news” outlet. AP gasps, “Tax records show Trump tried to land China projects.” Foreign Policy solemnly asks, “Why Does Trump Have a Chinese Bank Account?” Newsweek declares, “Trump’s Election Chances Hit By Secret Chinese Bank Account Allegations.” Never mind that the account is neither secret nor active, this tale provides Biden’s campaign with a badly needed red herring to distract the voters from the real scandal about his family’s brazen corruption.

As Michael Goodwin has demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt in the New York Post, former Vice President Biden “was a willing and eager participant in a family scheme to make millions of dollars by partnering with a shady Chinese Communist firm.” A former partner in that enterprise, Tony Bobulinski, issued a written statement Wednesday night unambiguously confirming that Joe Biden, Joe’s brother Jim, and Hunter Biden worked together with Chinese officials for the express purpose of selling access. Bobulinski explicitly confirmed that our erstwhile vice president and his family members were paid millions by the Chinese and that Biden is lying when he denies the charge:

I am the CEO of Sinohawk Holdings which was a partnership between the Chinese operating through CEFC/Chairman Ye and the Biden family. I was brought into the company to be the CEO by James Gilliar and Hunter Biden. The reference to “the Big Guy” in the much publicized May 13, 2017 email is in fact a reference to Joe Biden.… The Biden family aggressively leveraged the family name to make millions of dollars from foreign entities even though some were from communist controlled China.

It’s no coincidence that the Times story about Trump’s “secret account” broke just before the final presidential debate. Nor is it surprising that Biden’s former boss brought it up during his first campaign appearance on behalf of Biden the same day Bobulinski issued his statement. During a campaign event for Biden, former President Obama claimed, “We know that [Trump] continues to do business with China because he has a secret Chinese bank account.” We know nothing of the kind, of course. Alan Garten, Chief Legal Officer of the Trump Organization, told the Times before it published the story that the account had been inactive since 2015. The Gray Lady ignored this inconvenient fact.

Obama has just as much incentive to spread this kind of misinformation about the Trump account and to cover up the Biden family business as does “working class Joe.” The Chinese weren’t interested in what Joe or his brother or his son Hunter could do for them. For the Chinese, they wanted nothing more than access to the Obama administration. Moreover, when the former president first visited China in 2009, even the nauseatingly obsequious media reported that the new president had been led by the nose by the Chinese. But perhaps Obama’s nose just detected the smell of money? Stephen Moore wrote the following in the Daily Signal about his 2014 climate pact with the Chinese:

Obama’s climate-change pact would … cripple U.S. industries by force-feeding them expensive electric power. We will displace millions of highly paid U.S. workers in the oil, gas and coal industries. We will increase the cost of electric utilities as well as home-heating costs.… We are ceding our natural competitive advantages to China — in effect transferring millions of jobs outside the United States. That is why the Chinese and the rest of the world are laughing at us.

But our former president has his houses and the millions he somehow managed to accumulate working for a salary that is so modest that President Trump simply gives it away. Obama’s only goal is to help defeat President Trump so no one will ask him about the source of all that money he is now using to pay for his lavish lifestyle, so he reiterated the red herring about Trump’s dormant bank account. Oddly enough, when President Trump brought this subject up with regard to Biden and his family during Thursday night’s debate, the former VP went to the same red herring: “We learned this President does business in China, has a secret bank account in China, and he’s talking about me taking money?”

Just before the debate, as reported by the New York Post, Tony Bobulinski met with reporters to reiterate his claim that Joe Biden is lying when he says he has never taken money from a foreign government. He also released text messages and emails to back up his claims. He added, “Tomorrow I will be meeting with the Senate committee members concerning this matter and I will be providing the FBI the devices which contain the evidence corroborating what I have said, so I will not be taking any questions at this time.” When asked about evidence he said it was contained on several cell phones: “The evidence sits on these three phones, I don’t want to go into anything any further.”

It remains to be seen if Biden can survive the damning revelations of influence-peddling in China with the latest red herring from the New York Times and the corporate media. His deployment of the tale in response to President Trump’s charge during Thursday night’s debate was not very convincing. If Tony Bobulinski has the evidence he claims to have, and he survives until Friday morning, it’s unlikely that anyone can save the former vice president. This is the third time Joe Biden has run for president. His fundamental dishonesty destroyed his first two campaigns. This is the closest he has ever come to the finish line, yet it looks like his fatal flaw may well bring him down again.",https://spectator.org/covid-come-november-lockdown-china-showdown/,2020-10-23
The Pink Emperor Takes Charge in China - The American Spectator,"Officially the Chinese Empire ended in 1912 with the abdication of Pu Yi. He went on to head the puppet state of Manchukuo under Japanese occupation during World War II and died as an apparently loyal citizen of the People’s Republic of China in 1967.

Although Pu Yi was long referred to as the Last Emperor of China, that title really belongs to the so-called Red Emperor, Mao Zedong. Mao is credited with creation of the PRC, but his selfish, unbalanced, and xenophobic rule led to the deaths of tens of millions of people. He launched the Cultural Revolution, which unleashed veritable civil war throughout China. Relief at his death was widespread, since it allowed the PRC to evolve into something approaching a normal nation — and to subsequently undertake reforms that turned the PRC into a global economic powerhouse.

Most people believed imperial China was gone forever. Mao’s successors were willing to use extreme brutality to maintain power, witness the carnage in Tiananmen Square in June 1989. However, they attempted to prevent the return of personal dictatorship, ultimately setting a two-term limit on the president, which was respected by Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. Neither of them enjoyed the untrammeled authority of Mao or Deng Xiaoping. The system wasn’t exactly collective rule, but politics no longer was uniquely scary.

But that is changing. Xi Jinping appears set to become China’s next de facto emperor. He’s not exactly “red” — after all, among his political victims was Bo Xilai, a representative of the “New Left.” As provincial chief Bo promoted the “red culture” movement and used Maoist imagery to advance his career. In 2012 Bo was stripped of his position and put on trial, more for his outsize ambition than retrograde philosophy. Nevertheless, few of the PRC’s leaders wanted to return to Maoism.

After serving only one term, however, Xi is positioning himself to rule for life. Not from behind the scenes, like Deng, who set China on its reform course. But in front, as president, apparently the modern Chinese term for emperor.

Xi quickly established his authority, launching a carefully targeted — meaning mostly against his political opponents and their support networks — anti-corruption campaign. He upset the unwritten rule of not prosecuting “Tigers,” top leaders who had preceded him. He quickly gained authority over the military and asserted control over economic policy, traditionally left to the premier. At last fall’s party congress he failed to nominate a successor, a clear signal that term limits were kaput. Now the Chinese Communist Party has announced plans to amend the constitution to formally drop the restriction. After which Xi will not need even the pretense of reelection.

The announcement generated substantial disquiet, even among some Chinese who like Xi, whose rule has made nationalists proud. Censors quickly banned “I disagree” on social media, as well as a number of other words and phrases identified with Xi and his dictatorial plans. (Even Winnie the Pooh got the boot, since he is thought to resemble Xi and became a stand-in on social media.) Some intellectuals took the dangerous step of publishing open letters in opposition.

One suspects that many of those closest to him also are uneasy. No doubt, a number of them would like a chance to ascend the political summit. Many likely remember the madness of Mao. The younger Mao was an effective leader. The elder Mao was an unpredictable tyrant. No matter how measured Xi may seem to be, he may not resist the temptations and transformations of ultimate power.

There’s little the U.S. can do to stop Xi’s coming dictatorship. Not that Washington wouldn’t try if it could. Despite the complaints directed at Russian interference with the 2016 presidential contest, the U.S. has intervened in more than 80 elections abroad, with only limited success. It is even harder to influence an authoritarian political process like that in the PRC. As for Xi, the only thing likely to stop him is a desperate act of violence from someone around him. And that certainly won’t be ordered by Washington.

But there is a larger question of U.S. policy. Xi is not just determined to establish a personal rather than party dictatorship. He also is a ruthless Chinese nationalist determined to limit if not extirpate Western influence in the PRC. His government has expanded censorship, intensified internet controls, restricted cooperation with Western institutions, persecuted dissidents and their lawyers, tightened rule over Hong Kong, and otherwise sought to reinforce authoritarian controls.

At the same time, the Xi government has increasingly used its economic clout to promote political ends. Taiwan is a particular target of such activities. For instance, Marriott listed Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and Tibet as “countries” in a public survey. Beijing’s Cyberspace Administration declared that the hotelier had violated the law and “hurt the feelings of the Chinese people” and took down Marriott’s China website for a week. The company groveled its apology — of course it did not support “separatist movements.”

Other multinationals immediately began scrubbing their websites to avoid the PRC’s ire. Delta Airlines acknowledged making a “grave mistake” in listing Taiwan and Tibet as independent states. Shanghai’s internet regulator ordered Medtronic and Zara, purveyors of medical equipment and fashion, respectively, to update their websites, which listed Taiwan as a nation. Both naturally rushed to comply.

U.S. officials privately complain that China continues cyberespionage, vacuuming up data. American companies feel increasingly unwelcome in the PRC, being targeted by regulation and law. What once seemed to be simple commercial relationships has taken on the characteristics of economic warfare.

It’s still important not to overstate the threat. Outside of its major cities China remains poor. Extraordinary income inequality generates political instability. The nation’s demography remains dramatically unbalanced: despite having relaxed the one-child policy, the PRC may become old before it grows rich. Many economic pitfalls remain, including highly indebted, inefficient state enterprises, banks listing with bad debt, and a property bubble highlighted by entire “ghost cities.”

Militarily the U.S. remains far ahead, starting with its nuclear arsenal. And Beijing’s military ambitions remain limited to its neighborhood, something Washington sought to safeguard almost two centuries ago with the Monroe Doctrine. Moreover, the PRC is surrounded by potential adversaries, many of which it has battled in the past: India, Japan, Korea, Russia, and Vietnam. Just as Beijing hopes to deter American intervention, China’s potential adversaries can use deterrence to constrain and channel its behavior.

And Xi’s reach for supreme power may very well trigger more widespread opposition internally. The prospect of renewed empire might unify disparate factions against him.

Nevertheless, U.S. policymakers must consider the challenge facing America. A tough, strong leader, relatively unconstrained at home, is determined to assert the PRC’s increasing influence internationally. And to use the traditionally mutually beneficial activities of investment and trade to achieve ideological and nationalist ends, hostile to American interests and values.

Avoiding military confrontation should remain paramount: a series of wars (and it almost certainly would be more than one, since neither side would accept defeat) would be disastrous, whatever the formal outcome. Yet cheerful acquiescence to potentially threatening Chinese advances also isn’t an enticing option.

If Xi Jinping has his way, Americans will have to learn how to deal with a revived Chinese Empire. It is a prospect that even many of his fellow citizens likely fear. Americans still operate from a position of strength. But the challenge will force Washington to think more seriously about a China that is shifting from friend to foe.

The Truth About 'Green' China - The American Spectator,"It all reminds me of July 1, 1987 when President Ronald Reagan nominated Judge Robert Bork for an opening on the Supreme Court. He had it made in the shade, said my complacent conservative friends. The result was brutal. But we do not have to look back 32 years to see how unruly the leftwing mob can be. Recall the recent fate of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Only his courage and unscotchable determinate saved him. The simple fact is that the conservatives are often slow on the draw against the American left. Only the Wall Street Journal and the intrepid New York Sun have come out swinging for Moore. It is time for the conservatives to rally around him. He can probably win with the President on his side. He apparently has the votes. Yet the coming battle would be a lot less bloody if the conservative movement were to take the field on Moore’s behalf — and make it clear that from now on they are going to wage war for the President’s nominees.

The US Must Take Action on China - The American Spectator,"President Richard Nixon’s rule for handling other countries was: “Do unto others as they would do unto you.” Then–Secretary of State Henry Kissinger corrected him, saying, “Plus 10 percent.” The legendary Jimmy Hoffa gave this notion sharper elbows: “I do to others what they do to me, only worse.”

President Joe Biden’s letting the Chinese spy balloon enter America’s airspace illustrates yet again that his approach is more: “Do unto others … minus 10 percent.” His “Slowest Gun in the East” posture perfectly fits his flaccid stance toward China, sends a dangerous message to the world, and reflects how the United States now copes with China.

America and other Western countries need to make a marked shift in mindset to address properly the travesties perpetrated by the Chinese Communist Party. Here are five key reasons why.

First, current political efforts and policies have done little to bridle China. A compilation of speeches given by President Donald J. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, National Security Adviser Robert C. O’Brien, Attorney General Bill Barr, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Trump on China: Putting America First, finely details China’s evil and expresses the need for an “all of government” plan to combat the CCP.

But these speeches did too little. China violated and continues to breach its $200 billion trade agreement with America. Had Trump been reelected, he certainly would have taken his anti-China plans to a higher level. Biden’s policy largely has been to determine what Trump did and then do the exact opposite.

Last November, Biden shook hands with President Xi Jinping and then told journalists that they talked about the climate. China, of course, uses more coal than the rest of the world combined and has no plans to stop. While living in China during the depths of COVID, I saw residents of small towns burn trash every morning. Carbon dioxide seemed the last thing on their minds.

Biden did not even mention the CCP-exported fentanyl that fatally poisons roughly 200 Americans every day.

Second, CCP victim groups are numerous but too loosely connected to influence much change. Washington lobbyists dilute already weak policies that lack a strategic foundation. Famous American athletes escape any real ridicule when they criticize perceived racial injustice in the United States and shun others who rightly decry human-rights violations in China.

Third, Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), chairman of the new House Select Committee on China, recently told his colleagues that “it is time to understand the urgency of the threat” from the CCP and justifiably praised the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.

Roll Call summarized Gallagher’s account of his committee’s agenda, stating that the congressman “stressed that he wants to avoid duplicating the work of the defense panel and the jurisdiction of other national security committees, adding his panel should ‘play a coordinating function’ between them all.” On Taiwan, Gallagher and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) pledged to “make the urgent case for aiding Taiwan in its self-defense.”

The point is that Gallagher has not articulated an overarching strategy for foiling the CCP’s goals. He has done the reverse. He seems to want to fight one battle at a time rather than to win the war — to use an analogy that recalls his well-respected Marine Corps background.

Gallagher’s piecemeal approach is a detailed war plan compared to Biden’s complete inability to articulate a mission objective on the China threat. If anything, Biden’s strategic incoherence will cost America victory against China.

Fourth, every think tank, educational institution, podcaster, and government policymaking agency has researched China — globally. The time for research is over. For a recap of China’s transgressions, read The China Declaration.

With the facts on China’s evils painfully clear, these two questions arise: Should there even be a strategy for handling the CCP? If so, what is it?

Fifth, global public opinion strongly supports real action. Pew Research Center outlines globally unfavorable views of China. They are historically high, as one would expect in the wake of the COVID catastrophe. Among Australians, 86 percent have an unfavorable view of China; in Japan, 87 percent; in the U.S., 82 percent. But there is little that individuals can do. It is time for the masses to rise up and demand a real strategy.

Finally, after specifying China’s transgressions, The China Declaration proposes this strategy: “[Bring] freedom from the influence of the CCP to people in China and abroad.” Yes, China’s 1.4 billion people are the CCP’s biggest victims. Americans should care about them just as we historically grieved for the men, women, and children of the captivate nations behind the Iron Curtain.

Let’s start by making life miserable for the CCP’s top criminals who torture their own people: All 2,300 members of China’s National Congress should be blacklisted. No more U.S. visas for them. No more college admissions for their princes and princesses. And no more real-estate deals for the wardens of the giant prison that is today’s China.

Many similar nonmilitary initiatives would send China’s leaders a simple message: Enough is enough. Start acting like modern, humane public servants, not oppressors for life.

The US Needs Help for Its China Addiction - The American Spectator,"With China’s decision to close negotiations with the U.S. following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Taiwan visit, it’s fair to ask how the U.S.’s rapport with the People’s Republic got to this tense point in the first place.

The actor Dennis Quaid said his involvement with cocaine had three stages: “the fun, the fun with problems, and then just the problems.”

That’s not so different from America’s relationship with China. It was fun at first breaking the spell of no relations with our first attempts at detente and trying to bring the Chinese into the world of freedom by incorporating them into trade and high finance.

Then it was fun with problems. China did take the West up on its offer by opening trade and finance. American companies made billions selling in this huge market which, thanks to embracing some Western economic ideas, was becoming more prosperous.

But China didn’t fully reciprocate. Back home, U.S. firms began to lose out to Chinese firms that could operate with few regulatory restraints and lower labor costs. America began to find itself selling things it did not make and the makers of those products found themselves trying to learn to code.

Moreover, China didn’t make this large and growing market available to American companies for free. It demanded a seat on the board and in management for people who were members of the Chinese Communist Party and allies of the regime. That way, it learned how the company was managed and marketed and how exactly it made its product.

These board members and managers then would form Chinese companies that could get the raw materials from other Chinese companies at prices available only to Chinese companies — stealing the technology and squeezing the competitor by government fiat.

The Trump administration made some progress in stopping this massive transfer of intellectual property by using targeted tariffs and pressing the Chinese to drop requirements that CCP members be on boards and management teams.

But momentum has stalled and we’ve now reached the “problems” stage. We have corporations such as Nike and Disney that are continuing to take advantage of Chinese slave labor, filming movies just beyond the gates of Uyghur prison camps and taking China’s side in disputes with the United States. We have the NBA denouncing a team executive for calling out China’s human rights abuses.

We even have national security contractors working with and within China.

Take, for example, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has had his own “the fun, the fun with problems, and then just the problems” progression with the Chinese. First, it was loans from the China Construction Bank, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. Then, it was 5 percent of Musk-owned Tesla going to Tencent, the Chinese conglomerate. Then, it was still fun opening a new Tesla showroom in the same community as a Uyghur prison camp. Now there are problems. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Musk’s China ties are “causing unease in Washington, including among some Republican lawmakers who have been among the billionaire entrepreneur’s ardent supporters.”

By allowing these companies — Nike, Disney, Tesla, and the like — to do business in China, is the U.S. promoting slavery and the general mistreatment of the Uyghurs? What do we know and what does China require us to share? Are we compromising U.S. national security?

The U.S. relationship with China has reached the problem stage. Free trade and U.S. corporate chumminess did not make China a free country, it made it a more powerful and dangerous one. Western democracies have created unprecedented levels of freedom and prosperity in the last century, but unless things change, China’s way of managing societies — far more forceful, far less tolerant — could well emerge as the dominant model in this century.

It’s a clash of ideas and diplomacy now, but as recent threatening behavior from China around Taiwan illustrates, it may be closer to becoming hotter than we know. Our response must be comprehensive and cogent.

It will mean increasing defense capabilities, intensifying diplomatic pressure, and insisting on protections for intellectual property. But it also will mean our government will have to get a handle on the relationships between U.S. corporations — especially those that involve national security — and the Chinese Communist Party.

Because, like Quaid’s problem, it can be deadly if not addressed.

There Is No Strategic Ambiguity in China’s Approach to Taiwan - The American Spectator,"Those U.S. and Western sinologists, including the Biden administration’s national security team, who continue to promote the U.S. policy of “strategic ambiguity” on Taiwan as the most effective deterrent of a Chinese invasion of the island should ponder the words of Chinese President Xi Jinping at the opening of the Chinese Communist Party’s 20th Party Congress in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing: “We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and utmost effort, but we will never promise to renounce the use of force, and we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary.”

That line in the speech drew the longest and most sustained applause by the party delegates. Xi also made it clear that “[t]he Taiwan issue is China’s own problem to solve” and that “[t]he wheels of history are rolling on towards reunification and the rejuvenation of the great Chinese nation. Complete reunification must be realised and it can without a doubt be achieved.” No strategic ambiguity there.

Xi is preparing the nation for war with the United States. “Be mindful of dangers in the midst of peace,” he said. “Get the house in good repair before rain comes, and prepare to undergo the major tests of high winds and waves, and even perilous, stormy seas.”

He boasted that “China’s international influence, appeal and power to shape the world has significantly increased.”

Xi also promised to enhance the military’s “strategic capabilities” and called for accelerating military modernization and technological development.

Yu Jie, a China expert at Chatham House, noted Xi’s “more hawkish language on Taiwan.”

Alfred Wu of the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy said Xi’s narrative is that China must be in a “war-like state” to unite the people for national security reasons.

Willy Lam, a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation, described Xi’s remarks as indicating that the “U.S.-China confrontation will continue.” Former U.S. diplomat William Klein views Xi’s speech as exhorting the people to “continue to circle the wagons … to fend off … increasing external threats.” Taipei’s National Chengchi University professor Wang Hsin-hsien explained that while America was not expressly mentioned in Xi’s speech, almost everything he said about Taiwan “points to America.”

China’s English-language mouthpiece, the Global Times, called Xi’s remarks on reunification with Taiwan a “solemn pledge” and a “fresh warning to outside forces” (i.e., the United States) who seek Taiwan’s independence. It is those “outside forces” that it calls the “biggest uncertainty and destructive forces to the cross-Straits peaceful situation.” And the Global Times emphasized the “strong connection between national reunification and national rejuvenation.” The report quoted Zhang Wensheng of the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University in Fujian, China, as saying that fighting separatists is “extremely necessary given a changing global environment, especially when foreign forces ramp up efforts in containing us by playing the ‘Taiwan card.’” It also quoted Wang Jianmin of Minnan Normal University, who warned that if outside forces continue to interfere in reunification, “it will trigger a cross-Straits crisis and force the Chinese government to take non-peaceful means.”

Contrast Xi’s remarks and the Global Times commentary with the détentist language of the Biden administration’s recently issued National Security Strategy, and you can see why China’s confidence in its ability to reunify with Taiwan — peacefully or forcibly — is growing.

We are living in very perilous times. We need a Churchill or a Reagan, but there are none in this administration.",https://spectator.org/digital-yuan-chinas-plan-to-topple-the-usd/,2022-10-18
This Isn't China: Why Did Twitter Suspend Free Market Environmentalist Account? - The American Spectator,"Just as it was gaining momentum and attracting attention, Twitter shut down and silenced an account that promoted a free market vision for environmentalism timed with Earth Day. Special credit here belongs to Eric Bolling, who used his own twitter account and his program “The Five” on Fox News to bring attention the cause.

The account, @FreeMarket_US, a project of Americans for Limited Government (ALG), went live a few days before Earth Day and proceeded to pick up considerable steam. On Earth Day, the official website for Free Market America was launched and its Facebook and Twitter components started to come to life as well. The first video put out by Free Market America, “If I wanted America to fail,” got over 120,000 hits in less than 36 hours — that’s not too shabby.

Adam Bitely, an editor for Net Right Daily, the official website for ALG, described what happened after the Twitter account was suspended mid-way through Earth Day.

“After numerous attempts to contact Twitter and see what the story was behind the suspension, ALG launched a twitter campaign against twitter,” he wrote. “Urging all of our followers to contact @twitter to ask why the Free Market America site has been suspended, thousands came to our defense.”

Bitely credited Bolling and others including Michelle Malkin (@michellemalkin) who tweeted to her more than 270,000 followers multiple times, talk radio host Neal Boortz (@talkmaster), and Glenn Beck’s The Blaze, for bringing pressure on Twitter.

The account was eventually restored. But the lesson here is for free market activists to remain and vigilant at a time when green pressure groups, and their allies in old and new media, are out to stifle dissenting views.

A New Generation of China Lovers - The American Spectator,"New York Times foreign affairs columnist Thomas Friedman is what the late Paul Hollander called a “political pilgrim” — a Western intellectual so alienated from his own country due to its imperfections that he transfers his admiration to socialist, collectivist regimes, like China’s. Were Hollander alive to update his insightful book Political Pilgrims: Travels of Western Intellectuals to the Soviet Union, China and Cuba, he could devote an entire chapter to Friedman.

What National Review called Friedman’s “warped love affair with Communist China” was recently on display on CNN. Friedman praised China for the speed of its bullet train from Beijing to Shanghai, favorably comparing it to the much slower New York-to-Chicago train. He then went on an anti-Trump rant, lamenting that America was “unserious as a country” compared to China. While Republicans in the U.S. were spending their time “chasing a madman who actually encouraged people to sack our Capitol,” Friedman said, the Chinese “weren’t wasting their time on … nonsense,” even if they were thinking about “some bad stuff with the Uighurs and all of that.”

The “bad stuff with the Uighurs” that Friedman so clearly downplayed involves, as National Review points out, “the sadistic state-sanctioned torture of women with electric batons … the gang rape of 20-year-olds in front of hundreds of detainees, [and] genocide.” Other news outlets have accused Friedman of being “smitten with authoritarianism” and suffering from “China envy.”

In one notorious column, Friedman praised the “reasonably enlightened group of people” who lead China — he was describing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), elite rulers of a totalitarian state. Although Friedman acknowledged that one-party autocracy “has its drawbacks,” he marveled that the enlightened CCP leaders “can just impose the politically difficult but critically important policies needed to move a society forward in the 21st century.” Elsewhere, Friedman wrote in awe of China’s “concentrated state power” and its ability to mobilize its population and resources. More recently, Friedman expressed admiration for China’s ability to deploy “all the tools of its authoritarian surveillance system — tools designed to track and trace political dissidents to control the population — to track and trace those infected with the coronavirus and control its spread.” This is globalization on steroids.

Friedman in another column decries America’s “petty politics” that prevent us from effectively dealing with overpopulation and climate change. The Chinese, he claims, with one-party authoritarian rule can deal much more effectively with such crucial global issues. Apparently the “founding fathers” Friedman most admires are Mao Zedong, Chou En-lai, and Deng Xiaoping instead of James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay.

Hollander brilliantly diagnosed this Western intellectual malady as stemming from a desire to locate an earthly paradise — a quest for secular perfection. He wrote that “alienation from one’s own society and susceptibility to the attractions, real or imagined, of others are very closely linked.” Western intellectuals throughout much of the last century acutely observed the defects and flaws in their own societies and believed that they could create a more perfect society. Social criticism at home led to a search for a better society abroad. And repeatedly throughout the 20th century, intellectuals looked to collectivist regimes as models for reordering their own countries.

Some intellectuals studied by Hollander believed that human nature was perfectible. The elite leadership class, they believed, could use education and re-education to mold humans to achieve a fair and just society. Other intellectuals, however, would use the coercive powers of the state to overcome the stubborn resistance of humans who failed to share the elite’s vision of utopia.

Socialism imposed by a party of elites promised the end of inequality, economic justice, a classless society, and the withering away of the state — in the Marxist lexicon, taking from each according to his ability and giving to each according to his needs. But in reality, the state never withered away. The party elites imposed totalitarian dictatorships. And tens of millions died. That is the real lesson of the 20th century that Friedman, in his admiration for Chinese authoritarianism in the 21st century, ignores.

Just at the time Friedman points to China as a better role model for the 21st century than America, China’s President Xi Jinping has amassed more dictatorial power than any CCP leader since Mao. And Mao is the most murderous ruler of the 20th century.

Friedman’s disenchantment with the structural limitations that prevent “concentrated state power” in the United States is a recurring phenomenon among American elites. Woodrow Wilson, perhaps our most intellectual president, once proposed that America shift to a parliamentary system to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of national governmental power. As president during the First World War, Wilson demonstrated an approach to wartime governance that Jonah Goldberg described as “liberal fascism.”

Six decades later, Lloyd Cutler, an adviser to the ineffectual President Jimmy Carter, proposed a structural change similar to that proposed by Wilson. No modern president, Cutler wrote, could effectively govern the country because of the structural deficiencies imposed by the Constitution. A few years later, President Ronald Reagan showed that effective leadership and our constitutional structure were not incompatible.

Friedman’s “China envy” is somewhat reminiscent of the many musings of George F. Kennan, especially in his later years. Kennan, the renowned American diplomat and historian, unlike Friedman, never looked to a communist country for models of statesmanship. But Kennan, like Friedman, recommended anti-democratic approaches to solve national and global problems. In one of his last books, Around the Cragged Hill, and in his voluminous diaries, Kennan expressed a preference for a parliamentary system to overcome the checks and balances between the executive and legislative branches of our government, and the creation of a Council of State — a small group of elites appointed by the president to guide governmental policy free from the messiness of democratic politics.

Hollander expressed concern that Western intellectuals’ alienation from their countries’ democratic values and political structures could lead to “the erosion of both popular and elite support for the survival of Western political institutions.” He continued, “The more far reaching question is whether or not, willingly or inadvertently, Western intellectuals will contribute to the destruction of their relatively free societies, in part because of their illusions about other societies and their recurrent fantasies of new forms of liberation and collective gratification.”

In a powerful recent essay in Tablet, Lee Smith examines the sycophantic attitudes of what he calls a “new class” of China admirers in the United States. Smith includes in this “new” class of elites intellectuals (like Friedman), businessmen, academics, and even athletes who are willing to compromise or surrender Western values to accommodate and cooperate with President Xi’s communist-run Celestial Empire. But Friedman and other contemporary fans of China are not so much a new class as they are a new “generation” of admirers of autocracy. They are part of an intellectual and business lineage that reaches back to the 1920s and 1930s, when Western elites praised the “accomplishments” of Stalin’s earthly utopia. And after Stalin’s crimes were exposed to the world, many of those same elites looked to Mao’s China, then Castro’s Cuba, and even to the North Vietnamese communists for inspiration and example. For some, the dream never dies.

Thomas Friedman displays the same elite alienation from his own country’s values and institutions as Hollander’s 20th-century political pilgrims, while promoting autocratic solutions to the world’s problems. It is a dangerous combination — dangerous to the survival of Western political institutions and to the survival of individual liberty.",https://spectator.org/dont-be-fooled-by-the-idea-of-china-intervening-in-ukraine/,2021-02-15
"Trump, China Virus 19, and Biden - The American Spectator","The China Virus 19 is not what should scare Americans. The terrifying thought is: What if, G-d forbid, Joe Biden now were president?

This is a moment in history that calls for a uniquely strong and singularly focused president who can manage crises effectively, demand results with appropriate speed, cut through malarkey mercilessly, fire and replace people who cannot meet the moment, and also energize an enormous economy. There could not be a better president for this time than Donald Trump.

We can debate for years to come whether this or that step would have been desirable or even called for in January or February 2020 in confronting China Virus 19. Clearly, its emergence did not merit any alarm in the “news” media in January, nor in Democrat circles. One would think this disease would have come to the attention of the House Intelligence Committee no less than to committees on health. Yet Adam Schiff was focused on Pelosi’s Stillborn Impeachment. The Corrupt Journalist Corps were focused on the same. To defend himself from the vicious onslaught, the president necessarily was compelled to huddle with his attorneys. There were further outside distractions. John Bolton and his manuscript. Marie Yovanovitch, whoever she is. Some American military officer who had been offered a position in the Ukrainian cabinet and who became a star for the Democrats for a few minutes because he did not like Trump. By the last third of January, Pelosi still had not walked the impeachment over to the Senate but instead was handing out souvenir pens. That was January.

As February rolled in, more information about China Virus 19 also rolled in. The world was at a loss because the Chinese Communists had kept facts and data hidden from outside. So two Chinese travelers went to Italy. Others traveled elsewhere. We know the results.

Again, we can engage in fair and respectful debates today about how seriously to take China Virus 19, how it compares to influenza, hepatitis B, standard pneumonia, malaria, yellow fever, H1N1, Ebola, and other communicable illnesses that have taken far more lives so far. Ultimately, though, the urgent focus now is where we go from here. The stock market has taken a pounding. Stores and corporations are closed or severely stripped down. Toilet paper is gone because of mass insanity.

If we end our public speeches and invocations with the words “… and may G-d bless the United States of America,” pause a moment and realize that indeed He has. Trump, warts and all, is exactly the president for this moment, regardless of whether hydroxychloroquine in tandem with azithromycin proves effective. Trump always will be blamed by half this country and by 95 percent of the media for everything. That is his destiny, and it is his fate. Reagan had to live with it. Lincoln had to live with it. That is how it goes when you have a strong leader on one hand, and freedom to express opinions on the other. Can you imagine what Lincoln went through, as one incompetent general after another failed to break the Confederacy? McClellan would not fight and was insubordinate. Hooker got out-hooked at Chancellorsville. Burnside got cratered. Meade let the defeated Southern army retreat safely back home after Pickett’s Charge at Gettysburg. What kind of commander-in-chief was this Lincoln? What a bum! Indeed, that was the theme when McClellan ran against Lincoln for the presidency in 1864. Lincoln trounced him by 55–45 percent, with an even broader win in the electoral college, 212-21. And that was that.

Part of Trump’s greatness is that he is not intimidated by anything. In this, he differs from virtually every previous potentially great conservative American leader. Sooner or later, each has buckled under unremitting pressure from the Democrats and their left-wing media. When Nixon’s first Supreme Court choices were beaten back by the Left, he capitulated and named terrible justices in their stead. Reagan, too, was so desperate to mollify the left media that he began by naming Sandra Day O’Connor so that he could prove to be the first to name a woman. After elevating William Rehnquist to Chief Justice and thereafter naming Justice Antonin Scalia, Reagan next tried to appoint Robert Bork. The Left defamed and destroyed Bork, and Reagan buckled and went with Anthony Kennedy. Those two justices, O’Connor and Kennedy, disastrously impacted aspects of American society’s subsequent evolution in areas ranging from admissions and employment quotas (affirmative action) to abortion to the classic American family unit. The Bushes likewise mixed good and bad. From the first we got Clarence Thomas but also David Souter, and the second gave us Samuel Alito but also John Roberts and almost Harriet Miers.

Reagan gave in to leftist pressure and conferred a mass amnesty on millions of illegal immigrants, planting the seeds for the mess that has turned conservative states, including his own California, into leftist People’s Democrat Republics. One Bush gave in on taxes despite an ironclad promise. Another Bush likewise failed to lead strongly on the economy or immigration. The turning-point moments in American history were lost and cannot be retrieved. Now we are stuck with the fruits of nearly a century of government by liberal Democrats alternating with Republicans who promised to govern from the right and soon moved to the center-left. And then came Trump.

If Gen. Thomas Jackson of Clarksburg, Virginia, had not already become identified with the “Stonewall” sobriquet, it could have fit Trump. He has been standing there like a stone wall. Yes, he has compromised, especially in his early months in office, as he sought to govern effectively across the board. He was persuaded that Paul Ryan could deliver, that Reince Priebus could handle his role, that Rex Tillerson could lead at State, that Jeff Sessions could navigate the attorney general job. Trump was new to Washington but now knows, three years later, where he was wrong to take others’ advice and recommendations. And through it all, he increasingly has governed like a stone wall.

When Trump was elected in November 2016, the Dow Jones index stood at 18,000. Look it up. It hit 20,000 in February 2017. It settled into 21,000 three months later in May. Four months later at 22,000 in September. The next month 23,000. Two months later, in December 2017 — 24,000. The following month 25,000. Three weeks later 26,000. Then came a year of modest pull-backs in 2018, as Trump’s economic war with China began, and as Democrats and their Corrupt Journalist Corps gleefully predicted and hoped for a recession because, as they daily reminded us, Trump is such an idiot, does not understand markets as well as Don Lemon and Rachel Maddow do, and tariffs never work. Yet by April 2019, the market was back at 26,000 — tariffs intact, American farmers fine, and China blinking. In July it hit 27,000, drew back, but settled in at 27,000 in September. It landed at 28,000 in December and 29,000 in February 2020. And then came China Virus 19.

Trump knows what he is doing. On economics, he has heard all the attacks from “experts” who have trophies like Paul Krugman at the New York Times. Krugman once upon a time got a Nobel Prize in economics, many years ago, much as Yasser Arafat once got a Nobel Prize in Peace. Obama also got a Nobel Prize in Peace. But Stonewall Trump stood unflinching. He knew that if he did not stare down the Chinese on the trade war, we would lose forever our hope to balance the playing field with that crooked and G-dless nation that steals our intellectual property, manipulates its currency, hacks into our national databases, and cheats in virtually every aspect of commerce. In staring down China, Trump took a terrible risk with his base. What if farmers would turn on him because of the tariffs? What if factory workers would turn on him? And yet Trump did not back down, even as his determination slowed down the incredible rise of the stock market for a year. He understood — as so many of us did — that mainland China is controlled by communists, tyrants, crooks and cheats, with a President for Life, and they know how to “play” American government leaders who always capitulate, fearing they will lose their base of support before the next election.

Trump did not back down. Maybe that cost a few borderline Republican House seats in 2018. By contrast, LeBron James was such a coward that he could not say in China that the people of Hong Kong deserve freedom. And how fitting that the China Virus 19 and that dictatorship’s refusal to acknowledge the truth has resulted both in the NBA having to close down its basketball season while Nike has lost over $17 billion! How fitting! Go ahead and sign Colin Kaepernick to a new endorsement with that.

But Trump does not get intimidated. As weak-kneed Republicans behind the scenes have begged him to change course — on immigration, on trade, on almost everything — he has remained a stone wall, and it is they who ultimately have been the ones to change course as his instincts repeatedly have proven correct.

At this moment in time, Trump is precisely the person we need to lead America through the present mess and to recharge the economy as a societal “new normal” unfolds.

He is strong. He also has a fabulous Vice President in Mike Pence. Pence is cut out of different cloth, to be sure, but also is a tremendous conservative leader. The man is a deeply religious Christian and does not apologize or back down. He is principled, and he is exceptionally competent. This is exactly the leadership we need now and for the next 13 years, at least.

We saw what happened when the second Bush ran the economy into the ground, as had his father, and he was succeeded by Obama. Through the Wasted Obama Decade we watched the economy sputter and barely move. Yes, some numbers got better under Obama, but anyone who understands anything about economics knows that, after a recession, there always is a recovery. It is basic. A country is in a recession, so everyone chooses not to buy a new car, a new laptop or smartphone, or new clothes at the moment. Then, after a few years, everyone’s car starts breaking down beyond repair, everyone’s technology is out of date, and everyone’s clothes wear out, so everyone has to start buying again. And that, in two sentences, is why there always is a recovery after a recession. But somehow Obama managed to put a damper on the recovery. With all his welfare and food stamps and other “entitlements” inducing people not to return to work, all his anti-business regulations crippling entrepreneurs, all his anti-energy actions forcing us to rely on foreign oil from Arab Muslim dictatorships, and all his trade deals driving American manufacturing out of business — while shoveling our tax dollars into sweetheart deals with losers like Solyndra and into “shovel-ready” jobs that were never going to materialize but only would enrich and line the pockets of Obama friends and supporters — the Wasted Obama Decade managed to emerge with a dead economy. And then came Trump.

Can you imagine if China Virus 19 had come under Obama–Biden? The economy now would look like a return to Fred and Wilma Flintstone with Barney and Betty Rubble. America really would have the Green New Deal, with cars running not on gasoline but on two feet pitter-pattering under every vehicle. If this China Virus 19 had started with the Dow Jones at 18,000 instead of 29,000, where would it be now under Biden–Obama? Again, just watch an episode of The Flintstones. Thanks to Trump, we had an economic cushion. Yabba-dabba-doo.

G-d forbid that we would have a Biden in the Oval Office at a time like this. Just imagine his press conference: “I have met with my experts, and we are prepared now to fight rubella — uh, small pox — until we defeat every pock, big or small. And that’s exactly what Barack and I did a few years ago when we fought the Black Death together. That’s when me and Barack coined the phrase ‘Black Death Matters.’ Remember?” Can you imagine Biden restoring the country, the economy when this China Virus 19 blows over?

The forthcoming course of China Virus 19 is hard to predict, and we cannot know now what will be in August and September, six months from now. Trump has assembled an excellent leadership team, and the country has excellent resources and world-class medical personnel to calm the national mood and pursue strategies. Instead of having Biden and Democrats in power beating up on the pharmaceutical companies, this is precisely the time for a pro-business president to be in the White House, encouraging businesses to take risks and to move quickly though responsibly. This is the time for a pro-business president to be at the helm, encouraging manufacturers like General Motors to retool as needed, to manufacture ventilators and whatever the CDC says we need, while we remove fear of litigation for the makers of protective masks.

For three years all the political experts on both sides have been jockeying and leveraging and investigating and impeaching, but the November 2020 election ultimately may turn not on whether you are better off today than you were four years ago — but on whether you want to return rapidly to the greatness you only recently experienced under a dynamic leader or to sputter backwards under a blowhard who talks a quasi-coherent talk and who has a documented record of voting the wrong way on major issues for decades. Biden has spent much of the past year apologizing for many of the most critical votes he ever cast. G-d forbid that we have a bumbler like him in power at a time like this.",https://spectator.org/dont-blame-nixon-for-chinas-rise/,2020-03-24
Trump Hits Communist China and Liberal Universities - The American Spectator,"President Trump this week delivered a blow against the corrupt communist Chinese and our corrupt liberal universities. The double-whammy was a delicious slap that few noticed, including the president’s supporters.

Unbeknownst to the vast majority of Americans, including conservatives, the Chinese government has been busily establishing so-called Confucius Institutes on campuses all across the country. These centers are directly funded and largely staffed by the Chinese government, where they can present a cozy Shining-City-on-a-Hill version of Beijing. Liberal universities have rolled out the red carpet for these institutes, so long as the Chinese gravy-train ladles out the cash. If there’s one thing to make an educrat salivate, it’s a cash-cow. Apparently, for many universities, it doesn’t matter much if the milk comes from Uncle Sam or Chairman Xi.

The progressives on the university front are happy to drink up, and their hypocrisy is quite distasteful. Liberal academics gnashing their teeth over Russian meddling in the 2016 election against their beloved Hillary allow the Chinese to meddle on their campuses.

And not merely meddle. As noted by FBI Director Christopher Wray, some Confucius Institutes may be engaged in espionage, notably at universities with top-notch research and STEM programs. The FBI, says Wray, is “warily” watching these groups.

That’s a good thing, given that many of the universities don’t seem to be warily watching.

How many campuses are involved? A handful? A dozen? No, over a hundred, according to the National Association of Scholars (NAS), which has done yeoman’s work on this matter, even creating a list of the colleges. A rare organization that fights for genuine diversity in college classrooms, NAS has been on this issue, namely with a ground-breaking report in 2017, titled, Outsourced to China. Rachelle Peterson, NAS’s director of research projects, has followed the money and the chain of command for the Confucius Institutes. She details how the institutes are a project of the Chinese government run through a front-group agency called the Hanban. The Hanban funds the institutes and staffs them with “teachers” carefully vetted, screened, and trained by the Hanban.

(A crucial sidenote beyond the higher-ed aspect: NAS states that the Hanban has some 500 “Confucius Classrooms” in K-12 schools across America, which is surely another scandal waiting to be exposed. How many of our government schools are opening their doors and wallets to the Chi-comms?)

The whole thing stinks of what the Kremlin used to run with its bogus KGB-controlled “cultural exchange” programs. (A hilarious case I’ve written about is Oleg Kalugin, the later KGB defector, who in 1959 was placed by Moscow in Columbia University’s School of Journalism, where he and the Kremlin duped his progressive hosts into thinking he was a happy, innocent student from Russia. The young KGB officer went into Columbia under the cover of a Fulbright study exchange program.)

So, what did President Trump do to change this?

On Monday, Trump signed the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act. The $717 billion budget features some big-ticket military items that Trump says will constitute “the most significant investment in our military and our war fighters in modern history.”

But equally important is what the funding does not include: The National Defense Authorization Act includes a provision to limit funding to colleges and universities with Confucius Institutes. The act was passed by both the Senate and the House. And there, mainly in the Senate, great credit goes to Trump campaign rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, who have done excellent work exposing this quiet scandal on college campuses.

“Their goal is to exploit America’s academic freedom to instill in the minds of future leaders a pro-China viewpoint,” states Marco Rubio. Rubio urged all educational institutions hosting Confucius Institutes in his home state of Florida (there are four of them) to end the partnerships.

Ted Cruz has been especially vigilant. “Communist China is infiltrating American universities to meddle with our curricula, silence criticism of their regime, and steal intellectual property, including sensitive dual-use research,” says Cruz. He calls the Confucius Institutes “the velvet glove around the iron fist of the [Chinese government’s] campaigns on our campuses.”

Cruz put forward a crucial amendment that would prohibit funding. He introduced legislation titled the Stop Higher Education Espionage and Theft Act, which attempted to monitor Confucius Institutes and other sources of foreign interference in American higher education. Cruz’s legislation required the FBI to create a list of “foreign intelligence threats to higher education.”

Trump’s signature on Monday responds to this. As noted by Josh Rogin of the Washington Post, who has followed this topic more consistently than probably any other columnist, and who understands the legislative language, the National Defense Authorization Act that President Trump signed technically bars “any U.S. university from using Pentagon resources for any program involving Confucius Institutes, Chinese government-funded language schools embedded inside U.S. colleges.”

It’s a great move by President Trump, long overdue. President Obama certainly didn’t take such action. We can firmly doubt that a President Hillary Clinton would have either.

And it’s especially refreshing to see these colleges held accountable. This country’s scandalously biased, monolithic, left-wing universities, which already bilk the nation’s youth with massive amounts of unsustainable debt, as they take wads of cash from federal and state governments, happily look to Red China for more money. Liberals permit universities to get away with their financial excesses because the universities serve as the primary training ground for developing liberals. Our universities are already centers of leftist indoctrination, whether pushing toxic ideologies under the guise of critical theory or “queer theory” or gender theory or “intersectionality” or whatever other intellectual twaddle. Now they also want to become centers for communist China?

Kudos to President Trump — and the likes of Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and the National Association of Scholars — for responding to this with some hardball.

Trump Tariffs Only Tip of the Iceberg for China - The American Spectator,"China can’t get out of its own way.

At a Foreign Affairs Congressional Hearing last Wednesday, a panel of congressman and economists agreed that action needs to be taken against China’s “predatory trade practices.” What that looks like, however, is up for debate. Luckily for the panel, they may not have to decide.

Will the Year of the Dog turn to Year of the Bear? The Chinese economy is precariously sitting on massive amounts of debt, forcing President Jinping into a policy of “deleveraging” this past year. Simply put, deleveraging is a shifting of fiscal policy. Money once intended for state-sponsored industries is redirected towards debt retirement.

With the Yuan weakening, business defaults increasing, and trade concerns escalating, Jinping and Co. have had to call an audible. Recent Politburo meetings suggest the end of deleveraging, at least for now. In what can be compared to stripping planks from a ship’s hull to fix the mast, capital once devoted for debt payments is moving back to state businesses. In this way, Jinping hopes to reignite the domestic economy.

As of Friday, the state investment fund, Chinese Investment Corp., has asked permission from the central government to steer investments into the domestic economy. Since its creation in 2007, the fund has only been allowed to invest internationally.

So why now? Take it as a sign of desperation—Chinese businesses are capital starved and will continue collapsing without it.

Trump’s tariffs are both magnifying and intensifying the problem. The tariffs are expected to shear some 0.3% off Chinese GDP, no decimal to scoff at. Yet, considering all the other problems in the Orient, what’s a few missed shipments?

China’s export-based economy is serviced on untenable mountains of debt. If Jinping wants to keep the Mandate of Heaven, he needs to take care of things down here on earth, starting with his credit card. For once, it would be great if congress did not do anything.",https://spectator.org/dreams-of-splendor-the-decline-and-fall-of-traditional-china/,2018-07-16
Trump to North Korea Is Nixon Goes to China - The American Spectator,"The news was a blockbuster.

President Donald Trump had agreed to sit down with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. Here is the story as headlined by Fox:

Trump will accept Kim Jong Un’s invitation to meet, White House says

The story begins:

President Trump will accept an invitation by North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un to meet, the White House confirmed Thursday night, in a dramatic development after months of sabre-rattling between the two world leaders. Kim extended an invitation to meet with Trump and the president agreed that the two would meet by May, South Korean National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong announced at the White House. “President Trump greatly appreciates the nice words of the South Korean delegation and President Moon,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. “He will accept the invitation to meet with Kim Jong Un at a place and time to be determined. We look forward to the denuclearization of North Korea. In the meantime, all sanctions and maximum pressure must remain.”

And what does this remind?

If one is old enough to recall the shock in the day, it is the announcement in 1971 that the legendary-anti-Communist President Richard Nixon would be going to China to meet with China’s tyrannical Communist Chairman Mao Zedong.

Nixon’s then- national security advisor and later Secretary of State Henry Kissinger would write of this totally unpredicted event:

On the third anniversary of Nixon’s Inauguration Day (1971) we were in the thick of planning an event nobody imagined possible in 1969: the visit of a United States President to Peking.… China was not important to us because it was physically powerful; Chou En-lai was surely right in his repeated protestations that his nation was not a superpower. In fact, had China been stronger it would not have pursued the improvement of relations with us with the same single-mindedness. Peking [now Beijing] needed us to help break out of its isolation and as a counterweight to the potentially mortal threat along its northern border [the Soviet Union]. We needed China to enhance the flexibility of our diplomacy. Gone were the days when we enjoyed the luxury of choosing the moment to involve ourselves in world affairs. We were permanently involved — but not so physically or morally predominant as before. We had to take account of other power centers and strive for an equilibrium among them. The China initiative also restored perspective to our national policy. It reduced Indochina to its proper scale — a small peninsula on a major continent. Its drama eased for the American people the pain that would inevitably accompany our withdrawal from Southeast Asia. And it brought balance into the perceptions of our friends around the world.

Change a few things here and there and what we have in this description of the legendary ex-Secretary of State about the events of Thursday night. In which we learned that, in essence, as Nixon went to China, Trump is going to sit down with North Korea.

After decades of letting the “experts” deal with North Korea, the United States now faces a North Korea that is by all accounts mere months from getting nuclear weapons. North Korea helped immeasurably by the Neville Chamberlain style of naïveté like this from then-President Bill Clinton in 1994:

“Good afternoon. I am pleased that the United States and North Korea yesterday reached agreement on the text of a framework document on North Korea’s nuclear program. This agreement will help to achieve a longstanding and vital American objective: an end to the threat of nuclear proliferation on the Korean Peninsula. “This agreement is good for the United States, good for our allies, and good for the safety of the entire world. It reduces the danger of the threat of nuclear spreading in the region. It’s a crucial step toward drawing North Korea into the global community.”

Not a word of this was true. Clinton’s assurances were as worthless as Chamberlain’s proclaimed promise of peace from Adolf Hitler in 1938. Chamberlain and Clinton had made the same exact mistake. Peace is not gained with weakness. As Ronald Reagan proclaimed and demonstrated in reality, peace was only gained through strength.

Not to put too fine a point on all of this, but here is the Jerusalem Post on North Korea and what it has been up to in Syria:

FORMER SYRIAN GENERAL: HEZBOLLAH IS IN POSSESSION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS According to General Sha’arq Zuhair al-Skeit, Tehran is building short- to medium-range missiles with chemical warheads in Syria.

The story says, among other things, this:

On the issue of Syrian cooperation with North Korea, Saqit confirmed that North Korea had indeed supplied Damascus with chemical weapons and assisted in their installation and operation against civilians. He also said that in his capacity as senior officer in the Syrian Army, he accompanied North Korean officers who came to advise on chemical weapons for the various units.

So. What do we have here?

What we have here is Nixon goes to China, or Reagan’s Peace Through Strength that ended the Cold War. President Trump has made it abundantly clear that he is more than willing to use peace through strength — which is to say nuclear weapons — to stop Kim Jong Un in his tracks.

Suddenly, Kim wants to talk.

Shocker.

Trump Touts the Great Deal of China - The American Spectator,"A trade deal with China could finally be here! It’s a good one, too, according to President Donald Trump, who said last week, “So, we just made what, I guess, is one of the biggest deals that’s been made in a long time, with China.” He added, “If you look at the deal, the deal is so incredible. The deal is a great deal.” Then we learned that there isn’t actually a real deal yet, just a tentative proposal. It’s also far from the comprehensive deal that Trump once promised.

Either way, one must ask: Was it worth it?

The president is understandably eager to make the case for his tariff strategy. Yet, objectively, the deal is at best a minideal. At worst, it’s a joke that pretty much fails to accomplish the goals Trump was trying to achieve. Most noticeably, it fails to get a commitment from the Chinese government to give up its protectionist and authoritarian grip on its economy. It’s also unclear as to whether the deal will succeed in forcing China to stop asking foreign companies to hand over trade secrets. And China will undoubtedly continue to use its state-owned enterprises to artificially direct resources toward — and subsidize — favored industries.

Worst of all, the deal would actually reinforce these Chinese behaviors. For instance, the deal in question would require that China use its state-owned enterprises to buy $40 billion to $50 billion worth of American agricultural products annually — instead of the roughly $20 billion it bought previously. That’s no victory. That’s a concession China already agreed to more than two years ago. And that’s pursuing the very sort of top-down, government-directed policy Trump claimed he wanted to change in the first place.

Unfortunately, thanks to a profound misunderstanding about the value of exports, the president may receive some praise for getting China to commit to buying more U.S. soybeans. While it may be very counterintuitive to most people, economists understand that exports are valuable goods that we give up in exchange for imports; exports themselves are costs, rather than benefits.

Think about it this way: When you go to work in the morning, you export your services to your boss in exchange for wages, which, in this illustration, are an import. Even if you love working and derive value from it, for the most part you export your work in exchange for your wages and the goods and services that you can then buy with them. Imports, and the consumption they allow, are the goal of trade — not exports. As George Mason University’s Donald Boudreaux notes, “What is true at the level of the household is here true at the level of the national economy: the goods and services that Americans export to foreigners are the costs that we willingly incur in order to be able to import into our country the goods and services that we receive from foreigners in exchange.”

It’s hard to jump for joy at the opportunity cost of Trump’s strategy. After almost four years of lavish rhetoric against China, tariffs all over the place, manufacturing slowdowns and rampant uncertainty, Trump got China to agree to very few concessions. Meanwhile, the United States will maintain those punishing tariffs on roughly $360 billion worth of imports. This means the supply chain will continue to be disrupted at the expense of American companies and consumers.

Moreover, Daniel Mitchell of the Center for Freedom and Prosperity highlights another opportunity cost of the Trump strategy that’s often ignored by commentators. He writes, “Just imagine, by contrast, where we would be if Trump had joined with our allies and used the World Trade Organization to go after China’s mercantilist policies. We’d be in much better shape today.” If you don’t buy it, look at the reduction in tariffs China agreed to for many other countries while simultaneously increasing tariffs on American exports. And take note of the many trade deals our trading partners have implemented with one another since the beginning of this trade war.

In light of all that, you can’t seriously see the trade war, even one that ends up with this minideal, as a win for the United States.

Trump Zig-Zags on Trade Talks With China - The American Spectator,"President Donald Trump has spent his entire adult life railing against the excesses — and damage — that untrammeled “Free Trade” has done to the United States and the majority of Americans. In many ways, his surprise victory in the 2016 presidential election (it was only a surprise to the very same free trade cultists he railed against) was as much a repudiation of the free trading dogmas of neoliberalism as it was a denunciation of the expansive foreign policies championed by neoconservatives.

Recently, the president has engaged in what some are calling a low-grade trade war with the People’s Republic of China. While most Trump supporters knew that holding China’s proverbial feet to the fire would not be an easy task, few could have guessed that Trump himself would complicate his own efforts to rein in China’s unfettered, decades-long, economic war against the United States.

Several events happened in the past week.

First, the Chinese raised the stakes in the ongoing — tense — trade negotiations with the United States. President Trump has reiterated his commitment to getting China to lower the $375 billion trade deficit with the United States. Of course, this is easier said than done (mainly because the trade deficit with China is a sign of lagging production in the United States that China has picked up, and the question remains as to how the United States would pick up that slack, should China reduce the trade deficit).

Second, North Korea pulled out of the scheduled conference with South Korea. Pyongyang claimed this was to protest the upcoming joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea. Although, it is likely that Pyongyang was helping China to raise the stakes on the United States in Beijing’s ongoing trade talks with Washington.

Third, Peter Navarro, the controversial White House trade adviser known for his extreme positions on trade protectionism, was granted access to the next round of Sino-American trade talks, after having initially been disinvited from the talks.

Fourth, Trump’s tweeted last week intimating his willingness to grant critical concessions to the Chinese telecommunications giant (and state-owned corporation), ZTE. In exchange for allowing American agricultural firms to sell previously banned farming equipment in China, as well as potentially having invested in a Trump Organization property in Indonesia, the American side would relieve ZTE of onerous trade restrictions imposed earlier in the year on the Chinese tech firm.

Should President Trump relieve the ZTE Corporation — or any other Chinese state owned tech firm — from trade restrictions imposed to protect American national security, he would not only betray his constitutional duty to protect the country as president, but he would also further contribute to the destruction of the American economy. Just as the previous two decades saw the Chinese take advantage of the American manufacturing sector in order to build up its own strength relative to America’s, Beijing is now pivoting and seeking to gut the United States of its high-tech, white-collar sectors.

Critical support for science, technology, engineering, and math education programs for its young; an emphasis on technological and scientific development above all else (as defined in the Chinese Communist Party’s National Science, Technology, and Innovation Plan); and copious investments made into cutting-edge, next-generation technological development (everything from quantum computing to the quantum internet, artificial intelligence, and nuclear fusion research to name a few areas) have allowed for China to directly compete with the United States for global dominance. Granting ZTE the ability to take over American firms, such as Qualcomm, the wireless networking company, would only further China’s interests — at American expense.

Presently, Qualcomm is a leading innovator in the development of wireless technologies, such as the 5G network. It is essential for the integration of the “internet of things”; Qualcomm provides a large portion of U.S. government cellular devices; and Qualcomm plays a pivotal role in ensuring America’s overall cyber security. Should ZTE be given sanctions relief, they would then have access to all of these strategic assets. Further, if the Trump Administration lessened the sanctions on ZTE, then China would gain access to information needed to build semiconductors indigenously. A homegrown semiconductor capability is the last stumbling block in China’s epic quest to displace the United States in the tech sector (and, eventually, in all other areas).

For the Trump Administration to consider giving in to China during these difficult trade negotiations is bad enough. But, to abandon the president’s steadfast commitment to trade protectionism — particularly in the area of semiconductors, America’s silent advantage over China — in favor of winning some paltry deals that would benefit American farmers or enrich the coffers of the Trump Organization’s real estate empire would be a terrible betrayal. Thankfully, it would appear that President Trump has rightly reversed course on any self-destructive deal.

Not only should Trump intensify his pressure campaign on China over trade, but he should also let ZTE die. It is a direct national security threat that, if left unchecked, would lead to the long-term degradation of America’s strategic dominance and give our great rival a significant competitive edge in global economics. Time will tell what the Trump Administration will do.

One thing is clear: The White House is looking for a soft landing to its hard stances on trade with China. Perhaps China has already won this round of the trade war. But, if the White House holds strong, it just might exact the concessions it needs from China without sacrificing American national security.",https://spectator.org/export-import-bank-china-program/,2018-05-21
Trump’s China Policy: Chaos and Success - The American Spectator,"Josh Rogin’s book Chaos Under Heaven is a less than admiring look at the convoluted evolution of the Trump administration’s strategy for dealing with China. Rogin, who writes for the Washington Post, details the infighting among Trump advisers and blames President Trump for failing to implement a consistent policy towards China, except in the last year of his administration. Yet, in the end Rogin concludes that Trump eventually got it right by confronting China on trade, Taiwan, the South China Sea, human rights, and its obfuscation about the true source of the COVID-19 virus.

Rogin’s book is not history, but rather journalism’s “first take” on Trump’s China policy, and is based in part on interviews with Trump officials, many of whom are named in the book. This is not a Bob Woodward-style anonymous source marathon. It is, however, a Washington-insider book, filled with details about policy disputes and power competitions among Washington officials and bureaucrats. And Rogin, unlike Woodward in his many books about presidential administrations, plays no favorites. Just about every major Trump administration official who weighed in on China policy during four years receives Rogin’s unsparing observations and judgments.

Rogin divides the Trump team into superhawks (led by Steve Bannon, Peter Navarro, and Stephen Miller), hardliners (including Matt Pottinger, Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, and Robert O’Brien), accommodationists (led by Steve Mnuchin, Gary Cohn and Larry Kudlow), and a group he calls the “Axis of Adults” (Rex Tillerson, James Mattis, H.R. McMaster, and John Kelly). And then there were Trump family members — most prominently Jared Kushner — who Rogin believes had an outsized role in shaping policy despite their lack of qualifications.

President Trump himself, according to Rogin, was all over the map on China policy. Trump switched from confrontation to accommodation, and then back again, seemingly oblivious to the contradictions and policy implications. At times, it seemed the superhawks had Trump’s ear, but at other times, the accommodationists and Trump’s business friends (who had “business” with China) gained his favor. And Kushner brought Henry Kissinger — with long ties to China — briefly into Trump’s China policy circle.

Rogin also notes Trump’s tendency — shared by previous presidents — to personalize relations with foreign leaders. Trump would refer to China’s President Xi Jinping as “my good friend” and tweeted congratulations to Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th anniversary of the communists seizing power, seemingly unaware that for the Chinese people, it has been 70 years of repression under the totalitarian rule of a one-party state. And Trump wanted very much to achieve a trade deal with China, and this desire sometimes led the administration to downplay the international aggression and internal repression of the Chinese regime.

But when Rogin switches from Washington-insider journalist to geopolitical analyst, he recognizes the important strides the Trump administration made in awakening America and its allies to the existential threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). This was in stark contrast to the Obama administration which failed to appreciate, in Rogin’s words, that “the Chinese government was becoming more externally aggressive, more internally repressive, and more totalitarian in its politics and economics, fusing state and business in a coordinated strategy not to join the world order that the United States and its partners had built after World War II but rather to undermine that system and replace it with one suited to China’s interests — and one that would protect the party’s survival and success above all.” Rogin accuses Obama of approaching China with “willful blindness to the changing reality,” emphasizing cooperation over competition, and “where most uncomfortable issues were swept under the rug.” Rogin suggests that the CCP in 2016 hoped that a President Hillary Clinton administration would continue the Obama approach.

After all of the fits and starts of the first three years, Trump “gave the green light for his national security team to take whatever policies to push back in China’s malign behavior they had sitting on the shelf and let them fly.” Trump imposed and maintained tariffs on Chinese goods. He beefed up America’s military capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region and strengthened alliances with India, Japan, and Australia. The Justice Department prioritized investigations and prosecutions of Chinese scientists who stole research from U.S. universities. Trump’s Commerce Department sanctioned Chinese companies for human rights abuses. The administration ended special trade benefits for Hong Kong after China’s brutal crackdown there. And the president and his top national security officials delivered what Rogin calls “a series of tough-on-China speeches” that emphasized “the urgent need to confront the Chinese government’s threats across the board,” including calling for China to be held responsible for the deadly COVID-19 virus that more and more evidence shows likely emerged from the Wuhan lab.

The hardliners and the superhawks of the Trump administration were right. They “ultimately succeeded,” Rogin concludes, “in moving the government closer to a competitive stance vis-a-vis China than any administration that had come before.” Trump’s greatest accomplishment, according to Rogin, was to shift “the conversation about China in a way that cannot be undone.” The Trump hardliners helped awaken the American people and the world, Rogin writes, “to the scope and scale of the China challenge.”",https://spectator.org/fauci-china-covid-leak/,2021-10-07
Trump’s Increasing Advantage From Highlighting China’s Coronavirus Connection - The American Spectator,"By emphasizing China’s coronavirus connection, Trump hurts Biden and splits Democrats. Each day makes China’s culpability for coronavirus clearer; simultaneously, Trump’s political advantage for highlighting this grows. By underscoring China’s responsibility, Trump pins Biden with his worst campaign gaffe, while forcing Democrats to either be tough on Biden or soft on Beijing.

America already broadly disliked China before coronavirus. Its trade policies beggared the U.S. through IP theft, dumping, and favoritism at home. Its anti-democratic policies and suppression of minorities were politically and morally repugnant. Its aggressive foreign policy made it a military threat.

Coronavirus now takes America’s view of China to depths unseen in decades. The question is not about China’s culpability, but about its extent. With over 70,000 deaths, 1.2 million confirmed cases, and 30 million unemployed, Americans are justifiably angry at what was, at the very least, China’s coverup.

Already more than justified in calling China out, President Trump has held back only in deference to his signature trade victory there. But his domestic political advantage now increasingly outweighs his former hesitance.

America has reached its China verdict. Being on the right side of lopsided issues is where smart politicians go — it is better to lead than follow. With China and coronavirus, Trump can go there; Biden cannot.

It seems impossible to pick a worst soundbite from Biden’s litany. Still, the one with biggest negative repercussions is undoubtedly last year’s in Iowa, when he inexplicably claimed China was “not competition” for America: “China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man … I mean, you know, they’re not bad folks, folks. But guess what? They’re not competition for us.”

Biden was wrong then and is proved more so daily. Coronavirus adds an exclamation mark to that conclusion.

Trump hitting China forces Biden back on his ill-considered comment. Biden must either agree with Trump and disagree with his prior self, or he must disagree with Trump and America in order to stay consistent with his past.

There is no good outcome for Biden here. He has no choice but to join in condemning China. That means he must explain last year’s faux pas, and Biden explaining anything is a recipe for disaster.

Trump attacking China also forces Democrats into Biden’s dilemma. They either must contradict public opinion or their nominee. Again, the answer is a no-brainer, but for Democrats it is also no-win. Adding insult to injury, taking the obvious anti-China route also means siding with Trump.

Further splitting an already divided party only benefits Trump and Republicans. This split also falls on their most sensitive fault line running between their ascendant left and dwindling moderate wings.

For most, there is clear connection between China’s authoritarian communism and its gross mishandling of the global coronavirus crisis. Yet it’s not an easy one to make for Democrats eager to curry favor with their left — a left not inherently predisposed against China’s communist regime. Losing support from the left means Democrats losing desperately needed November voters.

Hitting China for coronavirus now does so much good for Trump, and so much bad for Democrats.

China was already a bad actor in American eyes. Coronavirus now makes them a pariah, and only sinking further with America’s mounting costs in deaths and dollars.

Recounting China’s role also undermines Democrat attempts to stick the Trump administration with responsibility. Although seemingly a lifetime ago, Trump’s impeachment trial was just months ago. Democrats have eagerly pursued investigations against every facet of the administration. Coronavirus presents a tempting target — as evidenced by the Democrat House’s recent creation of a coronavirus oversight committee — if not blocked.

Finally, calling out China puts Biden and Democrats in terrible spots at terrible times. Biden cannot follow Trump in blaming China without resurrecting his China dismissal of last year. He cannot maintain his earlier denial now, but he also cannot renounce it without flip-flopping.

The Democrats’ choice is no less excruciating. They must choose between implicitly opposing their nominee or explicitly appeasing China. Both carry serious ramifications for party unity.

The coronavirus story is not going away. As China’s involvement increasingly manifests, Trump’s political opportunity only grows, and with it the Democrats’ vulnerability.

U.S. China Policy at the Crossroads: Containment or Liberation? - The American Spectator,"The Biden administration’s early rhetoric on China, unsurprisingly, mimics the Obama approach of engagement and competition. In a speech at the State Department on February 4, the president said, “We’ll confront China’s economic abuses; counter its aggressive, coercive action; to push back on China’s attack on human rights, intellectual property, and global governance. But we are ready to work with Beijing when it’s in America’s interest to do so.” Biden later said that China should be prepared for “extreme competition” with the United States but explained that this did not mean “conflict.” Key Biden national security advisers Jake Sullivan and Kurt Campbell have in the past promoted a policy of “clear-eyed coexistence” with China. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Biden’s nominee for trade chief Katherine Tai, meanwhile, have labeled China both a competitor and a partner.

The new president’s foreign policy team consists mostly of former Obama staffers who previously announced a “pivot” or “rebalance” to the Asia-Pacific. It was during those same Obama years that China’s President Xi Jinping launched the Belt and Road Initiative and proclaimed the “China dream” — a vision or goal of China replacing the United States as the organizer of the global order. The Obama “pivot” or “rebalance” was long on rhetoric but short on actions.

The engagement/competition approach reaches back to the Nixon–Kissinger “opening” to China in the early 1970s, which exploited the Sino-Soviet split and laid some of the groundwork for the Reagan administration’s victory in the Cold War. The West’s victory over the Soviet Empire, however, is a tale of two versions of history. One version credits the West’s victory to the long, patient policy of Containment that was most compellingly explained by George F. Kennan in his seminal article in Foreign Affairs, “The Sources of Soviet Conduct.” The other version recognizes Containment’s contribution to the West’s Cold War victory, but credits President Reagan’s more confrontational policy in the 1980s for the final defeat of Soviet communism and the liberation of the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe.

Containment or Liberation? It is the title of one of James Burnham’s great post–World War II books, which was published in 1952. In the book, Burnham brilliantly dissected the weaknesses of Kennan’s Containment doctrine and proposed an alternative policy of Liberation. And Burnham’s policy prescriptions in Containment or Liberation? uncannily foreshadowed Reagan’s policies in the 1980s.

Burnham understood the nature of communism better than most Western policymakers, in part, because he flirted with Marxism in the 1930s. After breaking with communism in 1940, Burnham wrote two books — The Managerial Revolution (1941) and The Machiavellians (1943) — that combined sociopolitical observations and geopolitical analysis. During World War II, he joined the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and wrote a paper in the spring of 1944 that envisioned the emerging Cold War struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union.

After the war, Burnham wrote a Cold War trilogy — The Struggle for the World (1947), The Coming Defeat of Communism (1950), and Containment or Liberation? (1952). He later became a founding editor of William F. Buckley Jr.’s National Review, where for more than two decades he wrote a regular column on the Cold War.

Burnham and Kennan knew each other, and for a time they both worked on formulating and implementing “political subversive warfare” against the Soviet Empire. Both were anti-communists. Both understood geopolitics. Both wanted the West to emerge victorious in the Cold War struggle with the Soviet Union. Kennan believed that a defensive but “firm and vigilant” Containment policy would result over time in the Soviet Empire’s “break-up” or “gradual mellowing.” Burnham, on the other hand, viewed Containment as too defensive — it ceded the geopolitical initiative to the Soviets and failed to exploit Soviet weaknesses. Ironically, Kennan in his memoirs described Containment or Liberation? as “well-written and persuasive.”

Burnham’s policy of Liberation had five main components: (1) an ideological propaganda offensive against Soviet communism; (2) fomenting dissent within the empire, especially in Eastern and Central Europe; (3) waging economic and technological warfare against the vulnerable Soviet economic system; (4) using psycho-political warfare to encourage divisions and fear within the communist ruling elite; and (5) putting the Soviets on the geopolitical defensive. Ronald Reagan’s winning strategy in the 1980s reflected each of these components.

Most liberals and Democrats (including George Kennan), however, refused to attribute the West’s Cold War victory to Reagan. Many on the left gave most of the credit to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Other liberals (and some conservatives) saw the collapse of the Soviet Union as a vindication of Kennan and Containment.

Why does any of this matter today? Because those who view the end of the Cold War through the lens of Kennan and Containment (such as the Biden foreign policy team) are more likely to favor the more defensive engagement/competition approach to the Chinese communist regime, while those who credit Reagan for winning the Cold War (as most of President Trump’s key foreign policy advisers did) are more likely to favor a more offensive, Burnhamite confrontational approach to meeting the Chinese challenge.

Interestingly, two recent policy papers — “The Longer Telegram: Toward a new American China strategy” authored by an anonymous former U.S. national security official, and “Seizing On Weakness: Allied Strategy for Competing with China’s Globalizing Military,” by China expert Toshi Yoshihara and Jack Bianchi — both lean toward Burnham’s Liberation strategy in that they recommend a robust military posture in the Indo-Pacific and policies that target the weaknesses of the Chinese communist regime.

America’s China policy is at a crossroads. Beijing has made it unmistakably clear that it seeks to extend its influence throughout the Eurasian landmass and to control its adjacent seas and develop a global naval presence. That is the geopolitical essence of the Belt and Road Initiative and the PLA Navy’s aggressive moves in the South China Sea. The policy of engagement/competition made sense when Nixon used it to widen the Sino-Soviet split. It was a policy that every successive U.S. administration followed, including after the end of the Cold War, even as China grew economically and militarily, until the Trump presidency reversed course.

Trump and his key advisers recognized that the United States and its allies are once again faced with an existential threat from a globally ambitious communist giant. The Trump approach to China gradually became more confrontational — and, militarily, Trump put meat on the bones of the “pivot” to the Indo-Pacific. The early Biden administration is signaling a more passive and less confrontational approach. It’s back to Kennan/Burnham and the early 1950s: Containment or Liberation?

In the 1950s, the United States chose Containment, and Cold War I dragged on through four more decades, during which the millions of enslaved peoples within the communist empire continued to suffer while the United States was forced to devote more and more resources to national defense. Cold War II — for that is what best describes the current U.S.–China rivalry — is in its early stages. How long Cold War II lasts, how many more years the Chinese people and minorities within China’s empire continue to suffer, and how many more precious resources the United States will have to devote to defense and national security will depend on policy choices made today.

Should China win Cold War II, the world will be a very different place, and the liberal world order that has brought freedom and prosperity to so many people will be replaced by an illiberal, autocratic one. These are the stakes.",https://spectator.org/fauci-emails-lab-leak-china/,2021-03-02
Democracies Should Delink From China - The American Spectator,"While the democratic countries all realize that they must do something to counter the expansion of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), there is little consensus on the best way to achieve it. In order to protect the democratic countries from the CCP’s expansion, the democracies must push China to change, and an effective way to do so is to delink from China.

What Path Do We Want China to Take?

Below are some possibilities:

1. A democratic China emerges based on the rule of law, both in domestic and international affairs. As we all know, this is highly unlikely.

2. The CCP adopts some rule of law and allows some political liberty and more room for unofficial media in China, although it does not allow political participation such as free elections. Foreign firms and people are more secure in China. This sounds more like Hong Kong’s system before the new National Security Law. This may be possible if there is a coalition by the democratic countries that can effectively pressure China to do it.

3. China becomes more isolated. This will happen if the democracies divest from China. This will worsen the Chinese economy, and more infights will emerge in China.

4. The status quo: China remains under the CCP dictatorship and keeps taking advantage of the open societies of the democracies.

Using democracy based on the rule of law as the ideal, the first option is the best, and the second option is the second best. Both are preferred to the status quo.

A Strategy to Achieve the Preferred Goal

In order to achieve the first or second option, the democracies should first make China into the third option, a more isolated China. As I will show, China cannot afford to be isolated, and thus isolation will force it to change.

Why Delinking?

The engagement approach, which is still more or less the EU’s strategy, is logically flawed. The CCP’s running China is like the ringleader Fagin’s running his thieves’ house in London in Oliver Twist. Fagin’s gang can thrive because London allows it to steal. If London delinks from Fagin’s gang, the closed house of Fagin will force the thieves to infight and kill each other.

The success of the CCP/China depends on, first, the democracies opening their markets to China, and, second, the CCP ruling China with its dictatorship. This combination produces a Chinese workforce that obeys the CCP and at the same time is lawless internationally, harming the open societies of the democracies. The EU’s strategy that keeps China engaged and asks it to be lawful is not only ineffective but also allows the CCP to use both bribes and retaliation to train the EU to behave according to the CCP’s preferences.

The above analysis shows that a China under dictatorship going global is more dangerous and harmful to the democracies than a closed one. That’s because if China is closed, like Fagin’s house, it cannot extract new resources from unfair trade with the democracies, and it will degenerate into infighting like the Cultural Revolution under Mao. The CCP clearly realizes that its current model (keeping China under dictatorship and demanding the democracies to be open to it) is vital for its success and thus strongly opposes delinking.

Delinking from China is not the goal in itself, but an effective means to achieve the goal of making China play by the rules.

There will be strong resistance from the multinational corporations and Wall Street investors who have been deeply entangled with the CCP and making money in China. But pushing China to change is in their best long-term interest, for their profits from China are based on bribery, corruption, and most importantly the CCP’s whims. There is no security in markets or property rights in China. Lasting security and profitability can only be achieved if the CCP/China obeys the rule of law.

China v. Democracies: Who Needs Whom More?

Delinking will hurt the democracies. But this is temporary. In the long-term, democracies can readjust and benefit from trading with each other and with the less developed countries who are democratizing.

In contrast, dictatorships are predatory and cannot realize the full benefits of trade when dealing with each other.

Furthermore, if a dictatorship is closed, it will degenerate into infighting.

The only way for a dictatorship like the CCP’s China to thrive is to trade with the democracies.

In sum, China under the CCP’s dictatorship needs the democracies more than the latter needs China. The democracies have more bargaining power in the game than the CCP. And as such, the democratic countries should stand firm on their principles in demanding that China change.

Can the Delinking Strategy Fail?

Even if the democracies are not effective in forcing China to play by the rules, delinking will provide more protection for their democratic system from being encroached upon by the CCP. A possible scenario of delinking is that China will form its own trading bloc with like-minded countries. But such a bloc is unlikely to be mutually beneficial due to the predatory nature of dictatorships.

Using the U.S. as an example, the table below shows the cost and benefit analysis of different Chinas for the democratic countries, from the status quo (China under communist rule and the world open to it), to a more isolated China, to a more rule-based China.

*Note: The total score is the sum of positive and negative points, where positive = 2, negative = -2, and others = 0.

As can be seen from Table 1, for the U.S. (or other democratic countries), keeping the status quo is the worst option; a more isolated China is more beneficial to the U.S., while a more rules-based China is the best, not only for the U.S. and the democracies but also for China.

Based on the above analysis, delinking can be a phase one goal in order to achieve the phase two goal — making China more rules-based. For this strategy to be most effective, all major democracies must adopt the same policy.

"U.S., China Play Trade War Chicken - The American Spectator","As the tariff war between the United States and China escalated Friday, a Trump adviser said the president would not back down.

China announced Friday it was ready to slap tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. goods if Trump follows through on his announced plan to impose 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods.

National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told Bloomberg Television the president is in the trade wars for the long haul, and would continue to press China for trade concessions.

“We’ve said many times: no tariffs, no tariff barriers, no subsidies. We want to see trade reforms. China is not delivering, OK?” Kudlow said. “Their economy’s weak, their currency is weak, people are leaving the country. Don’t underestimate President Trump’s determination to follow through.”

Trump previously said he would like to see a world that eventually has no tariffs, but he’s pushing such duties in the short term to attempt to pressure other countries to come to the negotiating table on new trade deals. He has called China’s trade practices “predatory.”

The trade gap with China is significant, with the June total increasing to $33.5 billion from $32.6 billion. At this pace, the overall trade deficit for both goods and services in 2018 will surpass last year’s record number of $552 billion.

So far, other nations have responded by increasing their own tariffs, although European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker agreed in July to open trade discussions with the U.S. as long as Trump agreed not to impose any new tariffs on exports from the European Union during the talks.

Trump also put tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union, prompting Juncker’s response.

The Chinese Ministry of Finance announced on its website Friday that tariffs between 5 and 25 percent will be implemented on more than 5,000 different American imports. This includes higher duties on such products as meat and wine, and lower duties on such products as computers and planes.

“China’s differential tax rate countermeasures are rational and restrained,” the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on its website. “The implementation date will be subject to the actions of the U.S., and China reserves the right to continue introducing other countermeasures.”

The Trump administration previously added tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese products in July, and China responded with its own duties.

The People’s Bank of China implemented restrictions to shorting the yuan, the nation’s currency, to prepare for the economic fallout from the tariffs.

Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a group that represents major exporters, told Politico that businesses are becoming caught in the middle of the trade wars.

“You’re seeing tariffs go up and the adverse impacts, but you don’t know if that’s going to be a permanent state of affairs and the trade war never gets resolved, or whether you get some kind of deal that takes off the tariffs and opens up new opportunities,” he said.

The New York Times pointed out in an editorial that some of the detrimental economic effects of the tariffs can be unclear without further inspection. For example, Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs have cost Iowa hog producers $560 million already. Why? The prospect of retaliatory tariffs from Mexico on American pork sent the price of pigs tumbling.

China buys some 25 percent of American soybeans, putting domestic soybean farmers on pins and needles.

And The American Spectator recently wrote about the plight of craft brewers, who are seeing the cost of their aluminum cans increase, with many passing those costs on to the consumer.

"U.S., China Trade More Tariffs - The American Spectator","The trade war between the United States and China escalated Thursday with both countries implementing additional rounds of tariffs.

The U.S. imposed tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of Chinese goods. Some 279 products are affected, including plastic tubing, steam turbines, and railway cars.

Once President Trump’s latest round of tariffs went into effect, China responded with its own 25 percent duties on $16 billion in American imports, including a variety of chemical items and diesel fuel. China called its measures “necessary counterattacks.”

China pledged to file a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO), an admittedly laughable gesture given the country’s lack of respect for copyright law — and, well, human rights, but that’s unrelated to the WTO.

The U.S. and China have now slapped duties on $50 billion of each other’s goods. Trump said he implemented the tariffs in part for what he calls China’s unfair trade practices, which includes the theft of intellectual property. He hopes to reduce America’s trade deficit with China.

Trump told Reuters that “China’s done too well for too long, and they’ve become spoiled.”

Officials from the U.S. and China met in Washington, D.C., this week, but little progress was made in those talks, as Trump told Reuters he anticipated.

“In order for us to get a positive result out of these engagements, it’s really critical that they address the fundamental concerns that we have raised,” an unnamed Trump administration official said on a call with reporters, Business Insider reported. “We haven’t seen that yet, but we are going to continue to encourage them to address problems that we have raised.

“We hope that they will take seriously the concerns raised and that can put us on a better posture, both with respect to the issues that have been raised but also with the broader trade relationship,” the official said.

The trade war between the two countries could still escalate, but China would definitely end up on the short end of that stick — Trump has talked of more 25 percent tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods, but China could only respond with duties on $60 billion of goods from the U.S. because America exports less to China.

Chinese’s financial markets are also taking a hit as investors express concern about how the country could weather a trade war with the U.S. The country’s currency, the yuan, has seen its value against the American dollar drop in recent weeks.

Although the future in trade with China only gets cloudier, there are signs of progress on other fronts. Trump had planned to place additional 25 percent tariffs on cars and auto parts imported from the European Union, and while he reiterated that pledge at a campaign rally in West Virginia on Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross indicated the plan could be put on hold during trade talks with the EU and Canada and Mexico over the North America Free Trade Agreement.

While Canada has been scarce in recent discussions, the U.S. and Mexico have hammered out some agreements on a new NAFTA, although rules for auto production remain an issue of contention.

American businesses, meanwhile, report that the trade wars are causing their production costs to increase, which in turn forces them to raise prices for consumers and, in some cases, lay off workers.

Some companies, such as Harley-Davidson, are planning to shift some production overseas so they won’t be hit with the import tax in conducting business with the European Union, as The American Spectator previously reported. The iconic American motorcycle manufacturer faces hard hits from the EU in retaliation for Trump’s tariffs on aluminum and steel coming from the EU.

The effects could go beyond pocketbooks. Purolite CEO Stefan Brodie said at a hearing at the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office last month that tariffs could result in a reduced supply of chemicals used to purify water.

“By further reducing the supply of these products in the United States, the proposed tariffs threaten higher prices for U.S. consumers and a higher level of contaminants in American drinking water, food chain, waste water and chemicals,” Brodie said.",https://spectator.org/from-the-spectator-archives-appeasing-china-is-old-hat-for-prestigious-u-s-institutions/,2018-08-24
"U.S. Like Communist China, Needs Arab Spring - The American Spectator","Displaying the tone-deafness that doomed his presidential campaign, Jon Huntsman compared the current state of the Republican Party to Communist China. Complaining about the Republican National Committee’s decision to un-invite him from a fundraiser after he called for third party competition, Huntsman told reporters in New York, “This is what they do in China on party matters if you talk off script.”

Needless to say, the Communist Chinese can do a lot worse things to you than rescind your invitation to a posh fundraiser. Huntsman later explained he was “waxing philosophical.” It was precisely Huntsman’s tendency to express his extremely mild dissents from the GOP platform in such world historic terms, combined with his not-too-thinly veiled contempt for those to his right, that kept him an also-ran.

Not to be outdone, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wonders if America needs an “Arab spring” because the last vestiges of constitutionally limited government make it so darned hard to get anything done. (Presumably by Arab spring he doesn’t mean the Muslim Brotherhood taking over the government.) In recent years, all Washington has been able to ram through is Medicare Part D, No Child Left Behind, the Patriot Act, the Iraq war, Sarbanes-Oxley, TARP, the stimulus, Dodd-Frank, and Obamacare. I’m probably missing something. “We can’t be great as long as we remain a vetocracy rather than a democracy,” Friedman concludes.

US Returns to the Philippines to Fend Off China - The American Spectator,"Thirty years ago, as the post–Cold War era dawned, the United States formally transferred control of the U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay to the Philippine government. The Washington Post reported on Nov. 24, 1992, that the transfer ended 94 years of U.S. military presence in the archipelago. The previous year saw American air forces depart from Clark Air Base. The United States seized the Philippines from Spain after its victory in the Spanish–American War in 1898. But with a new Cold War brewing in the western Pacific, Kyodo News reports that the U.S. Navy will likely return to Subic Bay as part of a U.S.–Philippines Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement.

The United States still honors the 1951 Mutual Defense Pact with the Philippines, and relations between the two countries, which worsened during the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte, have since improved after Ferdinand Marcos Jr. became president. Marcos, son and namesake of a former Philippine president who was a staunch U.S. ally during the Cold War, reaffirmed the importance of the alliance with the United States soon after taking office in the summer of 2022.

Geography makes the Philippines a crucial anchor in a series of island arcs in the western Pacific that the United States and its allies in the region can use to contain China and its strategic partner Russia. In 1957, political geographers Hans Weigert and Eric Fischer produced a map of East Asia and the western Pacific that every American strategist and policymaker should display on his or her office wall. Weigert and Fischer described a “succession of marginal seas defined by an almost interminable chain of islands and archipelagos.”

“The continental mainland,” Weigert and Fischer noted, “is separated everywhere from the open oceans by a succession of partly enclosed seas, each protected and easily defended on the Pacific side by curving peninsular and island barriers.” The island arcs extend from the Aleutians to the Kuriles, to the main islands of Japan, to the southern Korean Peninsula, to the Ryukyus and Taiwan, then to the Philippines, Borneo, Australia, and Indonesia. The more U.S. and allied military power is based on and along these island chains, the more readily China can be contained in the western Pacific.

In his famous “Old Soldiers Never Die” address to Congress in 1951, Gen. Douglas MacArthur observed that the United States controls the Pacific Ocean “by a chain of islands extending in an arc from the Aleutians to the Mariannas [sic],” from which U.S. sea and air power can “dominate … every Asiatic port from Vladivostok to Singapore … and prevent hostile movement into the Pacific.” The same holds true today.

China’s military buildup — both conventional and nuclear — and its aggressive actions in the western Pacific have rightly, if belatedly, focused the minds of policymakers in the United States and its regional allies. Even the Biden administration, which has gone out of its way to avoid characterizing U.S. policy as “containment,” has appreciated the importance of the Philippines to U.S. security interests in the region. And while the United States has operated in the Philippines under a Visiting Forces Agreement since 1998, the impending return to Subic Bay and possibly five other locations on the archipelago is a clear indication that U.S. policymakers view the Philippines as critical to its western Pacific defense perimeter.

A few days ago, a senior Philippine defense official strongly criticized Chinese naval incursions into portions of the South China Sea claimed by Manila. China claims the entire South China Sea as its waters and has ignored rulings by The Hague’s Permanent Court of Arbitration that dismissed China’s claims.

Between 1898 and 1992, the U.S. maintained a large military presence in the Philippines, except from May 1942, when U.S. forces surrendered to Japan on Corregidor Island, to Oct. 20, 1944, when MacArthur fulfilled his promise to return. After U.S. forces took back Corregidor in early March 1945, MacArthur held a ceremony that involved raising the American flag once more on the flagpole on the edge of the parade field on Corregidor. MacArthur memorably remarked: “I see the old flagpole still stands. Have your troops hoist the colors to its peak, and let no enemy ever haul them down.” Three decades after U.S. forces left the Philippines, it appears they have returned.",https://spectator.org/general-says-u-s-intel-report-on-risks-of-doing-business-with-china-doesnt-go-far-enough/,2022-12-21
U.S. Should Go Postal on China - The American Spectator,"While the trade war between the U.S. and China has focused on various goods, America faces an imbalance in an area that may not seem obvious – postage.

Ever heard of the Universal Postal Union? That obscure body establishes rates for how much each country can charge consumers for mail that originates from other countries. China is considered by the UPU as a developing country, which means the postage is subsidized – countries like China and India get to pay rates far below cost to recipient nations.

This can really put a dent in American business. NPR’s Planet Money podcast recently talked with Jayme Smaldone, a New Jersey inventor who created a travel tumbler that’s hard to knock over called the Mighty Mug. Smaldone discovered he could order a Mighty Mug knockoff in China and it would be much cheaper to ship it across the world to his neighbor than to ship his own product across the street through the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).

Taxpayers Protection Alliance’s policy director Ross Marchand recently pointed out in The Federalist that a three-pound package shipped to China from the east coast of the U.S. would cost around $30 through the USPS. Shipping the same package the opposite direction through China Post would cost less than $20.

“While this is just one of many factors contributing to China’s massive export edge over the United States, it is one of [the] few that defy market logic,” Marchand wrote.

The U.S. is fighting back on the issue under the Trump Administration.

Trump issued a memorandum last month providing a directive to several administration officials that include the postmaster general and chairman of the Postal Regulatory Commission to push the UPU for more fairness in the international postal system.

“It is the policy of the United States to promote and encourage the development of an efficient and competitive global system that provides for fair and nondiscriminatory postal rates,” the memo states.

The current system is grossly unfair to the U.S. so pushback from Trump can only benefit America, its consumers and its businesses.",https://spectator.org/geography-containing-china/,2018-09-24
UK Bans China’s Huawei 5G - The American Spectator,"Huawei, the controversial Chinese telecommunications giant, was dealt another blow this week with the news that it would be banned from the United Kingdom’s 5G network development.

The government decision, released Tuesday, explicitly mentions the American sanctions on Huawei, introduced by the Trump Administration back in May, as the main driving factor. The sanctions had barred Huawei and its suppliers from using American technology, including in the vital, cutting-edge semiconductor industry, out of fear that the company was acting as a conduit for technology transfer to Beijing. The UK government’s press release notes that Huawei currently has “no alternatives which we have sufficient confidence in” and that “the new restrictions make it impossible to continue to guarantee the security of Huawei equipment in the future.”

Buying new Huawei 5G equipment will be banned in the UK by the end of 2020, while any existing equipment will be removed by the end of 2027. Back in January, the UK had given the company permission to play a limited role in its 5G expansion, resulting in operators such as Vodafone already deploying some Huawei infrastructure.

China has, predictably, lashed out at the UK’s decision. The Communist Party-endorsed tabloid Global Times ran an editorial urging “public and painful” retaliation against the UK, likely in the form of an equivalent economic response as is Beijing’s preference.

More importantly, however, this event is being treated by both sides as the latest move in an economic proxy war between China and the United States. In the same editorial, the Global Times asserts that “in the long run, the UK has no reason to turn against China.” Instead, the UK’s hostility is because it is “an important member of the Five Eyes, which now follows Washington’s policy loyally.” Separately, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying leveled the accusation that the United Kingdom “took unfounded risks as an excuse and cooperated with the United States to discriminate, suppress and exclude Chinese companies.”

In other words, Beijing sees this decision as the UK signaling its loyalty to the United States, with any economic or national security concerns being mere window dressing.

The accusation is cynical and false, though it is undeniable that continuous American pressure against Huawei has played a substantial role in making it a less attractive partner to many governments. President Trump was quick to claim credit for the decision, stating in a press conference that “we had convinced many countries … not to use Huawei, because we think it is an unsafe security risk.” British Health Secretary Matt Hancock shot back, insisting that the UK’s decision was an independent one. Beijing, for its part, isn’t convinced.",https://spectator.org/give-trump-credit-on-china-and-the-coronavirus/,2020-07-16
Ukraine and China Top Putin’s Annual Press Conference - The American Spectator,"Russian President Vladimir Putin scored major propaganda points in his over four-hour annual press conference this week. He turned attention away from Russia’s invasion of Crimea, support of Russian separatists in the Donbas region (Donbas), and troop buildup on Ukraine’s borders. Instead, Putin guides the untrained eye through the conflict in terms of Russian grievances. In Putin-speak, the Ukrainian conflict is a product of Ukrainian persecution of Russians and separatists, and NATO’s expansion eastward. Putin also used the news conference to showcase the growing Russia-China strategic partnership. Putin made the following claims:

Claim #1: Ukraine Is a Made-Up Country

Putin implicitly questioned the sovereignty of Ukraine, as well as Ukraine’s sovereignty over the Donbas region. On the origins of Ukraine and Donbas, Putin said “Lenin and his comrades decided that Donbas should belong to Ukraine and they created a country that never existed, and that was the Ukrainian Republic. And they pushed some of the historically Russian territories into that republic.” With those two sentences, Putin implies that Ukraine and Donbas are legal fictions that are ripe for revision.

Claim #2: Ukraine Is a Destabilizing Force

Putin claims that Ukraine, not Russia, is the destabilizing force in the region. To do this, Putin maintains that the Ukraine is discriminating against its Russian citizens. Putin refers to a 2019 law which made Ukrainian the official language of the Ukraine as an attempt “to oust Russian-speaking people from their historically occupied territory.” He also argues that a July 2021 law on who constitutes the indigenous people of Ukraine as practically declaring that “Russians that have always lived in Ukraine were not an indigenous ethnicity.” He also states that the current and former presidents of Ukraine are influenced by “radical” and “Nazi” elements within Ukraine.

Additionally, according to Putin, Ukraine is instigating the violence in Donbas. Putin accuses the leadership of Ukraine of giving orders to shell Donbas daily and devolving such orders to “the warlords” and the “commanders on the ground,” exclaiming, “How dare they shell and bomb their own nationals?” Further, Putin states that Ukraine is proclaiming the separatists in Donbas as “terrorists,” rather than granting them autonomy as promised.

Putin also claims that it is the Ukraine that is threatening Russia, not the other way around. Putin also states that he is discussing with President Biden about “greater threats from Ukraine.” According to Putin, Ukraine wants to turn Donbas into “an anti-Russia on [Ukraine’s] territory that will be injected and pumped with state-of-the-art arms” and that Ukraine would use this territory and arms to “prod the radicals to try to resort to a military option for the Donbas.”

Claim #3: Russia Will Be a Stabilizing Force in Ukraine (as It Was in the Past)

Putin implies that Donbas, like Crimea before it, can benefit from Russian intervention. Putin claimed that the reason why Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 was that “there was a bloody coup d’etat and people were killed” and that Russia had to protect the people of Crimea. Similarly, Putin stressed that Russia’s role in Donbas would be merely to serve “to mediate.” Putin alleges that despite Russia’s desire to serve as an “intermediary,” forces in the Ukraine “want to render us a party to the conflict.” In fact, Putin claims that in 2014, it was the Ukraine that wanted military conflict in Donbas, while it was Putin who tried to convince them otherwise. Putin is suggesting that it is Ukrainian aggression that will force Russia’s hand.

Claim #4: The West, Not Russia, Must Back Down

Putin insists that NATO expansion and western missiles are an additional cause of the crisis with Ukraine. Putin made clear that it is up to the West, not Russia, to resolve the conflict.

Key to the conflict’s resolution (and in influencing Russia’s actions), according to Putin, is NATO halting its expansion eastward, which according to Putin, the Biden administration is open to discuss. “We have … said that we want no expansion of NATO eastward, and the ball is in their [the Biden administration’s] court and they should respond … American partners have stated that they are willing to wade into this discussion…”

Putin also questioned why Russia is being labelled an aggressor, as Russia is not deploying missiles close to the U.S., while the U.S. is “deploying missiles close to our home, on the porch of our house.” He asked what the U.S. would think if Russia deployed missiles close to the U.S./Canada or U.S./Mexico border. Of course with this logic, the former head of the KGB is memory-holing Russia’s invasion of Crimea, support of Russian separatists, and its recent troop buildup.

Claim #5: Russia and China Are Thick as Thieves

Additionally, at the news conference, Putin used a question from the CCP-run Xinhua News Agency to showcase growing China-Russia relations, calling it “an unparalleled strategic partnership that has no equal in global history.” He stated that President Xi and Putin “call each other friends and have a good personal contact.” Putin also spoke to the two countries’ cooperation in nuclear and hi-tech and space exploration. In security cooperation, Putin stated that “the Chinese army receives a lot of state-of-the-art Russian weaponry, and we have been together designing hi-tech arms,” in addition to working together in joint maneuvers, international combat games, and joint patrols.

Claim #6: Russia Will Go Carbon Neutral (or Not), With China as Buyer

On carbon neutrality, Putin said both yes and no, but either way with China as a partner. Putin stated that while both countries “honor our commitments to reach carbon neutrality by 2060,” he admitted that before 2060 Russia “will be supplying all types of energy resources to China.” After 2060, Putin cryptically predicted that “history will not end and carbon neutrality may be obtained differently,” making it clear that Russia is really not committed to carbon neutrality.

In the press conference, Putin shows that he is keeping his options open on Ukraine. While not quite telegraphing a desire for invasion outright, his portrayal of Ukraine as an illegitimate aggressor is certainly setting the stage for making a case for invasion at the time of Putin’s choosing. Furthermore, his growing alliance with China, of which he is quite proud, should certainly cause concern for the West. Only time will tell if Putin will capitalize on his strong position.",https://spectator.org/good-news-bad-news-in-china-tiff/,2021-12-26
Ukraine: China to the Rescue? - The American Spectator,"There is only one man on Earth who holds sway over Vladimir Putin, the rogue, isolated president of the Russian Federation who has fractured Europe in a way not seen since Adolf Hitler attacked Poland on September 1, 1939, after the Nazi annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland the previous year.

That man is Xi Jinping, president of the People’s Republic of China and secretary general of the Chinese Communist Party. On February 4 in a joint statement, Putin and Xi announced that their friendship would have “no limits.”

Earlier this week, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi signaled China’s willingness to mediate in the Ukraine crisis. And on Tuesday Xi himself stated that China would participate in mediating the conflict.

Time is running out. Thus far Putin has not been deterred by brutal sanctions such as kicking Russian banks out of SWIFT, freezing the central bank’s $630 billion in foreign currency reserves, the exiting of blue-chip multinationals, suspending the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline by Germany, and seizing the personal property of oligarchs who owe their status and privilege to the Russian president. Even relatively neutral countries — Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland — have taken action by sending weapons or endorsing sanctions.

Putin’s raging inferiority complex and obsession with restoring the glory of the Soviet if not Czarist Empire will, if unchecked, result in the further leveling of Ukrainian cities not seen since the devastating allied bombardments of Germany in World War II, and a subsequent guerrilla war against the occupational Russian army. The will of the Ukrainian people and the heroic persona of President Volodymyr Zelensky have already reminded a complacent West that freedom has its price. Armed with American-made surface-to-air Stingers and Javelin anti-tank fire-and-forget, shoulder-fired weapons, and inspired by President Zelensky, the Ukrainian resistance can inflict substantial losses for some time to come, increasing the cost of Putin’s war. (READ MORE from Frank Schell: Ukraine: India’s Balancing Act)

The civilized world wonders how this catastrophe will end. If the Russian military continues to underperform, more doubts about its competence arise, and President Putin becomes more and more isolated at his oversized, ornate white table, he still has the tactical nuclear weapon in his playbook. Its use on a Ukrainian city would horrify the world and probably stop the Ukrainian resistance. It could also demand a more aggressive response by the U.S. and NATO. This possibility makes China’s offer even more important, and potentially useful.

The irony of Chinese cavalry coming to the rescue is indeed profound. Nonetheless, China and Russia have forged ever-closer bonds in recent months, the aim being to end the U.S.-dominated postwar order for trade, investment, and diplomacy. While Chinese mediation will legitimize and enhance China’s posture on the world stage, it will carry with it a price. So what must the West give China, in the catbird seat, for its ostensibly good behavior? The solution will fall upon the United States, China’s chief rival. Britain and France can support but they cannot lead, and Germany is busy repudiating years of the pro-Putin policy of the Christian Democratic Union.

China’s continued anger over U.S. support of Taiwan, which it views as a renegade province, is nonstop and predictable. Since 2010, the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan total $23 billion. As recently as early February, the U.S. announced a $100 million aid package to upgrade Taiwan’s Patriot missile system to protect against airborne threats. U.S. support for Taiwan’s independence and military are the single most important issue to Xi Jinping — who could demand cessation of military support by the United States.

Other demands that China could make are more diplomatic and optical in nature, to enhance China’s image in the West. Moderation of anti-China rhetoric with regard to human rights violations in Hong Kong and repression of Uyghurs, a Turkic ethnic population in western China, would be on the table. China could also demand that the West back off on correctly holding them responsible for a Chinese cover-up of COVID-19 for months preceding lockdowns in the West. China could also ask that the U.S. accept the militarization of the South China Sea and cease airborne and naval reconnaissance patrols. Xi might also ask the U.S. to remove existing tariffs and sanctions.

It has been speculated that a coup d’état in Russia or national revolt by the Russian people could oust Putin. Both would probably require the sanctions to continue to bite deeply, and that will take more time.

The West is not in an enviable position. Which is worse: Allowing China to preen, grandstand, and appear benevolent, giving in to some Chinese demands — or letting an unhinged Vladimir Putin continue to sink and rage, with his finger not far from the trigger of Armageddon?

Xi Jinping does not have to read this opinion piece to know that he now has the potential leverage with the West that he has dreamed of for years.

UN Human Rights Vote Reveals China’s Power and the West’s Decline - The American Spectator,"The so-called “global community” that Western liberals frequently look to for formulating and implementing “global governance” showed its true colors by voting down a proposal by the United States, Britian, Canada, and other, mostly Western, countries to debate a UN report on human rights abuses and alleged crimes against humanity committed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) against its Muslim Uyghur population in China’s Xinjiang province. The vote in the UN Human Rights Council was 17 for debate, 19 against, and 11 abstaining. CNBC reports that the defeat of the motion to debate marks the second time in the council’s 16-year history that such a motion has been defeated. The vote was a victory for China and a defeat for the United States and the West.

The 45-page report, issued on Aug. 31, 2022, concluded that “[s]erious human rights violations have been committed” by Chinese authorities and found credible evidence of coerced abortions, forced labor, “arbitrary detention,” “family separation and reprisals,” “enforced disappearances,” and “patterns of torture or ill-treatment,” such as “forced medical treatment” and “sexual and gender-based violence.” The practices carried out by Chinese authorities, the report states, “may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.” The UN previously issued a report detailing that China has detained more than one million people in camps in Xinjiang.

Countries that voted with China and against the United States include Cuba, Bolivia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Cameroon, Eritrea, Gabon, Kazakhstan, Mauritania, Côte d’Ivoire, Namibia, Nepal, Senegal, and Venezuela. More surprising, and more telling, is the list of countries that abstained — effectively supporting a coverup of China’s crimes. That list includes Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, India, and Ukraine. Those countries were unwilling to anger China but perfectly willing to oppose the United States.

The Biden administration’s ambassador to the UN Human Rights Council, Michèle Taylor, predictably expressed “disappointment,” while also acknowledging that no country — including the United States — “has a perfect human rights record.”

China’s foreign ministry, meanwhile, called upon the Human Rights Council “to focus on … the serious human rights violations concerning the U.S., UK and some Western forces, including systemic racism and racial discrimination, the rights of refugees and migrants, rampant gun violence, unilateral coercive measures, and mass killings of innocent civilians in overseas military operations.” Oh, for the days of ambassadors Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick, who refused to descend into rhetorical moral equivalency with tyrannical communist regimes.

The governments of Brazil, Mexico, India, and Ukraine have signaled unmistakably that they fear China more than they respect the United States. The UN vote demonstrates China’s making inroads in Africa and Latin America, and it is a devastating rebuke of the Biden administration’s failed attempts to garner international support for opposing China’s expansionist foreign policy.

To be sure, objectively the UN Human Rights Council is a joke — Cuba, China, Sudan, Namibia, Venezuela, and some of the other countries on the council should under their current regimes not be able to serve on a “human rights” organization. But liberals and the Biden administration take the UN and its councils seriously. They really believe in global governance by a globalist elite. They try to align U.S. energy, climate, economic, environmental, and security policies with the globalist agenda.

In 2021, President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken proudly and publicly reversed President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the UN’s Human Rights Council. Blinken claimed that “U.S. leadership” of the council was the “best way to improve” it.

But China’s ability to win the support of a majority of the council’s members in order to cover up its massive crimes shows who really leads the council — and it’s not the United States or any of its Western allies. Trump was right to withdraw from the sham “human rights” council. By rejoining it and taking it seriously, the Biden administration has enhanced the council’s credibility in the “global community.”",https://spectator.org/googles-hard-line-on-free-speech-violations-in-china/,2022-10-10
"China’s Vaccine Propaganda: Maligning the US, Bribing the World - The American Spectator","Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) approved China’s Sinovac vaccine for COVID-19, following its approval of China’s Sinopharm last month. The WHO can now distribute both vaccines through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) program, which distributes COVID-19 vaccine to the developing world. China is poised to export over one billion COVID-19 doses abroad in 2021 alone, according to Chinese state-run media outlet the Global Times.

While the world is growing increasingly interested in China’s culpability in the spread of COVID-19, Chinese media are taking full advantage of China’s vaccine exportation boom to craft propaganda aimed at maligning the West while bolstering China’s own image. This is timely misdirection; recent revelations that a Chinese military scientist had patented a COVID-19 vaccine only five weeks after China admitted the existence and contagious nature of the virus raise questions as to what China knew about the virus and when. Also not emphasized by Chinese media is the degree to which these vaccines are provided “with strings attached,” essentially as bribes.

Chinese media like state-run newspapers XinhuaNet, Global Times, and China Daily craft news surrounding China’s vaccines to portray the West as participating in selfish and incompetent vaccine diplomacy, while portraying China as benevolently and efficiently exporting its vaccine and using such exportation to champion the poor. Similarly, Chinese state media crafts China’s vaccine exportation as a tool to showcase China’s alliances while minimizing conflict with its enemies.

Claim 1: The West, India Are Selfish and Incompetent

Chinese media uses news of China’s vaccine to criticize the West’s vaccine exportation. The first way Chinese media does this is by portraying the West as acting selfishly. A XinhuaNet article criticizes Western vaccine campaigns as fraught with “stockpiling of vaccines and export control,” an “ ‘ourselves first’ approach,” and “vaccine nationalism.” A Global Times article accused the U.S. of “sit[ting] on piles of vaccine stock [while turning] a blind eye to the struggle” of the COVID-19 pandemic. Chinese media also portrays the West as incompetent in its attempts to send vaccines abroad. An article in Global Times states that regarding exportation, “the U.S. keeps making promises without actual moves.”

Of course, Chinese media downplays the facts that the U.S. has already shared 4.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with Mexico and Canada and that it will send 60 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine and 20 million doses of Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines by the end of this month. Additionally, Japan has sent Taiwan 1.24 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and the U.S. has pledged 750,000 vaccine doses to Taiwan.

Chinese media also portrays India as failing to come to the world’s rescue. The Global Times article mentioned above also editorializes that “India, a previous major global vaccine manufacturer, is struggling to fulfill their production contracts amid the serious domestic COVID-19 epidemic.” The article also criticizes India’s vaccine exports as “India’s largest vaccine producer the Serum Institute is struggling to meet domestic demand and says it will not be making doses available for export until the end of the year.” An editorial in China Daily criticized India for suspending shipments of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Africa, as India “races to save its own people from the virus.”

But what Chinese media overlook is India’s continued confidence that it will still be able to produce two billion COVID-19 vaccine doses by the end of this year. Also not mentioned are recent efforts by the United States, Australia, and Japan to assist India, Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh in their fights against COVID-19, including a U.S. effort to provide India with the vaccine. Unmentioned as well is the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue’s (U.S., India, Australia, and Japan’s) promise to provide one billion COVID-19 vaccine doses “to ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), the Indo-Pacific and beyond by the end of 2022,” according to National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.

Claim 2: China Is Benevolent and Efficient

Chinese media portrays China as willing and able to pick up the slack in exporting vaccines. An article in the Global Times states that “China is taking the leading role to support the global anti-pandemic fight in expanding international supply as much as possible, providing reliable doses with impressive protection data.” Citing Feng Duojia, president of the China Vaccine Industry Association, that article claims that “China not only has the willingness and the means to help in the global anti-pandemic fight, but the capability to do so.”

A common theme in Chinese media is Chinese ability and benevolence in providing the vaccine to other countries while also satisfying domestic demand. China was “determined to share the vaccines from early on,” according to the above XinhuaNet article. This article continues, “While meeting demand at home, China has provided more than 350 million doses to the international community.” In another XinhuaNet article, China’s ambassador to Chad said, “Despite domestic demand, we have delivered on our promise by delivering the vaccine to more than 80 developing countries in urgent need.”

Chinese media even gets China’s allies to parrot the same talking point. For example, a Global Times article cites the ambassador to Ecuador preaching Chinese generosity: “China is now the world’s largest exporter of vaccines, especially for many developing countries. We are most moved by the fact that, although China has its own mandate to vaccinate 1.4 billion people, it still distributes some of its vaccines to other countries with similar needs.”

Chinese media also portrays China’s vaccine exportation in more explicitly moral terms. A XinhuaNet article boasted, “Unlike some developed countries which are hoarding vaccines, China has been taking concrete steps to deliver on its promise to make Chinese vaccines a global public good, and implementing with practical actions the concept of a global community of health for all.” China’s ambassador to Chad and China’s ambassador to Cambodia both have spoken of China’s vaccine exports as a “global public good” in two separate XinhuaNet articles. A third XinhuaNet article praised “China’s commitment to making its COVID-19 vaccines global public goods with concrete actions.”

Of course not discussed in Chinese media is that China’s vaccine support often comes with “strings attached,” as Secretary of State Antony Blinken remarked in March. For example, China has provided Honduras and Paraguay with more vaccine doses in exchange for pledges to cut ties with Taiwan. Several experts also predict that China may use its vaccine diplomacy to buy compliance with its neighbors on its regional ambitions, including its claims to the South China Sea.

China also seeks to distribute the vaccine as a mechanism to strengthen its economic ties with other countries, for example through the Health Silk Road and the Belt and Road Initiative. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang spoke of strengthening “the synergy between the Belt and Road Initiative and Hanoi’s Two Corridors and One Economic Circle vision,” in addition to COVID-19 cooperation between China and Vietnam, as reported by China Daily. Farhat Asif, president of Pakistan’s Institute of Peace and Diplomatic Studies, had mentioned that China’s “speedy recovery” from COVID-19 “helped the grand Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and connected nations to help build their own recoveries,” according to the Global Times. “Chinese vaccine producers such as Sinopharm and Sinovac had established production lines to repackage vaccines with countries including Egypt, Brazil and Turkey, and in the future, China will build vaccine plants overseas,” according to Zheng Zhongwei, director of the Development Center for Medical Science and Technology of the National Health Commission, as reported in the Global Times.

Claim 3: China Champions Poor Countries and “Equity”

Chinese media portrays the race for world vaccination in terms of “gaps” and “divides” between countries that have the vaccine and those that don’t, with China playing an equalizing role. A China Daily article argued that Sinovac and Sinopharm’s inclusion in the WHO’s COVAX project make China part of “the equitable distribution of vaccines around the globe, especially in developing regions.”

A XinhuaNet states that China seeks to “eliminate the global vaccine divide” and “walks the talk [sic] to promote the fairer distribution of jabs.” A second XinhuaNet article said that China was engaged in an “unremitting effort to help the international community bridge the ‘immunization gap’ generated by inequity in vaccine distribution” and that “China, being a responsible global player, has been promoting a more equitable global vaccination campaign.”

Chinese media portray Chinese vaccination as the salvation of poorer countries from COVID-19. A XinhuaNet article states that Sinovac is “a boon for people in under-developed countries.” China Daily quoted Andrea Taylor of the Duke Global Health Institute, as saying to the New York Times that “The situation right now is just so desperate for low- and lower-middle-income countries that any doses we can get out are worth mobilizing.… Having potentially two options coming from China could really change the landscape of what’s possible over the next few months.” According to the Global Times, “The majority of the 80 countries that China has assisted are developing and underdeveloped countries.”

Chinese media particularly portrays China as being the rescuer of Africa. An editorial in China Daily argued that the approval of Sinopharm by the WHO “is particularly significant for African countries, which currently face hurdles to gaining access to Western-produced vaccines.” Another China Daily quoted the WHO Regional Director for Africa as praising Sinopharm for helping “speed up vaccine access for Africa” and claiming that Sinopharm “will help ensure our [Africa’s] high-risk populations get the protection they need.” But COVID-19 assistance to Africa could mirror China’s previous “strings attached” aid to Africa.

Chinese Vaccines Minimize Active Disputes With Rival Nations

Chinese state-run media manipulates vaccine news to minimize China’s active disputes with Philippines, Vietnam, and even Taiwan.

According to XinhuaNet, the Philippines “lauded” the WHO’s approval of Sinovac, and a previous Global Times article argued that Filipinos prefer the Sinovac vaccine. Not discussed were the two countries’ active disputes in the South China Sea and the Spratly Islands. The Philippines approved Sinopharm on June 7 and Sinovac back in February.

Citing Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, China Daily says that China is willing to “strengthen cooperation with Hanoi in COVID-19 prevention and control, as well as the research, development and production of vaccines.” Paraphrasing Li, the China Daily article bizarrely states that “China and Vietnam are friendly neighbors linked by mountains and rivers” and that “the two sides have always cherished the profound friendship jointly created by leaders of the older generation since the start of their diplomatic relations more than 70 years ago.” The China Daily article did not discuss the Sino-Vietnamese conflicts of 1979–91 nor the growing China–Vietnam tensions over the South China Sea, with Vietnam expanding its fishing militia to counter Chinese threats. Earlier this month, Vietnam approved Sinopharm.

Chinese media also portray China as extending a helping hand to rival Taiwan, with XinhuaNet, for example, stating that China is amenable to giving Taiwan vaccines. Not mentioned was that Taiwan is refusing to import Chinese vaccinations due to safety concerns, and Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen claims that Chinese meddling prevented Taiwan from importing Pfizer shots directly from Germany.

Vaccines Strengthen China’s Existing Alliances

Chinese media portray Chinese vaccines as a tool to strengthen existing alliances with China. A spokeswoman from Cambodia’s Ministry of Health remarked that “China has been the key vaccine supplier to protect Cambodian people’s lives against the pandemic,” according to XinhuaNet. The spokeswoman added that “China’s effort to help Cambodia is really amazing. It’s really remarkable, it’s really unforgettable, and this is really much appreciated by the people of Cambodia.”

Sri Lanka’s Health Minister similarly praised China’s vaccination efforts in her country, stating that Chinese vaccines were “extremely valuable” and China had “continuously assisted” Sri Lanka in the fight against COVID-19, according to XinhuaNet. That article did not mention the massive debt trap that China has put Sri Lanka in over China’s financing of the Hambantota Port.

Pakistan has piled on praise as well. Upon receiving the Sinopharm vaccine, Farhat Asif, founder and president of Pakistan’s Institute of Peace and Diplomatic Studies, gushed to the Global Times, “I was proud to see this day, that modern science and medicine has brought forward this miracle that we are able to receive the vaccine to save ourselves from such a once in a century pathogen.… China has sent, as a gift, half a million doses of Sinopharm vaccine to Pakistan. This donation arrived at the right time, when Pakistan is grappling with rising COVID-19 cases in the country.” Of course, not mentioned is Pakistan’s massive $3 billion debt to China, which is contributing to Pakistan being in a “sovereign debt danger zone.” Also not mentioned is China’s “debt trap” arrangement with Pakistan, which gives China 91 percent of Gwadar Port’s revenues. China is seeking to establish a navy base there.

Turkish physicians marveled over the Sinovac vaccine in a XinhuaNet article. One Turkish doctor in that article claimed, “Based on our field observations, we can say that the Sinovac vaccine prevents deaths and intensive care hospitalization 100 percent,” and that “The phase studies had already proved its efficacy, but our field notes are even better.”

And lastly, an adviser at the Bangladesh Health Ministry’s Institute of Epidemiology called the Sinopharm vaccine a “big blessing,” according to China Daily.

Chinese state-run media uses news about Chinese vaccines to craft a narrative of Chinese benevolence and U.S. malevolence. This massive media campaign is part of a larger effort to get more of the world to criticize and doubt the United States while whitewashing any Chinese culpability in spreading COVID-19. Through an aggressive propaganda effort, China hopes to rehabilitate its image abroad.",https://spectator.org/harry-reid-has-seen-the-future-green-jobs-in-red-china/,2021-06-09
Voices of China: ‘Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death’ - The American Spectator,"Steven Mosher, author of Bully of Asia — a book that contends that the Chinese Communist Party under President Xi Jinping seeks to “continuously expand its power to achieve [global] hegemony” — recently reached out to four of his friends in China to learn why they are protesting COVID lockdowns there. The answers he got are revealing. They show that, for at least some Chinese citizens, the protests are about more than the CCP’s draconian COVID restrictions — they are about freedom and ending the dictatorial rule of the CCP.

The protests and the brutal crackdown by Chinese authorities also show why the CCP is so intent on reunifying Taiwan with the mainland. Taiwan is an island of freedom-loving Chinese people. Taiwan shows that Chinese people can have both political freedom and economic well-being. The example of Taiwan puts the lie to the CCP’s narrative that their citizens are content to sacrifice freedom for a better standard of living. And it puts the lie to those Western observers, political leaders, and businessmen who continue to push “engagement” with the criminal regime that rules China in the hope that economic interdependence will result in political liberalization.

China’s COVID crackdown is made possible by what authors Josh Chin and Liza Lin call the “surveillance state” in their new book with that title.

They describe a high-tech surveillance apparatus that uses digital technology as a weapon of repression. The regime uses ubiquitous cameras, facial recognition software, biometric data collection, algorithmic controls, artificial intelligence, and internet filtering firewalls to observe, control, and, when needed, repress the Chinese people. And the authors note that the CCP obtained the tools of the surveillance state from Western companies who were encouraged by Western political leaders to economically engage with China. “The Western business world,” Chin and Lin write, “has midwifed the [CCP’s] surveillance state since its embryonic beginnings in the late 1990s.”

Back to Mosher’s friends. One of Mosher’s correspondents noted how the CCP “track[s] our movements” by mobile phone apps and a “tracking system” that authorities “installed in our house to monitor everyone in our family 24 hours a day, seven days a week.” This friend expressed his hope “to be able to speak freely, instead of anonymously, without fear of being imprisoned.”

A second Mosher friend, a retired bank employee in Hubei province, noted that the “endless lockdowns” are destroying the economy and people’s lives. This friend, too, expressed the desire to “live in freedom” and to “live in a normal society.”

Another Mosher friend, who lives in Beijing, lamented that “[f]or more than 70 years, three generations of Chinese people have been unable to speak freely in their own country.” This friend called the CCP a “terrorist organization” and China a “prison state” that wants to “destroy mankind.”

The fourth friend Mosher talked to is a software engineer in Beijing. After describing for Mosher “the hell that we are now living” and expressing fear not of COVID but of the CCP, this friend said: “End the one-party dictatorship. Give me liberty or give me death!”

“Give me liberty or give me death.” The phrase has a familiar ring to it. The words were spoken by Patrick Henry on March 23, 1775, at the Second Virginia Convention that met in St. John’s Church in Richmond. Henry was speaking to those who sought accommodation with the occupying forces of Great Britain. “There is no retreat but in submission and slavery,” he exclaimed. “Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston!… Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?… I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!”

If China reunifies Taiwan with the mainland, either “peacefully” or by force, the Chinese people in Taiwan will share the fate of the Chinese on the mainland and, now, in Hong Kong, where the CCP is gradually ending political freedom in violation of its pledge made to Britain of “one country, two systems.” Taiwan’s existence as a distinct political entity is a dagger pointed at the heart of CCP rule. Like West Berlin during the Cold War, Taiwan is a beacon of freedom and liberty — a glowing rebuke to the legitimacy of communist rule. China’s leaders understand this. Many in the West do not.

Wargame Says US Would Beat China — But at Huge Cost - The American Spectator,"The future has been written by a video game. The United States will win a war against China, but only after the countries bleed each other dry, following an attempt by China to invade Taiwan. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has been working with this scenario: China invades Taiwan in 2026. It ran the video game 24 times to assess the most-likely possible outcomes. I, being older than James Stewart’s shoelaces, hold some reservations about this new way of handing over important analysis to artificial intelligence. I mean, this video game seems about as reliable as ChatGPT advising you on whom you should marry. Be that as it may, there are a lot of very serious gentlemen in suits analyzing the results of the video game in a virtual conference, and even though I don’t believe in AI, I still have faith in the gentlemen in suits.

The analysts believe that, after the projected war, Taiwan has a good chance of continuing to exist as an autonomous entity. But it will be left as dilapidated as Joe Biden’s brain, along with the U.S. and Japanese armies. The 24 contests that the little game has run analyze how vulnerable surface ships are (this use of AI will come as no surprise to you if, as a kid, you, like yours truly, played Battleship), the number of aircraft losses, the effectiveness of long-range anti-ship missiles, and the strategic importance of Taiwanese ground forces, as well as the need for access to operational bases in Japan. There’s a basic principle in the art of war that I’ve kept with me since my scuffles back on the playground at school: If you can’t reach his face, you can’t slap him.

What does sound like music to my ears is the other part of the prediction: China would end up with its army in ruins and thousands of its soldiers as prisoners of war. Bear in mind, however, that most of those soldiers, more than prisoners, will likely feel privileged, if the Communist regime, which is truly holding them prisoners, were to finally fall. Ten thousand Chinese soldiers would die, and 155 warplanes and 138 Chinese ships would go to hell. Commentary not suitable for wokes: These are far fewer victims than what would be caused by a world hegemony of Chinese Communism.

The analysts also offer advice to the Biden administration to prepare for this supposedly looming war. They suggest, among other things, strengthening U.S. bases in Japan and changing up its naval forces to smaller ships with higher chances of survival, although this last measure seems to me, again, to be a typical idea that ChatGPT would come up with upon being asked: “Hi, I’m the United States and I’m 13 years old. How can I win a war with China?”

The analysts generally suggest cheaper and lighter ships and aircraft for both the United States and Taiwan, on the premise that it doesn’t matter how they are made; they will not survive the first Chinese attacks. As a war strategy, it sounds very 21st century. In my opinion, though, we could attack them with hackers and make sure that Xi Jinping, in his smart mansion, gets doused with cold water in the shower, and film the moment. This would not win the war, but it would afford us some laughs and a quick lesson in Chinese swearing.

In any case, I will tell you something that the CSIS analysts have not taken into account. There will be no war with China even if Xi deploys his cannons on the White House front doormat. You won’t see a single 2022 Democrat stand up to communist tyranny of any sort. And if, by some freak occurrence, that horrible war were to take place and it were declared and led by Biden, there is no chance that the West would be victorious: We would bomb the wrong island; we would do it with green bombs, which only scare but do not pollute; our military leaders would be chosen under gender perspective and with preference for those who have had their genitals amputated and their name changed from John to Linda; and, moreover, in the middle of the fray, Hunter Biden would go to dinner with a beautiful Chinese woman who would turn out to be an enemy spy, forgetting a laptop with racy videos in the middle of his Shanghai binge, which the Communists would then use as blackmail, forcing the zombie in the White House to make a mysterious and swift surrender, and leaving the whole world in the hands of the CCP.

Washington Is Not Serious About Russia-China Rapprochement - The American Spectator,"While Washington’s experts and pundits continue taking Moscow’s pivot to Beijing with a grain of salt, China and Russia announced yet another joint mega-project that will help to accelerate the formation of what many dubbed the “Eurasian supercontinent.” From an American perspective, long historical grievances, border wars, and overwhelming mistrust between the two Eurasian powers are seen as permanent factors that will inevitably downgrade the Kremlin’s alignment with China’s Communist Party. Granted, Russia’s quasi-alliance with China has become a double-edged sword. On one hand, the Kremlin uses Beijing to balance against the United States and Japan; hence the sale of sophisticated stealth fighters including the SU-35 jets and state-of-the-art Kilo–class submarines to China. On the other hand, Russians have compromised their influence in Central Asia by essentially granting Beijing unlimited access to the region’s resources, allowing China to gain a strategic foothold in an area central to China’s own security. Add to this China’s ingenious reverse-engineering, which targets Russian military technology and its burgeoning economic clout in Russia’s Far East.

Nonetheless, many American commentators fail to acknowledge that both Russia and China have not forgotten the strategic leverage that their conflict produced for the United States during the Cold War. As such, neither Moscow nor Beijing is willing to hand Washington another bargaining chip to maneuver within this geopolitical triangle. For too long, Americans have focused only on the difficulties of Moscow-Beijing relations while largely neglecting the incentives that have brought these two powers together. In short, there may not be another “Sino-Soviet split” in coming decades for Washington to exploit.

Apart from subscribing to China’s 5G network, Russians are positioning themselves as the connecting bridge between China and Europe. The recent announcement of the trans-continental route — the Meridian highway — seeks to accomplish exactly that. This will be a major contribution to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), since the Russian part of the highway begins at the border with Kazakhstan and ends in Belarus, creating a shorter route between the Middle Kingdom and the Old World. The idea for the highway belongs to the former deputy chairman of Gazprom Alexander Ryazanov, who believes that the project will cost roughly $9 billion and take around 14 years to start generating a profit.

As Russia’s RBC Group reports, the Meridian will be a four-lane toll highway consistent with European standards, with a starting point in the Orenburg region near Kazakhstan. Already approved by Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, the 2,000-km highway is the brainchild of the “Russian Holding Company,” and, according to Vzglyad, the company has acquired 80 percent of the corridor where the route is set to be built. Although this is a private initiative, Russian government agencies such as the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Development will assist the company to find additional investors.

Russia’s involvement in this motorway stretching from China all the way to Hamburg, Germany, is part of a greater development to which the United States didn’t pay much attention. In his book Belt and Road: Chinese World Order, Bruno Maçães describes the 2015 Putin-Xi statement that essentially attached the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union to China’s BRI. Maçães claims that it was anticipated from the get-go that Moscow would not tolerate Beijing’s advancement into Central Asia, and China was cautious not to do anything drastic. Moscow, however, ended up giving China the green light to enter Central Asia and Georgia, as well, for further expansion into Europe. Now Moscow is willing to bandwagon directly with China’s intercontinental ambitions.

Throughout the Cold War, American policymakers were adamant about preventing the emergence of a communist hegemon dominating the Eurasian landmass. This was one of the main concerns that brought Paul Nitze into the State Department; he consequently wrote one of the most important Cold War policy papers, the NSC-68. The Americans knew that if Eurasia were to be dominated by a single power or a coalition of powers, the power balance would inevitably be exported into the Western hemisphere, something that all American statesmen had vehemently opposed since the birth of the Republic. Through vigorous diplomacy and bipartisan consensus, the United States was able to turn containment into one of the most successful American foreign-policy strategies.

True, Russia is not a communist state anymore, and China values its bilateral relationship with Washington much more than it does with the Kremlin. As former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski liked to caution, however, the U.S. should avoid a formation of a “grand coalition” between Moscow and Beijing “united not by ideology but by complementary grievances.”

This is the scenario unfolding before our eyes today. It is ironic, notes historian Stephen Kotkin, that while Moscow refused to become America’s junior partner in post-Cold War era, it is becoming that of China.

The United States doesn’t have a Russia policy. Its domestic political market is consumed by Russia’s 2016 election-meddling, which gave birth to the “Donald-Trump-the-spy” conspiracy. No meaningful engagement, therefore, has been possible between the two nations.

The result is a two-front Cold War-like situation with China and Russia: the former being led by the Trump administration, and the latter by the Democratic Party. While Russia may not be the determining factor in America’s strategy vis-à-vis the rising Asian powerhouse, Moscow has the capacity to alleviate some of China’s strategic challenges.

As Beijing continues its bold plan of building a blue-water navy, it is simultaneously building railways and roads across Eurasia. Even though it is practically impossible to compete against the maritime trade, China hopes to mitigate its vulnerability on the seas — where it sees American and Japanese navies as formidable rivals — through continental expansion. This is where Russia comes in handy.

By linking China and Europe, Russia helps Beijing to deviate part of its trade from the maritime zone to the continent. Most importantly, increased Chinese trade in and around Central Asia will enable the final stage of China’s border consolidation: the isolation of separatist regions such as Xinjiang from outside political support.

The long-term challenge that the U.S. should address is decreasing China’s socioeconomic influence over Russia. Just as geopolitical analyst Brandon Weichert warns, China’s subtle “subordination of Russia” may turn Beijing into an even more hardline competitor that could force the U.S. to accommodate the Chinese global influence.

Should Beijing’s pan-Eurasian vision become reality, the United States will face a situation never seen before. And as countries such as India continue resisting China’s expansion while demonstrating extraordinary cautiousness, Russia seems to be sliding into Beijing’s orbit.

This is what should worry Americans in the long run: a China-dominated Eurasia connected with ports, railways, and roads stretching from the remote corners of Asia to Western Europe.

We Caught More Than Coronavirus From China - The American Spectator,"The coronavirus killed the Constitution before it killed 30,000 Americans.

From North Carolina to California, agents of the state charged Americans with crimes for protesting government policy. In Mississippi, the heart of the Bible Belt, local authorities shut down a church service held for safety reasons at a drive-in and ticketed parishioners remaining in their cars with the windows rolled up. Police in Colorado arrested three men for an illegal assembly in a private residence; the two visitors also face charges stemming from the crime of venturing outside of their own homes.

As the state follows its nature by engorging on freedom to grow its power, its policymakers use the coronavirus crisis to cynically advance causes they pushed prior to the importation of the disease: everyday-is-election-day ballots submitted by mail whenever by whoever, single-payer health-care, a guaranteed income, a cessation of border-wall construction, and so on. They seek not so much a cure for coronavirus as they do for America, diagnosed as a diseased body politic infected at its creation. Coronavirus, Rep. Jim Clyburn explained in a moment of candor, represents “a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.”

The government deems everything nonessential aside from government. Sure, that exaggerates — consumers, for instance, still find such essentials as scratch tickets, abortions, marijuana, and liquor available — but only a bit. Private enterprise, without which government budgets evaporate, barely exists. To the extent that it does it exists by the whim of the state. The Federal Reserve can counterfeit our own currency only so much before the money it creates to lend to the Treasury to fund stimulus becomes as valuable as your plane tickets to Paris. A temporary salve exists — furlough the many nonessential public-sector workers whom the unemployed private-sector workers deemed nonessential by government can no longer afford to float — but only one permanent solution: let the young and healthy go back to work, school, and their pursuit of happiness in restaurants, gyms, theaters, and strolls around the block. Individuals, many of whom likely continue to pursue their happiness by cordoning themselves off from the world, can protect their health better than the state.

We know this because, when not evil, the state proved idiotic in failing to meet this challenge. Its dictates emptied the schools of the young and healthy demographic least impacted by coronavirus and allowed poorly ventilated, unnaturally lit “care” facilities to carelessly remain crammed with the vulnerable demographic most susceptible to death by the disease. The data from their statistical models — predicting here, 1.7 million U.S. deaths; there, 60,000 deaths — seemed more likely derived from a late-night Ouija board session than mathematics. The very people who lectured us not to wear face coverings several weeks ago now demand that we do so. Officials released hardened criminals (one Floridian allegedly murdered a man a day after his release) and jailed social-distancing scofflaws.

None of it made sense, except as a cathartic attempt to assert power in a situation that shows them powerless through displaced assaults on the freedom of people rather than germs, projection of certainty on the unknown, and largely symbolic gestures passed off as substantive actions. And, of course, nothing hurts business more for the state the widespread realization of its impotence. So, it predictably, and laughably, explains its own powerlessness to protect as a function of its lack of power. If only individuals gave up more of their God-given rights to government, then government could more credibly imitate God by sparing all from death. It came to that most demagogic of all arguments: everyone dies unless all do as we say.

The government that forbids restraint of trade, the abridgment of peaceable assembly, unreasonable searches and seizures, and a deviation from republicanism now does what it proscribes. Two months ago, Americans mocked the robot gestapo flying around Wuhan, the government-created ghost towns, and hundreds of millions grounded by people not their parents. We imitate what we so recently ridiculed.

We caught more than COVID-19 from China. You do not live in a free country.

What Are We Allowed to Believe About China? - The American Spectator,"Last weekend at Power Line, John Hinderaker donned a conspiratorial cap and mused about exactly what it is we as a nation are going through and who benefits from it all.

An excerpt:

If you ran the Chinese Communist Party, what would your number one strategic goal have been in late 2019? Undoubtedly, to get rid of China’s nemesis, Donald Trump, and replace him with Beijing Joe Biden. How far would China’s rulers have gone to achieve that goal? Look what they have done to get rid of the Uighurs, a minor annoyance. Could the Chinese have deliberately arranged for the worldwide dissemination of the Wuhan virus? Yes, rather easily. They could have created the virus, too, but that isn’t necessary. Once the virus escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan, by means unknown, the rest was probably inevitable. Of course, the virus did some damage within China, but nowhere near enough to pose a threat to the regime. And to the extent that there was collateral damage in Europe and elsewhere around the world, such damage, from the CCP’s point of view, was a helpful distraction at a time when China is building up its armed forces and extending its military footprint across Asia. Does anyone think China’s rulers are either too inept or too principled to unleash the Wuhan virus on purpose? If so, why? They have done worse. And here, they would have been playing for enormous stakes — restoration of the pro-China, globalist regime that preceded Trump’s America First rebellion. Hardly any price would have been too much to pay. And, having watched the first three years of the Trump administration unfold, China’s rulers could well have calculated that a pandemic originating in their homeland stood a good chance of reshaping America’s electoral landscape. The desperate Democrats and their press would blame the president and his administration for the disease — something that has never occurred before in American history, but was sure to happen this time. If the Chinese did seek to influence our presidential race, they were successful. President Trump has gone from being a prohibitive favorite in January to an underdog today, and the reason is the Wuhan virus. Do I think China’s leaders deliberately unleashed the Wuhan virus on the world? I don’t know, but I no longer consider the idea outlandish. The virus’s origins are shrouded in mystery, and investigation of those origins has been discouraged, to put it mildly. Indeed, even mentioning the disease’s place of origin — Wuhan — has been denounced as “racist.” The virus may bring about the Chinese Communist Party’s number one goal. I don’t see any reason for a conclusive presumption that this fact is a coincidence.

Are you allowed to believe the things Hinderaker suggests? A certain political party in America would undoubtedly say no. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday after last week unleashing a spirited statement signaling a definitive change in America’s attitude toward the Chinese Communist Party, and Pompeo was ambushed by the uber-corrupt Robert Menendez, whose rhetoric differs little from that of the ChiComs:

“Under your watch, the United States has faced setback after setback on the world stage, ceding leverage and influence to our stated adversaries,” said Senator Bob Menendez, the committee’s ranking Democrat.

Menendez’s broadside was eerily similar to a propaganda video released by the Chinese government-owned China Global Television Network last week, which lambasted not just President Trump but British prime minister Boris Johnson and Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro as “populists” incapable of meeting real challenges and therefore “inventing” fake ones like controversies with China. Creepily, the video termed COVID-19 as the “test case” for that incapability, almost in a way suggesting that the virus was intended to so serve.

As Hinderaker notes, you are certainly not allowed to believe that the virus was a bioweapon. We all know that. Even to remind others within earshot that it was of Chinese origin would make you a racist by the modern crackpot definition of the term.

Of course, it isn’t necessary for the virus to have been a bioweapon per se. All that was required was for it to get out into the world.

Are you allowed to believe that once the virus was plaguing the city of Wuhan and escaping to other cities to build body counts and threaten an economic shutdown the ChiComs couldn’t afford, that regime deliberately allowed it to spread to Europe and the United States? It isn’t an over-the-top belief, after all. If China was to suffer economically from the virus, would the regime not wish to level the economic playing field?

Does China not benefit from economic carnage in America and Europe? Did China not swallow Hong Kong whole without so much as a peep from the U.S. and UK as they did the deed? Pompeo has announced a long list of consequences, none of which change the fact that Hong Kong’s independence is over.

In his Yorba Linda speech outlining the change in approach to China, Pompeo said what you know is true though are not allowed to believe — that opening trade to China has been a disaster, not just for America, but for the rest of the world. The Chinese have cheated their way to a position of economic strength they do not deserve, and while American interests have been damaged along the way, it’s other countries — Mexico, Brazil, India, Thailand, countless more — who have lost the opportunity to supply the international market due to Chinese state mercantilism allowed and promoted by fuzzy-thinking American globalist policies.

Are you allowed to believe the regime treated the virus as an opportunity to engage in military adventurism and a worldwide propaganda offensive?

Are you allowed to believe that China played a role in the mask-mandate debate roiling America? Until this spring it seemed to be fairly commonly accepted science that cloth face masks did little or nothing to prevent the spread of viruses, going so far that in early June the World Health Organization’s technical lead on COVID-19 suggested masks are useless because asymptomatic spread of the virus is rare. Less than 24 hours later she was sidelined, the WHO jumped on board the mask train, and now your civil rights are practically forfeit.

Who makes the vast majority of those masks you buy in stores? China.

Incidentally, the mask isn’t performing so well in stopping the spread of the virus, in case you haven’t noticed. In California, almost three months ago the governor instituted a stringent mask mandate. Within two months case counts had increased by 250 percent. In Louisiana, the results have been similar in the two and a half weeks since a statewide mask mandate edict emanated from the governor’s uncovered mouth.

What’s the excuse for the poor performance of the mandates in stopping the spread of the virus? People aren’t sufficiently complying.

Both governors are members of a certain political party that commonly sounds similar notes to those played by the Chinese Communist Party.

Are you allowed to believe China is involved in promoting the violence and unrest in America’s cities? Last week the State Department ordered China’s consulate in Houston closed, which occasioned a quick bonfire of documents in the courtyard of that building so large that the local fire department was called to the scene. The Houston consulate was known to be a center of espionage through which the theft of intellectual property in the field of medicine had flowed — China is trying to beat the world in producing a COVID-19 vaccine, which would be another way they could monetize the virus. Stealing intellectual property from American medical researchers appears to be a key part of the their strategy.

What else where the ChiComs there up to? National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien had made statements following the outbreak of George Floyd-themed street violence that foreign action was suspected, and China was among the countries he mentioned.

Is China promoting Antifa and Black Lives Matter? Wouldn’t it be in the interest of that regime to foment unrest in our streets to balance its own internal issues? The world has been made aware, in technicolor, of Chinese abuse of the Uyghurs — from photographs of bound prisoners being loaded onto trains to NBA coaches admitting their training camps in western China were essentially concentration camps for Chinese minorities. And of course there’s what has happened to the people of Hong Kong.

Why wouldn’t China want to push Antifa and Black Lives Matter to build the narrative that America is a racist, unstable, morally unsound country? China seeks to take away America’s position of world leadership, especially at a time when Trump is building relations with India and the Anglosphere is reorienting itself to act as one. Doesn’t that leadership suffer from the violence in our streets?

Particularly during an election year?

Chinese meddling in American elections isn’t new. Going all the way back to 1996 it’s been known that Chinese money flows into the campaign coffers of candidates from a particular political party. That party’s current candidate has been all but bought and paid for by Chinese investment dollars; no one really disputes this. The candidate is moreover on video repeatedly singing the praises of the Chinese and discounting the idea they present a threat.

Are you allowed to believe China is meddling in the 2020 election?

Are you allowed to believe that China exercises significant influence over America’s major media? Chinese investors and companies, all with ties to the Chinese Communist Party, hold relatively significant stock positions in all six of the media companies that control 90 percent of the television channels and film entertainment producers in America. We’ve seen the Chinese exert influence on various film and television productions — there’s a reason the Red Dawn remake, in a classic example, had the wholly implausible North Koreans as the invading bad guys. Is it so hard to believe something similar is at work with respect to news? We’ve already seen it in the case of Bloomberg.

What are you allowed to believe about China and what they’re doing? Nothing? Anything? Are you allowed to believe the Chinese are not standing idly by waiting to see if Trump gets reelected and finishes his project of draining our supply chain out of that country?

Because once you are allowed to believe the Chinese have motive, opportunity, and capability to do these things, you’ll find a mountain of evidence, though admittedly much is circumstantial, that they’re playing a lot larger role in our current woes than we give them credit for.",https://spectator.org/how-the-u-s-can-solve-the-current-trade-tariff-impasse-with-china/,2020-07-31
What George Will Gets Wrong About Russia and China - The American Spectator,"The Washington Post columnist George Will surveys recent world events and proclaims that the “correlation of world forces” has shifted substantially against Russia and China. He attributes this shift to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — which he calls a “spectacular geostrategic blunder” comparable to Napoleon’s invasion of Russia in 1812 and Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 — and China’s aggressive behavior in the South China Sea. Russia’s blunder caused the NATO alliance to further expand with the additions of Finland and Sweden, while China’s repeated military incursions near Taiwan caused Japan to significantly bolster its defense capabilities. But what is also happening is that the principal world powers are dividing into two antagonistic blocs eerily reminiscent of the lead-up to the First World War.

World events in 2022 have pushed China and Russia closer together than any time since the founding of the Sino-Soviet bloc in 1950. Mao Zedong’s victory in China in October 1949 and his signing of a mutual security pact with Soviet Russia on Feb. 14, 1950 — and the subsequent Korean War in which China and Russia supported, supplied, and fought with our North Korean enemy — resulted in the adoption by the United States of NSC-68 — the classified national security blueprint that put meat on the bones of the containment doctrine that the State Department’s Policy Planning Director George F. Kennan explained in his famous “X” article in Foreign Affairs in 1947. And NSC-68 had its origins in the geopolitical writings of Britain’s Sir Halford Mackinder and America’s Nicholas Spykman, who separately warned that the democracies needed to ensure the geopolitical pluralism of Eurasia.

The United States fought two “hot wars” — in Korea and Vietnam — against communist regimes supported by the Sino-Soviet bloc. We tied in Korea and lost in Vietnam thanks, in part, to Soviet and Chinese assistance to our enemies. Fortunately, the emerging Sino-Soviet split widened in the late 1960s to the point where their respective armies clashed near the Ussuri River in 1969. President Richard Nixon took geopolitical advantage of that development to forge the opening to China while simultaneously pursuing detente with the Soviet Union, further driving a wedge between the two Eurasian communist giants. Every administration after Nixon’s recognized the wisdom of preventing a reconciliation between Soviet Russia and China during the endgame of the Cold War.

Since 1993, U.S. foreign policy has, wittingly or unwittingly, worked in the opposite direction — financially fueling China’s rise while antagonizing a defeated Russia by repeatedly expanding NATO eastward. It was our “unipolar moment” when the hubris of our policymakers talked about “new world orders” and “peace dividends.” Geopolitics was seemingly replaced by geoeconomics. Distracted by the endless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the Global War on Terror, we took our eye off the ball of global geopolitics. And we based our approach to China’s rise on the mistaken belief that China’s market reforms would lead to political liberalization and China’s acceptance of a U.S.-led world order. China instead, first quietly then overtly, pursued what President Xi Jinping calls his “China Dream” — China replacing the United States as the leader of the global order.

More than a hundred years ago, Mackinder warned that control of Eurasia by an alliance of hostile great powers could lead to a world empire. Eighty years ago, Spykman warned U.S. policymakers to focus on maintaining the geopolitical pluralism of Eurasia upon which their security depended. Today, George Will sees the strengthening of the strategic partnership of China and Russia as a shift in the “correlation of world forces” in the democracies’ favor. He must have skipped his Geopolitics class.

George Kennan understood geopolitics. He warned in 1997 that expanding NATO would lead to a revival of a militaristic and imperialistic Russia. He also understood and wrote about the events that led to the outbreak of the First World War, which he rightly called the “seminal catastrophe” of the 20th century. The events of 2022 that George Will sees as hopeful and positive — the forming of great power hostile alliances, war in Eastern Europe, crises in the South China Seas — echo the tragic sequence of events that led to World War I. History does not repeat, but it does rhyme, and, contrary to George Will’s sanguine observations, the rhyme of today’s events is frightening.",https://spectator.org/how-to-make-china-pay-and-prevent-the-next-pandemic/,2022-12-30
What Rand Paul Gets Wrong About China and Taiwan - The American Spectator,"Writing in the American Conservative, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul urges Congress and the Biden administration to maintain America’s long-standing policy of “strategic ambiguity” toward Taiwan. Paul’s reasoning is simple: switching to “strategic clarity” now and providing additional military funding to Taiwan, as is contemplated by the Taiwan Policy Act (which has bipartisan support in the Senate), “may well be interpreted by China as a provocation,” is too “explicit and aggressive,” will result in “escalating tensions,” is “bellicose,” and “may very well” lead China to prepare for war.

This raises the questions: What does Paul think China has been preparing for this past decade under the leadership of President Xi Jinping? Haven’t China’s military exercises and frequent air and naval incursions into Taiwan’s defensive zone been “aggressive” and “provocative”? Who is it that has been “escalating tensions” since at least the fall of 2021? As for bellicose rhetoric, China claims that the entire South China Sea belongs to her (the so-called “nine-dash line”) and repeatedly has called for the reunification of China and Taiwan, by force if necessary.

Just because a policy is “long-standing” does not mean that it corresponds to today’s geopolitical realities. The policy of “strategic ambiguity” can be traced back to the Shanghai Communique, negotiated by President Richard Nixon and Chinese leader Mao Zedong. At that time and throughout the 1970s and 1980s, China was our de facto ally against the Soviet Union. China opened relations with the United States because it was by far the weaker party in its conflict with the Soviet Union. This was, after all, the same Mao Zedong whose planned invasion of Taiwan was deterred by America’s 7th Fleet when the Korean War broke out; the same Chinese leader whose military designs on Taiwan were foiled twice in the 1950s by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who threatened nuclear war to defend the island.

What is often forgotten by foreign policy observers is that when the Cold War ended, both the United States and China were winners. But while America sought a “peace dividend,” China pursued policies that resulted in sustained growth in its economic and military power. And China’s goal of reunification with Taiwan never changed. Chinese leaders were, however, patient and circumspect in pursuing that goal, at least most of the time. Sometimes, as in 1996, they tested the waters by threatening military action against Taiwan, which caused President Bill Clinton to send the 7th Fleet to the Taiwan Strait.

Xi has been the most bellicose and aggressive of China’s leaders since Mao. And as Paul notes, China today “is a country with economic power, a growing military, and alliances with our other adversaries.” The circumstances under which we adopted and followed the policy of “strategic ambiguity” have changed considerably. Keeping China “guessing” about whether the United States will defend Taiwan, as Paul advocates, no longer makes sense. “Strategic ambiguity” deterred China from invading Taiwan when the United States had overwhelming military superiority vis-à-vis China. That is no longer the case in the South China Sea. What we need is strategic clarity backed by sufficient force. Paul appears to understand that, for he also writes, “If the United States announces an ironclad commitment to defend Taiwan prior to establishing the capabilities to do so, China may invade before the United States can significantly bolster Taiwan’s military.”

But deterrence always involves taking risks. The United States was never in a position to defend West Berlin in the event of a Soviet invasion, but our on-the-ground forces served as a psychological tripwire that was backed by a sufficient nuclear deterrent. There was very little we could have done to defend northern Norway in the event of a Soviet attack, but NATO and our nuclear deterrent effectively deterred such an attack. Strategic ambiguity with an insufficient military capability is the worst of both worlds. But strategic clarity even with a less-than-optimal military posture can serve as a deterrent, as the examples above proved.

Paul is right to criticize the Biden administration for a policy that can only be described as “confusion,” with the White House repeatedly having to walk back the president’s remarks on Taiwan. Yet isn’t that similar to a policy of strategic ambiguity? Surely, the Biden administration’s missteps on this issue have Chinese leaders “guessing” just what U.S. policy is towards Taiwan. And isn’t that what Paul wants? (READ MORE from Francis P. Sempa: More Confusion From Biden White House on Taiwan)

If Taiwan’s independence is in the vital national security interests of the United States — if Taiwan is the West Berlin of Asia — then strategic clarity backed by a manifest military commitment to the region (hopefully including key allies like Japan) is a better deterrent than strategic ambiguity.",https://spectator.org/human-less-robot-restaurant-opens-china-automated-food-service-coronavirus/,2022-10-04
When a Scholar Meets China’s Red Guards - The American Spectator,"When a scholar meets soldiers, he should not argue with them, for he surely will lose.

— Chinese proverb

Recently I was invited by the “China Goes Global” conference in Winter Park, Florida, to give a keynote speech on the U.S.–China trade war and its implications for management research. In my speech I briefly reviewed the trade war and the reasons behind it, and I pointed out that the control over business firms by the Chinese Communist Party (which is also the Chinese government) has changed the boundary and behavior of Chinese firms. This change has challenged the traditional assumptions about firms, such as that they prize autonomy or are purely profit-seeking, and thus requires new investigation.

A group of young scholars from China were very angry with my speech and accused me of lying. Frankly, I was quite shocked by their accusation. The moderator of the meeting asked them to explain how I lied. While I was not happy about being called a liar, I also very much hoped that they would identify mistakes in my speech. Who better to collect feedback from than those who disagree with me? So I encouraged them to criticize my talk. Two of them stood up, and the whole room was quiet with anticipation. But, to the audience’s and my disappointment, they could not deliver any more specific criticisms about my alleged lying. Finally, one of the young scholars gave her definition of lying as “not true,” which drew a few claps from her group.

The moderator then asked me to reply their accusations. I honestly felt quite dumbfounded. This type of accusation was common from the Red Guards during the Chinese Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, but to experience it over a half century later in an international academic conference was surprising, to say the least. These young participants are the future of China, in academics, politics, and business, but they don’t seem to know how to conduct meaningful discussions. Facing views that differ from theirs, their only tactic was to attack not my work but my character.

At that moment, my daughter’s experience came to mind. When she was a doctoral student in California, she went to a local kindergarten to talk to children about the ocean and encouraged them to ask questions. The kindergarten teacher quickly reminded the children, “Let’s review what questions are. Questions start with the words who, where, what, why, when or how.” I am sure that as they get older, these budding inquirers also learned how to debate.

The young scholars from China may have had a different education. The Chinese Communist Party superimposes their ideology on all aspects of Chinese society, including education. According to the party, communist ideology is an absolute truth that cannot be challenged. If anyone questions it, he or she must and will be denounced and silenced. In recent years, several outspoken professors in China (upon being reported by students) were silenced by the party. Usually the denouncement is done by labeling the deviant person as a counterrevolutionary. In comparison, “liar” is a rather mild label.

In my reply to the young scholars, I said that in academic debate, we must first distinguish facts from opinions. If my facts or data are wrong, you can say that I am wrong. If you feel that I deliberately misrepresented the facts, then yes, that would be lying. If you disagree with my point of view, however, you can put yours forward instead. But you can’t accuse me of lying simply because you disagree.

In my keynote talk, I quoted Chinese President Xi Jinping saying, “We want to be the participant, initiator, and leader of global governance reform and development.” In order to do this, active and meaningful participation in the debate on world affairs is necessary. Let’s consider my keynote speech appearing in a journal instead. An editor might welcome a rebuttal from the young scholars, but an article repetitively stating the retort, “He lied!” would hardly make the cut. I am afraid that even China’s Global Times, which frequently labels critics as “anti-China,” would not run it.

Ironically, these young scholars from China may not realize that the sort of efforts they made to silence me could eventually lead to their own demise. Because the Chinese Communist Party is built on such a lofty ideology, the party needs to periodically eliminate dissenting views to cement its absolute rule. During such a purge, the party would single out the most outspoken person (or people) to be labeled as anti-party, pro-America, or other names, depending on the current enemy. People who are not singled out would feel relieved, and to be safe, they might participate in denouncing these targets. Next time, since the most outspoken ones have been all silenced, the second most outspoken people would be culled. Eventually, victims must be picked from the mildest people who have never questioned the party. Therefore, in order to safeguard themselves, the mildest group should actually protect the most outspoken ones, even though they might not share the same views. Furthermore, if everyone expressed the same ideas in a conference, I am sure even these young Chinese scholars would find it boring.

During the “China Goes Global” conference, I sat in on six presentations, and in every presentation the speaker either criticized the U.S. government or ridiculed President Trump. By the way, these speakers were mostly foreign nationals. No one, not a single American, called the speaker a liar. But when I gave my view on how the Chinese Communist Party runs China and influences the world, I received a collective denunciation from the young Chinese scholars.

This leads to the following question: Can we criticize a government? The answer seems to be a no-brainer: in democracies, we criticize our government and our president all the time; in non-democracies, criticizing the government can cost one’s life. If the non-democracy is small, like Cuba for example, we can safely criticize it without consequences, as long as we are not inside the country.

But for China, this is not the case. Thus, this century-old question suddenly has renewed relevance.

China has the world’s largest economy (measured by purchasing power parity) and one of the strongest armed forces. Besides economic power and military might, the Chinese government projects its global influence through its pervasive propaganda campaign through international broadcasting, media acquisitions, and its numerous Confucius Institutes. All these efforts have impacted the policies and citizens of many countries, including the United States. It is not a stretch to say that people in these countries have every right to criticize the Chinese government.

If what I laid out above is so commonsense, why does virtually no one in international business or management research communities criticize the Chinese government, as evidenced by my experience at this recent conference?

One big reason: self-censorship. Criticizing the Chinese party-state is costly and potentially very dangerous.

The party-state retaliates against anyone who criticizes it. Scholars who study China need to, or at least like to, visit China. China is a huge academic market, and those who are good at publishing papers or teaching are often invited to visit with paid trips accompanied by lucrative lecturing and consulting fees. But if a scholar criticizes the party-state, he or she may lose all these attractive opportunities and be banned from entering the country. Even worse, he or she may be arrested for a variety of charges, such as endangering state security. If the scholar has family members in China, they may get visits from the police, too.

Those who study China are aware of this danger, and most make sure not to offend the party-state. Though there is no actual list of forbidden topics, scholars tend to play it safe and steer very clear from sensitive issues. Furthermore, knowing there are more applicants than coveted lecture or consulting spots, scholars compete to show who is closer and more aligned with the party. The Chinese government has crafted a conveniently toxic environment to ensure no scholars criticize its political system.

Perry Link, a noted China scholar, likens this type of self-censorship as “the anaconda in the chandelier”: the anaconda just hangs there and does not need to strike. Clearly realizing its presence, people underneath all try to outdo each other in order to not attract the attention of the big snake. So they all engage in self-censorship.

The only way to preserve and restore our power to speak on how the Chinese government’s policies impact the world is to collectively state our rights: people are free to comment on any topic and criticize any government. Many may view this as a futile effort thanks to the prisoner’s dilemma: rights like the freedom of expression are public goods; everyone enjoys it, yet few are willing to fight for it. But we must also recognize the undesirable consequences of not having these rights. And I hope the young Chinese conferencegoers may also see my points here.

"While the Media Analyzes Trump's Tweets, India and China Engage in a Military Standoff - The American Spectator","If you have been watching the news at all for the past few weeks, you’ve probably heard a whole lot about President Trump’s tweets, Don Jr.’s “treasonous” meeting with a Russian lawyer and probably something about the Kardashians. While these topics are entertaining and eye catching, they don’t really matter when it comes down to it. Trump is going to continue tweeting and pushing the media into an uproar, Don Jr.’s meeting is going to amount to just another “nothing-burger,” and the Kardashians stay the same. While all this nonsense has been filling our screens, either computer or television, a quiet crisis has been brewing in the Himalayan border region of Doklam.

What’s Doklam? I asked the same question when I saw an article in the Diplomat highlighting the crisis. Essentially, it is a disputed patch of territory claimed by both Bhutan and China. India tries to maintain Bhutanese sovereignty, and has territory that borders the region. China tried to build a military road through a pass in the region, and troops have been engaged in a standoff since June. No one has been killed as of yet, and the situation hasn’t escalated, but some are calling it India’s “Cuban Crisis“. Thankfully diplomatic solutions are likely, and a full out war is near impossible. Despite this, it would be nice to know if the two largest countries in the world, both with nuclear capabilities, were engaged in a military standoff. I checked CNN’s home page and a top article was about Ann Coulter tweeting at Delta Airlines, and only found an outdated article on Doklam. Ann Coulter was top billing on the Washington Post as well. Keep reporting on Trump’s tweets, CNN and Washington Post, it’s bread for the masses.

Why China Got Away With It - The American Spectator,"What can you say about a country that trashed the planet Earth with a deadly virus? That it knew what it was doing?

China has gotten away with it: businesses and industries destroyed or damaged; massive recession and unemployment; medical systems strained to the point of collapse; countries rent asunder by populism; transport systems in disarray; interruption of children’s education and development; loss of confidence in governments; rising mental illness, anger, and civil disobedience; vulnerability of the elderly and those with underlying conditions; and nearly twice as many American dead than in World War II. The full effects of COVID-19 and its variants are yet to be known.

Whether the COVID pathogen was an accidental release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology or an act of Nature via infected bats or pangolins matters less than the cover up by the Chinese Politburo — delayed disclosure by months, and the persecution of medical experts who tried to tell the truth. That domestic flights in and out of Wuhan were shut down while international ones were allowed to continue speaks for itself. Did the Chinese Politburo think that China should not be the only country to suffer — and that the catastrophe should be exported and shared?

The world’s reaction to this monstrous act has thus far been relatively mild. The full force of the world’s media, governments and multilateral organizations, judicial processes, and multinational companies has not been brought to bear. Yes, there was some initial outrage but it has subsided and yielded to a broad acceptance of the status quo: it is what it is, as they say.

So why is this? There are certainly two reasons: 1) money, and 2) fear of kinetic action.

Evidencing its economic might, China now appears to rank number one in outward foreign direct investment, which in 2020 exceeded $150 billion, according to the Hamburg-based data firm, Statistica, which seems to have accepted data from China’s Ministry of Commerce, the National Bureau of Statistics, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange at face value. The New York-based Trading Economics also appears to have accepted these statistics from the Chinese government. Other Chinese official sources report total Chinese outward FDI (believed to be at historical cost, not equity) at nearly $2.6 trillion, putting China in third place. Chinese direct investment benefits employment and GDP in host countries: nearly $50 billion of Chinese capital had been invested in the roughly 70 Belt and Road Initiative countries by 2020, with considerably more committed. For example, China’s commitment to Pakistan, a crown jewel in the BRI, exceeds $60 billion. With an economic stick of this size, it is no wonder that China wants to rewrite the global rules for trade and investment to benefit Beijing and challenge the U.S.-dominated postwar order.

Further, China’s foreign exchange and gold reserves total $3.3 trillion, allowing it to buy its way into recipient countries, particularly in capital short developing countries. Accumulation of these reserves has been driven by consumption, with U.S. retailers linked real time to the producing factories in China. Adding to its economic influence, China holds nearly $1.3 trillion of U.S. treasury securities. Abruptly swapping out of some U.S. dollar instruments would put pressure on the dollar and increase U.S. interest rates, likely creating pandemonium in credit and equity markets — albeit with devaluation of China’s U.S. dollar holdings and incurring transaction costs.

A final economic factor is U.S. foreign direct investment in China, which approximated $125 billion in 2020 at historical cost. Nationalization of premier U.S. multinationals in technology and finance, for example, would be a high visibility form of retaliation.

Besides money is the fear of a kinetic reaction — that could be demanded by knowing the truth. Notably, the U.S. intelligence community stated that it was unable to determine the origin of COVID-19 in its report released in August, although as noted, there is already evidence of China’s duplicitous behavior and cover-up. Should China be called out the way President Kennedy called out the USSR for its construction in Cuba of launch sites to support nuclear ballistic missiles in 1962, the world would demand more than rhetoric and condemnations. China is now perceived as nearing military parity with the U.S., with its goal of equivalence by 2027, contemporaneous with the 100th anniversary of its armed forces. A U.S. military or cyber conflict with China would be catastrophic for the world, with potentially cataclysmic consequences for both China and the U.S. Further, there is some doubt among experts as to whether the U.S. could actually win a conventional conflict with China in the western Pacific.

As I have written in The American Spectator, the free market can inhibit China’s future aspirations. However, relocation of manufacturing and cutting cross-border and local exposure will take time and may not be enough. A trial at The Hague, a judicial body of the United Nations, might result in a loss of face for the Chinese Politburo, however the UN is tilted toward anti-western policies, and a complaint would position the U.S. in conflict with developing countries, and those members of the Belt and Road Initiative.

Unfortunately, we are currently stuck with this: “it is what it is.”

"Why Take the Newest China Virus Seriously, and How Handle It With Sanity - The American Spectator","1. Why Take It Seriously

I face a dilemma. I do not believe a thing coming from CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, PBS, MSNBC, the Washington Post, or the New York Times. They have lied to me so often, and particularly these past three years, that I do not watch them, do not hear them, do not bother with them. I do read the headlines of the daily Washington Post and sometimes open a story, but rarely. Even a broken clock is correct twice daily.

Likewise, when I watch Fox News, the only American news I can bear to watch on my TV, I do so mostly with a grain of salt. Some of them have my confidence: Laura Ingraham, Mark Levin, Bret Baier, Brit Hume, Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, and the occasional appearances of Victor Davis Hanson and Mark Steyn. And, except for his adoration of animals and some of his salty references, Greg Gutfeld probably is the closest thing there to me.

As it happens, I watch one hour of Israel news every night. I do so because, although my mastery of Biblical Hebrew is strong, my day-long immersion in and love for the quirks and nuances of the glorious English language impel me to listen to an hour of spoken contemporary “street Hebrew” daily in order to maintain that added fluency. I also have come to enjoy the news coverage there because they cover Mideast, European, and Asian developments better and more objectively than does American news, and because it enhances my perspective on what’s cookin’ in Israel. This has proven to be particularly valuable for me as I follow the coronavirus scare because it affords me an in-depth second perspective. For the past month it has seemed to me that they are three weeks ahead of us. If so, we all will be expected to stay indoors by April, on pain of arrest and fine.

On one hand, I am like so many supporters of President Trump who are so disgusted with the Corrupt Journalist Corps and their nonstop lies that I have no patience to watch or hear their “coverage” of COVID-19, which basically can be summarized as, “Trump is to blame for the disease.” Trump failed to foresee it when he was born. Trump should have had everyone wearing gas masks. All deaths are Trump’s fault. Oh, and did we mention that he is a RACIST!? How can he call it the Chinese virus? Because of Trump, we do not have enough test kits, enough masks, enough toilet paper. Impeach! If only we had Joe Biden right now in the White House, he would know what to do.

I have no patience for that garbage. When I watch and compare what is going on in Israel, and their coverage of Europe and Asia, I see that President Trump has led very effectively. All countries were unprepared — in some same ways, in some different ways. Israel also did not have enough test kits and also is trying to line up more masks and ventilators. In Italy and Spain, they really messed up. Sure, it is easy for the perpetual Trump Haters now to say that he should have done more before. But when he closed down air travel from China, the same garbage-heavers went apoplectic: RACIST!

Now the governors of more and more states are imposing serious quarantines that are requiring all residents of their respective state to remain indoors, alone with family, allowed to exit only for the most urgent needs: seeking urgent medical care and buying toilet paper. In Israel, the country now is “b’hesger” — closed down. The only exceptions are for life’s urgencies: again, medical needs, shopping for food and pharmaceuticals, and — because it is Israel — attending political demonstrations (but staying six feet, or two meters, apart). Can you imagine what the Trump Haters would have said if he actually had ordered quarantines and businesses and people off the streets during the earliest days? CNN and MSNBC would have been hosting mental-health “experts” saying that Trump finally broke and now is like Hitler preparing to impose martial law and to impose the dictatorship-for-life that CNN’s and MSNBC’s crack commentators have been predicting insanely since he traveled down the escalator.

Meanwhile, objective history will record forever that, as the rest of the world was coming to grips in January 2020 with the realization that we had a pandemic brewing, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats were focused on souvenir pens, impeachment to nowhere, and tearing up speeches throughout the month, bogging down the president with a Senate trial that required huddling with legal counsel when the Congress and the country instead should have had eyes on Europe and on the newest China virus.

Regardless of the politics, I take this thing very, very seriously. My law students are in a safer age cohort, but my congregation includes several beloved families who are over age 60 and 65 and beyond. Some live very dynamically but with chronic health conditions that place them in the higher-risk categories. Some take meds to control those conditions and assure them longevity, but these meds compromise their immunity. Even though the death rate or any severe results from this newest China virus among people under 60 is minuscule, those are precisely the sweet and kind people who unknowingly can transmit death to those in the higher-risk categories. So I do not regard this thing as an “overblown exaggeration.” My people do not eat bats, snakes, and dogs, and we do not have an established tolerance to China viruses.

COVID-19 both is less serious than the flu, and it is far more serious than the flu. On one hand, coronavirus numbers are a minuscule splotch compared to the annual numbers of American and worldwide flu infections and deaths. We Americans lose 30,000 to 60,000 Americans annually from the flu, and no one pays much attention. By contrast, almost everyone under 60 who contracts coronavirus comes out pretty solidly. So that makes the China virus seem milder. Even the 60–69 group sustain fewer than 10 percent dead. Even the overwhelming majority of the septuagenarians and octogenarians who contract come out alive and kicking. More than 80 percent in those age groups survive, even at that age. All that is one perspective — that the whole thing is way overblown, aimed at taking down Trump now that the Democrats and their Corrupt Journalist Corps failed with FISA and with Christopher Steele, with Blasey Ford and with Avenatti and Stormy, with Michael Cohen and with Omarosa, with Mueller and with impeachment.

But here’s the thing. People under 60 and without high-risk health conditions know pretty quickly when they have the flu, but do not know for two weeks when they are carrying coronavirus. This difference is critical. When someone has the flu, within two or three days they are sneezing, coughing, red-eyed, and a mess. You know to stay away from them, or you know you also are going to be so sick in two days. Moreover, if you are among the half of Americans who are sensible, you even can pursue partial precaution by getting a flu shot, even a multi-spectrum one for people more at risk. That immunization does not cancel every flu bug, but it helps a bunch and even mitigates flu’s worst symptoms for many who nevertheless get stricken.

The problem with COVID-19 is that it takes a long time — two weeks, a fortnight, even longer — before the carrier knows he is infected. That is why they quarantine for 14 days, not two or three days. And carriers tend to transmit it more broadly, to more people than flu carriers, perhaps because they are oblivious to their own infection. So all these robust and healthy people kiss a spouse, hug a kid, visit a grandma or grandpa, shake a hand, place hands on a coffee-shop table, borrow or lend a pen, hand-pick some fresh produce at the store, and transmit the bug. And then — two weeks later — it turns into a 1960s “Star Trek” episode, where everyone on the planet except for Kirk, Spock, Bones, Sulu, and Uhura ends up dying before the first commercial.

Unlike flu, we do not yet know for sure what we are dealing with because, except for Andrew Zimmern, who eats bats? The flu season often ends in the warmer months, but Australia now is in summer because everything there is upside-down — lucky for them there is gravity! — and they have the China virus spreading there, too. Not only do we not fully know what we are dealing with here, but we also cannot be sure whether or not next winter the thing will mutate into a variant. So it is a real concern. Look dispassionately and objectively at what has befallen Italy and Spain to grasp what could be.

Which raises the next epidemiological concern: Let’s say, based on some people having stronger natural immunities and some being more susceptible, that this newest China virus eventually will hit “X” number of Americans in each of the various age and health categories. Even if the ultimate number of people stricken cannot be avoided, there is an enormous premium on slowing down the rate, the tempo of the spread so that not everyone gets critical at once. By reducing the speed of the spread, the public’s health system may avoid becoming over-taxed. We have a finite number of oxygen-generating equipment — ventilators, external oxygen machines — a finite number of hospital beds and intensive-care beds, a finite number of health-care workers, doctors, and nurses. If all whom the coronavirus will strike get sick during the same time frame, the system will be forced into the ultimate “Medicare for All” nightmare: not enough resources to treat all the older, the immunosuppressed, and the chronically weakened — so hospital administrators and medical personnel will have to make life-and-death choices as to who gets the ventilator and who is selected to die.

That concern is at the core of Israel’s response, as they have moved increasingly from the more relaxed early steps we have taken here. By now, they are enforcing home stays, except for limited exceptions. In their latest move, they actually are at the edge of the envelope of personal privacy, having engaged technology that, until now, they have employed only to track, monitor, and surveil potential terrorists. They have technology that enables them to go back and track retroactively to determine where an infected guy had been days earlier, and to identify and locate every person with whom he came into contact back then. And then they text those people to go into 14-day quarantine. The Knesset and Israeli Supreme Court are actively monitoring the implementation to assure that this desperate life-saving mechanism does not turn into our corrupted FISA court system.

2. Dealing With It

I am not hoarding. Hoarding is so foolish and socially evil, causing artificial disruptions to an ample supply chain. We are a land of plenty. Shelves are bare because supermarkets, proceeding as they do every other day, do not maintain in back storage room a million rolls of toilet paper, a million hand sanitizers, and a million cartons of milk. If they did, in normal times, the milk would spoil, and the toilet paper and sanitizers would crowd out the food items that normal consumers come to buy. So the store managers know how much of each thing to have on stock based on experiences with buyers’ normal patterns. At some point, those who have hoarded toilet paper are going to figure out that (i) they have no more room at home to store any more of it; (ii) they have no room for food in their refrigerators because the cold shelves, vegetable bins, and cheese racks are jammed with toilet paper; and (iii) if they having nothing to eat, then — d’uh!— they ain’t gonna need so much toilet paper anyway!

For me as an Orthodox Jew, there is another dimension to all this. All my life, I have lived a 25-hour period every week, from Friday sunset to Saturday nightfall, observing the Holy Sabbath (Shabbat) in the manner of our tradition. For 25 hours, we do not activate electricity or electronics, do not drive a car, do not transact business, do not write, do not use phones or computers. Outsiders hear of an Orthodox Jewish Sabbath and ask compassionately, “You poor person, what do you do all day? Sit in the dark?”

No. When you cannot watch television or email or text and tweet your thumbs off and cannot do clothes washes or write checks to pay bills, you instead slow down and take a breath for a day. You eat a slower, longer multi-course meal that you prepared before Shabbat, with no rush, no worries. You talk with your spouse, your kids, your parents, your invited friends, and you share a two-hour meal. You sing soulful songs at the table. The kids update you on their week at school, and you them on your week at work. Afterwards, you read. One person reads Team of Rivals. Another reads the weekly Torah portion with English-translated medieval Hebrew commentaries written by Rabbi Rashi of France, Rabbis Ramban and Ibn Ezra of Spain, Rabbi Sforno of Italy, perhaps something more contemporary like Rabbi Hirsch of Germany or Rabbi Soloveitchik of Boston and New York. The kids play board games: Apples to Apples, Settlers of Catan, chess, Ticket to Ride, Scrabble, Taboo! — or my favorite, 221B Baker Street.

When I was a little boy, I harbored mixed feelings about Shabbat because my non-Jewish friends and my non-observant Jewish friends would run off to the movies on Saturday afternoon; I could not go. The years have passed. If someone today were to ask me whether I wish I could go to the movies on Shabbat, I would look at them as though they were crazy.

It is going to be challenging for Americans to get used to living more indoors, slowing down the pace a bit, attending class and lectures via Zoom instead of in person, watching streamed movies at home instead of traveling the world. This will be different and at times isolating. And it may go on for a year, not just three weeks. But some may look back a year from now and concede that it was a little bit nice to experience what June and Ward Cleaver and Ozzie and Harriet had — nuclear family. In Israel, where not every Jew is Orthodox, this Shabbat will be the first time in the 71-year history of the country that there will be a Shabbat when all public transportation is closed down, all sports events are closed, all theaters, restaurants, beaches, and shopping malls are closed. Maybe some will appreciate what they have been missing.

Here, too, maybe we all can calm down a moment and realize that, in a world where an infinitesimally minuscule microbe can drive an entire planet into pandemonium, we do not and cannot control everything. We are incapable of destroying G-d’s planet because we are not omnipotent. And we also should think about whether anyone in our orbit is so isolated and shut in that they need a phone call or help in having food delivered to their door. That omnipotent we can be.",https://spectator.org/in-china-free-trade-means-steal-what-you-want/,2020-03-20
Why the U.S. and China Need to Delink - The American Spectator,"The two biggest events in the world today are the U.S.–China trade war and the current coronavirus pandemic. Both are related to a single country: China. If a single country can adversely affect the U.S. and the world on such a grand scale, we must examine how to protect ourselves from these events in the future.

The most fundamental reason for the trade war is the political and economic system of China. China is ruled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which claims to know the human destiny — communism — and therefore the party is infallible. To lead the humanity to its destiny, the party must have absolute power over every aspect of society, not only political power and economic control but also control over the culture, the flow of information, and people’s opinions.

Interestingly, the current CCP leadership has avoided Mao’s mistake of ignoring the people’s welfare, and it has done a quite successful job of aligning the interests of the people and the party. For example, the economic goal of China is to develop the economy and profit from international trade. To achieve this, the party, being above the law with absolute power, runs China like a huge corporation. Living and doing business in China is not a right, but a privilege granted by the party. The state-owned enterprises are essentially business units, and foreign and private firms are like franchisees of China, Inc. owned by the CCP.

People in China are not citizens, but employees of the giant corporation, with the party leader as the CEO. The CCP’s industrial and trade strategy is to identify key industries, such as electronic vehicle batteries, mobilize the necessary resources such as acquiring cobalt worldwide, protect its domestic markets, and subsidize its national firms. One such example is Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL). The large, protected domestic market enabled CATL to quickly work its way down the learning curve and quickly realize its economies of scale.

The CCP also uses state intelligence collection capabilities to help Chinese firms acquire foreign technologies. If other countries confront the Chinese firms for alleged illegal behavior, the CCP will use its state power to intervene and retaliate. Now CATL is among the largest electronic vehicle batteries suppliers in the world.

Using this strategy, the CCP has expanded China’s domination in several key industries, such as solar panels, high-speed rail, and 5G networks. While supporting the industry/firm selected by the CCP for global dominance takes away resources from other businesses and people, once the supported firm dominates the world market, the revenue from its near-monopoly position will create jobs and raise the income level for the people in China. In this sense, the CCP’s global expansion strategy, while unfair to other countries, not only pays off for the party and the favored firm or industry but also benefits the ordinary Chinese people, making the interests of the party and the people more aligned.

The present trade war may change this by stopping unfair practices. The U.S. demanded that the laws in China be fair and impartial and that the CCP stop its “Made in China 2025” strategy. This strategy uses state power and unfair industrial and trade policies to achieve dominance in the industries that the CCP deems strategic. The U.S. has also demanded that China cease subsidizing Chinese firms to gain unfair advantages and stop stealing intellectual property from other countries. It has demanded that China remove trade barriers and open its markets. In sum, the U.S. wants the CCP to give reciprocal treatments to the U.S. and U.S. firms, and protect doing business in China with a true rule of law. This demand, if completely fulfilled, would effectively end the absolute rule of the CCP in China.

Aware of this outcome, the CCP strongly opposes the demands of the U.S. and is attempting to mobilize the Chinese people to do the same. The CCP’s message to the Chinese people is that the U.S. is waging the trade war because the U.S. is afraid of losing its No. 1 position in the world to a rising China. If the party agrees to the demands by the U.S., it says, you, the Chinese people, will suffer. In other words, the CCP must preserve China as a giant corporation and continue unfair trade with the U.S. and the rest of the world. Most Chinese people seem to agree. (What the ordinary people in China appear not to realize, however, is that, even if China is able to continue trade with the U.S., its comparative advantage in low-cost labor will disappear. The people’s share of the benefits from the unfair trade will decrease faster than the CCP’s share. This will eventually increase their dissatisfaction towards the party.)

For the U.S., demands that China change not only trigger Chinese wrath but also face resistance from U.S. corporations and investors, who have profited from their investment in China. If the U.S. retreats, the CCP and the Chinese people will continue to prosper at the expense of the United States.

But if the U.S. continues to trade with an unchanged China, it is certain to lose. China, Inc. has the advantages of being an absolute state and a huge corporation. When the U.S. government deals with the Chinese government, the latter can act like a corporation that is able to use all the resources in China as its own and order all individuals and firms to help achieve the state’s goals without any internal checks and balances. When a U.S. firm deals with a Chinese firm, the latter is actually a subunit of China, Inc. with access to the capabilities of the state and unlimited resources. This should make the U.S. think seriously about delinking.

The coronavirus pandemic has greatly reinforced such a sentiment by showing how vulnerable the U.S. is to an expansive totalitarian power. The unfair economic exchange with China not only incurs deficits and job losses for the U.S., but more importantly renders our borders ineffective in protecting us from the CCP’s mismanagement of its internal crises and makes our supply chains for vital products hostages of the regime.

If the U.S. and China do delink, what are the possible outcomes? For the U.S., products may become more expensive in the short run. But we have already seen price increases due to the trade war, and the impacts were easily absorbed. On the positive side, manufacturing jobs in the U.S. will increase since more firms will return. The U.S. will reduce its reliance on China for vital supplies and avoid clashing with the CCP on the daily basis. Furthermore, if the U.S. can lead democracies to form a new trade alliance based on the rule of law and reciprocity, the size of this group will be large enough to allow members to enjoy the benefits of globalization such as the realization of comparative advantage and economies of scale.

For China, the decline in foreign investment and trade will reduce jobs and technology transfer. Given the large size of the Chinese market, however, these can be absorbed in the long run. But closing China is not a viable option for the CCP. Due to the lack of the rule of law, the party officials and their friends need to send part of their (ill-gained) wealth and families abroad for protection.

If the democracies delink from China, the CCP officials will face a dilemma: they love the lawlessness in China so that they can loot; they fear the lawlessness because they can lose favor in a power struggle and lose everything. And if China is closed, the ruling party’s gain is at the absolute loss of the masses. This will exacerbate internal conflicts and may eventually lead to a new revolution.

To keep the country open, the CCP has an option to build an alliance with countries that economically depend upon and politically support China, thus achieving the CCP’s dream of building its world without criticism from the democracies. This group should be also large enough to enjoy the benefits of semi-globalization. Of course, if the Chinese Communist Party continues its current practices, it will eventually push its camp members to delink from China, forcing it back to a closed regime. To avoid this vicious cycle, China needs some fundamental changes.

Most importantly, the two-camp arrangement provides a more level playing field for both to compete. In this sense, both the U.S. and China should take this opportunity to show who can lead its camp to better protect human rights and deliver prosperity. And that’s a competition China may well lose.

Will China and Russia Become Official Allies? - The American Spectator,"As the war in Ukraine continues, a series of recent statements from high-level officials in Russia and China has set off the alarm that an increased partnership between the two may be in the works. This comes as intelligence reports obtained in early April from Ukraine accuse China of conducting a massive cyberattack on their military and nuclear facilities just days before the Russian invasion.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping issued a joint statement in February which discussed their goals for reshaping the international system. In addition, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on March 30, “China is willing to work with Russia to take China-Russian ties to a higher level in a new era under the guidance of the consensus reached by the heads of state,” and that “Both sides are more determined to develop bilateral ties, and are more confident in promoting cooperation in various fields.” The pair also condemned what they claim to be illegal and counterproductive Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.

While Beijing has not fully supported the invasion of Ukraine publicly, recent media reports in China have also repeated Russian talking points and propaganda on the war, including false claims about the presence of U.S. biological weapons in Ukraine. State-run media in China reported on April 2 that “the forces of NATO countries and other powers are becoming more active in Russia’s border areas, which forces Russia to remain vigilant.” This line comes directly from Russian news outlet TASS.

Over the past 70 years, the relationship between Russia and China has ranged from conflict to alliance. After gradually improving their relations since the mid-1980s, China and Russia became much closer beginning in 2014 during the Russian annexation of Crimea. Chinese government experts designate 2014 as “a year of abnormal acceleration of Sino-Russia relations” due to strategic anxiety over U.S. efforts to “rebalance Asia” and Russia’s fear over NATO’s potential expansion. The United States became the primary threat to both Russian and Chinese interests in 2014, which led to a strategic alignment in order to counter the perceived pressures.

Wang declared in a March joint statement that “China-Russia cooperation has no limits.” The statement stands as a promise to collaborate more against the West, which appears to be playing out.

Do these interactions hint that a more formal alliance between Russia and China could be forged in the near future?

“I do not believe that China will fully back the invasion of Ukraine unless the majority of states in the world were to suddenly reverse course and support the invasion,” Samuel Stanton, a professor of political science at Grove City College, told The American Spectator. “The Chinese relationship with Russia is firmly entrenched in both of those states opposing a western dominated world order led by the U.S. China does not, however, want to upset their ability to navigate the current world order in a manner that successfully allows them to grow economically and continue to develop greater influence politically.”

Stanton points out what many scholars believe: the relationship between Russia and China exists as a means to an end. Both countries have openly stated their motivation to create a world order without a Western overseer, and due to this desire for a common end, the two nations will continue to cooperate. Stanton also discussed the level of skepticism between Russia and China, noting that “the Chinese not being willing to openly support the invasion of Ukraine by the Russians points out the skepticism with which they view Russia. The only reason the Chinese are in league with Russia is as a means toward the end of redrawing the world order, not because the Chinese particularly like or believe in the qualities of Russia as an ally.”

David Tubbs, a professor of politics at King’s College, told The American Spectator, “The U.S. has not dealt with Russia well since the end of communism.”

Many scholars fear Western actions and poor handling of Russia following the fall of the Soviet Union are partly to blame for rising tensions internationally. Kadri Liik, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in December, “The severe deterioration in the country’s relationship with the West made it look at China in new ways – as an ally and an investor rather than just a regional competitor and a buyer of military equipment with an annoying tendency to copy Russian technology.”

Russia and China will likely stop short of an outright military alliance or treaty agreements. Experts believe they will remain trade partners and associates in collusion against the U.S.- and Western-dominated international world order. It is expected that the Sino-Russian relationship will continue to strengthen as long as the nations feel U.S. policies indicate aggression towards them. This should spark concern for U.S. and Western policymakers, as these collaborative efforts to disrupt the current system and alter it in favor of one more advantageous to the Russians or Chinese would result in a weakened liberal world order.",https://spectator.org/india-hedges-its-bets-with-the-u-s-russia-and-china/,2022-04-12
U.S.-China Trade: A War With No Winners - The American Spectator,"Reports indicate that China and the United States are close to ending their trade war, and it would appear this battle will result in no long-term winners.

Bloomberg reported that the tariffs imposed by President Trump could be lifted if China follows through with pledges to provide better protection of intellectual property rights and buys more American products.

But the global economy has already taken a big hit from the duties on a half-billion dollars worth of goods the two countries have implemented on each other. Bloomberg notes that it would behoove both Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to avoid further damage. Trump has touted the strong economy as a success of his first term, but his trade wars have put a damper on the celebration. Plus, he’s got a re-election bid next year to think about. Xi wants to avoid job losses that could undermine his Communist Party’s legitimacy, Bloomberg points out.

A recent report from economists puts the cost on the American economy at $19.2 billion and rising. That includes $12.3 billion in price increases due to the tariffs and $6.9 billion in lost income due to market disruptions caused by the trade wars.

The Trump administration has placed tariffs on $283 billion in imported goods — everything from washing machines to solar panels — since the start of 2018, and prices increased as the economists expected.

The report from Mary Amiti, assistant vice president of New York’s Federal Reserve Bank, and two Ivy League professors found that the cost of goods that faced tariffs tended to rise by between 10 and 30 percent. This also led to price increases for items that didn’t face tariffs, as competitors marked up their prices to increase profits while still staying below the prices of the imported goods.

The New York Times recently shared the plight of a Delaware lighting store that has held off on increasing prices as long as possible, but has begun mailing letters to customers informing them that costs will soon go up.

“As the trade war reaches into its second year, companies and consumers across the United States are growing weary. Small businesses like Brandywine Lighting have been forced to adapt to new economic realities brought about by Mr. Trump’s trade fight with China, Europe, Canada and Mexico and those companies are now beginning to chafe as the fight drags on, putting their profitability at risk,” the Times wrote.

The total value of imported goods facing the tariffs dropped by 25 to 30 percent as demand fell, and American consumers faced less choice as the variety of imported goods also decreased. The study found that tariffs have diverted $2.4 billion worth of American exports and $11.4 billion in imports a month.

“So far, the tariff revenue the US is collecting is not enough to cover the losses to consumers and companies, the study suggests,” Quartz reported. “And even if the trade war accomplished Trump’s goals of pressuring China to pay more royalties for US intellectual property and boosting manufacturing jobs, it would be expensive.”

The study found that if China boosted royalty payments by 25 percent, it would still take three years to make up for the trade disruption costs.

“These benchmarks suggest that the costs of the trade war are quite large relative to optimistic estimates of any gains that are likely to be achieved,” says the study.

Axios reported this week that the potential truce between the U.S. and China didn’t have a major effect on markets.

One major reason: financial analysts place the odds low that expanded market access, reduction of the trade deficit, and reform of intellectual property theft “are addressed with credible enforcement procedures,” Axios writes.

“Betting that Trump will not follow-through on the extreme rhetoric of his campaign pledges has worked out well for fund managers over the past two years,” the outlet added.",https://spectator.org/indias-china-problem-a-view-from-new-delhi/,2019-03-06
"With China’s Rise, Is a Eurocentric Worldview Limiting? - The American Spectator","Yale University history professor Valerie Hansen, in an important essay in Foreign Affairs, urges modern international relations scholars to abandon their predominantly Eurocentric historical analyses and provide a more balanced Euro-Asian approach to understanding the geopolitics of what many have called the Asian century. International relations, she writes, in a review essay of Ayse Zarakol’s Before the West, originated not in the Westphalian European settlement in 1648 but rather in the 13th century with the rise of Genghis Khan’s Mongol empire.

The Mongols under Genghis and his successors constructed the largest contiguous empire in world history centered in the regions that Halford Mackinder described as the “Heartland” and Asian “Coastlands” — which encompass the modern countries of China, Russia, India, the Koreas, Japan, Pakistan, the Central Asian republics, Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, and much of the Middle East. “Genghis Khan,” Hansen writes, “aspired to rule the entire world, and he conducted diplomatic relations with his neighbors on that basis.” Hansen believes that the Mongol empire and its successor empires — Ming, Mughal, Safavid, and Timurid — have served as models for Asian rulers, including the contemporary rulers of China and Russia. And those earlier Asian empires at times built fleets that journeyed as far as East Africa.

The Asian empires were all autocratic with “an extremely high degree of political centralization … subordinating all competing forms of authority” to the ruling elites. In his new book The Story of Russia, historian Orlando Figes explores the lasting impact of Mongol rule on all of Russia’s subsequent political systems. Hansen believes that the Mongol influence extended beyond Russia to China, India, Central Asia, and the Middle East and created a geopolitical outlook known as “Eurasianism.” Hansen credits Zarakol’s view that “the history underlying Eurasianism helps make sense of the events occurring in the territory once ruled by the Mongols.”

Hansen does not dismiss the relevance to international relations of the history of the Westphalian system but points out that Westphalian Europe is only part of the story — and today is the less important part. China, Russia, India, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Central Asian Republics — all trace their histories back to the Mongol empire and its successors. While the Westphalian system connotes the sovereignty and independence of individual nation-states, the Mongol system connotes autocratic empires that seek world domination. And the Mongol system, as Hansen points out, is literally in the DNA of the regimes that today rule China and Russia. (READ MORE by Francis Sempa: Communist China’s Plot for World Domination)

We know that Russian President Vladimir Putin — through the influence of Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin and others — approaches the world with a Eurasianist outlook. Putin has called the demise of the Soviet Union — which in its extent of territory rivaled the Mongol empire — a great catastrophe. And China’s Belt and Road Initiative envisions a China-led international system that would exceed in territory and political influence the empire created by Genghis Khan and his successors.

The greatest global geopolitical thinkers, such as Britain’s Mackinder, America’s Alfred Thayer Mahan, and Germany’s Karl Haushofer, viewed a Eurocentric worldview as too parochial and too limiting. Mackinder wrote compellingly about the empires of the Asian steppe. Mahan devoted an entire book to what he called “The Problem of Asia,” and Haushofer studied the geopolitics of the Asia-Pacific. Zarakol and Hansen are in some ways their intellectual disciples.

If today’s Western policymakers lack the time to read Zarakol’s book, they should at least read Hansen’s essay. To understand the Asian century, it is necessary to understand Asia’s geopolitical history.",https://spectator.org/is-china-really-out-of-bullets/,2022-09-15
World Court Decision Won’t Temper China’s Territorial Claims - The American Spectator,"As expected, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled against China’s expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea. The Philippines was exultant. Beijing responded angrily.

Territorial disputes pose a perennial international problem. Great powers, including the U.S., typically refuse to be bound by the decisions of others when they believe important interests to be at stake.

The existing order in the Asia-Pacific was established at a time when China was unable to effectively assert its claims or defend its territory. Understandably, Beijing is dissatisfied with the status quo.

Nor is Beijing the first rising power to challenge a system seemingly biased against it. The young American republic responded truculently in border disputes with both Great Britain and Mexico, even invading the latter and seizing half of that country.

In recent years the PRC has challenged territorial claims of Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Manila lacks an effective military and turned to the arbitration panel for support. The decision reaffirmed the position of the Philippines and nearby states, which will embolden them to take a tougher position against China.

Unsurprisingly, Beijing rejected the ruling and promised “to protect its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.” The PRC also won’t be inclined to step back.

The U.S. insists it takes no position in the ongoing disputes, but Washington has clashed with China over the former’s right to collect intelligence. If war erupted in the region, America’s alliance with Japan and ambiguous commitment to Manila could drag the United States into combat with nuclear-armed China.

All parties have an obligation to dampen tensions. They should start by recognizing that none of the disputed claims are worth war.

The resources in surrounding waters could be substantial but still would pale compared to the cost of conflict. In peacetime navigation would continue largely unimpeded. Wartime navigation would depend upon on the capabilities of the respective navies.

Calls on the U.S. to confront China are misguided. The PRC’s stake in securing its coast is vital and the waters beyond substantial.

America’s interests are more diffuse and distant. Dominating China’s borders might be theoretically desirable but isn’t necessary to protect American security. Navigational freedom is important but not directly threatened. Peaceful dispute resolution by others is welcome but not a matter for the U.S. military.

Of course, many in Washington believe that the sight of a few American ships would deter aggressive action by China. Alas, the PRC is not likely to respond by abandoning interests viewed as essential. Rather, it would do what the U.S. almost certainly would do if similarly provoked: increase military outlays.

Although the U.S. will remain wealthier and more powerful than China for years to come, the former cannot forever afford to maintain military forces strong enough to have a reasonable certainty of defeating the PRC in the latter’s home waters. Once the entitlement tsunami begins to overwhelm the federal budget, Americans will sacrifice Scarborough Reef and the Senkakus to protect Social Security. In contrast, Chinese citizens likely would spend and risk whatever is necessary to ensure the disputed territories remain Chinese.

As I point out in National Interest: “the best outcome for Washington would be for events to take their natural course, that is, the PRC’s neighbors rearm and coordinate to counter Beijing’s aggressiveness. The participation of both India and Japan would make a serious regional coalition possible.”

Only mutually agreed solutions, not disputed legal rulings, can settle the region’s territorial disputes. In fact, the PRC peacefully resolved 17 of 23 previous border disputes.

Overall the parties should to “seek common ground while reserving differences,” as Wu Shicun of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies put it. The U.S. and its friends should demonstrate that China’s interests would be respected by adapting to changed circumstances.

The tribunal decision may prove to be a Pyrrhic victory for America’s allies. Despite the court ruling, they still will have to negotiate to settle the issue.

World War III Is Almost Over and China Is Winning - The American Spectator,"“To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.”

— Sun Tzu

For the last few years China and the United States have been at war. A polite war, but a war for world leadership nonetheless. Until recently, the combat was economic. The U.S. imposed tariffs — an 18th-century technology — and the Chinese responded with COVID-19, a 21st-century technology that decimated our economy. They won.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, 40 percent of the U.S. economy will be destroyed — as well as over 200,000 deaths worldwide and 50,000 in the U.S. to date and counting. The latest is that meat-packing plants are closing to avoid spreading the virus, which may lead to food shortages.

There is no question that China did this to us and our economy. Some people still want to believe that it was an accident or an innocent mistake. That is naïve, but more important, irrelevant. The adverse effect on our people and our economy is no less real even if we can’t prove that the Chinese did it on purpose.

It cannot be denied that the Chinese government set loose the COVID-19 coronavirus on the rest of the world and that the U.S. and our NATO allies have been especially hard hit. It appears at present that there will be no adverse consequences for them — with the possible exception of paying $30 million more to support their friends at the World Health Organization to replace the contribution that the U.S. suspended. What a pitiful response!

China has shown the U.S. and the rest of the world who is boss by demonstrating what it can do with a virus. U.S. strategic doctrine calls for the U.S. to retaliate with nuclear weapons if we are subject to an attack by biological or chemical weapons of mass destruction. That strategy — if one can dignify it by using that term — is both impractical and antiquated; it is mired in cold war thinking from the nuclear standoff of the 1960s. Who could possibly imagine that a U.S. nuclear strike on the Chinese people in retaliation for a pandemic their government chose not to prevent is realistic — or desirable? No, the Chinese government has figured out how to attack in a way that gives plausible deniability, and consequently there will be no retaliation.

The lesson from World War II is that the major country that is least damaged by the carnage emerges as the new world leader. In 1945, that was the United States; today it is China. Whether they did this to the rest of the world on purpose or it just happened because they didn’t bother to prevent transmission to the rest of the world is largely irrelevant to assessing the consequences for the new world order. The “Chinese century” has begun.

True, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) have proposed a bill to set loose on China our equivalent of their virus: hordes of American trial lawyers bringing lawsuits in U.S. courts. That won’t pass — and if it did, China wouldn’t accept the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts or pay. What could show more clearly how unprepared we are intellectually to respond to an attack of this type than that the only thing we can think of to do about it is to sue the pandemic’s creators.

This is one of the few major attacks in history that was so brilliantly done — intentionally or not — that no one will counterattack. The only thing that comes to mind is the British breaking the German codes in World War II so that they could redirect the radio targeting beams and German bombers would drop their bombs in empty fields rather than over London.

You have to hand it to them: China out-thought us. They are taking credit worldwide for cures and humanitarian aid for a virus that they set loose on the world.

President Trump says he “is not happy” with China. Whoop-de-doo. They must be shaking in their boots. China is supposed to buy $250 billion of our products, and Trump is pleading with them to live up to their bargain, perhaps because he sees that as crucial to his prospects for reelection.

Imagine that the roles were reversed and we had killed 50,000 Chinese citizens with nuclear or conventional kinetic weapons instead of a naturally occurring virus. What would the response have been?

We are fighting a 21st-century enemy with 20th-century weapons. No wonder that they are winning.",https://spectator.org/is-the-u-s-china-relationship-worth-saving/,2020-04-28
Xi’s Trip to Saudi Arabia Shows Gulf Drifting to China - The American Spectator,"Chinese President Xi Jinping recently concluded a multi-day trip to Saudi Arabia, which included a Chinese state visit to Saudi Arabia, the first-ever China–Arab States Summit, and a China–Gulf Cooperation Council Summit. In the Kingdom, China and Saudi Arabia signed 34 deals, encompassing cloud services, information technology, construction, transportation, and green energy. China also signed an agreement to invest in Saudi Arabia’s gaming sector. While exact numbers were not available, earlier reports stated that the countries would sign agreements totaling $30 billion. Additionally, the two countries signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement and agreed to hold state visits every two years. Xi’s visit highlighted some serious wins for China in the Gulf, contrasted with the Biden administration’s erosion of influence in the region.

“Non-interference” Doctrine Benefits China and Arab Countries Alike

Key to growing China-Gulf ties is the mutual promise not to meddle in the internal affairs of the other. In fact, during Xi’s recent meeting, Xi promised that China and its Arab allies would “continue to hold high the banner of non-interference in [each other’s] internal affairs.”

This realist approach to diplomacy stands in stark contrast to the Biden administration’s fixation on Jamal Khashoggi’s death, civilian casualties from Saudi Arabia’s proxy war against Iran in Yemen, and Saudi Arabian human rights violations. This sanctimonious approach has yet to yield any tangible results that promote the interests of the United States.

In contrast, China can count on Saudi Arabia and many other Arab countries for support. For example, China has scored two big wins in the United Nations Human Rights Council: when Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, the Palestinian Authority, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen all supported China’s National Security Law in Hong Kong, and when Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and the U.A.E. supported Chinese persecution of the Uyghur Muslims.

Huawei Expanding in the Gulf

Xi’s recent trip to Saudi Arabia highlighted that Huawei has had a very good year in the Gulf. On Xi’s trip, Saudi Arabia signed a memorandum of understanding with Huawei Technologies “on cloud computing and building high-tech complexes in Saudi cities,” according to Reuters. This follows a deal in July in which Kuwait green-lighted Huawei cloud services. In March, the U.A.E.’s du signed a 5G contract with Huawei, and, in December 2021, Oman’s Omantel and its Ministry of Culture, Sports and Youth signed a memorandum of understanding with Huawei. Huawei’s Mate50 Pro phone will be available in Qatar soon.

In contrast, the United States has opposed Huawei’s expansion in the Gulf to no avail. The Federal Trade Commission recently banned importing Huawei and FTE communications equipment stateside.

China Increases Energy Cooperation With Gulf

The trip also demonstrates that Xi was able to score key wins in the Gulf on energy, another area where the Biden administration came up short. During Xi’s visit, oil producer Saudi Aramco signed an “initial agreement” with China’s Shandong Energy Group to provide China with oil and “chemical products.” The two companies also agreed to cooperate in “hydrogen, renewables and carbon capture and storage.” This followed a deal in November in which QatarEnergy agreed to supply China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) with four million tons of liquefied natural gas per year for 27 years.

In contrast, despite the Biden administration believing that it had clinched a deal to get the kingdom to increase oil production, Saudi Arabia declined to oblige, and instead cut production. In retaliation, the Biden administration threatened to review the strategic partnership and so far has not followed up on this threat.

China Is Providing for Saudi Arabia’s Military Needs

During his trip, Xi stated that China wants to partner with Saudi Arabia on nuclear energy and nuclear security. Only days later, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister stated that “all bets are off” in the event that Iran obtains a nuclear weapon. Additionally, a recent report in the Israeli press indicated that one of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s demands for Saudi normalization of ties with Israel is U.S. recognition of Saudi Arabia’s civilian nuclear program.

Additionally, Saudi Arabia’s Advanced Communications and Electronics Systems Co. and China Electronics Technology Group Corp. agreed in March to produce military drones in Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia is constructing ballistic missiles with China’s help, according to reports from December 2021.

Faced with the growing threat of its arch-enemy Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon, and incessant attacks from Iranian proxies in Yemen, it makes sense that Saudi Arabia would desire nuclear weapons, drones, and ballistic missiles. Whether through policies of banning “offensive weapons” to Saudi Arabia, its removal of the Houthis from the Foreign Terrorist Organization list, or its failure to definitively scrap negotiations with Iran, the Biden administration has failed to assure Saudi Arabia that it understands (and will assist in providing for) Saudi Arabia’s military needs. So China is filling the gap.

As Xi’s recent trip to Saudi Arabia shows, China continues to make inroads in the Gulf regarding telecommunications, energy, and even military cooperation. The Biden administration could best mitigate this advance by abandoning a nuclear deal with Iran, shoring up more support for Saudi Arabia’s defensive needs, and brokering Saudi Arabia’s normalization of ties with Israel. Treating our Gulf allies as such would be a step in the right direction to temper Chinese influence in the region.",https://spectator.org/israel-needs-to-end-its-romance-with-china/,2022-12-13
