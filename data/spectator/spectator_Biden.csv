"2,000 Mules or 81 Million Biden Votes? - The American Spectator","It all reminds me of July 1, 1987 when President Ronald Reagan nominated Judge Robert Bork for an opening on the Supreme Court. He had it made in the shade, said my complacent conservative friends. The result was brutal. But we do not have to look back 32 years to see how unruly the leftwing mob can be. Recall the recent fate of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Only his courage and unscotchable determinate saved him. The simple fact is that the conservatives are often slow on the draw against the American left. Only the Wall Street Journal and the intrepid New York Sun have come out swinging for Moore. It is time for the conservatives to rally around him. He can probably win with the President on his side. He apparently has the votes. Yet the coming battle would be a lot less bloody if the conservative movement were to take the field on Moore’s behalf — and make it clear that from now on they are going to wage war for the President’s nominees.

2022 Was a Horrendous Year for Biden - The American Spectator,"It’s hard to imagine that Joe Biden could have had a worse year than his inaugural one as president in 2021.

In case anyone needed a reminder of just how dreadful it was, that was a year under his “leadership” in which inflation rose to 7 percent — its highest level in 40 years. It was a year that saw unleaded gas prices increase by a whopping 50.8 percent from 2020, as the average price of gas skyrocketed to $3.30 a gallon.

It was a year that saw illegal immigration reach its highest point in U.S. history, with ​border apprehensions of lawbreaking migrants reaching close to two million in fiscal year 2021, compared to just 646,822 total encounters in fiscal year 2020.

It was a year that saw U.S. Customs and Border Protection seize 11,201 pounds of fentanyl — compared to just 4,791 pounds in 2020, an increase of 133 percent. The deadly synthetic opioid crisis is currently the No. 1 cause of death for U.S. adults ages 18–45.

2021 was also a year that saw 13 U.S. service members senselessly killed, billions of dollars worth of U.S. weapons and aircraft left behind, and Biden relinquishing control of both the U.S. embassy and Bagram Air Base to the Taliban.

It was a year that saw over 400,000 Americans die from COVID under Biden’s watch and a year in which Biden threatened to unconstitutionally take away jobs from millions of Americans if they refused to take an experimental vaccine that does not actually prevent anyone from catching COVID.

And it was a year in which Biden held the fewest number of solo or joint press conferences of any president since Bill Clinton’s lame-duck year in 2000.

But apparently “Mr. Unity”’s disastrous first year in office — one in which he fell not once, but three times up the stairs on Air Force One, was just a warm-up act for his greatest hits of 2022.

Leaving aside that the 2022 version of Biden seems unable to figure out how or where to walk off the stage after delivering his latest gaffe-ridden speech, or that it’s probably no longer safe for him to be riding a nonstationary bike, or that he literally needs one of his staffers dressed up as the Easter Bunny to shield him from a sycophantic press, the simple fact is that Biden has been such an embarrassment at home and abroad that it’s hard to know which self-inflicted catastrophe to even begin with.

As was expected, the Biden White House’s foreign policy has been nothing short of a chaotic disaster.

Thanks to Biden’s evident mental decline, apparent weakness on the world stage, and disgraceful withdrawal from Afghanistan, Russian strongman Vladimir Putin sensed no greater opportunity to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. And while Russia may be losing the war, Biden’s economic sanctions have done little to deter Putin’s feckless behavior.

It’s anyone’s guess how this ends, but 300 days later, the war still rages on — resulting in the deaths of 6,826 Ukrainian civilians, including 428 children, and an additional 10,769 Ukrainians were reported to have been injured.

As it stands, the U.S. has now provided Ukraine with more aid ($48 billion) than all European Union countries combined. It is not entirely clear how that money has been used. But Biden appears poised to send another $45 billion in emergency relief as part of the 4,155-page boondoggle of an omnibus bill that Congress has passed despite no one having read a single word of it.

Meanwhile, Biden has done nothing to hold China accountable for unleashing the China Virus on the world, even as Chinese President (or dictator) Xi Jinping continues to show aggression toward Taiwan, and as Xi has sought to build a stronger economic alliance with Russia — including increasing its imports of Russian oil, gas, and farm goods.

Instead of showing any curiosity into examining the origins of the virus, Biden has been careless with his rhetoric, incorrectly saying on three separate occasions that the U.S. would intervene militarily to defend Taiwan if China attacked the island — a direct contradiction of official U.S. policy toward Taiwan.

On the domestic front, things are not going much better for Biden.

There have now been over 2.3 million border encounters in the fiscal year 2022, including 227,000 border encounters in September. And this past July, Customs and Border Protection reported seizing 2,071 pounds of fentanyl — a record high and a 60 percent increase from the previous record that was already set in April of this year.

That’s enough fentanyl to kill every single American. But Biden doesn’t seem to care. His administration is content to let Title 42 run its course, which will likely further exacerbate problems and embolden violent criminals, human traffickers, and drug cartels to pour across our border.

In June, U.S. inflation reached a new 41-year high of 9.1 percent, but that didn’t stop Biden from piling onto the 31 trillion debt by signing the monstrous $739 billion so-called “Inflation Reduction Act,” which will do nothing to stop inflation or prevent climate change — unless, of course, one considers hiring 87,000 new IRS agents to harass Americans and cutting the temperature in the year 2100 by approximately 0.0009 degrees Fahrenheit to be significant progress.

And thanks to Biden’s war on the energy industry and the canceling of oil and gas leases, including killing a one-million-acre oil lease in Alaska, gas prices have continued to reach record highs this year, with the national average spiking as high as $4.58 in May. Rather than drilling our own oil in the U.S., Biden would rather deplete our Strategic Petroleum Reserve and beg the Saudis and thugs like Nicolás Maduro to pump more oil.

But remember, it’s all Putin’s fault, Biden assures us.

Surely, all of these self-inflicted disasters couldn’t possibly have anything to do with the man currently occupying the Oval Office, the geniuses in the leftist corporate media keep telling us.

So another dreadful year has come and gone for the teleprompter president who has somehow only done seven formal interviews this year and has managed to make Jimmy Carter’s presidency look like George Washington’s.

But here’s the good news: when the 118th Session of Congress commences early next year, Republicans will have a majority in the House. Let’s see if they actually do anything with the gavel.

David Keltz previously served as the Press Secretary for the Attorney General of Indiana and was a speechwriter in the Trump Administration.

2022 Was Uglier Than Hunter Biden’s Liver - The American Spectator,"If I’m to be entirely honest, 2022 wasn’t that bad really. But I can assure you that, given the choice, I wouldn’t pay the entrance fee again. The last year that was worth it passed years ago. Maybe 1984, when my biggest concern in the world was reading all of Donald Duck’s comic book collection. That was the life! I felt I had so much in common with that funny duck. I expect that these days the idiots at Disney have made that poor Duck black and transsexual, with no sense of humor at all. But even then he had an unbearable temper, a measure of good heart, some success with his lady ducks, and a lousy nose for business. But, above all, he hated to work. In hindsight, he may be the most influential character in my life.

The year 1992 wasn’t bad either. You know, when you’re 11 you still spend most of your energy kicking things in different sporting disciplines. Soccer was an obsession with me. In fact, I wanted to be a soccer player. And partly I’ve succeeded: I’m like Cristiano Ronaldo or José Mourinho, I make my living kicking a lot of balls.

If I could, though, I would go back to the early 2000s for a while. I was a singer in a band back then, and I suppose I was already working, but I have some gaps in my memory from those years. I remember feeling a bit like John Belushi in The Blues Brothers, throwing the car’s cigarette lighter out the window every time I lit a cigarette. And getting angry afterwards because no one could tell me where the hell the lighter was.

I’ve spent a good part of 2022 within the walls of a hospital, and I’ve learned a few things. That if it says “do not touch” you should not touch. That hospital food makes sick people healthy and healthy people sick. That to a doctor there is nothing that can happen in the human body that seems extraordinary or alarming, unless you have a beating heart tucked away in the right pocket of your pants. And that you should not mistake the kindness of the nurses for an invitation to go out dancing later that night. Or, yes, that where you least expect it, Joe Biden appears waving to nobody.

I have spent the rest of the year contemplating the political news with a certain disdain. There is such a concentration of morons among the world’s population in 2022 that, if they were all to be blown up at once, it would solve the global warming problem forever. What amazes me most, of the things I have discovered this year, is that there are idiots who will invariably go one step beyond their level of stupidity at every chance they get. It’s as if their stupidity is self-reproducing, so that each new idea, each new protest, or each new word turns out to be even stupider than the last. There are certain kinds of bugs that upon being split in two will self-regenerate — worms and things like that. Postmodern idiots are like those worms. Infinite.

Some things have started to change this year. Progressives have not done so well with the mass emotional manipulation campaigns that had served them so well in the past, like BLM and other nonsense. Now they try, but fail quickly. There is a growing number of people who, having survived a pandemic, are not willing to argue about imaginary problems any longer. I mean, with inflation skyrocketing, public opinion loses quite a bit of sensitivity to critical race theory, inclusive language, or the need to eat Bill Gates’ meat to save the planet; I obviously mean the meat he makes.

The most characteristic thing about 2022 is that everyone is out for fun, and there still lingers a certain fear that some loony leader might decide, for whatever reason, to lock us back in our tiny apartments. I don’t think they would be able to pull it off this time. They have lost their audience. Even if acid rain started falling on our cities tomorrow, and we were ordered to stay indoors, people would revolt, go out in the streets, drink the damn acid rain, film it with their cell phones, and upload it to the networks.

Be that as it may, I put a lot of hope in 2022, the year of the return to normality. Then my year turned out to be a real disaster from January onwards (although now it’s ending beautifully, thank God). Maybe that’s why, personally, I don’t expect anything good from 2023. But that’s just a professional strategy: as an author I need everything to go wrong in order to write better stories. Ultimately, I’d say that, except for the four evangelists, no author has ever achieved success by writing about good news.",https://spectator.org/2022-was-uglier-than-hunter-bidens-liver/,2022-12-28
"A House GOP Opportunity: A Resolution Calling on Biden, Democrats to Apologize for Dem Support for Slavery - The American Spectator","Well.

Democrats and the media have made much about former President Donald Trump unknowingly hosting a white supremacist and anti-Semite at a Mar-a-Lago dinner. The guy was brought along as an unannounced guest of Ye (as Kanye West now calls himself).

The former president issued this statement:

This past week, Kanye West called me to have dinner at Mar-a-Lago. Shortly thereafter, he unexpectedly showed up with three of his friends, whom I knew nothing about.

The Biden White House issued a statement on the incident that said this:

Bigotry, hate, and antisemitism have absolutely no place in America – including at Mar-a-Lago.

Agreed. Without a doubt, Trump, who had no idea who Ye’s unannounced guest was — as the guest himself admits — agrees as well. And, for the record, the notion that Donald Trump, who negotiated the Abraham Accords and has a Jewish daughter and son-in-law, is anti-Semitic is insultingly laughable.

Also, for the record, as the Nation noted, Biden proudly hung with white supremacists. The headline:

When Joe Biden Collaborated With Segregationists The candidate’s years as an anti-busing crusader cannot be forgotten—or readily forgiven.

If anyone should be looking himself in the mirror about his ties to white supremacists, it should be Joe Biden — not Donald Trump.

But if the Biden White House really believes what it said in that statement about there being no place in America for white supremacy, then surely it would agree that slavery was the personification of white supremacy, bigotry, and hate.

Which is why the House GOP and presumed Speaker-to-be Kevin McCarthy have a golden opportunity to right a 157-year-old decidedly bigoted, hateful, and racist wrong — by the Democratic Party.

What is that opportunity?

It’s time for a House resolution calling on President Joe Biden to officially apologize for his party’s once very seriously official and repeated support of slavery from 1840 to 1860.

In 2008, as Democrats prepared to nominate then-Sen. Barack Obama for president, I noted right here in this space (and it was also picked up and run in the Wall Street Journal) that the website of the Democratic National Committee had gone about the business of rewriting the history of the Democratic Party by simply whitewashing it. I began by noting this:

As Democrats prepare to nominate Senator Barack Obama to be the first black president, the Democratic National Committee and its chairman Howard Dean have whitewashed the party’s horrific and lengthy record of racism. The omission is in the section of the DNC website that describes the party’s history. The missing history raises the obvious question of whether the Democrats, unable or simply unwilling to put their party on record as taking direct responsibility for one of the worst racial crimes of the ages…

That would be slavery.

I went on:

The DNC website section labeled “Party History,” linked here, is in fact scrubbed clean of the not-so-little dirty secret that fueled Democrats’ political successes for over a century and a half and made American life a hell on earth for black Americans. Literally, the DNC official history, which begins with the creation of the party in 1800, gets to the creation of the DNC itself in 1848 and then…poof!…the next sentence says: “As the 19th Century came to a close, the American electorate changed more and more rapidly.”

A full 52 years of Democrat Party history had been erased. Why? Because of what the party supported officially and repeatedly in that time period: slavery. And beyond that — segregation. Both are the very embodiment of white supremacy.

I had the list of what Democrats refused to acknowledge in their air-brushed party history. It included these:

• There is no reference to the number of Democratic Party platforms supporting slavery. There were 6 from 1840-1860. • There is no reference to the number of Democratic Party platforms that either supported segregation outright or were silent on the subject. There were 20, from 1868-1948. • There is no reference to “Jim Crow” as in “Jim Crow laws,” nor is there reference to the role Democrats played in creating them. These were the post-Civil War laws passed enthusiastically by Democrats in that pesky 52-year part of the DNC’s missing years. These laws segregated public schools, public transportation, restaurants, rest rooms and public places in general (everything from water coolers to beaches). The reason Civil Rights heroine Rosa Parks became famous is that she sat in the front of a “whites only” bus, the “whites only” designation the direct result of Democrats…. • There is no reference to the fact Democrats opposed the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution. The Thirteenth banned slavery. The Fourteenth effectively overturned the infamous 1857 Supreme Court Dred Scott decision (made by Democrat pro-slavery Supreme Court justices) by guaranteeing due process and equal protection to former slaves. The Fifteenth gave black Americans the right to vote.

Full stop.

There’s more along these lines in the party’s actual history — opposition to civil rights laws passed in the 1860s and 1870s by Republicans, on-the-record support for the Ku Klux Klan, and using the Klan as, in the words of historians, the party’s “terrorist arm” and “military force.” Then there was the segregation of the federal government by Democrat “progressive” President Woodrow Wilson.

And so on goes this shameful, disgraceful list of support for white supremacy.

But the focus of a House resolution demanding a formal apology should stay on the original evil here — slavery. Evil it most assuredly was. Yet six different times from 1840 to 1860, the Democratic Party put itself officially on record in its quadrennial platforms as supporting slavery. Talk about white supremacy!

And here’s the kicker: To this moment, the Democratic Party has never gone on record with an official apology to black Americans for supporting the enslavement of their ancestors.

Never. Not once. Isn’t it about time?

If the Biden White House and Trump critics are genuinely concerned about an accidental dinner guest at Mar-a-Lago — to reemphasize, a guest the former president did not invite or even know was going to show up — then isn’t it more than past time for an official party apology from today’s titular leader of the Democratic Party? An apology for the repeated, decidedly official support for slavery by the Democratic Party that, in fact, had a serious impact on actual public policy? Something that has not been done in the 157 years since slavery was abolished — and abolished over the objections of Democrats in Congress?

Thus, the need for a simple Republican House resolution calling on the Democratic Party leader of today, President Biden, to apologize on behalf of his party. An apology for unarguably the most horrendous party-supported evil in American history.

That apology would be coming 157 years late, but better late than never. And it should pass unanimously, with Biden’s support — and that of every single House Democrat.

Are Catholics Deserting Biden? - The American Spectator,"In 2020, according to exit polls, Joe Biden won the Catholic vote by five percentage points over Donald Trump. But Biden “has lost significant ground with Catholics since his election,” reports Susan Crabtree of RealClearPolitics. Citing “findings in the latest survey of Catholic voter mood by RealClear Opinion Research in partnership with Catholic-themed television network EWTN,” Crabtree writes that now “just 47% of Catholics approve of Biden’s job performance, while 53% disapprove.”

Biden remains popular with Hispanic Catholics — “Biden’s approval rating among Latino Catholics stands at an impressive 59%,” writes Crabtree — but his support among white Catholics has sharply declined and stands at a mere 36 percent.

Given Biden’s starkly anti-Catholic agenda — from his aggressive promotion of all things LGBTQ to his adamant support for abortion — one might expect these numbers to be even worse. Biden has given Catholics faithful to Church teaching no reason to support him. That almost half of Catholics continue to view his performance favorably speaks to the liberalism within precincts of the Church.

Still, it appears that Biden’s hostility to religious freedom — his administration is assaulting it on multiple fronts, hatching plans to discriminate against Catholic hospitals, Catholic adoption agencies, and groups such as the Little Sisters of the Poor — is one of the factors that explains Catholic disaffection with him. According to Crabtree, “59%-30%, Catholic voters support the Trump-era ‘conscience rule’ that allows health care workers to opt out of procedures (such as abortion, sex-reassignment therapy, physician-assisted suicide) that conflict with their religious or moral beliefs.” Half of Catholics polled expressed a favorable view of Trump, suggesting that he could improve on his 2020 numbers should he run again. Crabtree also noted that 82 percent of Catholics “said a candidate’s support for religious freedom would make them more likely to vote for them” — another bad sign for Biden and the Democrats.

Biden has made support for transgenderism one of the signature issues of his administration. “Transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time,” he has said. But Catholics, among other religious groups, don’t appear to agree with him. “Regarding political clashes over gender identity, an overwhelming majority of Catholics (63%-25%) believe that gender was created by God rather than determined by individuals,” writes Crabtree. “On the divisive issue of allowing transgender people to participate in girls’ sports teams, 56% believe that allowing such competition conflicts with Catholic teaching.”

Biden claims that the collapse of Roe v. Wade will benefit the Democrats in the fall and that Republicans will face a “mini-revolution” for their supposed extremism. But as evident in his eroding support among Catholics, Biden is paying the political cost of adopting his party’s extremism on abortion, a problem that Roe’s fall has not lessened but exacerbated. Biden joined other Democrats in driving pro-lifers out of the party. Now it can’t field any pro-lifers in the states that are adopting restrictions on abortion.

Biden used to bemoan his party’s lack of moderation. Now he celebrates it and gives ludicrous lectures on America as a historically pro-abortion country, as he did earlier this month while announcing new executive orders in support of abortion. This is a far cry from the Joe Biden who once said: “I don’t like the Supreme Court decision on abortion. I think it went too far. I don’t think that a woman has a sole right to say what should happen to her body.” Throughout his senatorial career Biden also supported the Hyde Amendment, a prohibition on taxpayer funding for abortion.

By shedding any semblance of moderation on the issue and selling out completely to Planned Parenthood activists, Biden finds himself in a greater political bind than the Republicans. While Catholic support for abortion is much higher than some might expect given the Church’s official teaching on it (only 9 percent of Catholics oppose abortion in all cases), the polling indicates that most Catholics do not share Biden’s maximalist support for abortion. Crabtree writes that “a high percentage of Catholics, 65%-23%” know that abortion “conflicts with Catholic teaching,” and that by a 68 percent to 23 percent margin, these voters support “parental consent for minors before undergoing an abortion.” A strong majority of Catholics, she writes, “oppose unfettered access to abortion.”

So even with liberal divisions in the Church, Biden is losing his hold on the Catholic vote. His secularist wokeness, which pits him against Church teaching on a wide range of issues, is catching up with him. No doubt his mishandling of the economy and rising inflation have also hurt him with Catholic voters. He is lucky that Hispanic Catholics, unlike Hispanic Evangelicals, are sticking with him. If Hispanic Catholics were to leave him, his Catholic problem would grow catastrophic. (Philip Bump of the Washington Post argues that the GOP’s outreach to Hispanic Catholics will fail owing to the group’s increasing acceptance of abortion.)

In both North and South America, it is Hispanic Protestants, not Hispanic Catholics, who are pushing politics to the right. Even a faltering GOP can ride this wave to many victories as long as it doesn’t join the Democrats in their destructive wokeness. As evident in the Catholic polling, the more religiously devout the voter, the more he or she leans toward conservative candidates.

Even though he is technically the second Catholic president in American history, Biden is presiding over the most anti-Catholic administration ever. He has gone beyond Obama and his contraceptive mandate. Biden is pushing for Catholic hospitals to perform transgender surgeries and other procedures contrary to Catholic teaching. How could such a radical agenda not hurt his standing with Catholic voters? It would appear that all Republicans need to do to win the Catholic vote in 2022 and 2024, as well as the votes of other formerly Democratic blocs, is simply stand back as Biden plunges ever deeper into his party’s unpopular wokeness.",https://spectator.org/a-little-respect-for-joe-biden-the-artist/,2022-07-17
What Is the Biden Admin Hiding on Federal Voter Mobilization? - The American Spectator,"Americans have good reason to wonder if the Biden administration is abusing its power in order to protect Democrats in November.

That’s what our organization discovered this month in our lawsuit against the Department of Justice. On Sept. 8, the DOJ ignored a court order to give us documents it’s required to share under federal law, and on Sept. 22 the DOJ told us that the public has no right to know what it may or may not do. But that’s absolutely false and anti-democratic.

We asked for everything showing its implementation of the president’s 2021 executive order, “Promoting Access to Voting.” Through this measure, Biden is forcing the DOJ and every other federal agency to help people “register to vote” and “participate in” elections. There’s a name for that — voter mobilization — and it’s unjust for the federal government to meddle in this area. A president has every right to sway potential voters on the campaign trail. He has no right to influence them using the force of the federal government.

Our lawsuit came after the DOJ failed to respond to our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. We asked for all documents that show how the department is putting the executive order into action. After more than 200 days of waiting, we asked a federal court to force the DOJ to comply and turn over the information Americans deserve to know.

The court took our side, ordering the DOJ to start providing us with relevant documents by Sept. 8 so that we could discern the truth before the midterm elections. The department told the court that it has “approximately 5,500 records that are potentially responsive” to our request, yet it provided us with a mere 135 pages.

More concerning: The documents were heavily redacted, including no real details of the DOJ’s election-related actions. Its lack of transparency is incompatible with the court’s ruling.

The department tried to justify its intransigence by citing “the deliberative process and presidential communications privileges.” On Sept. 22, it doubled down on this claim. Yet it’s laughable when you consider the documents the DOJ blacked out or withheld in full. Crucially, the list includes the DOJ’s 15-page strategic plan for implementing the executive order, which remains completely in the dark. That document is not deliberative — it’s final. Nor does it reflect presidential communications. It appears administration officials simply don’t want us to see it. Why not?

The documents did contain one jaw-dropping revelation. They confirmed the existence of a 2021 White House meeting in which a slew of liberal groups provided feedback on the executive order’s implementation. One attendee from Demos called on the Biden administration to prioritize the agencies overseeing public housing and immigration. Demos previously authored a comprehensive plan to put federal agencies at the heart of voter registration — a plan that formed the basis of the president’s final executive order.

Clearly, the White House listens to this group, so its latest recommendations deserve attention and investigation. But once more, the DOJ withheld all the details. It refused to hand over a department employee’s notes from the White House meeting, arguing again on Sept. 22 that the public has no right to know about its “deliberations.” What doesn’t the Biden administration want Americans to see? (READ MORE from Stewart Whitson: Biden’s Unlawful Plan to Federalize Elections)

We only sued the Department of Justice. Yet every other federal agency — from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Defense — is also attempting to mobilize voters. We have submitted FOIA requests to other agencies, none of which have responded. Had we filed a lawsuit, it seems likely they’d be as opaque and sketchy as the DOJ.

The Department of Justice apparently has no intention of complying with the court order, much less respecting the American people’s right to know what its own government is doing with voting, the heart of democracy. In a forthcoming filing, we will ask the court to hold the DOJ accountable and compel release of the documents over the administration’s refusal.

A partisan president has taken the unprecedented step of ordering the federal government to push voters to participate in a heavily politicized election season. That reeks of a potential abuse of power — and the administration’s latest refusal to be transparent only makes the stench worse.

"No, No, No. Down With the Biden Ship You Go. - The American Spectator","Was it breakfast tacos that finally broke the media dam against Team Biden?

If so, there is a certain reason to that. Jill Biden’s catastrophically moronic reference to the Hispanic community as being “as unique as … breakfast tacos” during a speech the rest of which was just as cringe-inducing seems to be something of an at-long-last tipping point in which the Democrat operatives masquerading as honest brokers at the Washington Post, New York Times, MSNBC, and other organs have finally thrown up their hands.

Truth be told, there was a bit of bailing-out before Tuesday’s “LatinX IncluXion” extravaganza in San Antonio.

The Times had articles trashing Joe Biden in both its Sunday and Monday editions, for example. By Tuesday it was running columns claiming Biden is too old to run for a second term. It’s almost certain that the sudden anti-Biden sentiment in the newsroom boiled over as a result of the paper having received the results of a poll in which Biden’s approval rating sank to 33 percent.

The Times poll is, if anything, generous. Last week CIVIQS had Biden at 30. This week he’s at 29, joining only five presidents in modern American history — Harry Truman, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bushes 41 and 43 — to suffer approval ratings in the 20s.

But then came Taco X. The grumbling seems to be increasing in volume.

As it should. The “breakfast taco” fiasco shows something the Democrat establishment that foisted a degenerate, demented, crooked old perv onto first their voters and then the country at large would rather you not know as their operatives spin their narratives. Namely, that the problem is a whole lot larger than the fact, as Michelle Goldberg would have you believe, that Biden is too old to run again.

Joe Biden isn’t their problem. Joe Biden makes gaffes because he reads things aloud from teleprompters that he shouldn’t. Jill Biden makes them because she reads things aloud from teleprompters that she should. That “breakfast taco” debacle was written and vetted by a staff of supposed trained professionals in the White House, and she delivered the line as directed.

And that’s the problem. The utter failure of this administration, and the political party spooling out its idiocies to the American people, isn’t the product of Biden’s age, mental fitness, or meager political talent. He’s the least consequential president since Woodrow Wilson’s stroke made the latter an invalid hidden away in a bedroom for the final year of his time in office. And the deficiencies of the administration Biden sits atop arise from the handlers, the operatives, and the billionaire lunatics who have bankrolled policy and cultural failure at every level for 15 years.

They’d like to leave this at Biden and move on to someone else. Not that they have anyone else. They didn’t when they settled on Biden and then repurposed him as a neo-communist wannabe dictator flouting the Constitution and public preference at every turn. All of their friendlier avatars — Liz Warren, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, etc. — were horribly unsellable and still are, and the next batch hardly satisfies, either.

There’s a reason. None of these people are competent leaders. And they’re all pushing policies no successful society can withstand. As bad as Team Biden is, the worst things happening in America — the persecution of the New York bodega owner who defended himself against a thug ex-convict, the shooting galleries that are Chicago, New Orleans, St. Louis, and other currently unlivable cities, the burgeoning child mutilation industry Planned Parenthood is funding with your tax dollars — Joe Biden is only on the periphery of.

And those woke leftist operatives disguising themselves as mainstream media gatekeepers haven’t said a bloody word of substance about any of those things. If they’ve even touched those subjects, they’ve tried to pin them somehow on Republicans.

If Joe Biden’s approval ratings are in the tank, he’s a veritable Marcus Aurelius compared to the legacy media in the eyes of their countrymen:

Don’t sell Sleepy Joe and La Doctora Dama Jill short, though. Give them time. These are tough numbers to hit, but they’re just getting started.

The Democrat establishment, the operatives at the New York Times and Washington Post who propped this presidential fraud up despite the fact that Biden wasn’t capable of even running a real campaign much less winning a straight race conducted under the accepted rules state legislatures set forth in law, and the conspirators who “fortified” the 2020 election by hiding the Hunter Biden laptop story as “Russian disinformation” when we now know it was but the tip of the rancid, septic iceberg of the Biden family’s business and personal dealings cannot be allowed the privilege of manning the lifeboats and turning on Biden.

No. This won’t do at all. He’s yours.

We insist you drown on the U.S.S. Biden. There are no lifeboats. That’s what you get for selling out your integrity for partisan gain. You’ve destroyed the institutions you populate, and we’re all worse off.

Biden Can’t Shield Us from ‘Billionaire Tax’ Fallout - The American Spectator,"One of the most important lessons in tax policy is that the person who is handed the bill and sends the check to the taxman isn’t necessarily the person shouldering the entire cost — or even the bulk of the cost. A tax might first directly hit a few rich taxpayers, but it never remains confined there. Case in point: the logic and marketing of the novel “billionaire tax” introduced in the White House’s fiscal year 2023 budget proposal.

As described, it would impose a wealth tax on certain appreciated assets of households worth more than $100 million. This would break new ground in unfair taxation by requiring these households to pay at least 20 percent — composed of both traditional taxes on income and, going forward, unrealized gains in owned liquid assets.

Garrett Watson and Erica York of the Tax Foundation explain how this would work:

Consider a household with net wealth of $200 million, $5 million in ordinary income, $10 million in accumulated unrealized capital gains from a privately held company, and an ordinary tax liability of $1.8 million in 2023 … When including unrealized capital gains as income, the household’s effective tax rate is 12 percent, below the proposed 20 percent minimum. To increase their effective tax rate to 20 percent, the household must remit an additional $1.2 million in tax ($3 million in taxes paid with a $15 million income inclusive of unrealized gains).

OK, that’s stiff, but let’s focus on everyone else. The Biden administration reassures us that we — non-billionaires or millionaires — wouldn’t pay a dime of this tax as it would only be imposed on the top 0.01 percent of households, with half of the revenue coming from checks written by billionaires. I wish.

There are many problems with this tax. For instance, it is unclear that taxing wealth as opposed to income wouldn’t face constitutional problems, as Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia pointed out to the president. In addition, as we have learned from other wealth taxes, it will be administratively prohibitive. This is why most of the European countries that previously had wealth taxes eventually abandoned them.

In addition, it would likely raise very little revenue. This is precisely because capital is mobile and would soon fly to other, less-restrictive countries to escape the tax. Alternatively, the owners of the assets in question could be forced to sell — often to foreigners — also leaving less to tax.

More importantly for the purpose of this article, it would reduce U.S. saving and capital formation, which would have consequences for everyone else who isn’t a billionaire. The wealth of billionaires isn’t held the way most believe it to be — stored as if in gold or cash under their beds. A lot is invested back into their own companies, meaning wealth taxes ultimately hurt their employees.

In the same way, billionaires’ wealth is some of the capital that ends up being lent to smaller companies, new entrepreneurs, and other job creators. This is yet another way the wealth tax would hurt non-billionaires.

Finally, as my Mercatus Center colleague Thomas Hoenig recently noted in a Barron’s magazine piece about why a billionaire tax should worry the middle class, if such a proposal were implemented, it would very likely be expanded to apply to more and more Americans. He cites the example of the income tax, which Congress passed in 1913 and “topped out at 7% for income above $500,000.” $500,000 in 1913 would be over $14 million today. Now, the top tax rate is at 37 percent for income above $539,900.

The same is true of the 1969 alternative minimum tax (AMT). Then, the tax literally applied to only a few super-wealthy taxpayers who were accused of dodging taxes. However, over time, Hoenig explains:

With price and wage inflation, the number of households subject to the AMT increased from 200,000 in 1982 to 5.2 million in 2017, although their real income remained relatively unchanged. The tax was adjusted down in 2018, but only temporarily, and the middle class will again carry a heavier tax burden after 2025.

The bottom line is to be careful what you wish for, because this supposed billionaire tax may inadvertently tax you, too.

"Yes, Biden’s Filegate Is Impeachable - The American Spectator","The legacy media is once again, though sluggishly, coming to the defense of the crook who occupies the White House in the wake of a brand-new Joe Biden scandal. It seems that Biden was caught spiriting away classified documents covering national security issues and ensconcing them in a “think tank” he had set up at the University of Pennsylvania. Several of the items in question were marked Top Secret.

No bueno, José:

Among the items from Joe Biden’s time as vice president discovered in a private office last fall are 10 classified documents including US intelligence memos and briefing materials that covered topics including Ukraine, Iran and the United Kingdom, according to a source familiar with the matter. Attorney General Merrick Garland has received a preliminary report on the documents inquiry, a law enforcement source said, and now faces the critical decision on how to proceed, including whether to open a full-blown criminal investigation…. The documents were dated between 2013 and 2016, according to the source familiar. They were found in three or four boxes also containing unclassified papers that fall under the Presidential Records Act.

So … briefing materials on Ukraine, from the same time period in which his son was reeling in all that sweet Burisma coin as part of the greasy pay-for-play arrangement Biden had put his family into with respect to that country. Complete with his demands for firing the Ukrainian prosecutor investigating the methane smell coming out of that company.

And these were squirreled away in 2018, only to be found …

… just before the midterms.

Which we find out about two months later.

Hey, how similar is this to the unforgivable offenses Donald Trump committed against the Presidential Records Act, which necessitated the FBI snooping through Melania’s lingerie?

Not at all, says CNN after grudgingly reporting the story in the first place:

There are clear distinctions between the two classified documents cases involving President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump https://t.co/fCjS88bCr4 pic.twitter.com/xEhkJHtt9G — CNN (@CNN) January 10, 2023

It was immediately noted that not only was this “cooperation” between Biden and the authorities a little bit different in spirit than the “obstruction” Trump is guilty of — after all, the authorities in question are the most politicized, weaponized, partisan Department of Justice in American history, and they work for the Big Guy — but something else important was missed in CNN’s little disinfographic.

Namely, that Donald Trump was president and therefore had plenary power to declassify anything he wanted, and implicit in that power is that the simple act of taking documents home would constitute their declassification.

As compared to Joe Biden, who had no such power as vice president.

Every single argument you could make imparting culpability to Trump on the presidential documents he had at Mar-a-Lago blows up in Biden’s face.

Especially given that it was said Trump was keeping “nuclear secrets” in a storage closet at his residence. Biden’s keeping foreign policy secrets about Ukraine, a subject for which he’s at minimum ethically weak?

Nope. Can’t paper this one over, CNN. Or Adam Schiff, lately and rightly bounced off the House Intelligence Committee. Or any of the other Usual Suspect liars who commonly peddle falsehoods and equivocations into the national discussion. Dirty Joe is busted cold here, and there is nothing you can say that exonerates him.

It’s amazing how consistent this stuff is, isn’t it? Every time these people accuse Trump or some other Republican of some foul deed here or there, they turn up guilty of identical behavior or worse.

You can’t go to a movie theater and get projection as expertly perpetrated as today’s Democrat Party offers.

So what to do? Well, Texas Rep. Pat Fallon dropped impeachment papers against Biden’s lying SOB Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and those were well deserved. This column has suggested Biden’s whole cabinet should be hit with similar results. It doesn’t matter that the Democrats in the Senate won’t take up the impeachments. The House impeachment trials are just the right kinds of ordeals that can shake loose chaos in the administration to match what it’s done to the American people. Remember Trump’s first impeachment and what a distraction and a mess that was? Why wouldn’t we want to gum up Biden’s team in a similar way?

Besides, impeach a cabinet secretary who’s got one eye toward K Street in the first place, and you might just be able to take credit for a resignation. Skins on the wall are not nothing, you know. Imagine if you impeached Pete Buttigieg for what he’s done to air travel and the supply chain, and he then decided he “wants to spend more time with his family” rather than have to answer for all of his ineffective and ridiculous antics while the economic sectors for which he’s responsible have burned to the ground.

It might be enough to finish off his political career, which would be a real service to America. And there’s a bit of “social justice” in it, seeing as though Buttigieg was outspoken in favor of that first Trump impeachment.

And should that same fate befall a Jennifer Granholm or Lloyd Austin or Xavier Becerra or Antony Blinken or Miguel Cardonas or Merrick Garland … well, you know, it wouldn’t be such a terrible thing.

But what about the Big Guy?

Here we have a clear violation of the Presidential Records Act. That’s going to fall within the definition of High Crimes and Misdemeanors the Constitution prescribes as justifications for impeachment.

Breitbart’s Joel Pollak says this isn’t complicated, and it’s time to put Biden under the impeachment heat lamp:

First, it appears that Biden has committed a crime — certainly by the standard the Department of Justice applied to former President Trump in conducting the raid on his private residence at Mar-a-Lago. And while then-FBI director James Comey let Hillary Clinton off the hook, he did so by reading an “intent” requirement into the relevant statute that isn’t there. But Biden is not a private citizen at the moment, and he cannot be prosecuted while in office. Moreover, as Andrew McCarthy observed on Fox News Tuesday, there is a five-year statute of limitations that would likely expire this year (the center was founded in 2018). So the only way to hold Biden accountable is through Congress — and breaking the laws on classified information clearly fits the definition of “High Crimes and Misdemeanors” — the Constitution’s standard for impeachment. Second, ordinary congressional committees have limited subpoena powers, but impeachment investigations can dig deeper and wider. That became clear during the endless fights between the Democrat-run House of Representatives and the Trump White House, in which Trump’s lawyers argued that they did not have to comply with document requests that were not part of a valid impeachment investigation. The litigation ended in a settlement, but reinforced the idea that during an impeachment inquiry, the executive branch has fewer grounds to resist demands for documents and testimony than it does during an ordinary investigation. An impeachment inquiry could look not only at the mishandling of classified documents, but also at broader questions about what Biden and his family have been doing, both during and between his terms in office. Third, Republicans need to pursue the principle of reciprocity. Democrats must endure, measure for measure, every abuse of power and precedent that they imposed on Republicans. They impeached Trump in 2019 without any legitimate basis. Now that Republicans have a real reason to open an impeachment investigation of Biden, led by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) on the Judiciary Committee, they should not waste the opportunity.

Pollak isn’t wrong. And here’s the thing: the imbroglio over the classified documents at Penn is simply a straw breaking the camel’s back where Biden is concerned. He’s the most impeachable president in American history — based on the things in Hunter’s laptop; his role in the Trump–Russia hoax as part of the outgoing Obama administration, which weaponized the CIA and FBI against members of Trump’s campaign; his Afghanistan pullout; his (perhaps intentional) mismanagement of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and domestic energy supply; the abuse of the FBI against public school parents protesting at school boards; his administration’s open censorship of dissenters on social media, as Jeff Landry’s lawsuit is establishing beyond doubt; his mismanagement of the southern border, including his inaction as the nation drowns in Chinese fentanyl; and, yes, his abuse of the federal law enforcement apparatus to persecute a former president.

Joe Biden richly deserves to be impeached, Speaker McCarthy. So impeach him not just for these records found at Penn and hidden from the public so they wouldn’t affect the midterms. Which is now an established pattern of cover-up the Biden cabal can’t hide from.

Impeach him for all of it.

The thing about the impeachment — not just of Biden, but of his whole cabinet — is that by doing it you create conditions that are undesirable for those on whom you’re imposing them. Perhaps they’re willing to offer things as consideration for the lifting of the conditions they don’t like.

And perhaps those things they offer have value.

Right now, it’s a small majority of Republicans in the House. That isn’t much of a power base in Washington compared to the Democrat-controlled Senate and Biden White House. You need a lot more leverage.

But, as McCarthy just found out, those willing to engage in some hard-nosed, high-stakes negotiations can find themselves with the leverage to move mountains.

And impeachments create leverage because they create discomfort.

So create that discomfort for Biden and his cabal. And see what it shakes loose. You don’t even have to remove anybody from office for this to be worthwhile.",https://spectator.org/biden-abortion-lobby-mass-shootings/,2023-01-11
"Remember, the Bidens Are Trash - The American Spectator","Tuesday, Joe Biden took to a podium at the White House and did perhaps the one virtuous and potentially effective thing he’s done since his inauguration. Biden signaled, as part of the non-kinetic war he’s declared against Russia, that America will no longer buy the 650,000 barrels a day of oil we’re currently buying from them.

In case you might be confused, this column seeks not to credit Joe Biden.

Now, there are finally sanctions on Vladimir Putin which might — might — result in a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine. Putin has put forth conditions to the Ukrainians by which he would agree to stop his war. He says that if Ukraine would agree to a neutral geopolitical position between Russia and the West, cede Crimea and most of the Black Sea coast, and give up the Donbas region, assumedly for it to be swallowed by the Rodina, that the war might cease.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky might have to take that deal if he wants to avoid a Russian encirclement and slaughter of his military and principal cities. Zelensky keeps asking the West for things we aren’t going to give him — a no-fly zone over his country, fighter jets, and so on. Without them, the heroic defense of Ukraine is probably doomed in the long run. The only variable is how much bloodshed, and perhaps what military cost to Russia, stacks up before the end comes.

We aren’t going to bankroll a long-term Ukrainian insurgency. Not against a world power like Russia in Europe. Anyone who tells you we can turn Ukraine into Afghanistan or Vietnam is lying; those countries were insignificant shitholes on the edge of the Great Game. Ukraine matters, and it matters most to Vladimir Putin. So the more you think you’re going to run up a Russian body count by staffing and funding an insurgency which will ultimately, necessarily commit atrocities against occupying Russian soldiers or their proxies over the long haul, the more you’re deluding yourself.

But the in-crowd in Washington is pretty good at delusion.

A few headlines that have come out since the State of the Union speech a week ago:

You get the picture. Since the State of the Union last week, when the president managed to speak for an hour without keeling over or dropping a Ron Burgundy–style “F you, San Diego” gaffe (he made gaffes, to be sure, but they were blue-collar turds rather than the royal variety), there has been some hope that this man might find some footing sufficient to save his party.

While at the same time his party is busily provisioning electoral lifeboats in gubernatorial races across the country in preparation for the grim reality awaiting them.

Rather than analyze the prospects of Biden’s political rehabilitation amid the catastrophic polling data and horrendous on-the-ground realities a year of his handlers’ ministrations have produced, though, it might be useful to recognize just who it is we’re dealing with here.

Does Joe Biden deserve to be rehabilitated by his friends in the media?

The answer is absolutely not. And not just because of the fact Biden’s policies have imposed most of our current malaise.

That’s true to be sure, of course. Russia invaded Ukraine because Biden’s treasonous and moronic energy policies made the Putin regime rich beyond its wildest dreams while his Afghanistan policy indicated America’s foreign-policy resolve was nonexistent. When Biden failed to offer any real deterrent to a Russian invasion of Ukraine before the fact, Putin’s suspicions were confirmed. So we have highest-ever gasoline prices to go with inflation at a 40-year record, and moms across the country in a frenzy over their futures, we have markets in turmoil, working Americans terrified about the future of their jobs and livelihoods, and parents in deep distrust over what leftists want to do to their kids.

The reaction of Biden’s party to a common-sense bill in Florida which would ban trans advocacy to first graders makes that last bit much more than idle paranoia.

But forget about the man’s atrocious policies. Let’s just focus on one thing that shows what an awful human being Joe Biden is.

Let’s remember that Biden’s son Hunter, the crackhead and sex pest whom he has both called “the smartest guy I know” and profited in the millions as “the big guy” off various shady foreign business deals, impregnated a stripper from Arkansas by the name of Lunden Roberts a couple years ago.

The little girl who came from that sordid union’s name is Navy Joan. She’s four. Unlike the six other Biden grandkids, she gets no recognition from the family.

Here is Pres Biden’s granddaughter, named Navy. He and Jill refuse to acknowledge her existence. They put Christmas stockings up for their other grandchildren, but not her. Just truly awful behavior toward an innocent child. It tells you who Biden really is. pic.twitter.com/JUBYShdwHg — Kathleen McKinley (@KatMcKinley) December 4, 2021

Of course, Hunter Biden refused to acknowledge the girl. A DNA test proved he’s her father.

And the president of the United States, who won’t shut up about his son Beau and his death, going so far last week as to claim that a “burn pit” near where Beau Biden was briefly stationed in Iraq was responsible for the brain cancer that killed him, won’t embrace his own flesh and blood.

Of course Hunter Biden’s liaison with Lunden Roberts when she was working as an exotic dancer in a D.C. strip club was tawdry and embarrassing. But we’re past that now. Navy Joan Roberts is not responsible for the behavior of her father.

For Joe and Jill Biden to deny that little girl the love and recognition grandparents give to their grandchildren is unforgivable. To do it out of some sense of propriety or rectitude is laughable.

Democrats have promoted unwed childbirth for decades. Certainly Joe Biden has. When his own son acts in a manner hardly atypical of his party’s political clients, Biden rejects the product?

It’s disgusting.

Nothing Joe Biden says can be interpreted in a way that gives him the benefit of the doubt. He’s a terrible human being, exemplary of everything Americans despise about the political class. The whole Biden family are terrible people. The abject failure of his presidency, which reads like a modern American Macbeth, is by no means unforeseeable.

We’re all paying a price for the elevation of these people to status as our First Family. And as things get worse, it’s important to resist the attempts of Team Biden’s media allies to save him. They deserve every bit of condemnation and blame you can give them.

It you doubt this, just remember little Navy Joan and the snub from her grandparents, and think about what kind of people would do that.",https://spectator.org/biden-admin-hiding-federal-voter-mobilization/,2022-03-09
"Biden, Hurricanes, and the Depleting Strategic Petroleum Reserve - The American Spectator","As if Biden-induced inflation, soaring gas prices, the disasters at the southern border and with the Afghanistan withdrawal weren’t enough, try this.

To bring down gas prices, instead of drilling, the Biden administration has decided to ease the pain at the pump and not coincidentally his serious drop in the polls by releasing oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Hey, no problem! Right? What could possibly go wrong?

How about a hurricane?

This problem is beginning to get some attention.

Here’s the headline from Tampa Bay 10 television’s Josh Sidorowicz back in April:

Could large oil reserve drawdown have unintended consequences heading into hurricane season? Drawing down 180 million barrels will leave the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at its lowest level since the 1980s.

Over in Bloomberg in June was this from Bloomberg oil strategist Julian Lee:

US Hurricane Season Will Be Felt Around the World This Year On top of their huge human cost, storms can knock out oil production and refining, causing long-lasting disruptions.

The Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management in the U.S. Energy Department warns:

The impacts of these storms can have serious repercussions not only for the communities along the Coasts, but for residents throughout the United States—particularly when it comes to energy. These severe storms can cause downed power lines, resulting in widespread power outages and power grid instability. They can also prevent refiners located along the Gulf Coast from being able to distribute gasoline, diesel and other refined products throughout the eastern half of the country.

In other words, the Biden administration, for political purposes with an eye on the November election, is using the SPR to lower the price of gas. And just where is the SPR getting its crude in the first place? That would be the Gulf of Mexico — which is exactly where so many hurricanes wind up in the United States.

All of which means Biden is lowering U.S. reserves — and taking the chance that no hurricane will hit the gulf in this coming hurricane season that will halt the ability of the U.S. to refill the reserves it has used for the purely political purpose of lowering the price of gas at the pump.

Need it be said that any administration that mishandles anything connected to hurricanes pays a political price? The George H. W. Bush administration’s mishandling of 1992’s Hurricane Andrew without question contributed to Bush’s 1992 defeat by Bill Clinton. The George W. Bush perceived mishandling of 2005’s Hurricane Katrina also helped Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign.

House Republicans have taken note of Biden’s use of the SPR, which certainly will have implications if, as expected, they take back control of the House in November.

The Washington Times reports they are zeroing in on the issue of general mismanagement of the SPR. Reports the Times:

House GOP calls for probe into Biden’s ‘mismanagement’ of oil reserves after overseas sales “House Republicans want to haul in Department of Energy officials to examine the Biden administration’s handling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and recent overseas sales of domestic stocks despite near-record U.S. gasoline prices. The sought-after hearing, which the majority of Democrats are not likely to approve, highlights the sort of investigations that Republicans plan to open into the administration’s energy policies if the party retakes control of the chamber after the midterm elections. In a letter sent Tuesday to House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone Jr., New Jersey Democrat, and first shared with The Washington Times, GOP Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan and Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma cited national security as the crux of of why an oversight hearing is needed. “Selling off our strategic stockpile is not a solution to high gasoline prices, and when it is exported to our foreign adversaries, it further harms our economy and national security,” the Republicans wrote.

To sum it all up: Added to the ever-growing list of Biden bungles and disasters is its use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

And if, as is quite possible, a Category 5 hurricane rolls into the Gulf of Mexico and decimates the ability of an already depleted SPR to “refill the tank”?

There will be political heck to pay for Joe Biden.",https://spectator.org/biden-administration-woke-national-security-strategy/,2022-07-22
It Must Be Said: Biden Is Dangerously Impaired - The American Spectator,"Much has been written about President Biden’s surreal State of the Union address, but the commentariat has studiously ignored the real problem with the speech. The trouble with this unnerving oration isn’t that much of it was fiction or that it revealed a vision of the nation that isn’t shared by most Americans. Its scariest feature is that it was filled with semi-coherent gibberish delivered by a man who is cognitively impaired and obviously unfit to carry out the duties of his office. If Biden were your father, you would relieve him of his car keys, yet he possesses the authority to launch a thermonuclear strike and hit virtually any target on the planet.

If you doubt that Biden is mentally unfit for his office, you are out of step with a majority of Americans. According to a new ABC News/Washington Post survey, a mere 40 percent of adults believe the president possesses the “mental sharpness it takes to serve effectively as president.” A recent POLITICO/Morning Consult poll revealed that less than half of registered voters believe he is “mentally fit.” Only 37 percent of Independents said he was up to the job. Moreover, Biden refuses to take a cognitive test. Last month, 38 GOP lawmakers sent him a letter requesting that he take the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA):

The American people should have absolute confidence in their President. They deserve to know that he or she can perform the duties of Head of State and Commander-in-Chief. They deserve full transparency on the mental capabilities of their highest elected leader. To achieve this, we urge you to submit to a cognitive test immediately. We implore you to then publish the test results, so the American people know the full mental and intellectual health of their President, and to follow the example set before you.

Not least among the signatories to last month’s letter was Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas). Before his successful run for Congress, Dr. Jackson served in the White House as Physician to the President during the Obama and Trump administrations. Indeed, it was Jackson who administered the MOCA test to then-President Trump at the demand of numerous Democrats and members of the “news” media. Surprising no one but his political opponents, Trump passed the test without difficulty. This is the second such request that the GOP has sent to Biden. Nor are they mere partisan stunts. Some Democrats are also worried.

Last year, Reps. Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.) and Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) wrote to Biden expressing considerable discomfort with the fact that he has the sole power to order a nuclear strike. They went on to point out that the president would be wise to discuss a nuclear attack with advisers but that he isn’t required by law to do so. They offer a number of suggestions which they believe would “reduce risks inherent in the present system.” They would, for example, require additional civilian officials to concur with any nuclear launch order. As the following excerpt from their letter suggests, President Biden obviously makes them nervous:

You alone possess the authority to order the use of nuclear weapons, which assures that nuclear weapons remain under civilian control. However, vesting one person with this authority entails real risks.… While any president would presumably consult with advisors before ordering a nuclear attack, there is no requirement to do so. The military is obligated to carry out the order if they assess it is legal under the laws of war. Under the current posture of U.S. nuclear forces, that attack would happen in minutes.

So, in addition to a growing percentage of voters who believe Biden’s cognitive acuity is not equal to the requirements of his office, there is bipartisan concern in Congress that this is probably dangerous. If you go back and objectively analyze Biden’s performance during last Tuesday’s SOTU, it will be difficult to avoid the same conclusion. Don’t bother to read the bowdlerized version posted on the White House website. His staff has clearly revised the text in a way that renders his weird digressions and ad lib maundering far more coherent than they were during the live speech. It must be seen and heard on video to be believed.

Biden ends with ""Go get him"" ??? pic.twitter.com/gFFDynJCF4 — Greg Price (@greg_price11) March 2, 2022

Perhaps the scariest thing Biden said involved his closing exhortation. The revised White House version renders it thus: “Go get ’em.” That is still incoherent in the context, and it’s inaccurate. Listen carefully to his closing. He clearly said, “Go get him.” Why is this scary? It’s probably an example of echolalia, the involuntary repetition of a phrase heard by someone suffering from dementia. This will be familiar to many Americans caring for aging parents in the midst of cognitive decline. Biden probably overheard a Secret Service supervisor alerting his detail that the speech was ending — and he reflexively repeated the words. (READ MORE: When Biden Said Putin Will Never Win Over the Iranian People, I Ran)

Whether or not that theory is true, it’s impossible for an objective auditor to come away from Biden’s first SOTU still believing he is mentally sound. He is a clear and present danger to the country and indeed the world. It’s probable, for example, that Putin decided to execute a full-scale invasion of Ukraine after closely observing Biden’s obvious limitations. It’s terrifying to contemplate the consequences of leaving him in office for three more years. The damage can be reduced if the GOP takes control of Congress after the midterms, but Biden and his executive branch bureaucrats can still do a lot of harm.

Biden’s Phony Words Follow Inflation’s Phony Money - The American Spectator,"Joe Biden named inflation “my top domestic priority” on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced an annual consumer price index of 8.3 percent for April.

The president’s top domestic priority also ranks first in terms of his domestic failures. None of the president’s five immediate predecessors saw numbers as awful as Joe Biden does on what he points to as his No. 1 domestic issue.

Biden blamed not U.S. policies but “a once-in-a-century pandemic” and “Mr. Putin’s war in Ukraine” for rising consumer costs.

“And those two major contributors to inflation are both global in nature,” the president assured. “That’s why we’re seeing historic inflation in countries all over the world.”

But most countries see no such thing.

Vietnam experiences a 2.6 percent rate of inflation, Switzerland 2.5 percent, the United Arab Emirates 2.5 percent, Cameroon 2.4 percent, and Ecuador 2.9 percent.

How did these nations inoculate themselves from the twin maladies of coronavirus and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine? They didn’t. They dealt with them just as we did (only differently). Those countries did not trash their currencies just as we did. President Biden obfuscates — with political cunning or economic ignorance, one does not know — the alpha-and-omega role the money supply plays in devaluing currency.

Negative examples abroad also illustrate this reality. Argentina, which suffers through a 58 percent rate of inflation, devalued the peso to a far greater degree than the Federal Reserve devalued the dollar. Variation in inflation rates exist globally because variation exists in the monetary policies of central bankers.

The Federal Reserve’s current balance sheet amounts to 2.5 times its September 2019 size. Put another way, in a very short period the U.S. central bank created an enormous amount of money to fund the operations of the federal government. M1, the measurement of cash and assets easily convertible to cash, quintupled since February 2020. Look at the graph measuring M1. It takes a Jordanesque vertical leap, albeit in a Space Jam rather than a 1987 dunking-competition sense. The graph looks preposterous, unreal even. The trendline for the Fed’s balance sheet similarly leaps tall buildings in a single bound. Unleash pennies from heaven and the checkout line soon resembles hell.

Just as the diversity of national inflation rates discredits Biden’s argument, so does the conformity of inflation in economic sectors domestically. All 21 of the 21 categories that the Consumer Price Index examines show price rises. Nothing went down. Everything went up. When a flood of money, rather than a damming up of goods, explodes prices, one observes it across the board because money accounts for half of the value exchanged in just about all transactions.

The president may view the excuse-making as a way to avoid responsibility. It really conveys hopelessness. If forces in Russia and China beyond our control unleashed this explosion in prices, then American policymakers remain helpless to alleviate the problem.

Boogeymen such as “the Putin price hike” and “the Ultra-MAGA Agenda” did not cause inflation. They merely act as the president’s convenient scapegoats. A flood of money disproportionate to goods and productivity altered the value of the money in our pockets. This started before the Russians invaded Ukraine and even before the first case of coronavirus from China killed an American. It started with the massive creation of money, at the behest of reckless politicians of both parties looking to spend without taxing or borrowing or cutting, in September 2019.

Biden pointing that all this started more than a year before he assumed office might have acted as a way out, at least partially, for him. But to admit its true cause necessarily limits his ability to pursue the reckless spending on the fiscal side that made a nightmare of the monetary side. One cannot concede that loose money causes inflation without dooming legislation the likes of the Build Back Better Act.

Along with co-author Hunt Lawrence, this writer warned about traveling down this very dangerous path in August 2019. When the Fed started altering course, particularly in its intervention in the repo market in September 2019, we again warned of the dangers of quantitative easing in an expanding economy with low unemployment. Gimmicks in a strong economy lead to a lack of them in a weak economy. A cause (loose money) resulted in a predictable effect (higher prices). That the effect (higher prices) in Joe Biden’s narrative preceded the cause (the Putin price hike) should invalidate his argument for rational observers. And only in an indirect sense did his second cause (coronavirus), in so much as it pushed policymakers to boost the economy with funds it did not possess, result in inflation.

The bad news for any officeholder attempting to obfuscate the reality of inflation either through excuse-making or data manipulation? It does not work. Even a skilled politician cannot convince a housewife that the $13.99 she now pays for a pound of roast beef does not make things worse for her than the bad old days a year ago when she paid $9.99 for the same meat. We feel inflation. We feel it belatedly in price hikes but we feel it painfully. The words on a teleprompter or the numbers on a monthly bureaucratic report do not mitigate that pain.

The rhetorical finessing and data legerdemain we will increasingly see on inflation between now and November stems from the same root as inflation. Dishonest words always follow dishonest money.",https://spectator.org/biden-and-the-left-reject-dr-martin-luther-king-jr/,2022-05-13
Biden Is at His Worst When Sucking Up to the Arrogant and Authoritarian - The American Spectator,"The Africa summit is mercifully over. Traffic around the Convention Center in Washington, D.C., is back to normal. More importantly, U.S. officials can stop pretending Africa is a vital security battleground requiring copious false praise, ritualistic self-criticism, and enormous taxpayer transfers.

Fear of the People’s Republic of China has become the excuse for any and all bad policies in Washington. Whatever the expenditure or regulation, claim that it helps the battle against Xi Jinping and China’s communist hordes, and it will receive congressional authorization, presidential action, and popular acclaim.

Such was the case with the semiconductor chip bill, advanced to address a serious concern but turned into a special-interest payoff for production that the U.S. dominates despite enormous wasted Chinese subsidies. Similar is President Joe Biden’s proposal to meet the PRC’s faltering Belt and Road Initiative by reviving the bad old years of Western funding of dubious governments for equally dubious projects across the developing world. A better strategy would be to encourage the world’s deadbeat nations to load up on Belt and Road Initiative projects, sticking Beijing with even more bad loans.

Beijing does pose a significant challenge to the U.S., and to the West more broadly. However, its weaknesses are manifest. Indeed, the more dictatorial Xi becomes, the greater the challenges China is likely to face. Washington is operating from a position of strength, and its response should be measured. Becoming more like the PRC in response to the PRC would make bad policy even worse.

Yet the Biden administration continues its craven approach to other nations, acting as if they, rather than America, are superpowers requiring constant flattery and subsidy. An example is Washington’s pusillanimous treatment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Crown Prince Mohammed “Slice ’n’ Dice” bin Salman. Unsurprisingly, MbS, as the killer prince is known, responded to Biden with disdain and contempt. Washington should treat the Saudi royals like any other Third World dictators, rather than like exalted beings from another galaxy.

Of course, Xi’s recent visit to Riyadh led to all sorts of wailing and gnashing of teeth from MbS’s factotums in Washington. However, the trip was Kabuki theater. China is a rising economic power, so it inevitably will do business with Saudi Arabia. After all, South Korea currently trades more with the PRC than it does with the U.S. and Japan combined. However, Seoul continues to look to the U.S., not Beijing, for security. Similarly, MbS and his pampered princely class still looks West for security. Xi certainly isn’t going to turn his nation’s soldiers into the equivalent of royal bodyguards. (Too bad. It would be nice to offload that responsibility onto some other sucker!) Washington, not Riyadh, has most of the leverage.

Africa’s situation is similar. The continent, with a growing population and economy, will become more significant geopolitically over time. However, its security significance to America will long remain limited. If Africa does pose a threat to America, the problem is weakness rather than strength, allowing terrorism to fester.

For instance, many of Africa’s 54 countries face significant internal challenges. South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria, Libya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zimbabwe are among the states unable to manage their own affairs well. Nor is continental unity likely to become a reality, soon or, perhaps, ever. The continent is divided between North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa; Muslim and Christian/animist; francophone, commonwealth, and other; chaotic and semi-developed. The continent is a threat mostly to itself.

The U.S. and the Soviet Union competed for the allegiance of African despots throughout the Cold War; Washington won but gained few spoils for the enormous energy and money expended. Yet last week, the Biden administration went into full suck-up mode, hosting 49 African delegations. And the president laid it on thick. First came the inevitable apology for slavery: “We remember the stolen men and women and children who were brought to our shores in chains, subjected to unimaginable cruelty. My nation’s original sin was that period.”

It was an odious practice, but, of course, we and they already knew that. Indeed, that is why the practice was abolished 150 years ago after America’s most costly conflict. Moreover, Africans were enslaved only with the complicity of Africans. That is, Biden’s audience was filled with the descendants of aggressors, kidnappers, and traders who trafficked in slavery. Engaged in the transatlantic practice were people living in present-day Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, and Zambia. Algeria, Egypt, and Morocco hosted the Muslim/Middle Eastern slave trade.

If the president was serious about righting historical wrongs, then he would have proposed that his guests apologize first to one another, depending on their respective nations’ tribal makeup and geographic location, and next to African Americans for having made the Atlantic slave trade possible. And then these governments would have pledged to provide reparations to the descendants of slaves, including those in America.

Of course, Biden had no such objective. He intended to blandish and bribe his guests, not enlighten them. As he declared: “[T]he United States is all in on Africa and all in with Africa. African voices, African leadership, African innovation all are critical to addressing the most pressing global challenges and to realizing the vision we all share: a world that is free, a world that is open, prosperous, and secure.”

Alas, this is utter nonsense, and he knew it. All the governments he was dealing with undoubtedly want to be secure and prosperous. However, free and open? Think again!

Although democracy has made progress in Africa, few countries are well-developed, stable, and free societies. The group Freedom House rates only eight African nations as “free”: Botswana, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Mauritius, Namibia, São Tomé and Príncipe, Seychelles, and South Africa. The rest are split evenly between “partly free” and “not free.” Although the situation is better than it was in the past, it remains awful.

So much for the administration’s democracy agenda. Little better are the prospects for raising the poorest Africans out of poverty. Economic liberty is essential for prosperity. Only two African nations, Mauritius and Cabo Verde, rank among the top 30 most economically free nations. Another three make the next 30: Botswana, Gambia, and Uganda. In contrast, 18 African states, a full third, fall within the bottom 30.

Nevertheless, Biden played Santa Claus with Americans’ money. He promised the assembled delegations $55 billion as “a comprehensive commitment from the United States to invest in Africa’s people, Africa’s infrastructure, Africa’s agriculture, Africa’s health system, Africa’s security, and more.” Next, he said, he was “asking the Congress for the authority to lend $21 billion to the International Monetary Fund to provide access to necessary financing for low- and middle-income countries — which is so difficult to come by now — and to — will help Africa’s recovery efforts and support projects that build resilience against future crises.” (Those are b’s, as in billion.) On top would be more money for governance and security.

Finally, the president said he wanted to visit. Vice President Kamala Harris would visit. So would his wife, Jill (shouldn’t that be Dr. Biden, even to him?). Finally: “Secretary Blinken is on his way. Secretary of Defense Austin. Secretary of the Treasury Yellen. Secretary of Commerce Raimondo. The USAID Administrator, Power. And our Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield. Promise you’ll send them back. Promise you’ll send them back. I need them. They all want to go, but I’m worried they won’t come home.”

Actually, if the president wouldn’t mind, could we keep our money and let the Africans have this gaggle of Biden attendants and lackeys instead?

Particularly unseemly has been the administration’s slavish attention to Equatorial Guinea, thought to be the possible site of a Chinese military base. Reports Foreign Policy, “Since Washington first caught wind of China’s ambitions to build a naval base in the Atlantic last year, current and former officials said, a series of top U.S. diplomats, intelligence officers, and White House officials have visited Equatorial Guinea to meet with [President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo] and his top aides.”

The prospect of the PRC basing some ships in West Africa poses no crisis. In fact, it’s probably best for America that China divide its fleet and siphon fighting power away from the Asia-Pacific. Moreover, a Chinese presence would allow Europe to demonstrate its new supposed commitment to constraining Beijing. In order to most help America, the European members of NATO should take over responsibility for confronting Russia rather than send token forces to the Pacific. Patrolling West African waters would be a natural outgrowth of securing the continent.

Freedom House rates Equatorial Guinea as 5 out of 100, in bottom-feeding North Korea/Eritrea territory and worse than China, Iran, and Russia. Details Freedom House: “The current president, who took power in a military coup that deposed his uncle, has led a highly repressive authoritarian regime since 1979. Oil wealth and political power are concentrated in the hands of the president’s family. The government frequently detains the few opposition politicians in the country, cracks down on civil society groups, and censors journalists. The judiciary is under presidential control, and security forces engage in torture and other violence with impunity.”

Alas, trying to buy the allegiance of Obiang creates a potentially unlimited bidding war with Beijing. The people of Equatorial Guinea would be the primary victims, followed by American taxpayers. Washington played this game throughout the Cold War with ugly consequences all around. Obiang would likely prove to be a poor investment. There is no reason to believe that he would stay bought. Moreover, the spectacle of the U.S. spending wildly to thwart what today looks like merely a possibility would encourage other African governments to announce that they were “considering” offering base rights to China and then to head to Washington to negotiate for booty to reverse their “decision.”

Americans should be engaged in Africa. However, they can’t afford yet another open-ended financial commitment by Washington for benefits more imaginary than real. If Beijing wants to risk its fiscal future subsidizing even more authoritarian developing countries, Washington should stay out of the way.

Biden Is the Stuff of Nightmares - The American Spectator,"I woke up screaming. The stock market is way down and it’s been going down sharply lately. It’s going down because people anticipate more inflation, mostly from rising oil prices, and this will move us towards recession — possibly. Meanwhile, we are begging governments that hate us, like Iran and Venezuela, to sell us their oil, even if it means allowing Iran to have nuclear weapons.

Now, why do we have an oil shortage? Because Mr. Biden, upon taking office, immediately shut down major domestic sources of oil, especially certain pipelines and squeezing oil out of rock, namely “fracking.”

This was the single stupidest domestic policy maneuver in U.S. history, besides allowing the banks to fail in the Great Depression. If we had continued fracking, we would have been the world’s largest oil producer and exporter. But because a group of dopey fake environmentalists pressured a dopey fake president, Joe Biden, to stop fracking — for NO GOOD REASON — we now have to beg our worst enemies for oil. Our consumers are gouged at the pump, and we may well be sliding into a recession.

There never was a real reason for banning fracking and now we are paying a terrible price.

Please, Mr. Biden, please voters, let’s restore some good sense to America, open the pipeline, open fracking, and let us breathe.",https://spectator.org/biden-approval-rating-30-and-dropping/,2022-05-18
"Biden, Liz Cheney, Kinzinger Push the Politics of Racial Supremacy - The American Spectator","Well, of course.

In the wake of the Buffalo murders President Joe Biden went to Buffalo and said this:

In America evil will not win. I promise you. Hate will not prevail, and white supremacy will not have the last word.

Then there is Wyoming “Republican” Rep. Liz Cheney tweeting this:

The House GOP leadership has enabled white nationalism, white supremacy, and anti-semitism. History has taught us that what begins with words ends in far worse. @GOP leaders must renounce and reject these views and those who hold them. — Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) May 16, 2022

And how exactly has the House GOP leadership “enabled white nationalism, white supremacy, and antisemitism”?

Like clockwork, her fellow January 6 Committee “Republican” Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger provides this answer:

Did you know: @EliseStefanik pushes white replacement theory? The #3 in the house GOP. @Liz_Cheney got removed for demanding truth. @GOPLeader should be asked about this. Stefanik Blasted for 'Despicable' Facebook Ads Pushing 'Replacement Theory' https://t.co/RcuzJ37BiE — Adam Kinzinger (@AdamKinzinger) May 14, 2022

First of all, for Rep. Elise Stefanik to oppose illegal immigration is decidedly not about “replacement theory.” It’s about demanding that all immigrants stand in line, wait their turn, and cross the border legally. This country is filled with the descendants of immigrants. Of all colors. Rep. Stefanik supports the obvious and ancient American policy of legal immigration. To look at those illegally crossing and judge them by skin color, as Cheney and Kinzinger did, is nothing but an obsession with racial supremacy — in which everyone is to be judged by skin color.

One doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry that Reps. Cheney and Kinzinger — “Republican” members of Congress — are so astoundingly ignorant that the American Left, and specifically Joe Biden’s Democratic Party, has repeatedly, from the very beginning of its existence as a political force in American politics, built its movement and political party around a culture of racial supremacy, a culture in which anyone and everyone is to be judged by race.

The Democrats have moved from supporting slavery to supporting segregation, creating Jim Crow and now the son of segregation and Jim Crow called “identity politics.” The party used the Ku Klux Klan as, per University of North Carolina historian Allen Trelease, “the terrorist arm of the Democratic Party.” They opposed the abolition of slavery in the 13th Amendment, due process and equal protection for the freed slaves with the 14th Amendment, and opposed the 15th Amendment, which gave blacks the right to vote.

On and on and on to this very moment Democrats and the Left have played the race card, all of which comes out of their obsession with race. The latest round of obsession with “white supremacy” is in reality yet another example of their obsession with “racial supremacy” — which, again, is judging anyone and everyone by race.

What astounds is that two Republicans from the Party of Lincoln would sign on to this racial supremacy garbage.

Over at the Daily Caller is a collection of reminders of just how avidly modern-day left-wing media and Democrats support replacement theory.

And here is Time magazine in 1990 headlining this:

Beyond The Melting Pot In the 21st century — and that’s not far off — racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. will outnumber whites for the first time. The “browning of America” will alter everything in society

The magazine’s cover featured a re-imagined drawing of an American flag, with the stripes no longer red and white but red, black, brown, and yellow. The headline on the cover:

America’s Changing Colors What will the U.S. be like when whites are no longer in the majority?

Then there was this from the far-left Center for American Progress:

Immigration Is Changing the Political Landscape in Key States Supporting real immigration reform that contains a pathway to citizenship for our nation’s 11 million undocumented immigrants is the only way to maintain electoral strength in the future.

Here is the left-wing Salon on the subject:

A permanent Democratic majority? Hispanic voters played a pivotal role in this election. If current trends continue, they may turn other parts of the country as blue as they just turned New Mexico.

Then there was the New York Times in 2020:

The Relentless Shrinking of Trump’s Base A steady decline in white voters without college degrees, 1976-2018

And the New York Times two years earlier, in 2018, with this headline about white Americans:

We Can Replace Them

That piece was about the Georgia governor’s election between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp. Abrams is black, Kemp white. The piece closes with the Times columnist saying this:

In a week, American voters can do to white nationalists what they fear most. Show them they’re being replaced.

Here is the Los Angeles Times:

Beyond the Melting Pot: In America, blending in was once the ideal. But since society has grown more diverse, some say we must learn to respect our differences.

The idea behind all of this and oh so much more is simple: Designate Race X as a danger and then whip up a racist frenzy centered on replacement theory.

Replacement theory and the fear attached to it began, of course, with the birth of the Democratic Party and the writing of their first six — say again, six! — political platforms, which all adamantly supported slavery. The very idea that black people would be allowed to be treated as equals to whites — to mingle, to do business with, to vote, to (gasp!) marry — was repulsive to the rulers of the Democratic Party. Blacks were seen as a direct threat to the idea of racial supremacy that the Democratic Party and the larger American Left held so dear. Which is to say, they used the fear of whites being replaced by blacks as the core of their politics.

So, of course, they went out of their way to suppress them — first by enslaving them, then by segregating them. The purpose was highly political: to strike the fear of God in Americans that people of another race were coming to get them.

On and on this use of replacement politics has gone with the Left and the Democrats. As noted in this space repeatedly, from slavery to segregation to today’s son of segregation known as identity politics, replacement theory is an invention of the American Left.

Over at Breitbart, Ann Coulter lists by name the liberals who have cheered on replacement theory. And the New York Post correctly adds this:

And the larger claim that US demographic change boosts Democrats has been standard among Democrats for years. Left-liberal analysts John Judis and Ruy Teixeira made the case in their influential 2002 book “The Emerging Democratic Majority.” Civil rights attorney Steve Phillips argued similarly in his 2016 best-seller “Brown Is the New White.” Sen. Dick Durbin felt comfortable saying just last summer, “The demographics of America are not on the side of the Republican Party.” Heck, Joe Biden in 2015 stated that, starting in 2017, “fewer than 50% of the people in America … will be white European stock” and adding, “that’s a source of our strength.”

So when Tucker Carlson or others in conservative media talk of opposing this, all they are doing is observing the cold, hard fact that Democrats’ use of replacement theory is decidedly not new. They most assuredly, as Tucker has noted, oppose a color-blind America, where one is judged by the content of their character and not the color of their skin. It is the complete opposite of the famous line from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

And Tucker Carlson, as with conservatives and Republicans in general, believes in a color-blind American meritocracy — and is on record as saying so.

Want more examples of the hardcore racist use of replacement theory by Democrats from ancient times? There are plenty. More than plenty. Here are but two.

Here is Democratic Sen. Thomas Hendricks from Indiana on the passage in the day — by Republicans — of the 15th Amendment, which guaranteed the recently freed slaves the right to vote. Hendricks, by the way, would later go on to be elected vice president of the United States under Democrat President Grover Cleveland. Said this prominent Democrat of his day:

I do not believe that the Negro race and the white race can mingle in the exercise of political power and bring good results to society…. I do not believe that the two races can mingle successfully in the management of government. I believe that it will bring strife and trouble to the country…. While the tendency of the white race is upward, the tendency of the colored race is downward; and I have always supposed it is because in that race the physical predominates over the moral and intellectual qualities…. I am speaking of a race whose history for two thousand years has shown that it cannot elevate itself. I am speaking of a race which in its own country is now enshrouded by the darkness of heathenism that covers any land on earth. While the white man for two thousand years past has been going upward and onward, the Negro race wherever found dependent upon himself has been going downward or standing still.

Democrat senator and future Vice President Hendricks was trying to scare Americans that allowing blacks to vote would mean they would be free to mingle with — replace — the dominant white society.

In 1902, South Carolina’s Democrat Sen. Ben Tillman said that if Southerners had ever realized that blacks would be given political rights they would never have surrendered in the Civil War. Said the Democrat senator:

If it had ever entered into the minds of the Southern soldiers that it was not only to restore the Union and destroy slavery but then put the ex-slaves in charge of the state governments and make them control our affairs, I tell you here there would have been guerrilla warfare inaugurated … throughout the South that would have made it impossible that you should have won in the long run.

Tillman added a plea to the North to send blacks back to Africa.

Let us colonize them. Let us do anything you please that will get them away and out from among us. They threaten our civilization!

So in this context, it’s particularly amusing to see a New York Times story by reporters Nicholas Confessore and Karen Yourish with this headline the other day:

A Fringe Conspiracy Theory, Fostered Online, Is Refashioned by the G.O.P. Replacement theory, espoused by the suspect in the Buffalo massacre, has been embraced by some right-wing politicians and commentators.

Fringe theory? OK. Hardly. This has been the bedrock politics of the American Left and Democrats from the 19th century to this minute.

Here is the New York Times itself using replacement theory to scare Americans of the day by playing the race card in this 1900 editorial:

The Republican Party committed a great public crime when it gave the right of suffrage to the blacks…. So long as the Fifteenth Amendment stands, the menace of the rule of blacks will impend, and the safeguards against it must be maintained.

Got that? The New York Times is warning Americans against “the menace of the rule of blacks.” This is replacement theory in action. And you wonder why Tucker Carlson and conservatives oppose it?

Which brings us back to Joe Biden.

For Biden, the deliberate use of the politics of racial supremacy is gospel. When Biden spontaneously exclaims to a black DJ that “if you’re for Trump you’re not black” or says in a planned speech to a black organization that voting for Mitt Romney would “put y’all back in chains” — that is racial supremacy at work.

This last week there was Joe Biden talking about white supremacy in Buffalo, where a racial supremacist — who is white — has mass murdered blacks. But where was Joe Biden in Waukesha, Wisconsin, after a racial supremacist — who is black — mowed down whites at a Christmas parade? Where was Joe Biden in New York City when racial supremacist Frank James — who is black — shot up a subway car filled with whites? And where was Joe Biden when racial supremacist Jeremy Smith — who is black — shot up an Asian-owned hair salon in Dallas?

Answer: Nowhere. Why? Because Biden was busy playing the politics of racial supremacy.

And where are Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger in condemning this garbage from Biden? Answer: Nowhere. Instead they play the racial supremacy game themselves with Republican colleague Stefanik because she opposes illegal immigration … which has zero to do with race. Unless, of course, one is a racial supremacist.

The repeated obsession with racial supremacy in which everything and everyone is to be judged by race — as Biden, Cheney, and Kinzinger all displayed this week — is a disgrace.

And, more to the point, it’s wrong.

Biden’s Ministry of Truth - The American Spectator,"The headline at Fox was blunt:

Mayorkas testifies DHS is creating ‘Disinformation Governance Board’ The news comes two days after Tesla CEO Elon Musk secured a $44 billion deal to buy Twitter

The story began:

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas testified Wednesday that the Department of Homeland Security is creating a “Disinformation Governance Board” to combat misinformation ahead of the 2022 midterms.

Say what? The Biden administration is now setting up a decidedly Orwellian “Ministry of Truth” to “combat misinformation”?

Yes.

Aside from suggesting that the first place to begin combatting misinformation would be with the Biden administration itself (for example, the claims that Joe had no knowledge of Hunter’s business ventures, inflation is transitory and caused by Putin, the border swarm is “seasonal,” the Afghanistan exit was a “success,” etc.), it is time to call out this government-run attack on free speech exactly for what it is: out-and-out fascism.

And I don’t throw that term around casually.

Over here at a site called libertarianism.org is this decidedly relevant headline from history:

Mussolini attempted to remake the Italian mind, taking a personal interest in applying the twin tools of censorship and propaganda.

Here’s what it details about Italy’s fascist-in-chief and his dealings with the Italian media, which in his day consisted of newspapers and radio:

The unique totalitarian project of Italian Fascism reposed on a careful balance that required both popular confidence and a level of fear. The ambitions of this project reached not only into government, law, and economics, but also into the minds of Italy’s people, which the Fascists believed they could reshape and recommit to the nation‐state…. No such idea of adversarial journalism, of subjecting the actions of state to investigation and scrutiny, was to infect the minds of the nation’s newspaper writers and editors. Rather Mussolini contended that “Fascism requires militant journalism,” the country’s newspapers presenting themselves “as a solid bloc,” committed to “the Cause” and obscuring or outrightly burying any fact or story antithetical to it. Even more than post-factum censorship, Mussolini favored this kind of proactive steering of the press, hardly subtle and clearly defining his expectations as both military and civilian leader of the people. In Fascist Italy, social and political pressures—and the resultant self‐ policing by the media—were at least as important as actual legal proscriptions, probably much more important…. Just as Mussolini’s example had inspired Hitler and the young National Socialist movement, the Nazis’ Reich Ministry for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda, established in 1933, seems to have motivated Mussolini to adopt a newly invigorated approach to censorship…. In a sense, then, the Fascists were successful in creating, to borrow Orwell’s phrase, a new “climate of thought.”

Plainly put, what the Biden administration is about with the creation of the DHS “Disinformation Governance Board” is nothing less than the American version of what in 1933 so inspired Mussolini and his fascists — the Nazi “Reich Ministry for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda.”

So how will this jewel of Orwellian thought control deal with, say, Fox News? Or Newsmax? Or One America News? Or talk radio? Or, dare I say, right here with The American Spectator?

One can only begin to imagine the sight of well-paid government bureaucrats putting out command after command because Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, or Laura Ingraham has had an hour of prime time to talk the latest government-declared “disinformation.”

I cannot wait to see the fireworks when one of these Orwellian robots attempts to “correct” Mark Levin on either his radio or television show because they charge him with spreading “disinformation.” To borrow from Clint Eastwood: Go ahead — make my day.

And I definitely want a great seat to see the results when they accuse The American Spectator of spreading “disinformation.”

Exactly as that history of Mussolini illustrates, what Mayorkas is about is what Mussolini was about: “applying the twin tools of censorship and propaganda.”

This is exactly at the heart of the uproar, furies, and tears from lefty Twitter employees who are enraged at Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter. The New York Post headlined this:

Twitter workers freaking out over Elon Musk in internal Slack messages

And indeed they were. Various Twitterites were saying things like this:

“Physically cringy watching Elon talk about free speech.” “We’re all going through the five stages of grief in cycles and everyone’s nerves are frazzled.” “A M*sk-owned Twitter is one of the greatest threats to the 2022 and 2024 elections. We are f*cked if this happens.”

There was more like this — oh so much more. But right there is the self-reveal of what happened to Twitter. It moved from being the national “town hall” to being the lefty censor of all things — and people — conservative. It hated free speech. As does the Biden administration.

Blocking that October 2020 New York Post blockbuster investigation of Hunter Biden, banning President Trump, suspending Tucker Carlson, the Babylon Bee, and oh so many more conservatives known and unknown? All of this was par for the course at Twitter.

Now, with a Musk-owned Twitter, the government has decided, à la Mussolini, to take on the task of censoring conservatives and free speech themselves. The bureaucrats who spied on the 2016 Trump campaign and went out of their way to disrupt his administration from the inside are now going to be in charge of deciding what is “disinformation.”

Make no mistake, what this “Disinformation Governance Board” is about is exactly what Mussolini was about. Using Orwell’s phrase, the United States government is now formally about creating a new “climate of thought” with “the twin tools of censorship and propaganda.”

To say the least, this seriously dangerous board should be dismantled — post-haste.

Biden Misses the Mark on Texas Shooting - The American Spectator,"After President Joe Biden returned to the White House from an overseas trip Tuesday night, he addressed the horrible mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, Tuesday that left 19 elementary school students and two teachers dead.

“I am sick and tired of it,” Biden said from the Roosevelt Room. “We have to act. And don’t tell me we can’t have an impact on this carnage.”

Biden noted that other countries have mental health problems and domestic disputes, “but these kinds of mass shootings never happen with the kind of frequency that they happen in America. Why?”

One answer: the Second Amendment.

Biden didn’t have much in particular to say about the killer who robbed these precious children of a future. It’s as if the shooter, whose name will not appear in this column, was beside the point.

The president simply referred to him as “an 18-year-old kid.”

Biden saved his ire for those “who obstruct or delay or block the commonsense gun laws.” Forget the shooter. People who oppose Biden on guns are the bad guys.

We later learned from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott that the shooter posted text messages on Facebook that he was going to shoot his grandmother Tuesday morning.

Then, as CNN reported, he texted that he had shot his grandmother in the head. Next he announced, “Ima go shoot up a elementary school.”

Social media platforms have changed how American teens relate to — and dehumanize — others.

Biden’s solution is to confront the enemy, “the gun lobby.”

Biden speaks as though he doesn’t know that the toothpaste is out of the tube. When shootings like this occur and the Left calls for more gun regulations, Americans run out and buy more guns and ammo.

“Democrats love to hammer the strawman ‘gun lobby’ because they don’t want to openly attack tens of millions of gun owners,” observed the Federalist’s David Harsanyi.

After a shooter killed five Stockton elementary school students in 1989, California passed an “assault weapons” ban.

I supported the California law and the 1994 federal law. But then it turned out the 1994 federal assault-weapons ban, which expired in 2004, didn’t really reduce gun violence.

A 2004 Department of Justice report found that if the 10-year law were to be renewed, “the ban’s effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement.”

A 2020 RAND review of gun studies, according to FactCheck.org, found “inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings.”

The New York Times reported that the British government banned handguns after a gunman killed 15 students and a teacher in 1996, Australia banned semiautomatic weapons after a massacre in Port Arthur left 35 dead, and New Zealand passed strict gun laws after a gunman killed 51 Muslims in Christchurch two years ago.

That’s not going to happen here.

According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, 5.4 million Americans bought firearms for the first time last year. Clearly these new gun buyers aren’t feeling safer. Maybe Joe Biden should chew on that.

Biden Must Go All In Against China’s Tech Industry - The American Spectator,"This week, the Biden administration launched its newest offensive against China’s semiconductor market by blacklisting at least 30 Chinese companies, including top memory-chip manufacturer Yangtze Memory Technologies. The move came following the expiration of the 60-day window for the entities to comply with U.S. end-use verification checks.

However, there is no cause to celebrate yet. On the same day that the new sanctions were announced, Reuters broke the alarming news that the U.S. would be removing several Chinese entities from the export blacklist as a sign of cooperation between the two countries. Sanctioning some companies while leaving out others underscores a serious problem with the current administration’s track record with the PRC: the lack of effective enforcement of its competitive policies. As the PRC’s aggressive posture escalates, this administration must recognize China’s threat to both the international order and American hegemony and thus reorient its strategy to challenge Beijing’s militancy.

The Biden Administration Is Holding Back Its Enforcement Action

Since taking office, President Joe Biden has struggled between competing and engaging with Beijing. This is not to say that Biden is simply appeasing Beijing’s malign activities. Alongside the CHIPS Act, the White House has sanctioned numerous Chinese companies and officials, passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, called for stronger relations with its Indo-Pacific allies, and kept some of the Trump-era tariffs and export controls.

However, the administration is hindering the damage it could do to the PRC by not thoroughly enforcing its sanctions on Beijing. For example, Reuters found that over 300 export licenses worth $103 billion were given to suppliers of two blacklisted Chinese tech giants, Huawei and the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Beijing’s main chip manufacturer, despite the Biden administration’s recent attempts to clamp down on Chinese tech.

Even more troubling is the fact that the Bureau of Industry and Security, which is responsible for enforcing export controls on sanctioned entities, denied less than 1 percent of licenses for the two companies from 2020 to 2021, according to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

The Biden Administration Continues to Trust China Despite Having Every Reason to Not

Furthermore, Biden’s recent semiconductor sanctions, while laudable, are undermined by his misplaced trust in Beijing. While about 30 Chinese companies were added to the Entity List, at least 26 other corporations and individuals were absolved from further inspection by the Bureau of Industry and Security. According to Reuters, a U.S. official said that the decision was made “thanks to greater willingness from the Chinese government to permit U.S. site visits,” meaning that exporters “will no longer have to conduct additional due diligence before sending goods to the Chinese entities.”

Removing Chinese companies from export controls is unfortunately not a new phenomenon for this administration. Chip manufacturer Nanchang O-Film Tech and tech giant Xiaomi were removed from the Entity List under Biden’s watch despite their ties to the Chinese military and to human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Even the Bureau of Industry and Security’s October restrictions announcement stated that nine entities would be removed from any export-controls list.

As former Bureau of Industry and Security analyst Nazak Nikakhtar warned before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, China is “notorious for falsifying records and diverting exports of controlled items to unauthorized end users within the PRC,” meaning that American tech could be sent off to the People’s Liberation Army and the Bureau of Industry and Security would have no idea. Yet, the current chief of the Bureau of Industry and Security, Alan Estevez, commended the PRC for being “forthcoming” and having a “change of attitude” regarding end-use checks, while Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo encouraged further exports to Beijing to promote greater “connectivity with the Chinese people.”

Biden’s Approach to China Is Marked by Internal Contradictions

The rhetoric and actions of the administration do not signal a commitment to blunting Beijing’s technical dominance. Instead, they reveal internal contradictions that continue to plague Biden’s China policy. When peeling back the headlines, Biden’s competitive streak and tech campaign is a mixed bag. The policies are good but lack effective enforcement to do any long-term damage. Raimondo and Estevez should not be lulled into a false sense of security by Beijing’s promises. As Forbes international tech writer Roslyn Layton put it, “The Chinese government is a world-class force for cheating and promise-breaking.” But why does the administration continue with these half measures instead of going all in against Beijing? The self-sabotaging could be because the president believes that the U.S. can engage with China on “transnational challenges” like climate change and the pandemic.

Perhaps the framing of the U.S.–China dynamic accounts for Biden’s off-balance approach. In last October’s National Security Strategy, the Biden team designated China as the strongest challenger to the international system instead of couching the PRC as a direct threat to America. This framework ignores Beijing’s true nature as a ruthless, genocidal, imperialist regime that the U.S. should be challenging. This administration instead rewards its adversary through export-controls removal, undermining its entire strategy. Biden needs to keep the pressure on Beijing and attack China’s hold on the global tech market with everything he has. There can be no half measures taken when protecting America’s national security interests.

Biden Nixes EPA Action on Climate - The American Spectator,"One of the ways that I try to raise the consciousness of my fellow humans is by telling them things that they don’t know and then asking them why they don’t already know those things. This admittedly obnoxious behavior is intended to get people to reflect on the fact that they don’t trust big companies in most other aspects of their lives, so why should they trust Big Corporate Media to keep them informed fairly about politics? (I implore my fellow conservatives to stop using the term “the mainstream media,” which concedes the high ground to companies that are out to control our thoughts by not covering any information that contradicts their left-wing narrative.)

The latest example of my “why don’t you already know this” trope is this: “Did you know that President Joe Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency just denied a petition from eminent scientists to use the EPA’s existing statutory authority against climate change?”

I haven’t met a “progressive” yet who had a clue that this happened. Guess that just wasn’t part of “all the news that’s fit to print” for the New York Times, CNN, or MSNBC. (Yes, I put the term “progressive” in quotation marks for a reason: It is a loaded term intended to convince your subconscious that progress inevitably means more government control.)

It seems that “Biden & Co.” only care about climate change when it serves as an excuse for getting Congress to give them $370 billion to hand out to their supporters in the name of setting a good example for China and India, who are building polluting plants like crazy. (Yes, I put the term “Biden & Co.” in quotations marks to remind the reader that the Biden family business is influence peddling.)

Biden apparently doesn’t care a whit about climate except when it gives him an excuse to shovel billions of dollars to his supporters. On Sept. 14, the EPA formally denied a petition by former NASA scientist Jim Hansen, one of the first U.S. government officials to raise alarms about climate change, and by several others to use the EPA’s existing authority under section 6 of the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to gradually reduce fossil fuel use in applications where there are ready substitutes. In essence, the EPA’s denial says, “We don’t debate that climate change is a real problem, and we agree that we have the existing authority to deal with it under the TSCA; we just think it isn’t necessary to use that authority to address climate change because we’d rather spend billions under the ‘Inflation Reduction Act.’” (Yes, those quotation marks are there for the obvious reason.)

Why didn’t you know that happened? I’ll bet you thought that all those nasty Republican justices on the Supreme Court had deprived the EPA of the authority to address climate change under existing law. Wrong again. They merely said that Congress had not given the EPA the authority to dictate to states the mix of fuels they use to generate electricity. On the contrary, in a 2017 case when he was on the D.C. Circuit, Brett Kavanaugh, then a judge, now a justice, pointed out that the EPA has the legal authority under the TSCA to restrict or phase out “chemical substances” that are harming the climate, and that certainly includes greenhouse gases and fossil fuels. Why do you suppose you haven’t heard that either? Could it be because Big Corporate Media are trying to convince the public that Democrats are the good guys and Republicans are the bad guys?

Some readers may by now want to scream at me that climate change is “the greatest scientific fraud of all time,” to quote my friend and former law partner Buddy Menton. I do recommend Buddy’s excellent series of dozens of articles that raise many interesting and debatable questions about how good humans are at predicting the future of the climate. For example, in the 1970s, numerous scientific articles speculated about the possibility of a new ice age — the opposite of the concerns about global warming that are front and center today.

For my own part, I am not a scientist, although I am married to one, and I don’t feel qualified to judge the scientific issues. While I find Menton’s work entertaining and provocative, I am more inclined to defer to the views of experts like Steven E. Koonin, Bjørn Lomborg, and Dan Yergin, whose excellent books review what we do and do not know about the climate. These three authors all maintain that climate change is real, and human beings and fossil fuels are contributing to it, but that it isn’t an “existential crisis” that is going to kill all of us or destroy the planet, as is sometimes hyped by Big Corporate Media. As Lomborg has repeatedly argued, gradual warming actually saves lives and the key to adapting to it is to make cheap energy available to all. However, for those interested in a deep dive into climate science for themselves, Part II of the Hansen et al. petition contains a 75-page summary.

But arguing the science of climate is beside my points, which for today are only two:

(1) The Biden administration is hypocritical about climate issues and uses them as excuses to funnel money to its supporters. (Check out this Breitbart article, which claims that 80 percent of the so-called “green energy loans” last time around went to bundlers and donors of President Barack Obama, who got millions in subsidies allegedly to encourage more renewable energy.) It isn’t a good sign that the Biden administration recently put “Democratic stalwart” John Podesta in charge of deciding who actually gets the $370 billion allegedly intended to fight climate change.

(2) Big Corporate Media are trying to control your thoughts so that you believe that Democrats are trying their level best to address climate change, but they can’t because those nasty Republicans in Congress and on the courts just won’t let them.",https://spectator.org/biden-cant-shield-us-from-billionaire-tax-fallout/,2022-09-26
"Before Announcing Russian Oil Ban, Biden Pledged U.S. Oil Embargo - The American Spectator","The Biden administration, a public relations outfit disguised as a presidency, advanced the hashtag “PutinPriceHike” as a means not of alleviating service-station strain but to deflect blame for it.

Long before Joe Biden announced an embargo on Russian oil, he promised one on American oil.

“Would you close down the oil industry?” Donald Trump asked at the second 2020 presidential debate. “I would transition from the oil industry,” Joe Biden responded. “Yes.”

In post-debate damage-control mode, Biden insisted that “we’re not getting rid of fossil fuels for a long time.” Does the president consider 17 months “a long time”?

One way to avoid blame for “getting rid of fossil fuels” — a commodity used by even (news flash!) electric vehicles deriving energy from the coal- and natural gas-dominant grid — involves pursuing policies to make them cost-prohibitive. On Thursday, AAA pegged a gallon of regular unleaded, up 59 cents from a week earlier and 84 cents from a month earlier, at $4.32 a gallon. Where do prices go this weekend? Up seems like a pretty good guess.

The policies of the president of the country that provides about half of U.S. oil and gas, not the strongman running the country that provides less than 5 percent of U.S. petroleum, exert a far greater influence on the price at the pump. #BidenPriceHike

Joe Biden issued an executive order on his first day in office placing a moratorium on Arctic National Wildlife Reserve drilling and blocked offshore drilling for parts of the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea. That same executive order “determined that approving the proposed Keystone XL pipeline would not serve the U.S. national interest” because “the United States must prioritize the development of a clean energy economy” and “that approval of the proposed pipeline would undermine U.S. climate leadership by undercutting the credibility and influence of the United States in urging other countries to take ambitious climate action.”

A week later, Biden compounded the problem by issuing executive order 14008.

Therein, he instructed the secretary of the Interior to “pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters” to “consider whether to adjust royalties associated with coal, oil, and gas resources extracted from public lands and offshore waters, or take other appropriate action, to account for corresponding climate costs.” The order also ordered several cabinet secretaries to “identify steps through which the United States can promote ending international financing of carbon-intensive fossil fuel-based energy while simultaneously advancing sustainable development and a green recovery.”

The president of the United States stands so committed to this cook-the-frog oil embargo on the United States that rather than lift any of these restrictions to replace the now-forbidden Russian energy he instead goes in search for fossil fuels in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. Better for his image to pay far-away commies and princes who dismember critics and death-to-America ayatollahs to produce the energy, he reasons, than Americans. (READ MORE from Daniel J. Flynn: Biden’s Energy Ideology Fuels Russia’s War)

Like the hashtag public relations “solution” to the gas price problem, this strikes as a superficial approach in that it aims to placate environmentalists rather than help the environment. Americans still use the fuel. The president just wants to continue boasting that he banned drilling in an oil-rich but creature-poor desolate outpost, blocked a pipeline, and refused permits on coal leases here in America. The energy sector under the Biden administration increasingly resembles any tech company’s customer service department: outsourced.

The weakness President Biden displayed in Afghanistan that effectively provided encouragement for Putin’s foreign adventurism, and the inflationary policies pursued by the economic illiterates of both parties that sent the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet from roughly $3.8 trillion in September 2019 to $8.9 trillion today, fueled the fuel-price explosion. So did oil and gas policy, boasted about by the Biden administration before every motorist reacted to digital pump-price signs the way Marion Crane reacted to Norman Bates dressed in his dead mother’s clothes.

President Nixon, seeing a way to gain advantage on the Soviet Union and bring the North Vietnamese to the peace table, went to China. President Clinton, looking at massive deficits and the public’s weariness with Washington’s power, declared the era of big government “over” as he enacted welfare reform and presided over a balanced budget. Cold Warrior Ronald Reagan entered into an arms control agreement with the Soviet Union. Events cause presidents to pivot in directions people did not anticipate.

Current events, and long-standing anemic poll numbers, suggest that Joe Biden needs a fossil fuels reversal almost as much as America does. Just don’t count on it. The office that makes some men big keeps others small. Biden, a rigid servant to interest groups rather than the whole country, lacks the political imagination of a Nixon or a Reagan or a Clinton.

"Biden, OPEC+, and the SPR: His Search for Energy Ruination - The American Spectator","While touring the damage Hurricane Ian did to Florida a couple of weeks ago, President Joe Biden remarked, “No one f**** with a Biden.” Reality, as you should expect, is vastly different. Pretty much everybody — nations, courts, even television comedians — “f****” with Biden almost every day.

North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un, still trying to get the attention that Russian President Vladimir Putin has gotten with his Ukraine war, fired a ballistic missile over Japan. Chinese President Xi Jinping, in his opening speech to the Chinese Communist Party’s congress, held every five years, said that China was going to reunite with Taiwan by force if necessary. A federal appeals court ruled that former U.S. President Barack Obama’s “Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals” program — which Biden is working hard to save — is illegal.

Putin, about whom Biden shouted that the man couldn’t “remain in power,” is apparently as secure as Biden is in his presidency. Russia remains Biden’s principal intermediary in the ongoing, and hopefully fruitless, negotiations with Iran to renew Obama’s 2015 nuclear weapons deal.

And don’t forget what Saturday Night Live did with Biden’s “two words: made in America” remark. In one part of the show, a clip of Biden’s latest mental gaffe was played, and host Colin Jost said: “Wow. Well, let me respond with two words: Jesus H. Christ.” If only the other responses to Biden were as funny.

Biden’s relationship with Saudi Arabia has been fraught since his 2019 debate appearance, when he said: “I would make it very clear we were not going to in fact sell more weapons to them…. We were going to in fact make them pay the price, and make them in fact the pariah that they are.”

Biden wasn’t above pleading with the Saudi government to delay announcing the OPEC+ production cut of two million barrels a day until after the November election. What, asking for a political favor that could affect an election? The last time that theme became popular, former President Donald Trump was impeached for asking the Ukrainians to investigate Hunter Biden’s involvement with a huge Ukrainian oil company.

When the Saudis refused Biden’s request and announced the cut, the White House accused the oil cartel of siding with Russia. Perhaps the administration doesn’t know that Russia is a member of OPEC+ and its tacit leader. Now, Biden and his congressional cohort are trying to find a way to punish the Saudis.

Biden promised that there would be “consequences” for the Saudis and has said that it was time for us to reevaluate our relationship with them.

To paraphrase a recent tweet by Fox News’ Brit Hume, the Democrats’ approaches to punishing the Saudis amount to America’s committing strategic suicide.

After Biden’s July trip to the Middle East, a massive arms sale to Saudi Arabia was announced. It included Patriot missile batteries intended to protect Saudi oil-production facilities from attack by Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen. Now, the Democrats want to block some or all of the pending arms sales to the Saudis.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) urged Biden to “immediately freeze all aspects” of U.S.–Saudi relations, including halting new arms sales.

If the Democrats want to push the Saudis into Russia’s hands, this is the way to do it. The U.S. has been the primary source of arms to Saudi Arabia for decades. We have trained Saudi forces, especially its air forces, in the American way of war and defense for just as long. Russia, ever eager to gain more influence in Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Middle East, would gladly sell weapon systems, probably including missile defenses and aircraft, to the Saudis, reducing whatever influence we have over the Saudis.

Three members of Congress, Reps. Susan Wild, Sean Casten, and Tom Malinowski, want Biden to remove all U.S. troops from Saudi Arabia, a truly dumb move. That would bar the U.S. from major bases in Saudi Arabia that are key to opposing Iranian aggression.

And then there’s the “NOPEC” bill, which would allow antitrust suits against the oil cartel and ensure countering actions against U.S. companies trading in much of the Middle East.

The first thing Biden could and should do to punish the Saudis and the other members of OPEC+ would be to unleash America’s energy supplies. In 2018, America was energy independent because oil and gas were being drilled and produced at record levels. But the president’s too busy campaigning against U.S. energy and draining our Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to keep gasoline prices from rising.

Biden has been draining the SPR at a rate of about one million barrels of oil each day. It is now at its lowest levels since the 1980s, when it was built. As others have pointed out, Biden has been using the SPR as a credit card to artificially depress the price of gasoline nationwide.

The SPR is supposed to be used only in emergencies, such as another oil embargo against the United States or a war that interferes with our supplies from the Middle East. It is, as its name states, a strategic asset, not one that a president should be using to play games with the price of gasoline.

The best thing Biden should also do is to push the Saudis to join Trump’s Abraham Accords, which have significantly eased tensions in the Middle East. The Saudis have rejected the invitation to join the accords, but their relations with Israel have eased considerably since the accords were signed. Talks between Israeli and Saudi officials, some of which took place in Saudi Arabia, are ongoing.

The Saudis have always been a transactional ally of the United States. They are terrified of Iran and its growing nuclear capabilities. Biden should be using that fear to influence Saudi Arabia rather than to punish it.",https://spectator.org/biden-china-taiwan/,2022-10-17
Biden: Our First Cephalopod President - The American Spectator,"Scientists recently discovered what they believe to be the oldest common an ancestor of today’s octopus and other cephalopods. It lacked a backbone, was slimy, and is now a fossil. Without any apparent irony, they named it after Joe Biden. Syllipsimopodi bideni, as this ancient vampire squid is now known, was reportedly named after Biden by paleontologists for his work on climate change. This was apparently before Biden’s climate change work began to destroy the American economy.

But the name remains apt. Cephalopods will attempt to ooze out of tight situations that they have gotten themselves into. Biden is using the Russian invasion of Ukraine to explain high gas prices, which were on their way up well before Putin went after Kyiv. The president declared war on carbon-based energy immediately after taking office. That virtually ensured prices at the pump were going to rise. Biden and his advisers obviously hoped that the increases would be gradual enough that they would go unnoticed. As they have been so often in the past 15 months, they were disastrously wrong.

A cephalopod will change colors to adapt to its environment. Biden has shown this trait throughout his political career, but it has never been more apparent than in his switch from candidacy to presidency. Having misjudged the direction of the country, the slightly pink candidate has again turned a light shade of blue as president. Having failed to deter Putin, Biden will try to blame the Russian president for all his administration’s failures.

Putin has proven himself to be a truly malign actor, but much of what has happened in our country since January 2021 is beyond even his capability to create mayhem. Nor can Biden continue to blame Donald Trump. In Trump’s case, Biden promised to bring the country back together after Trump’s alleged mismanagement. He has had a year, and the country is more divided than ever. He promised to beat COVID, but managed to make it worse, and destroyed confidence in the nation’s public health system in the process. In Putin’s case, he had nothing to do with the Afghan debacle. Those were decisions made by the president against the advice of his military commanders and intelligence chiefs. There is no amount of lipstick that will make that pig look like Lady Gaga.

Nor did Putin engineer the Build Back Better fiasco. Biden made the decision not to break that unpassable leftist wish list into digestible parts all by himself because he had absolute faith in his ability to forge compromise based on Senate experience when he was just one of the gang. But there is a Putin analogy here. BBB is Biden’s Ukraine. Both men believe that they are the smartest people in the room and their misplaced self-confidence appears to have ignored good advice from advisers and congressional allies who should have been trusted. Putin may have cowed advisers into agreeing with him. But leaks from the Biden White House give solid evidence that the president really believed that he could push the package through by using his charm to win over the two rogue Democratic senators needed to pass. Even after the bill died, he refused to stop referring to his agenda by name.

Even the president’s two signature successes have proved inflationary. The second stimulus package put unneeded money into the economy and was probably the spark that started the fire. Even the “bipartisan” infrastructure bill proved inflationary as it immediately drove up the demand for construction materials past existing supply, and that will be the case at least until the midterms.

Nonetheless, Biden is reportedly going to attempt to escape the lobster trap he has gotten himself into by blaming the whole mess on Russia, labeling high gas prices and further inflation a “Putin Price hike” and portraying himself as a crisis president. It won’t work. First, the American people may have a short attention span, but they can remember last month. They may give him a pass on that portion of gas prices caused by the war in Ukraine, but they know that they were already mired in inflation far before the invasion started. In addition, most Americans understand that Biden’s lukewarm response to Putin’s threats at the start of the crisis caused him to factor out the U.S. and NATO in his equations. This does nothing to bolster his credibility as a crisis president. And he continues to double down. Instead of sending Polish fighter jets to Ukraine, Biden sent Vice President Kamala Harris to Poland. She giggled when asked her first serious question. We are lucky that we are not at war with Poland.

One thing that Biden can feel good about is that he is not the first president to have a new species named after him. Barack Obama’s namesake was a parasite, also an apt analogy.

Biden Plays Geopolitics With China and Russia — And Loses - The American Spectator,"Stephen Kotkin, Princeton professor, historian, and author of two magnificent volumes on Stalin (with a third planned), appeared recently on the Hoover Institution program GoodFellows with British historian Niall Ferguson, former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster, economist John Cochrane, and host Bill Whalen to discuss China, Russia, and the current world crisis. Kotkin conveyed insights on the nature of the Chinese and Russian regimes and the evolving war in Ukraine. It is well worth your time to watch, listen, and learn.

Kotkin began by bluntly stating the challenge we face in confronting China: “We’ve never had an economy this large run by a political system this opaque.” The Chinese regime is Leninist to its core, exercising a monopoly of political power in a country of more than 1 billion people. And it has been that way, Kotkin said, since Mao Zedong seized power in 1949. Western statesmen and businessmen, and some scholars, deluded themselves into believing that post-Mao China was evolving toward a pluralistic political society. Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leaders have studied Mikhail Gorbachev’s fall in the Soviet Union, he said. Don’t expect a Chinese Gorbachev to emerge in this opaque political system.

The CCP, Kotkin continued, is not motivated by economics. Its legitimacy does not depend on economic growth but, rather, on its control of the levers of power — a huge security apparatus that specializes in surveillance, control, and political repression. China’s remarkable economic growth since the 1980s, he explained, resulted from the hard work of the Chinese people in engaging in “market behavior” that the CCP tolerated but never really lost control over. So, the CCP created “special economic zones” where market economics thrived, but never outside of the watchful eyes of the party. This market activity encouraged the United States, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other free-market countries to trade with and invest in China. Productivity boomed. The standards of living for tens of millions of Chinese citizens greatly improved. The CCP did not cause this economic growth but hijacked it to serve the ends of the party — and took credit for it. And then it used it to become a military superpower.

Kotkin acknowledged that, at least in the 1970s and 1980s, there was a geopolitical component to the West’s embrace of China — exploiting the Sino-Soviet split to help undermine Soviet power. But after the Cold War ended, economics, or what Edward Luttwak called “geoeconomics,” replaced geopolitics as the motivation for the West’s continued engagement with China. The West, including the United States, took a geopolitical holiday and helped fuel China’s remarkable economic (and military) growth.

Kotkin applauded the Trump administration’s recognition that unrestricted engagement with China was folly. On the other hand, Kotkin said that the Biden administration plays geopolitics with a plus-30 handicap, with respect not only to China but also to Russia. Kotkin described Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime as a “praetorian guard” of 30,000–50,000 members who flourish even when the country suffers. It is similar to the old Soviet nomenklatura. Putin understands, according to Kotkin, that suppressing political alternatives is the key to staying in power, and he will likely be able to do that even if the war in Ukraine continues to go badly for Russia. Putin’s mistake in Ukraine was attempting to change the regime and install a pro-Russian regime on the cheap — similar to what the George W. Bush administration tried to do in Iraq. (READ MORE from Francis P. Sempa: Elbridge Colby Has It Right on Taiwan and Ukraine)

Putin (and U.S. President Joe Biden) underestimated the bravery and valor of the Ukrainian people, Kotkin said, and Ukrainian valor and Russian atrocities have thus far kept the West united in support of Ukraine. But, in the long run, Russian resources will likely enable Russia to hold on to some Ukrainian territory. Russia is inflicting terrible damage on Ukraine’s infrastructure (energy, transportation, and communication). Kotkin said that Ukraine’s definition of “victory” should not be our definition, and he suggested that the most realistic outcome of the war will be an armistice with compromises made on both sides.

Kotkin understands that in formulating policies to deal with the current world crises in Europe and the Far East, history is an indispensable guide. If only the Biden administration understood this, too, then America would be better prepared and equipped to successfully meet these geopolitical challenges.",https://spectator.org/biden-clinton-economy/,2022-11-18
The Biden Price Hike - The American Spectator,"In recent years, the typical American household has spent around 5 percent of its pre-tax budget on gasoline. Apart from housing, food, and transportation — the actual cost of vehicles and their insurance — petrol is an essential item on the expense sheet of almost all Americans. And almost all Americans are thus feeling the squeeze from gravity-defying prices at the pump.

So how did we get here? All political administrations lie a little bit, and some lie a little bit more than that. But the government of President Joe Biden in little more than a year has managed to manufacture crisis after crisis in the domestic economy, without ever acknowledging that its own policies have been to blame.

After hemming and hawing for months about inflation — the administration repeatedly assured the nation it would be “transitory” — the Biden government now says the punishing surge in gas prices is due to greedy oil companies and, of course, the all-purpose bogeyman from Russia, Vladimir Putin.

White House spokesperson Jen Psaki now routinely refers to the “Putin price hike,” while the president himself has directly accused the oil giants of intentionally taking advantage of the American consumer while supplies are somewhat limited.

It is a compelling narrative, but for one inconvenient fact: none of it is true.

“All you need to do is look at the numbers,” says Bruce Clark, a senior analyst at Informa Global Markets, a company that provides data and analysis to the financial markets. “The numbers don’t lie.”

Stat Sheet

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which is part of the U.S. Department of Labor, prices skyrocketed throughout Biden’s first year as president — well before Putin set off to wreak havoc in Ukraine.

From February 2021 to February 2022, food prices rose a whopping 7.9 percent — what the BLS called the largest twelve-month increase in the sector since 1981. But energy prices rose nearly 26 percent during the same period. And practically all of this is a direct result of the administration’s policy decisions.

Biden nixed the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada on his very first day in office — something he had pledged to do on the campaign trail, but something the markets had broadly already priced in. The move made a lot of headlines, but it was never clear how much oil the pipeline would have delivered. Woke progressives saw it as a chance to claim victory, and the halo over Biden’s head seemed to grow still more luminous.

But the serious work was happening behind the scenes, where Biden’s “climate czar” John Kerry — a man not seemingly allergic to his own private jets — was putting the full-court press on America’s biggest banks not to loan money to, or provide funding for, traditional oil and gas companies.

In conjunction with a United Nations initiative called the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, Kerry pushed America’s largest banks to stop money from going to entities involved in drilling, fracking, and other activities aimed at extracting energy from our own sovereign soil. In short, the United States was not supposed to use a pipeline from Canada or drill its own energy at home.

“The reality is the Biden administration is not standing in the way of domestic oil production,” Deputy Energy Secretary David Turk said in December. Yet that is exactly what the Biden administration is doing, and will continue to do.

While Psaki keeps claiming that thousands of potential extraction sites in the United States lie fallow, the administration’s push to block energy companies from borrowing money is tantamount to shutting those sites down. Companies live and die by the debt they can raise in the credit markets — they need cash infusions to launch new projects, which is what bonds provide — and the administration is making that as difficult as possible.

“Banks don’t want to be called names,” says Clark at Informa. “The government has essentially demonized the oil and gas markets. And when the government is knocking at their door, they don’t really have any choice but to listen.”

Bank Balance

Big banks make money by loaning money — the global size of the bond market dwarfs the size of the stock market — and restrictions on lending are a needless brake on the U.S. economy. Yet at a time when interest rates have been at historical lows, minimizing the ability of banks to profit from their loans, the Biden administration is doubling down on its efforts to block them from financing the United States from getting its oil and gas right at home.

That sounds woke enough to satisfy a certain braying section of the populace. But whatever one’s political stance, it’s simply a bad idea when banks are banned from making money.

And oil and gas companies need bank funding to undertake new drilling operations. According to general industry standards, it costs at least $500,000 — at pre-inflation numbers — to build a new drill site, plus up to $30 per barrel to extract the oil. If they can’t raise the money to start that via the bond markets, they simply cannot afford to drill.

“I’m not sure these fellows have thought this through,” says a senior Wall Street analyst who declined to be named because of his involvement with the sector. “You cannot argue that banks are evil while your entire economy depends on banking. They have to be free to act normally.”

All Blown Up Now

At the origin of this mess was Biden’s decision to hand out free money that the United States quite simply does not have. Driven by the squeaky wing of the party over which he nominally presides, Biden has rarely missed a chance to distribute cash on every street corner he can find. And the COVID-19 pandemic gave him a grand opportunity to do that.

While it has become a cliche to say that freedom isn’t free, it’s worth remembering that money isn’t free either. According to a recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the biggest surge in U.S. inflation of late started last year with Biden’s so-called COVID “relief” package, which amounted to a staggering $1.9 trillion.

The bank’s report — entitled “Why Is US Inflation Higher Than In Other Countries?” — succinctly lays out why U.S. inflation has spiraled out of control compared to other Western nations dealing with the COVID crisis.

“The United States is experiencing higher rates of inflation than other advanced economies,” the report says. “The sizable fiscal support measures aimed at counteracting the economic collapse due to the Covid-19 pandemic could explain about 3 percentage points of the recent rise in inflation.”

Depending where you are on the income scale, this logically means that your “free money” from Biden actually only made your household poorer. It’s the gift that keeps on taking.

Fed Up

In the minds of many in the markets, the United States is now at an inflection point similar to that of the early 1980s, when Paul Volcker, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, deliberately crushed the U.S. economy in order to tame runaway inflation.

He raised borrowing rates so high that it was all but impossible for companies to keep doing business. Virtually overnight he plunged the U.S. economy into a recession — the worst, it was said at the time, since World War II — and all but eliminated the rampant demand that was driving prices out of control. Angry builders put stamps on wooden two-by-fours that they mailed to Fed headquarters in protest. President Ronald Reagan’s approval ratings fell to Bidenesque lows.

It was by any standard an audacious gambit — but it worked. Inflation was tamed in time, the economy rebooted, and Reagan went on to cruise to reelection in a landslide.

Oil Over Again

Oddly enough, the 1980s crisis was in part spurred by the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, when an out-of-touch Western-style playboy autocrat was deposed by bearded religious militants who had their own ideas of what an autocracy looks like. Many in the West at the time started fretting about oil supplies in the wake of the shah’s overthrow. And now we have come full circle with Putin.

The virtue-signaling that comes with Biden’s insistence on sanctioning Russia — which supplied only about 3 percent of our oil before its invasion of Ukraine in any case — almost inevitably means we will buy more of our oil from Iran. They still chant “Death to America” there at Friday prayers, but as oil demand spikes and prices keep rising, the Islamists get ever closer to the nuclear weapons they are so desperate to possess.

As for the price at the pump here at home, virtually every policy decision being taken at the state and federal level is wrong. Many states are rolling back gasoline taxes, which will only drive more demand — and push prices even higher. California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s starry-eyed plan to give state residents a $300 “gas card” to offset pump prices will have the exact opposite effect of what he intends to do.

Meanwhile the Biden administration keeps stumbling along, spending as much money as it can as fast as it can. And there really isn’t anybody in the markets who believes the current Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, has the backbone to stand up, as his predecessor Volcker did, and say, “Enough is enough.” (READ MORE: Inflation Is America’s Payment for the Fed’s Printing Addiction)

Indeed, the Fed introduced its policy of so-called quantitative easing — buying up debt to increase the supply of money in the markets — as a short-term solution to the 2008 subprime financial crisis. But quantitative easing is still going strong fourteen years later.

And while the Fed is officially tasked to keep inflation at around 2 percent, inflation is nevertheless around 8 percent overall. Powell’s recent marginal increase in rates — the central bank’s first hike in more than three years — is akin to throwing a pebble into the ocean.

“The financial markets have essentially called the Fed’s bluff,” says Clark. “They don’t believe the Fed will harm them.”

So it becomes hard to see how all this will be brought under control. But in the immortal words of the late Herb Stein, President Richard Nixon’s chief economist and a longtime friend of The American Spectator: “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.”",https://spectator.org/biden-courts-abbas-ignores-palestinian-pay-for-slay/,2022-05-17
Biden’s Pathetic Response to Putin: ‘It’s Perfectly Normal’ - The American Spectator,"When I’m with kids, I tend to respond to their worries with “it’s perfectly normal” in order to reassure them. You know:

“I got a rash.”

“It’s perfectly normal.”

“My foot hurts.”

“It’s perfectly normal.”

“My brother bit my ear and I’m bleeding.”

“It’s perfectly normal.”

“Mom is walking down the hall with her own head under her arm.”

“It’s perfectly normal.”

It’s not like it’s a particularly well-thought-out answer either. Or is it? I don’t know. Maybe Mom has seen that influencers on Instagram carry their heads that way these days. In any case, nothing is going to distract me from my “keep calm” pep talk. The problem is, sometimes too much calm can bring about disasters.

One time I was in charge of about 15 children at a birthday party in a very small home. They were celebrating a seventh birthday for one of them. They were happy — I mean they were sweating like camels, red in the face, huddled together, screaming like Rambo getting a testicle amputated, and throwing objects at each other so savagely that they make the images coming in from Ukraine these days look like a joke. In the midst of all the chaos, one of them said to me, “It smells like something’s burning in the hallway.”

“It’s perfectly normal,” I instantly replied without looking up, trying to stop another one of them from choking a little girl with her own pigtails, as she steadily went blue in the face and her lungs became more depleted of oxygen than Biden’s brain. The young fireman tugged at my pants again: “It really does smell a lot like something’s burning in the hallway.”

“It’s perfectly normal. Keep playing while I go for the cake now,” I said, masterfully applying another advanced technique, namely distraction.

A word on distraction maneuvers: if you ever see a child with a several-meters-wide gaping wound who needs calming down, say that what has happened is terrible, but that you have a huge box of chocolates somewhere at home, that you are able to wiggle your ears, or that you are Donald Duck’s personal friend. And that’s today’s self-help tip for parents in a pickle.

The child firefighter came back for a third time: “It’s perfectly normal!,” I said, this time trying to get retrieve a ball that the children had managed to lodge between the curtain rail and the ceiling. It is scientifically impossible, but it’s a known fact that if you put 10 sufficiently agitated children together in a small place they are capable of breaking all kinds of laws of physics; if the children are over 18, they will also break the laws of chemistry.

The fourth time the little bugger came to yell at me that there was too much smoke in the house, and, after making sure that none of his friends were smoking my cigars, I peered into the kitchen. The scene was tragic: the candles and the cake were on fire. I don’t know who the hell thought it would be a good idea to light the candles half an hour before bringing out the cake. I doused it with as much water as I could, but this catastrophe was already well beyond repair.

Pushing my child-persuasion skills to the extreme, I tried to convince the kids to eat this “unique” cake: “Kids, it looks strange to you because you have never tasted this kind of cake. This cake is what the French call flambé, the latest trend in cake shops in Paris.” All I got in response were disgusted faces and a “well, let the French pigs eat it.” (READ MORE from Itxu Díaz: The Daily Nuclear Threat Is Getting Boring)

I tell you all of this because politics is the closest thing to a children’s birthday party. And it is to be expected that someone or another should tell us, as the world is going up in smoke, that “it’s perfectly normal.” But the truth is — and both Biden and the EU should know this — that we are coming to a point in which what is happening in Ukraine is a colossal wildfire, and, no, it is not perfectly normal. So insisting on peace, sanctions, and keeping calm to avoid a world war while the free world blazes away may not be enough. I’m speaking from experience, Uncle Joe.",https://spectator.org/biden-democracy-dictatorial-definition/,2022-03-09
Biden’s Colossal Misreading of Putin’s Motivations in Ukraine - The American Spectator,"The prolific British historian Niall Ferguson, writing in Bloomberg News, concludes that the Biden administration “is making a colossal mistake thinking that it can protract the war in Ukraine, bleed Russia dry, topple Putin and signal to China to keep its hands off Taiwan.” If this in fact is the administration’s policy — and Ferguson relies on apparently well-sourced New York Times stories by David Sanger and unnamed senior administration officials — then Ferguson is right. It is a colossal mistake and a misreading of Russian history.

According to Ferguson, the Biden administration envisions Putin’s regime collapsing if the war in Ukraine drags on without Russia achieving victory. New reports have portrayed the Russian invasion as a quagmire — a sort of rerun of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. And while Ukrainians suffer, so the argument goes, Russians are suffering, too — both soldiers as a result of the Ukrainian resistance and civilians as a result of Western economic sanctions. Revolution is in the air. And there is some historical justification for the notion that an inconclusive war can lead to revolution — the Russo-Japanese War led to a revolution in Russia in 1905, and the colossal losses and shortages caused by the First World War led to the Romanov dynasty’s collapse in March 1917.

But there is another side to Russian history — one that glories in the heroic fighting of its brave soldiers and civilians in the face of hardship and the drudgery and horror of war. In 2017, Gregory Carleton, a professor of Russian Studies at Tufts University, wrote a book that Biden administration policymakers should read: Russia: The Story of War. Carleton’s book provides a cultural history of what he calls Russia’s “civic religion” and a “grand narrative of war” that goes back to Russia’s experience of war — against the Mongols in the 13th through 15th centuries, during the Time of Troubles in the early 17th century, and against Napoleon and Hitler.

Russia’s grand narrative of war — which is partly myth — includes references to invasions, stout resistance, self-reliance, and incredible self-sacrifice. And the most evocative of these historical experiences are the Battle of Borodino against Napoleon’s Grand Armée in 1812 and the Battle of Brest against the German Army in 1941.

At Borodino on the third day of the battle, Russia suffered more than 50,000 casualties in an unsuccessful effort to prevent Napoleon’s forces from reaching Moscow. French losses were estimated at 35,000. It was the bloodiest day of the Napoleonic Wars. Twenty-nine Russian generals died at Borodino. Carleton described the suffering and tragedy there as the nation’s “Golgotha,” which was forever seared into the Russian soul by Tolstoy’s War and Peace. Borodino, Carleton explained, was an example of defiance, resilience, and courage among Russian troops and civilians.

The World War II battle at Brest is less well known, but it is similarly evocative of Russian courage, defiance, and resistance. Hitler’s troops attacked the fortress there in June 1941, and about 4,000 Russian soldiers, Carleton noted, “held out for weeks against overwhelming German forces.” The garrison at Brest refused to surrender despite being weakened by hunger and thirst. “Outgunned, out-teched, and outnumbered,” Carleton wrote, “Red Army soldiers fought like superhumans.” The heroic fight was memorialized by Russian historian Sergei Smirnov in Brest Fortress, published in 1965 and still in print in Putin’s Russia. The battle at Brest is also the subject of movies and documentaries, and a portion of the fortress’s actual walls has been preserved as an historic site.

Carleton noted that Vladimir Putin appeals to Russia’s historic grand narrative of war. In doing so, Carleton explains, he touches feelings and emotions that “lie deep in the soil of Russian history.” It doesn’t matter that in the Ukraine war Russia is the aggressor and invader. The Brest myth, for example, lives on despite the fact that Stalin was Hitler’s accomplice in starting the European phase of World War II and despite the facts that Stalin gobbled up the Baltic states and invaded Finland in the war’s early years. In Russia, as in many other countries, myth and history become one. And leaders like Putin use mythical history to their advantage.

According to early surveys — conducted by Russian and non-Russian pollsters — recently analyzed by scholars at the London School of Economics, ordinary Russians in February and March “expressed support for the Ukrainian war and for President Putin.” There have been protests within Russia, and Russian police have detained thousands of protesters across Russia. But Putin’s regime puts out pro-war propaganda and censors news reports about the war, and that undoubtedly has an impact on ordinary Russians’ views about the war. Meanwhile the Guardian reports instances of low morale among Russian troops based on statements made by soldiers captured by Ukrainian forces — who, reports note, made those statements under obvious duress. The Daily Mail reported that intercepted radio messages among invading Russian troops similarly showed instances of low morale. These reports, however, are anecdotal. Most Russian troops are obeying orders. The invasion, shellings, and bombings continue. There are no signs of a general mutiny among Russian forces.

The Biden administration would be well-advised not to protract this war in the hope that Russian defeats and casualties and hardships at home will topple Putin. The longer the war lasts, the more Ukrainian soldiers and civilians will die. The United States should be encouraging both sides to negotiate an end to the fighting. As Ferguson says, it would be “wonderful” if the war’s drudgery and tragedy led to Putin’s downfall. But, he writes, “Prolonging the war runs the risk not just of leaving tens of thousands of Ukrainians dead and millions homeless, but also of handing Putin something he can plausibly present at home as victory.” And prolonging the war could also lead to escalation and World War III if the U.S. and NATO become field belligerents. As Ferguson writes, “History talks in the corridors of power.”",https://spectator.org/biden-department-of-justice-alabama/,2022-03-23
Lessons From Biden’s Reckless Student Loan ‘Forgiveness’ Plan - The American Spectator,"President Joe Biden’s new plan to “cancel” up to $10,000 in student loan debt for those making less than $125,000 annually is at once a dereliction of constitutional duty, a crass political gambit in the lead-up to a contested midterm election, and a morally perverse value judgment that lavishes The Regime’s insular, well-heeled voting base at the expense of the median middle-class American. It is, to borrow a term in vogue in Democratic Party circles these days, a truly “deplorable” act.

Interestingly, however, it is also an act that comes with some key lessons for Republicans. If there is to be any silver lining from this grotesque and imperious act, Republicans must learn those lessons — and act upon them.

The first lesson to learn is that the Democratic Party, once the presumptive partisan home of the working-class and the downtrodden, has never been more confident about who it is that now comprises its core voting base: affluent, predominantly white, and predominantly urban or suburban college-educated elites. There is simply no other way to explain this particular policy. The wealthiest quintiles of the American income bracket bear the majority of outstanding student loan debt. Student loans, by their very nature, are only relevant for those who are privileged enough to attend the four-year elite Rumspringa that is the modern American university.

The majority of Americans who do not attend a traditional four-year degree-granting university, by contrast, tend to prioritize apprenticeships, technical training, and other tangible steps at career advancement that are sufficiently removed from the substantive claptrap that now pedagogically dominates, and the intellectual Robespierres who now numerically dominate, our decadent institutions of higher education. These are disproportionately the sort of practical, family-centric, salt-of-the-earth Americans who may be behind on their mortgage, auto loan, or small business loan, but are not profligate enough to sign up for hundreds of thousands of dollars in federally subsidized student loans, only to then major in “subjects” like gender studies.

To speak of “canceling” debt is economically, moreover, nonsensical; that cost will merely be transferred to the less profligate, and to those who made more economically sensible decisions. Those who went to a less prestigious university because they got a larger scholarship there will also bear this cost; they did the reasonable thing but will now be penalized for their prudence and thrift. As for the middle-class plumbers and electricians who forewent family vacations to more easily pay back their small business loans — well, they’re now on the hook to help bail out Yale Law and Harvard Law grads.

The Democratic Party, in “reverse Robin Hood” fashion, has fallen from the onetime pro-labor union, pro-welfare party of FDR and LBJ to the party of rich white kids and the miscreant denizens of America’s higher education cartel. Even worse, that cartel will now be perversely incentivized, as a result of this egregious moral hazard, to continue to spike already exorbitant tuition costs.

Democrats, going back at least as far as the Obama presidency and continuing through this week’s presidential edict, have made a deliberate choice to cater to the needs of wealthy, college-educated societal elites. Democrats have made their political bed; they must now lie in it.

The onus now falls squarely upon Republicans to do the same, albeit in reverse. That is, Republicans must emphatically embrace their own core voting base: blue-collar, middle-class, and working-class Americans without a college degree. Far too often, Republican leaders have attempted to run away from their base. Indeed, the worst-kept secret in American politics, exposed for all the world to see during the contentious 2016 GOP presidential primaries, is that the Republican establishment actually despises its own voter base.

But if the Democrats are this committed to mollycoddling the privileged and the well-off, then Republicans have a golden political opportunity to make a sustained play for “normal” America. That political realignment has already commenced; Republicans must now simply embrace it and act accordingly in their crafting of conservative-populist policies. If that requires a more assertive wielding of political power in the service of good political order, so be it.

The second, and closely related, lesson for Republicans is — as if we needed another reminder — that “value neutrality” in all things governance is a lie. It will never be achieved, even if it were worth pursuing as an end unto itself in the first place. (It isn’t.) In effectuating this student loan “cancellation” boondoggle, the Biden administration has made a very deliberate value judgment to prioritize its core voter base (white college graduates) and a core constituency (higher education bureaucrats) at the expense of those voters and constituencies that Democrats hate (the “deplorables” to which Hillary Clinton infamously once referred). (READ MORE: Biden Ukase Affirms Failure of Obama Student Loan Takeover)

The Biden administration, in other words, decided to reward friends and punish enemies within the (arguable) confines of the rule of law. Would that Republicans might do the same, the next time they wield power. As the often-astute Pedro L. Gonzalez put it on Twitter: “Republican politicians are outraged that Democrats used power to reward the people who vote for them while also punishing the GOP’s Middle American base by forcing them to foot the bill. Republican *voters* should be outraged the GOP won’t play the same ruthless game.”

Precisely right.

Biden’s new student loan policy is a travesty of justice. With any luck, if the right plaintiff can find Article III “standing,” the policy will be sued into oblivion as a blatant violation of the Constitution’s separation of powers framework. But perhaps, as a silver lining, Republicans might, might finally learn a necessary lesson or two about the art of politics in this ailing, bitterly divided republic.

Biden Opts to Redefine ‘Recession’ Rather Than Beat It - The American Spectator,"TWIL: What everybody thought constituted a recession no longer does.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis announced that gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.9 percent in the second quarter. This follows a 1.6 percent contraction in the first quarter.

Recession, right?

Well, heretofore two consecutive quarters of a shrinking economy meant recession. But our betters in the Biden administration gaslight enlighten us into seeing not the downturn before our eyes but an apparition of expanding economies past. Redefining recessions matters when they occur on the watch of Democrats at the levers of power who soon will face an angry electorate.

Since the Biden administration could teach a masterclass in spin but would fail Economics 101, the White House expends considerable energy on solving this terrible problem, this terrible problem of recalcitrants stuck on the idea that an economy in recession, well, recedes.

Whoever imagined that recession meant receding GDP never talked to National Economic Council Director Brian Deese. The Chip Diller of the Biden administration told CNN on Sunday that “in terms of the technical definition” two straight quarters of a contracting GDP actually is “not a recession.” He informed, “[The] technical definition considers a much broader spectrum of data points.”

Phew. For a minute it looked as though the twin terrors of Stagflation that plagued the Carter years now also would bedevil the Biden presidency. Good to know the real issue involves merely educating Americans that they do not know what they know and do not experience what they experience. Why did not Jimmy Carter think of this first?

President Biden doubled down on promoting public relations over sound economics on Thursday by claiming that “we’re not in a recession” according to the economists he respects and by boasting of a deal struck in the Senate that raises taxes, or, as the president put it, forces the wealthy and “the largest corporations in America to pay their fair share.” While common sense suggests to not raise taxes during a recession, Biden insists he does not do this because no recession exists.

The New York Times and the Washington Post quickly spread the gospel according to Joe Biden and Brian Deese.

Paul Krugman warned in the Times that “it would be foolish to declare that we’re in a recession even if Thursday’s number is negative and the first-quarter number isn’t revised upward.” Best, he explained, to wait for the word from “the people who actually decide whether we’re in a recession.”

What people? The American people who make up the market? Well, no. It turns out just eight professors.

Writes Krugman of the National Bureau of Economic Research:

Since 1978 the N.B.E.R. has had a standing group of experts called the Business Cycle Dating Committee, which decides — with a lag — when a recession began and ended based on multiple criteria, including employment, industrial production and so on. And the US government accepts those rulings. So the official definition of a recession is that it is a period that the committee has declared a recession; it’s an expert judgment call, not a formula.

Will this “lag” last beyond November, and did these experts vote for Joe Biden?

“The eight economists on the committee are among the most respected in their field,” the Washington Post maintains. “Some have served in Democratic administrations, but past members have also included GOP appointees.”

Past members, huh?

Current members include James Stock, who gave at least $1,000 each to Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Pete Buttigieg. He sent $2,800 to Biden’s 2020 campaign. David Romer, who also sits on this council of elders, donated $5,600 to Joe Biden in the last presidential cycle. His wife, Christina Romer, chaired the council of economic advisors during the Obama administration before becoming part of this elite eight.

What the committee lacks in balance it makes up for in transparency, right?

Reports the Washington Post:

The committee’s meetings are not publicized. They’re held in a closed-door conference room on the third floor of the Cambridge, Mass., office building where NBER is headquartered. They don’t meet on a fixed schedule: Board Chairman and Stanford economist Bob Hall is responsible for calling the meetings. During long periods of consistent economic growth, the board can go years without having anything to discuss, and therefore, it might hold no meetings. It wouldn’t even confirm when past meetings have happened.

Who knows? Maybe the NBER board will vote that America really is experiencing prosperity unmatched by the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s combined. Such a proclamation by eight professors would really show the shrinking stock market, rising consumer prices, and declining productivity that happy days are here again.

Americans find their country in a recession. Americans find those who do not find their country in a recession in the Twilight Zone.

Economists do not decide on a recession. The economy does.

The democracy of the market, where 333 million buyers and sellers determine whether the economy grows or shrinks, will mark “boom” or “bust” on ballots. Eight economists meeting in secret between the Harvard and Central Squares will not dictate the answer.",https://spectator.org/biden-document-scandal-explodes/,2022-07-29
Biden Regime Collapses the ‘Public’-‘Private’ Distinction - The American Spectator,"On Thursday, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, who is also the Show Me State’s candidate for U.S. Senate this November, unveiled some very interesting documents that his office, along with the office of Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, have received since the two states jointly filed a potentially pathbreaking lawsuit in May. Their lawsuit alleges that various high-ranking Biden administration officials have been colluding, in censorious fashion, with the purportedly “private” oligarchs of Big Tech. The straightforward aim of this collusion is the suppression of the dissident “wrongthink” — viz., conservative speech — that threatens the Biden Regime’s tenuous grasp on power.

The documents Schmitt and Landry have received, pursuant to their serving of discovery requests and issuing of third-party subpoenas, shine a spotlight on the depths to which the Biden Regime has fallen to collapse any putative distinction between the “public” sector and the “private” sector. Their findings thus far in this still-pending litigation reveal to all, as if we needed more evidence but a week after Mark Zuckerberg’s podcast confession heard ’round the world with popular host Joe Rogan, the extent to which Big Tech platforms such as Facebook and Twitter no longer qualify as meaningfully “private” and have instead simply become appendages of the state.

According to Schmitt, the Biden Department of Justice has, since Missouri and Louisiana’s lawsuit was filed, identified 45 federal officials who have “interacted with social media companies on misinformation.” What’s more, Meta (Facebook’s parent company) pinpointed 32 additional Biden functionaries with whom it communicated, and YouTube (a Google product) identified 11 such flunkies with whom it communicated.

Overall, the emails obtained evince, as Schmitt says, “a vast censorship enterprise.” The findings unveiled include the revelation that Facebook and the Biden administration arranged weekly and monthly phone calls to discuss what Facebook should be censoring. Those emails, from late July 2021, happen to be dated just a couple of weeks after then-White House press secretary Jen Psaki criticized social media platforms for not doing enough to stifle “misinformation” and President Joe Biden criticized them for “killing people.” What curious timing!

Other emails confirm that Biden administration actors and agencies as wide-ranging as the surgeon general, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency were all in communication with some combination of Google, Facebook, and Twitter. In every instance, the goal was the same: to censor “misinformation” and to constrain the Regime’s Overton window of permissible civilian opinion formation so as to penalize the citizenry’s (well-earned) suspicion of the Regime’s proffered narratives. As Saul Alinsky said, after all, “he who controls the language controls the masses.”

Schmitt’s revelations come just two weeks after Vivek Ramaswamy and Jed Rubenfeld, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, compellingly demonstrated the extent to which the Biden administration directed Twitter to ban Alex Berenson, a notable skeptic of Regime orthodoxy when it came to the COVID-era biomedical security state. And in the interim, in the brief time between that Journal op-ed and Schmitt’s unveiled love letters between Zuckerberg’s hucksters and Biden’s nomenklatura, came perhaps the biggest revelation of all.

On Aug. 25, Zuckerberg himself confided to Rogan on-air that America’s Stasi — sorry, FBI — warned Facebook in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election about the threat of “Russian misinformation,” thus effectively commandeering Facebook to algorithmically penalize, and generally conceal, the New York Post’s bombshell October 2020 story pertaining to prodigal son Hunter Biden’s infamous “laptop from hell.” Some polls have indicated that as many as one in six Biden voters would have changed their vote, in 2020, if they had known the full extent of the Post’s reporting on Hunter’s cursed laptop. Given how narrow Biden’s winning statewide margins of victory were in the states that gave him his Electoral College majority, Big Tech’s censorship was all but assuredly dispositive. (READ MORE from Josh Hammer: American Stasi)

Big Tech, then, is responsible for Biden’s presidency. And it is demonstrably also responsible for the continuing suppression and subjugation of all those “misinformation”-peddling “wrongthink”-ers who refuse to bend the knee to the Biden Regime. Big Tech gave Biden the election, and Big Tech now does Biden’s dirty work for him.

These technology platforms, in short, have proven themselves to not be “private” actors in any meaningful sense of the term. They are now direct appendages of the state, and they must be constitutionally treated and regulated as such.

At the state level, that means directly requiring Big Tech to embrace viewpoint neutrality and to not censor conservative or otherwise-dissenting viewpoints, similar to Texas’ recently enacted law that is currently winding its way through the federal courts. Applying a First Amendment speech standard to Big Tech is manifestly fair — and simply bespeaks the reality of what these platforms have become.

At the federal level, that means amending our byzantine corpus of civil rights law to add political viewpoint as an additional protected class, as well as independent action to either statutorily clarify that platforms such as Facebook are, or have the FCC unilaterally regulate these platforms under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 as, common carriers. There is absolutely no reason why Facebook, for example, should now be regulated any differently than how the phone companies and internet service providers are regulated.

It is bitterly ironic that the Biden Regime, which has recently taken to denouncing so-called MAGA Republicans as “semi-fascists,” has so accelerated the collapse of any distinction between the “public” and the “private,” resulting in a singular Regime blob. Such a merging of the state and the corporate sphere into such a disfigured blob, historically speaking, was a hallmark of actual fascism. In the year 2022, such naked “public”–”private” collusion, and such a “public”–”private” merger, represents the single biggest threat facing the American way of life. We must respond to that threat accordingly.

Biden Rhetorically Comes to the Defense of Taiwan But Actions Speak Louder Than Words - The American Spectator,"President Joe Biden, at a press conference in Tokyo to launch the new Indo-Pacific trade pact, said Monday that the United States would defend Taiwan if China attacked the island. A White House spokesperson was quick to say that this was not a shift in American policy, but it clearly was — assuming Biden meant what he said and understands the implications of what he said. Taipei reacted positively, thanking Biden for his remarks. China, meanwhile, condemned Biden’s remarks, expressing “strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition” to U.S. defense of Taiwan’s independence.

Ironically, Biden’s Indo-Pacific trade pact excludes Taiwan, and as the saying goes, actions speak louder than words. China’s communist leaders are not fools, and they likely have taken the measure of the Biden administration and found it wanting. Biden in his remarks attempted to connect the defense of Taiwan to the Ukraine war, but the United States has not pledged to militarily defend Ukraine and likely won’t do so. What Biden or someone in his administration needs to do is to explain why the defense of Taiwan is a vital national security interest of the United States. Talking about opposing autocracy and aggression as the administration has done in Ukraine is not enough. If American military forces are going to defend Taiwan, the American people need a well-thought-out explanation of why, and then the administration needs to figure out how it plans to defend Taiwan. (READ MORE: The Taiwan Enigma)

Will U.S. military forces be stationed in Taiwan? Will the U.S. Navy’s presence in the South China Sea increase in numbers and lethality? Will the Biden administration return in a major way to the Philippines now that Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is president? Will the United States extend its nuclear guarantee to Taiwan? Will the U.S. include Taiwan in its Quad Alliance in the Indo-Pacific? Will Japan and other regional U.S. allies join in this public commitment to defend Taiwan? And will the administration enable the American people to have a say in this effort through their representatives in Congress? Actions speak louder than words.

It was Theodore Roosevelt who famously said to speak softly and carry a big stick. Biden’s remarks were not “soft,” but what about the big stick? War with China over Taiwan would require a much bigger stick than we currently have in the region. If Biden’s remarks are a bluff, what happens if and when China calls that bluff? The policy of strategic ambiguity that has guided our policy toward Taiwan since the early 1970s needed to change, but Biden has perhaps put the cart before the horse. That can lead to miscalculation and war — a war that under current circumstances, the United States will not likely win; and a war, as a recent article in Foreign Affairs warns, that could go nuclear with unimaginable consequences.

What is needed today in Washington is a steady and resolute hand guiding the ship. The Chinese Communist Party will only be deterred from attacking Taiwan if it thinks it will lose a war with the United States and lose power in China. Our actions, not our words, need to convey that message.",https://spectator.org/biden-faces-setback-in-forcing-religious-doctors-to-perform-abortions-and-transgender-surgeries/,2022-05-23
Biden Risks Estranging Saudi Arabia and Israel While Attempting Reconciliation - The American Spectator,"President Joe Biden is scheduled to visit Israel, the West Bank, and Saudi Arabia starting on Wednesday. Given the war in Ukraine and Chinese aggression towards Taiwan, the president desperately needs a foreign-policy win. And a breakthrough in Israeli–Saudi Arabian relations is poised to give Biden that win, assuming he plays his cards right. For starters, the Biden administration is hoping to finalize the transfer of two Red Sea islands from Egypt to Saudi Arabia in a deal that will bring Israel and Saudi Arabia closer to normalization.

For readers concerned with the U.S. revisiting a strong partnership with Saudi Arabia, I have previously addressed those concerns here. But, in short, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman holds the key to brokering greater Middle East peace and checking Iranian aggression, and he now rules over a kingdom that, unlike 20 years ago, opposes Islamism. Criticisms of the killing of “journalist” Jamal Khashoggi ignore the man’s very checkered past.

It is very unlikely that Saudi Arabia and Israel will announce full normalization of relations during Biden’s trip to the Middle East. As U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has remarked, “Normalization of any kind would be a long process.” Israel is also tempering expectations, with the Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Idan Roll stating, “I don’t think we’re going to wake up and find out we have a signed agreement with Saudi [Arabia].” A recent op-ed by Biden indicated that his planned flight from Israel to Saudi Arabia, while the first by any U.S. president, represents “steps toward normalization” rather than normalization itself.

But most promising is the advancement of a Middle Eastern defense pact against Iran. Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz has recently stated that he expects a “breakthrough” on “MEAD — the Middle East Air Defense” during Biden’s visit. MEAD will reportedly include Israel, countries with formal ties to Israel (the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, and Jordan), and countries with no formal ties to Israel (Saudi Arabia and Qatar). The Wall Street Journal has reported that the U.S. brokered a meeting in Egypt in March with defense officials from all of the above countries to devise strategies to counter Iran’s missile and drone technology, and Gantz met with Bahraini and Jordanian officials to discuss “defense cooperation” earlier this week. The fact that Iran has issued a public statement against U.S. plans to shore up a regional defense against Iran, “solely with the aim of sowing Iranophobia and division among the countries in the region,” suggests that Iran may be taking such a strategic alliance seriously.

This budding alliance is the Biden administration’s win to lose. But the administration is poised to cannibalize the growing alliance by hamstringing Saudi Arabia and Israel in areas vital to these countries’ national interests.

First, the Biden administration risks chilling Saudi interest in such a defense agreement by not sending a clear enough message of support to the Saudis in their war against Iran’s proxies, the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. One great opportunity for the Biden administration to build confidence with Saudi Arabia and to bring Israel and Saudi Arabia closer together would be to allow Israel to give its “laser-powered air defense” technology to Saudi Arabia, as it is seeking approval to do, in addition to the UAE and potentially other Arab states. Hopefully this technology will fit into the Biden administration’s arbitrary category of “defensive” weapons that it is more amenable to letting the Saudi Arabians have.

The Biden administration stands to further lose Saudi confidence by continuing to send mixed messages to Saudi Arabia on the issue of “offensive weapons.” While the Biden administration reportedly is debating resuming the sale of “offensive weapons” to Saudi Arabia, Sullivan has indicated that “there is nothing on the table to lift that ban.” And, in more nonsense, the U.S. is considering lifting this ban on the condition that the Saudis continue to enforce the ceasefire in Yemen. While a stated purpose of the Middle Eastern defense alliance is to provide a check on Iranian missile and drone technology, there is a logical disconnect with the fair-weather U.S. support of Saudi Arabia’s fight against Iranian-sponsored terrorism.

The Biden administration can also put Israel’s participation in greater Saudi engagement at risk by linking Israeli–Saudi ties to concessions from Israel that cut against Israel’s essential national security interests. Despite the Palestinian National Authority continuing to be anti-Semitic, anti-Israel, and uninterested in peace, President Biden will meet with its president, Mahmoud Abbas, in Bethlehem. But even so, Israel is prepared to build more Palestinian homes and approve an expanded cell-phone network for the Palestinians, and the country has agreed to delay building in the E-1 corridor in Judea, in addition to issuing more work permits and legalizing the statuses of Palestinians living in Israel, ahead of Biden’s visit. (READ MORE: Joe Biden Discovers the Realist Case for the US–Saudi Alliance)

But that’s not enough for team Biden. While Israeli sources are stating that a Jerusalem-based U.S. consulate for the Palestinians is not on the table during Biden’s visit to Israel, U.S. sources say that it is. This would be a blatant unraveling of President Trump’s recognition of Israeli sovereignty over all of Jerusalem by supporting a de facto U.S. embassy to “Palestine”.

Biden will visit a Palestinian hospital on the Mount of Olives and use his trip to announce U.S. funding for the East Jerusalem Hospital Network. There are conflicting reports as to whether the Biden administration will allow Israeli officials to join them in this visit. If Israeli officials do not join, this omission will violate Israel’s sovereignty over Jerusalem. Let’s also hope that this hospital network doesn’t harbor Hamas leadership, like Gaza’s Shifra hospital does, or serve as a way to use U.S. taxpayer money to fund anti-Israel activities, like UNRWA or UNESCO do.

There are also reports that Biden will ask Israel for a settlement freeze while on the trip. Such a call would violate Israel’s right to build in Judea and Samaria.

While encouraging developments are bringing Israel and several Arab countries closer together against Iran, the Biden administration will jeopardize these gains by antagonizing Saudi Arabia, Israel, or both. Instead of making counter-productive requests of its allies, the Biden administration should shore up consensus and military and economic ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia.",https://spectator.org/biden-fascists-speech-marines/,2022-07-13
Biden Scandal Widens: Were Files Used to Write His Book? - The American Spectator,"The other week, I had the opportunity to attend a CPAC event at former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home.

And what was instantly apparent?

My name not only appeared on a guest list, carefully checked by a flesh-and-blood person at the entrance. Even before getting off the bus that transported attendees to Mar-a-Lago from our hotel, I and everyone else at this event had to present a valid driver’s license, military ID, or U.S. passport, showing it a second time at the Mar-a-Lago entrance to the person with the list. The place was afloat with Secret Service agents.

And, obviously, this was the personal residence of a former president, not a sitting president.

My recent experience comes to mind as the news has come out that the sitting president — Joe Biden — had been keeping classified files in the garage and library of his Wilmington, Delaware, home as well as in his office at the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Biden Center.

Fox News reports this:

House Republicans are requesting two years of visitor logs from President Biden’s home in Wilmington, Delaware, after classified documents from his time as vice president were discovered there. “Given the serious national security implications, the White House must provide the Wilmington residence’s visitor log,” House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., wrote in a Sunday letter to White House chief of staff Ron Klain. “As Chief of Staff, you are head of the Executive Office of the President and bear responsibility to be transparent with the American people on these important issues related to the White House’s handling of this matter.” Comer went on to argue that in order to fully address the situation, it is necessary to know who may have been privy to the confidential information.

And what was the response from the Biden White House? NBC reported this:

The White House and the Secret Service said Monday they do not maintain visitor logs for President Joe Biden’s personal home in Wilmington, Delaware, a day after a top House Republican called for their release. “Like every President across decades of modern history, his personal residence is personal,” White House counsel’s office spokesman Ian Sams said in a statement.

Note that line? This one: “Like every President across decades of modern history, his personal residence is personal.”

Really? As I can personally attest, former President Trump’s personal residence at Mar-a-Lago does in fact keep a record of who comes into the place. My name was clearly on a guest list, and I personally had to produce ID to get in — twice. Which, of course, creates a record. A visitor log.

In other words? In other words, the Biden White House was, up until yesterday when the Secret Service stepped forward to finally reveal the truth, trying to sell the American people a bill of goods. The Biden personal residence — with classified documents in both the garage and library — was clearly allowing who-knows-what-kind-of-people to come into the place.

And do what?

Who touched the documents before all of this uproar began? How long have the documents been there? Did son Hunter Biden use any of these documents in his various foreign-influence peddling ventures in Ukraine, China, or elsewhere?

And here’s one more problem.

In 2017, Joe Biden wrote and published a book. Entitled Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose, the book details his son Beau’s losing battle with cancer — and meticulously records what then–Vice President Biden was doing to stay busy during this period.

Here’s the kicker.

The flyleaf of the book says this of Biden’s schedule in 2015:

As vice president, Biden traveled more than a hundred thousand miles that year, across the world, dealing with crises in Ukraine, Central America, and Iraq. When a call came from New York, or Capitol Hill, or Kyiv, or Baghdad—“Joe, I need your help”—he responded.

Chapter five of the book is titled “Keeping Busy.” The chapter is littered with Biden’s references to the specifics of how he went out of his way to stay busy while simultaneously dealing with his son’s failing health.

Among those specifics:

Biden climbed on Air Force Two and flew:

…east over the Atlantic Ocean, into the rising sun, and headed for serious and consequential business.

That included meeting the king of Jordan and visiting the United Arab Emirates and the Persian Gulf. There was a state dinner in China, with trips to Egypt, Kenya, Tanzania, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and the demilitarized zone dividing North Korea from South Korea.

Then there was his “first trip to Moscow as vice president” in 2011, and his time in Helsinki, Finland.

Biden details a meeting with then–Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his “temporary placeholder” in the Russian presidency, Dmitry Medvedev. Biden gets into specifics of the meeting, such as saying:

I was in Moscow to make the case that Russia had no reason to fear the recent deployment of launchers for the missile defense shield in Europe, which was designed to intercept attacks from Iran.

And on Biden goes with more details about this meeting. The meeting, he says:

…went on for hours and ranged through other points of contention.

On and on he goes, detailing:

…meetings scheduled with the highest-ranking leaders of the European Union and a one-on-one with the prime minister of Belgium the next day. But that was just the warm-up for the critical business at the Munich Security Conference that weekend.

Next are detailed descriptions of his work with Ukraine:

I was the point man for our administration on the crisis, which was exactly where I wanted to be.

The obvious question? Was all this recalled from memory? Really? Or could it have come from the classified files in his possession at the Penn Biden Center, his garage, or his library in Wilmington?

And last but not least, as is typical with book authors, the last section of the book has an “Acknowledgments” closing. In which all manner of people, including his family, are thanked. He writes:

There were a number of people I counted on to help me with recall, with the reconstruction chronologies, and with encouragement.

Were any of those people using these Biden documents to help Biden with the “recall, with reconstruction chronologies”? And did they have security clearances?

In short, Joe Biden’s book opens the door to serious questions about all those classified documents found in his possession at the Penn Biden Center, his home library — and, yes, his garage.

One suspects the newly installed Republicans on the House Oversight Committee will be asking questions. Questions like: Who had access to these documents? Did those who have access have security clearances? Were these classified documents used to write Biden’s book? Were they used to further Hunter’s business dealings?

Which is doubtless why the Biden White House, panicked over the discovery of all these classified documents, has launched attacks on the newly appointed committee members.

Imagine that.

Nothing to see here, folks. Just move along.

Right.

And suddenly? All the panicky, adamant denials of record keeping at the Biden private locations created such a backlash furor that Breitbart is now headlining this:

Report: Secret Service to Disclose Visitor Records from Biden’s Residence

Which is to say that yet again the Biden White House has been deliberately deceptive with the American people. And they’ve been found out.

Shocking.

Not.

"Biden Scares America, Media Sweats Elon Musk - The American Spectator","It is now impossible to ignore our president’s cognitive decline. Public opinion polls indicate that most voters doubt his mental capacity to carry out his duties, and his public effusions confirm the accuracy of that assessment. Since his bizarre State of the Union address, Biden’s utterances have become less and less lucid and his few coherent statements are terrifying. He has called for regime change in a country with a huge nuclear arsenal and denounced its president as a war criminal. Yet the corporate media are generally sanguine about Biden’s verbal incontinence. Indeed, they have applauded it.

So, what would frighten the Fourth Estate? Elon Musk on Twitter’s board of directors.

Musk was invited to join the Twitter board after he bought a 9.2 percent stake in the company, making him its largest shareholder. He was initially welcomed by co-founder Jack Dorsey and CEO Parag Agrawal, but this did not allay media fears. At NBC’s “Think,” Kara Alaimo fretted, “As we head into another election cycle and are still dealing with Covid, his record of spreading misinformation on the social media platform is worrisome.” At the Washington Post, Ellen K. Pao revealed the actual issue in a column titled, “Elon Musk’s vision of ‘free speech’ will be bad for Twitter.” Take note that she invariably encloses free speech in scare quotes.

Musk calls himself a “free-speech absolutist,” but like many “free speech” advocates, he willfully ignores that private companies are free to establish some limits … As the company’s largest shareholder, Musk will no doubt have outsize influence, and his clout will be magnified by the board seat. He can bend the company toward his preferences, removing reasonable policies on hateful speech … Musk’s appointment to Twitter’s board shows that we need regulation of social-media platforms to prevent rich people from controlling our channels of communication.

As Pao knows perfectly well, rich people already control our channels of communication and Twitter’s violation of its own “reasonable policies” was a major factor in Musk’s decision to buy such a large amount of the company’s stock. Prior to announcing that he would join its board, Musk polled Twitter’s users about this very issue. He tweeted, “Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?” This elicited 2,035,924 responses, and 70.4 percent answered, “No.” And Pao certainly knows that, in 2020, Twitter censored damaging news about Hunter Biden’s infamous laptop.

Twitter gave us the mushroom treatment. A survey conducted by the Media Research Center in 7 swing states found that, had they known about scandals suppressed by Twitter, enough Biden voters would have withheld their support to change the outcome of the 2020 election. Pursuant to this and other such revelations, Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) and her colleagues in the House Election Integrity Caucus sent a letter to Twitter’s CEO last week posing questions about the platform’s censorship of the Hunter Biden laptop story. The letter expressly asks if Twitter censorship was carried out in coordination with the Biden presidential campaign.

Meanwhile, Biden’s decline steepens. He continues to make reckless statements about Putin while remaining in denial about the damage resulting from his own domestic policies. He insists that Putin is to blame for U.S. inflation and skyrocketing gasoline prices. But the price of gas was rising well before Russia invaded Ukraine, and a new study from the Federal Reserve suggests that Biden’s $1.9 Trillion “American Rescue Plan” caused the inflation spike. On top of all this, the Biden administration proposes a revision to our border policy so crazy that it has resulted in bipartisan opposition in both houses of Congress. As Newsweek reports:

Congressman Henry Cuellar signed onto legislation aimed at preventing the Biden administration from lifting Title 42 immigration limits … He joins other Democrats in backing the legislation. Representatives Tom O’Halleran of Arizona, Jared Golden of Maine, Stephanie Murphy of Florida, Chris Pappas of New Hampshire and Greg Stanton of Arizona … Meanwhile, Senators Krysten Sinema and Mark Kelly of Arizona, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana have signed onto similar legislation in Congress’ upper chamber.

According to a recent Morning Consult/Politico survey, a majority of the voters agree with these lawmakers. The poll found that the proposal to eliminate Title 42, which allows immediate expulsion of illegal immigrants pursuant to their potential to spread COVID-19, is the least popular Biden initiative to date: “A majority of registered voters (56%) oppose the decision to remove the border controls implemented by the Trump administration, the largest backlash against a Biden administration policy among dozens tracked by Morning Consult since January 2021.” The voters clearly knew from the start that the proposal was nuts.

Still, for the corporate media, neither Biden’s infirmities nor his irrational policy positions were as scary as Elon Musk sitting on Twitter’s board. Musk has, after all, uttered such heretical remarks as this: “Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy.” This outraged Twitter’s staff. The Washington Post reported, “Employees raged on internal message boards, expressing fears Musk will sabotage their culture and make it hard to do their jobs.” Late Sunday night CEO Parag Agrawal announced, “Elon has decided not to join our board.”

In closing, here’s something to consider: When the Russians invaded Ukraine, they initiated a cyberattack that took down internet access for most of the country. While Biden and his advisers were discussing the administration’s public response, Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov asked Elon Musk to use his Starlink network to restore connectivity for the besieged country. Just over 10 hours later, Musk tweeted: @FedorovMykhailo “Starlink service is now active in Ukraine.” Compare that to the dilatory support and mixed messages Ukraine has been getting from Biden. Perhaps these two should switch jobs. Just a thought.",https://spectator.org/biden-fertilizer-yogi-love/,2022-04-11
"Biden Should Not Run Again. Trump, Too - The American Spectator","Former President Donald Trump did not have a good night Tuesday.

As President Joe Biden noted during a Wednesday press briefing, “While the press and pundits are predicting a giant red wave, it didn’t happen.”

The fact that Democrats outperformed the usual midterm losses apparently gave him hope, because he also told the press corps, “our intention is to run again.”

Biden also said he would not decide until he discussed another presidential run with his family. He’ll probably let his decision be known after the holidays. He’s in “no hurry,” he added.

During the family confab, one would hope that family members bring up the president’s age. Biden turns 80 this month.

Later Biden said that he is not concerned about an Edison Research exit poll done for CNN and other networks that shows more than two-thirds of recent voters think Biden should not run in 2024. Thus, Biden revealed that he’s not only too old to run for reelection but also out of touch to the public’s view on a suitable age for his job. He’s in age-is-just-a-number denial even as he occupies the most challenging job in the world. (READ MORE: Maybe America Hasn’t Suffered Enough)

By the way, Biden’s approval rating is 42.1 percent according to the RealClearPolitics polling average; 54.6 percent disapprove of his job performance.

The tone-deaf Biden also said he would make sure that Trump, who is 76, would not win the White House in 2024.

Oddly, Biden was lifting up Trump just as the former president’s endorsement no longer is a must-have for GOP candidates.

The Big Lie about Trump winning in 2020 proved to be toxic for candidates like gubernatorial wannabes Doug Mastriano of Pennsylvania and Tudor Dixon of Michigan, as well as Senate hopeful Mehmet Oz of Pennsylvania and New Hampshire Senate candidate Don Bolduc.

The days of conservative hopefuls going hat in hand to Mar-a-Lago to beg for Trump’s support are dwindling.

Biden dodged a question as to whether he’d rather run against Trump or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Biden said it would be fun seeing the two Republicans challenge each other.

DeSantis enjoyed his own victory lap after beating Democrat Charlie Crist, a former Florida governor, by nearly 20 points. DeSantis has come a long way since 2018 when he won by less than half a point against scandal-plagued Democrat Andrew Gillum.

DeSantis is popular because he opened up the Sunshine State in the heat of widespread COVID closures — a decision he attributed to choosing “facts over fear.” Many Republicans look to the governor not just as a good candidate to turn the page on the Trump years but also as a savvy choice for the GOP in the future. He’s Trump, but younger and with discipline. His victory speech lasted less than nine minutes.

And as DeSantis, 44, relished his win, his supporters chanted words that should give Biden and Trump pause. Their chant: “Two more years.”

Biden Sticker Shock - The American Spectator,"It all reminds me of July 1, 1987 when President Ronald Reagan nominated Judge Robert Bork for an opening on the Supreme Court. He had it made in the shade, said my complacent conservative friends. The result was brutal. But we do not have to look back 32 years to see how unruly the leftwing mob can be. Recall the recent fate of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Only his courage and unscotchable determinate saved him. The simple fact is that the conservatives are often slow on the draw against the American left. Only the Wall Street Journal and the intrepid New York Sun have come out swinging for Moore. It is time for the conservatives to rally around him. He can probably win with the President on his side. He apparently has the votes. Yet the coming battle would be a lot less bloody if the conservative movement were to take the field on Moore’s behalf — and make it clear that from now on they are going to wage war for the President’s nominees.

Biden’s Taiwan Policy: Confusion - The American Spectator,"The world’s headlines say it all: “Biden’s Taiwan vow creates confusion not clarity — and raises China tensions” (the Guardian); “Biden’s new stance of strategic confusion on Taiwan” (CNN), “When will Biden stop sowing confusion?” (the Telegraph); “Confused about President Biden’s policies? You’re not alone” (the Hill); “Biden’s Taiwan defense vow could cause missteps” (South China Morning Post).

A day after President Biden said that the United States would militarily defend Taiwan from a Chinese invasion, Biden says that American policy remains “strategic ambiguity.” As a senator and vice president, Biden was known to be flippant with his words, which, when he was in those offices, caused no real harm to the country. It’s different, however, when you are flippant and careless with words as president. I have lost count of the number of times administrative spokespersons have had to “walk back” the president’s statements. It is embarrassing politically and dangerous strategically.

Throughout history, foreign policy observers and theorists have framed the overall approaches of American presidents to global policy as doctrines. George Kennan called Truman’s approach “containment.” American nuclear policy under President Eisenhower was called “massive retaliation.” John Kennedy’s revision of that policy was known as “mutual assured destruction.” As the United States retrenched after Vietnam and relied more on regional allies, that policy came to be known as the “Nixon Doctrine.” The 1980s-era policy of undermining Soviet rule in Central America and elsewhere was called the “Reagan Doctrine.” George W. Bush’s approach to the global war on terror became known as “preemption.” And now Joe Biden’s approach to the struggle for power in the Indo-Pacific and elsewhere can be called “confusion.” (READ MORE from Francis P. Sempa: Biden Rhetorically Comes to the Defense of Taiwan But Actions Speak Louder Than Words)

Biden’s confusion doctrine has been evident in his Ukraine policy. To this day, it is unclear whether the United States seeks victory for Ukraine, a negotiated resolution to the conflict, or regime change in Russia, complete with war crimes trials. The administration has said all three at different times. Confusion also marked our disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. It is also unclear whether this administration considers China’s geopolitical challenge, Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, “domestic terrorists” (i.e., Trump supporters), or “climate change” as the greatest security threat we face. The administration says it seeks “energy security,” but it closes fossil fuel pipelines and refuses to permit drilling in energy-rich Alaskan lands, making the U.S. more dependent on energy supplies from foreign sources.

And nowhere is the policy of confusion more evident — and more dangerous — than in the South China Sea. Biden’s statements that we will militarily defend Taiwan but also maintain an approach of “strategic ambiguity” can lead to deadly miscalculations by Chinese leaders, Taipei politicians, and our regional allies.

Let’s hope that the world’s headlines do not soon speak of “Great Power War.” That, unfortunately, is where the confusion doctrine is taking us.",https://spectator.org/biden-hail-mary-fascist-speech/,2022-05-25
Red States Move to Block Biden From Taking Away Kids’ Lunch Money - The American Spectator,"Last month, 22 attorneys general from GOP-led states sued the Department of Agriculture for threatening to withhold critical school lunch funding for districts that do not adhere to the new discrimination prohibitions under Title IX. The Biden administration’s reinterpretation of “sex” within Title IX, based on the Supreme Court’s 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, now includes “gender identity and sexual orientation.” The lawsuit is led by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert H Slatery III and alleges that the guidelines outlined by the USDA exceed Bostock‘s intent.

On May 5, the USDA issued a directive to its Food and Nutrition Service agency stating that “in light of Bostock, FNS has evaluated the statutes it enforces and determined that discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation can constitute prohibited sex discrimination under Title IX and the Food and Nutrition Act.” Allegations of noncompliance can be investigated and potentially referred to the Department of Justice. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service division administers funding for several programs, including the National School Lunch Program and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

Incidentally, the Biden administration’s decision to lean heavily on children to advance its progressive agenda mirrors the Democrats’ behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in America’s youth paying the steepest price for prolonged restrictions.

The National School Lunch Program provides 20-30 million students with a daily low-cost or free lunch. It is the second-largest U.S. food and nutrition assistance program, operating in approximately 100,000 public and private schools. Households at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty line are eligible for a free lunch. The Biden administration’s decision to tie nutrition-related funding for our nation’s most vulnerable citizens to its dubious interpretation of Title IX represents its most shameless effort in enacting radical gender ideology.

According to USDA regulations, schools that want to keep federal lunch money must permit biological males to utilize girls’ locker rooms and bathrooms. Those that refuse to allow biological males to participate in an all-girls sports team or after-school club would also violate USDA guidelines.

Moreover, schools and districts that refrain from punishing students who use biologically correct pronouns could be in danger of a Title IX sexual harassment investigation. In a Title IX case last spring, officials charged three eighth graders in a Wisconsin school district with “mispronouning” a classmate. The Kiel Middle School students used “her” instead of “they” when referring to another student and soon found themselves the center of a “sexual harassment” case. While the charges were eventually dropped, the district defended its original position. It stated that administrators and staff were “simply carrying out the functions of their job as set out in District policy.”

Withholding Food and Nutrition Service dollars for schools that refuse to state in their rulebook that prejudice based “on gender identity and sexual orientation is prohibited” will fill millions of children with feelings of uncertainty and anxiety over the source of their next meal. Academically and socially, American children are readjusting to school life following extended closures due to COVID-19. Moreover, with rising inflation, families are now struggling to afford the necessities required to run a household. Last year, almost 8 million children relied on the National School Lunch Program. For some children, a midday school meal represents their sole source of nutrition. According to USDA statistics, almost 12 million children experience food insecurity, defined as a lack of consistent access to enough food. Studies reveal that food insecure children had “odds of fair or poor health” almost twice as great as food secure children. Mental health problems in food insecure mothers and their children were also more prevalent than in households where food was readily available.

It bears mentioning that those most affected by the USDA’s enforcement of Biden’s Title IX regulations are black and Hispanic youth, whose rates of food insecurity in 2020 were 21.7 percent and 17.2 percent, respectively. Both figures reflect a higher degree of food scarcity than the 10.5 percent national average. A piece in the New York Post also highlighted the thousands of military families, numbering close to 30 percent of “troops in the most junior enlisted ranks,” that face food insecurity. Democrats’ decision to punish underprivileged communities and Blue Star families whose schools fail to embrace a progressive gender doctrine proves the party has abandoned any semblance of pragmatic governance.

Liberal approaches to COVID-19 are today reflected in our children’s academic and emotional decay. Months later, mandating that schools champion an extreme gender pedagogy or risk losing federal lunch funding further emphasizes that the Biden administration is forfeiting the health of America’s youth to fuel its ideologically driven objectives.

Biden Targets The American Spectator in Conservative Blacklisting - The American Spectator,"Well, of course.

Now comes the news that the Biden administration is using taxpayer dollars to blacklist, defund, and silence The American Spectator and other conservative media outlets. U.S. taxpayer dollars are being used to fund a leftist British censorship group calling itself the Global Disinformation Index.

The news of all this first exploded in a series written by the Washington Examiner and reporter Gabe Kaminsky.

The first Examiner blockbuster was headlined as follows:

Disinformation Inc: Meet the groups hauling in cash to secretly blacklist conservative news

The Examiner reported:

EXCLUSIVE — Well-funded “disinformation” tracking groups are part of a stealth operation blacklisting and trying to defund conservative media, likely costing the news companies large sums in advertising dollars, a Washington Examiner investigation found. Major ad companies are increasingly seeking guidance from purportedly “nonpartisan” groups claiming to be detecting and fighting online “disinformation.” These same “disinformation” monitors are compiling secret website blacklists and feeding them to ad companies, with the aim of defunding and shutting down disfavored speech, according to sources familiar with the situation, public memos, and emails obtained by the Washington Examiner.

The New York Post reports this, bold print for emphasis supplied:

The “Global Disinformation Index,” or GDI, is a British organization with a pair of US nonprofit affiliates. It receives hundreds of thousands of dollars from the State Department’s Global Engagement Center and the taxpayer-funded National Endowment for Democracy.

The British “‘Global Disinformation Index,’ or GDI,” self-describes as follows:

The Global Disinformation Index (GDI) is a nonprofit organisation that operates on the three principles of neutrality, independence and transparency. Our vision is a world free of disinformation and its harms, which undermine the trusted information ecosystems that are the foundation of democratic processes. GDI provides disinformation risk ratings of the world’s news and information sources, with a mission to catalyse industry and government to defund disinformation.

Translation? The GDI has set itself up as a far-left King of Censorship. Its targets: conservative media outlets in the United States. At the same time, it protects America’s left-wing publications, from NPR to the New York Times to the Washington Post and more.

The Washington Examiner and its ace reporter Kaminsky have serious scoop with this series revealing the blacklisting of conservative media outlets by the Global Disinformation Index.

What, exactly, are the State Department’s Global Engagement Center and the National Endowment for Democracy, both of which are shipping funding dollars to the blacklisting GDI?

The State Department website describes this part of the U.S. taxpayer–funded bureaucracy this way:

Mission: To direct, lead, synchronize, integrate, and coordinate U.S. Federal Government efforts to recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining or influencing the policies, security, or stability of the United States, its allies, and partner nations. Vision: To be a data-driven body leading U.S. interagency efforts in proactively addressing foreign adversaries’ attempts to undermine U.S. interests using disinformation and propaganda.

And the National Endowment for Democracy? The NED self-describes this way:

The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) is an independent, nonprofit foundation dedicated to the growth and strengthening of democratic institutions around the world. Each year, NED makes more than 2,000 grants to support the projects of non-governmental groups abroad who are working for democratic goals in more than 100 countries.

A personal note: The National Endowment for Democracy was established during President Ronald Reagan’s White House tenure. As a former associate political director for the Reagan White House, I can only say he would be embarrassed, not to mention angered, to see what the inheritors of this once idealistic vision have turned the endowment into. One of the president’s favorite publications back in the day was The American Spectator, and our founder, R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr., was a decided friend. There is no way in the world that Ronald Reagan would ever, ever go along with silencing this publication — or any other.

So. Again. The Biden State Department, under the leadership of Biden-appointed Secretary of State Antony Blinken, proclaims that the vision for the State Department’s Global Engagement Center is to be “proactively addressing foreign adversaries’ attempts to undermine U.S. interests using disinformation and propaganda.”

And the National Endowment for Democracy is about “working for democratic goals in more than 100 countries.”

Uh-huh. Last I checked, conservative media and The American Spectator are not “foreign adversaries” attempting to “undermine U.S. interests using disinformation and propaganda.”

And publishing a magazine devoted to free speech is exactly “working for democratic goals.”

To accomplish all this “vision” of Biden’s State Department and the NED, the two are targeting The American Spectator to silence it by putting it out of business — along with drawing a bull’s-eye on all the other conservative media sites listed by the GDI. But of course!

On Monday of this week, the Washington Examiner reported this, bold print for emphasis supplied:

But GDI, which did not reply to several requests for its exclusion list, discloses in reports which outlets it identifies as the “riskiest” and “worst” offenders for peddling disinformation. These 10, which all skew to the right, are the American Spectator, Newsmax, the Federalist, the American Conservative, One America News, the Blaze, the Daily Wire, RealClearPolitics, Reason, and the New York Post.

Here, for reference, is the official GDI description of The American Spectator:

Spectator.org (Risk level: Maximum) In content published by The American Spectator, bias, sensationalism, and divisive and targeting language were prevalent, while fact-based ledes and well-measured headlines were rare. On the contrary, most of the assessed articles on this domain negatively targeted a group or individual in their title or opening sentences. Frequent hyperbole and generalizations further supported the establishment of adversarial narratives. The site also provides little transparency around its operations, in particular its policies on sources and attribution and its editorial guidelines.

Right. What leftist propaganda.

As can be seen above, the Examiner links to the original GDI site. Reading the original GDI source reveals a chart that lists 10 so-called “Least risky sites” side by side with another 10 labeled “Riskiest sites,” the latter being the 10 sites — including The American Spectator — mentioned above.

And the “Least risky sites” when it comes to spewing disinformation and propaganda? Who are they? Try not to laugh. In the order the DGI lists them, they are as follows:

NPR AP News The New York Times ProPublica Insider USA Today The Washington Post BuzzFeed News Wall Street Journal HuffPost

Let’s take just one of DGI’s “Least risky sites” — the New York Times. Here’s a recent headline about the Times from, yes, the conservative and decidedly reputable Breitbart News:

Exclusive: New York Times Waited More than 500 Days Before Reporting It Authenticated Hunter Biden Laptop Emails

Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle reported this:

The New York Times, self-proclaimed “paper of record,” waited more than 500 days before finally reporting it had authenticated critical emails from now-President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden’s infamous laptop. The Times allowed the false narrative that the Hunter Biden laptop was somehow “Russian disinformation” to permeate the public debate for over a year when it had obtained evidence to the contrary, according to emails obtained exclusively by Breitbart News.

And reporting like this from the Times puts it on the GDI “Least risky” list?

Of course it does. The Left sticks together.

Make no mistake. Whether these are leftists running the Global Disinformation Index in Britain with the help of American tax dollars sent by the Biden administration, or whether they are leftist bureaucrats in Biden’s State Department, the objective first, last, and always is to shut down conservative media.

And Joe Biden’s State Department has made it crystal clear that The American Spectator is in their sights.

The 10 Plagues of Biden the Zhlub - The American Spectator,"The Zelensky reign in Ukraine depends mainly on the plane. The MiG-29.

The Rabbis tell of a king who dispatched his servant to buy him a fish for dinner. The servant returned with a rotten fish, a scale too foul to describe. As the king began choking after his first bite, he proffered the servant a choice of how to be punished:

Pay a steep monetary fine. Submit to 30 lashes on your back. Eat the fish yourself.

The servant was destitute and had limited pain tolerance, so he decided to eat the fish. After consuming half of it, he became so repulsed that he had to stop while vomiting uncontrollably. Accordingly, he submitted to whippings. After the 20th lashing, however, he could not bear any more whippings. Therefore, despite his penury, he caved and paid the full fine. Yet, along the way, the poor guy ended up sustaining whippings and eating half a fish he did not ultimately need to eat.

The war in Ukraine ends one of two ways. Either Ukraine emerges free and sovereign, albeit sworn never to join nor even to apply for NATO. Or Putin eventually invades other former USSR entities to reattach them to Russia, too, after Ukraine. And don’t think for a moment that he is not also contemplating Poland, Hungary, and the Czechs. Polls won’t save the Poles. And he is hungry to reconstitute the Soviet empire.

Ukraine right now wants to fight. They have proven to be fierce and courageous, and also effective. So far, they have killed around 10,000 Russian soldiers, which means probably close to 40,000 Russian casualties. That is one fifth of Russia’s 200,000-man fighting force — now out of business. Seven Russian generals have been killed. A Russian warship has been destroyed. The Ukrainians are skilled and motivated. They need only the weaponry to reduce Putin’s domination of the sky. Towards that end, they need and await S-300 missile defenses, “Switchblade” drones, and those darned MiG-29s.

MiG-29s are yesterday’s weapon. Poland has several left over and would love to give them to Zelensky, while America would replace and update those old aircraft for Warsaw. The GOP is in favor. The Democrats are in favor. No one is asking for American troops. No one is asking for Will Smith to deliver the MiGs. This transfer of old aircraft does not entail or imply America or NATO establishing a “No-Fly Zone” (NFZ). Establishing an NFZ would be too perilous to undertake for now. It would lead inexorably to America and other NATO forces shooting down Russian aircraft — a certain opening to World War III.

Once the Ukrainians get those MiG-29s, they will fly them to deter and obstruct Russia in and from the sky. Yes, their fighter craft will be out-maneuvered. Ukraine’s fighter pilots will not match their enemies’ training and skills. Yet the Ukrainians will come with something else: motivation and determination to survive. By contrast, Russia now is looking to hire mercenaries.

Although the parallels are hardly identical, this is not unlike the scenario that saw Israel rise to independence in 1948 — and to live. Seven murderous invading Arab Muslim armies attacked with an announced intent to crush the nascent Israel and to drive their millions of Jews into the Mediterranean Sea to their deaths. Harry Truman — much more hostile to Israel than liberal Democrat history falsely presents — imposed a complete ban on supplying the Jews with weapons to protect themselves or to fight off the invaders. These quasi-emaciated Holocaust survivors were at great strategic disadvantage. They lacked the basic armaments they desperately needed.

Here is what happened: Non-Jews in New York City and Central Jersey, who dominated the corrupt dockworkers’ unions along the Hudson River — many linked deeply to the Italian Mob — illegally ran guns to Israel out of Jersey City. Jewish and Italian mobs had been working closely together for decades during Prohibition. Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano crafted a brotherhood: “You wash my back, I wash your back, and we whack any wise guy who got a problem with that.” Even “Everyday Italians” in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, and in Hudson County, New Jersey, worked together with Jewish “street toughs” beating up wannabe Nazi Bundists at public rallies in local parks.

Likewise, Irish Catholic New Yorkers, like Paul O’Dwyer, who eventually rose to become president of the city council of New York City and who was reared to despise the British deeply, also ran guns to Israel. Irish Catholics were especially motivated to drive out British imperialistic occupation wherever possible. Jewish teenagers furtively would come to the docks after midnight to run guns to Israel. They did not tell their parents where they were. Joseph Stalin, seeing America equivocate on Israel’s survival, got the interesting idea that perhaps Israel would ally with the Soviet Union, so the Communist-dominated Czechoslovakia sent Israel weapons. As a result, the Jews got some weapons, and they stood up successfully against those seven Arab Muslim countries.

Today that is the call of the hour for Ukraine — and they can win. So many of them have died in vain for lack of arms to defend. They do not ask for our boys, nor for NATO intervention, nor for major offensive weapons systems. Just those old, worn-down MiG-29s. Only the Zhlub in the White House stands in the way. The Zhlub who spent the week walking back misstatements ranging from whether we would be sending our boys into Ukraine, whether we would respond to Russian chemical weapons “in kind,” whether we aim for regime change within Russia, and whether sanctions ever are meant to deter. (And did the Zhlub just inadvertently disclose that we are training Ukrainian armed forces now stationed in Poland?) (READ MORE: To Biden’s Handlers: Shut Him Up, and Shut Him Down)

Joe Biden is more than a Zhlub; he is a veritable plague. It took 10 plagues to liberate the Biblical Jews from Egypt at Passover season. Biden is not exactly blood, frogs, lice, mixed animals, pestilence, boils, hailstones mixed with fire, locusts, darkness, and death of the firstborn. Instead, redefining the term “Hail to the Chief,” he has continued to plague:

Our Mexico border (illegal immigration, undoing much of Trump’s successful efforts to secure the border, the impending end of Title 42, one million “encounters” in six months) Safety from historically surging crime in our inner cities (prompted by Democrats like the Squad and the Soros DAs who advocate revolving doors of jail, no bail, no charging felonies, defunding police) Our public schools (Critical Race Theory disseminated and inculcated in our schools; his DOJ comparing concerned parents with “domestic terrorists”; promoting same-sex and transgender curricula for children, the perverse sickness now extended to Disney Florida) Our unique world leadership in oil-and-gas energy (fall from energy independence, negating Keystone XL pipeline, adding obstructive regulations, closing off Alaska’s ANWR region to exploration, raiding the emergency oil stocks of the National Petroleum Reserve) Foreign affairs (Afghanistan evacuation, Iran deal, Russia–Ukraine, our allies will not even take his phone calls) Our economy (unprecedented runaway inflation, record debt, gas at $7 a gallon; exploding food prices; pending mass grain shortages worldwide as Russia and Ukraine, who supply some 30 percent of the world’s wheat and the fertilizer so critical to farming, decline and partly collapse agriculturally under the impact of the war and anti-Russia sanctions) Supply chains (high gas prices, government interference and regulations) High appointments of incompetents (e.g., Cackling Kamala) and Unqualifieds (e.g., Ketanji — the deeply dishonest, lying non-biologist) Gaffes, gaffes, and more gaffes (no surprises — we all knew it going in: his history of racist comments, the Neil Kinnock biography plagiarism, and so much more) Hunter Biden (a plague of the firstborn, although Beau came first)

That is where it stands. The toxic elements of AOC’s “Green New Deal” and Pelosi’s all-purpose leftist agenda have contributed to the mess. We have to learn how to say “Win!” — regardless of whether that word appears on Biden’s new set of “press conference flash cards.” Sooner or later, Ukraine will get the MiG-29s. They will win — or Putin will win. Only Biden will get a “participation trophy.” We are stuck with the Zhlub for 31 more months until November 2024 and two more beyond that until January 21, 2025. Until then, we will have to keep absorbing that fish.

Biden’s Title IX Rules Revision Will Cause More College Chaos - The American Spectator,"We all know how the Biden administration, on Day One, reversed two of the most successful Trump initiatives — energy independence and border control — turning with executive orders both areas into the twin disasters that have become part of our daily lives.

In June, the administration laid out new rules for Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 that roll back the common-sense advances of the Trump years, will cloud the waters on campus sexual-harassment litigation, and are guaranteed to throw even more chaos into the already tumultuous transgender arena.

As for the first piece in this trifecta, the sexual harassment element, the Left is hailing the new regs as the freeing of sexual abuse victims and a much-needed antidote to Trump-era rules. Trump had reversed the Obama administration’s harassment adjudication practices that denied due process and free speech rights to those accused of sexual harassment — practices that created, as called by one commentator, “kangaroo courts in which respondents had limited access to evidence and no right to cross-examination, hearings, or legal counsel” — and allowed a single school bureaucrat to serve as investigator, prosecutor, jury, and judge in a sexual abuse case. The Trump Department of Education had, in 2020, returned many due process rights to the accused, including hearings, legal representation, cross-examination, full access to evidence, and appeals.

The proposed new rules eliminate the live hearing and cross-examination requirements, leaving them to the discretion of the school. They also undo Trump’s prohibition of the “single investigator model,” a system that permits a lone bureaucrat to investigate a sexual harassment case and also serve as judge and jury.

Also proposed is a lessening of the burden-of-proof requirements necessary for conviction of discrimination or abuse. Under the Trump rules, a complaint, to be successful, had to reach a clear-and-convincing-evidence standard, similar to that used in business cases, whereas Biden intends to loosen that standard to a “preponderance of the evidence” level — that is, a determination that the discrimination occurred “more likely than not.” This new standard, says one jurist, sympathetic to the new regs, enables the school bureaucrat “to weigh all available evidence, including the credibility of witnesses, and determine what is likely to have happened without extrinsic corroborating evidence that is oftentimes lacking.”

All in all, the Trump policies, according to victim advocacy groups, discouraged survivors from filing harassment and abuse charges. The Department of Education claimed these policies had “weakened protections for survivors of sexual assault and diminished the promise of an education free from discrimination.” Said Sarah Warbelow, the Human Rights Campaign’s legal director, “The proposed rule change gets at the heart of what Title IX is supposed to do — protect students from sexual assault, sexual harassment and discrimination while on campus.”

So, it’s back to the Obama-era regs. Whether they will ramp up the already litigious atmosphere of the college dating scene remains to be seen. According to Paul du Quenoy, writing in Newsweek, during the Obama years, 73 percent of the Title IX–related lawsuits filed in federal courts included defamation claims against complainants: “Many also brought claims against Title IX officials, who are often exposed as biased against male students.”

Another study showed that, between 2011 and 2019, over 500 lawsuits were filed by students alleging they were accused wrongly of sexual misconduct. Writes Sarah Perry of the Heritage Foundation, “Federal and state courts ruled against universities in 151 of 298 decisions that were issued during the same time interval, having found the lack of due process in the campus tribunal hearings to have rendered them fundamentally unfair.”

The Trump philosophy regarding discrimination, following Supreme Court thought in the late 20th century, held that schools needed to take action against egregious, over-the-top sexual misconduct. This is how the Trump administration understood the law — identifying and then punishing the “bad apples.”

The new regs, however, broaden that sensitivity exponentially. Explains Shep Melnick:

The 2022 proposal, in contrast, endorses what the Obama administration called a “new paradigm” on sexual harassment, one far removed from the Supreme Court’s interpretation of Title IX. According to this approach, the problem is not a few bad apples but rather a “rape culture,” especially on college campuses. The Biden administration’s focus is changing that culture, as the President frequently emphasizes.

The other element to the new rules is the sexual-orientation and transgender piece. The new regs expand discrimination on the basis of what the original 1972 law called “sex” to include “sex stereotypes, sex-related characteristics (including intersex traits), pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.”

What that means, according to Perry, is that “any K–12 school or institution of higher education that receives federal funding would have to open its bathrooms, locker rooms, housing accommodations, sports teams, and any other sex-separated educational program or offering to the opposite sex, if those individuals simply claim to be female.”

Pushback from red states has been extensive. When the Education Department issued a heads-up in June 2021 that it would be including sexual orientation and gender identity in its definition of “sex,” 20 states bonded together to seek injunctive relief against the department’s interpretation. Bathroom laws and statutes limiting women’s sports to biological females have been passed in many states as well, an occurrence that portends myriad legal battles before any new Title IX rules can go into effect.

While the transgender sporting scene will doubtlessly be affected by the new rules, the Education Department, ironically, deigned not to include specific regulations about the hottest of hot buttons in today’s gender wars, biological males playing women’s sports, instead electing to issue a separate proposal at a later time.

The proposed regulations will now enter a lengthy review process, in which comments from concerned parties will be considered before the rules are implemented.

Whatever the final guidelines be, if they pass legal muster, Title IX will likely ping-pong back to more sane rules in 2024, if Biden is shown the stairway to his basement by a Republican challenger. The rules went from Obama to Trump to Biden, from liberal to conservative back to liberal again. Apart from the unlikely prospect that Congress gets its act together and rewrites Title IX in the meantime, it’ll be conservatives’ turn to hit the ball again in 2024.",https://spectator.org/biden-hurricanes-depleting-strategic-petroleum-reserve/,2022-08-13
Biden Tries to Dupe Parents - The American Spectator,"The Democrats have long been the party hostile to parental rights. They support laws that permit teen abortions without parental consent or even notification. They encourage children to pursue “gender-affirming care” behind their parents’ backs. They run candidates like Terry McAuliffe who say, “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.” But all of this opposition to parental rights is catching up with the party politically. Its strategists fear a parental backlash at the polls this fall. Out of this anxiety has come the Biden administration’s latest scam: the U.S. Department of Education’s National Parents and Families Engagement Council.

Miguel Cardona, Biden’s secretary of education, announced the creation of the council on June 14. “The National Parents and Families Engagement Council will serve as an important link between families and caregivers, education advocates and their school communities,” he said. “The Council will help foster a collaborative environment where we can work together to serve the best interest of students and ensure they have the academic and mental health support they need to recover from the pandemic and thrive in the future.”

This is the same secretary of education who won’t say whether schools should inform parents if their children are “transitioning.” It is also the same secretary of education who participated in a scheme to unleash the FBI on complaining parents at school board meetings.

His new council is obviously designed not to serve parents but to bamboozle them. It is a pathetic political prop, as evident in the left-wing composition of the council — just a bunch of progressive groups, such as Mocha Moms, that support the agenda of the Democrats.

“The Biden administration claims it formed the recently unveiled ‘parents council’ to better reflect families’ views in public schools — but its members include Al Sharpton’s community organizing group, activists who lobby to teach ‘comprehensive sex education’ including gender identity theory in school, and open borders groups,” reports the Washington Stand.

The Biden administration seeks the votes, not the input, of parents. Its multiple propaganda projects — from critical race theory to gender theorizing in elementary schools — depend upon driving a wedge between parents and children. All of Biden’s executive orders and policies in favor of transgenderism presuppose that the autonomy of the child trumps the wishes of the parents. Biden wants to make it a crime for parents to seek psychiatric treatment for their confused children. Beneath all of his hysterical blather about the evils of “conversion therapy” lies the totalitarian assertion that the state, not parents, knows what is best for children.

Hillary Clinton once famously took the position that children have a right to sue their parents and promoted the mantra that “it takes a village” to raise them. Spelling this position out even more explicitly, the liberal pundit Melissa Harris-Perry has said that “we have to break through our kind of private idea that ‘kids belong to their parents’ or ‘kids belong to their families,’ and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.”

This is the anti-parent collectivism at the heart of the Biden administration’s policies, and it explains why Biden is such a shill for the crumbling public school system. He needs to herd as many children as possible into it so that the state can propagandize them for cowed citizenship in the fundamentally transformed America to come. Pesky parents are seen by the left as an impediment to that transformation. Much of the left’s rhetoric is designed to fool parents into surrendering their natural rights to the “experts” of the state.

Even the name of Biden’s hastily assembled council sounds suspicious, implying that “parents and families” are distinct entities, with the latter representing an interest separate from the interest of biological parents. The Department of Education’s press release about the council also refers nebulously to “caregiver representatives from national organizations” that will work with it — meaning left-wing activists opposed to parental rights.

The tone about parents in the press release is condescending. “Parents provide critical perspective, and they should always have a seat at the table whenever decisions are made that impact their children. And this is more important than ever in the effort to help students recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,” Anna King, president of National Parent Teacher Association, is quoted as saying in the release. How big of her! How reassured parents must be to know they get “a seat at the table.”

But even that patronizing is bogus. On the issues most crucial to the left, the Biden administration seeks to exclude parents. Wherever parental rights and wokeness collide, Biden supports the latter. “As I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I’ll always have your back,” he has said. This means turning his back on parents. He clearly considers self-mutilation a “civil right” beyond the control of parents.

The party’s problem with parents is not cosmetic but philosophical. The success of its agenda is staked on the diminution of parental rights. Biden’s new council of “parents” at the Department of Education will not correct that problem but conceal it, and thereby give insulted parents yet another reason to vote Democrats out in the fall.",https://spectator.org/biden-impaired-sotu/,2022-06-23
Biden Ukase Affirms Failure of Obama Student Loan Takeover - The American Spectator,"President Barack Obama engineered a federal takeover of the student-loan industry 12 years ago. The failure of this scheme finds confirmation in President Joe Biden’s executive fiat that waives student-loan repayment to the federal government.

“An entire generation is now saddled with unsustainable debt in exchange for an attempt at least at a college degree,” Biden said Wednesday, announcing the scheme that allows most borrowers who earn under $125,000 to default on as much as $20,000 of their debts. “The burden is so heavy that even if you graduate, you may not have access to the middle-class life that the college degree once provided.”

How could this be so? Obama fixed this problem 12 years ago.

“By cutting out the middleman, we’ll save American taxpayers $68 billion in the coming years,” the then president said at a ceremony at Northern Virginia Community College’s Alexandria campus in March 2010. “That’s real money — real savings that we’ll reinvest to help improve the quality of higher education and make it more affordable.”

None of this happened. Texas Tech University’s decision to open a waterpark several months before the bill was signed foreshadowed that Obama would fall short of these ambitions.

When Obama said those words, students of four-year institutions paid an average of about $21,000 a year for tuition, fees, room, and board. They pay about $30,000 now.

Boston College is charging $62,950 for the 2022–2023 school year. The University of Connecticut is charging out-of-state enrollees $55,724. California State University Northridge is charging $32,716 for students living off campus, in part because “[i]n accordance with California Assembly Bill 990 the California State University Northridge provides the typical market cost of a one-bedroom apartment in the Northridge area.”

Since the Higher Education Act of 1965 put the federal government heavily into the business (charity?) of subsidizing college, costs have skyrocketed from $1,286 (about $11,000 in 2021 dollars) annually for tuition, fees, room, and board at a four-year school to about $30,000 now.

This latest gambit by the Biden administration, like all the ones before it dating to the Johnson administration, does not make college more affordable for students. It incentivizes colleges to raise their prices.

The more they do, the more a sucker known as Uncle Sam coughs up.",https://spectator.org/biden-inflation-phony-money/,2022-08-25
Biden Undermines Parents in Remarks to Teachers - The American Spectator,"Do kids in America’s classrooms belong to the teachers? President Joe Biden seems to think so. In remarks to teachers this week at a White House event honoring national and state teachers of the year, Biden told educators that their students “are not somebody else’s children. They’re like yours when they’re in the classroom.” In any other era, we would have understood what the president meant — that teachers and parents were working in tandem to give kids a quality academic education while instilling shared American values. But while Biden may believe that in his mind, his comments don’t match up with the current reality of our public school classrooms today.

Over the last two years, the COVID-19 pandemic with its resulting lockdowns and school closures has blown the lid off the inner workings of America’s public school classrooms. Parents have gotten a firsthand look at how divisive ideologies like critical race theory and gender identity are entering school curricula, libraries, and policies. Not only are kids collectively falling behind in academics right now, but they’re also being distracted by harmful ideas that confuse, segregate, and shame instead of unite.

In a national wave of righteous anger, parents began pushing back against this trend, prompting a backlash from some political and educational leaders who would prefer parents stayed out of public school affairs. In testimony to the Senate in September last year, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said that parents of school-age children should not act as the “primary stakeholders” in education decisions. That same month, National School Boards Association CEO Chip Slaven sent a letter to the White House accusing upset parents of engaging in “a form of domestic terrorism.” And in the run-up to his failed bid for reelection last November, Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said, “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.” The message from these public figures is clear: parents should butt out of their kids’ education and leave it to the professionals.

But just whose kids are they anyway? As writer Helen Roy puts it — “that children are natural subjects of their parents, and that parents are the best guarantors of their children’s health and happiness” — should go without saying. As such, parents are the primary educators of their children. They have the ultimate right to decide who partners with them to teach their kids as well as supervise what and how their kids learn. They also have ultimate authority to teach their kids about sexuality. But a number of recent news stories have exposed schools and teachers who think they know better than parents what’s best for their kids. In California, two middle school teachers secretly manipulated an 11-year-old girl into believing she was a transgender boy while keeping her mother in the dark. Also in California, parents have been told repeatedly that critical race theory is not being taught in schools, yet a video has surfaced that shows school advisers discussing how to get around the CRT label and still teach the concepts. A school district in Wisconsin is training school staff that “parents are not entitled to know their kids’ identities” and that that knowledge “must be earned.”

So what is the appropriate role for teachers in public schools? Ironically, in the same speech to teachers, Biden admitted that “the greatest sin that anyone can commit is the abuse of power.” Yet, that’s what we’re seeing in classrooms across America — teachers who are abusing the trust placed in them by parents and students in the name of personal propaganda. To be effective as a teacher, four qualities must be evident. First, a healthy dose of humility is in order. Teachers serve the community, which includes the parents of the students they teach. As Carol Garhart Mooney notes in her book Theories of Childhood: “The values and cultures of families and communities should be reflected in and deepened by what happens at school.” But if the values of the teacher or school administrators are vastly different than the values of parents at home, that’s a fundamental problem. Second, modesty is essential. As teachers guide students to learning, it’s not necessary for students to know intimate details about them, least of all their sexual or political persuasions. Modest teachers will demonstrate self-restraint and wisdom in the sharing of personal information or opinions. Third, a spirit of gratefulness is required to teach well. It is hard to be pessimistic about America’s past or future when teachers practice gratefulness. Dwelling on what isn’t good about life or society will not promote a grateful tone in teachers or students. Finally, truth should be the goal of any humble, modest, and grateful teacher. Cultivating thoughtfulness and kindling a hunger for the quest for truth are the ways we equip the next generation to form sound judgments.

Biden’s effort to share his immense respect for teachers and encourage today’s overwhelmed and overstressed educators is not without merit. But his admission that the students in classrooms are not somebody else’s children undermines parental rights and gives continued license to activist teachers and administrators who sacrifice critical thinking and free inquiry for indoctrination and intolerance.

"Biden’s Relentless War on the Border Targets Law Enforcement, Not Illegals - The American Spectator","President Joe Biden’s attack on America’s southern perimeter continues without mercy. Indeed, the U.S.–Mexico “border” is dissolving at a quickening pace.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered 239,416 illegal aliens in May alone. This is yet another monthly record, as Biden becomes the Babe Ruth of border destruction.

May’s figure was “the highest number in DHS history,” Fox News Channel’s intrepid southern-boundary correspondent Bill Melugin told Fox Radio’s Guy Benson. Melugin added that May’s total encounters with illegal aliens shattered “the record, which was set last month in April, which was 234,000, which broke the record for March, which was 221,000. So the last three months in a row have all been record-breaking months and May being the highest at nearly 240,000.”

In Biden’s first full 16 months in office (from February 1, 2021, through May 31, 2022), Border Patrol agents confronted a staggering 2,975,135 illegal aliens. These law-breaking interlopers exceed the 2,731,994 people who inhabit Alaska, North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming, according to the latest Census Bureau estimates. If these 2.73 million individuals established their own state — call it Rio Grandia — they would be nearly as populous as Kansas and entitled to two U.S. senators and four U.S. House representatives. Perhaps that is the point.

Compare​ these 2,975,135 to the 754,538 such encounters during President Donald J. Trump’s final 16 months in office (October 1, 2019, through January 31, 2021 — including Biden’s first 11 days). Since Trump jetted to Mar-a-Lago, these hard numbers confirm, illegal-alien apprehensions have ballooned under Biden by a mind-blowing 394 percent.

Joe Biden must be vying for the Border-Elimination Hall of Fame. By now, he deserves his own dedicated wing.

And these statistics do not include so-called “got-aways.” Border Patrol detects these illegal aliens but is unable to intercept them. The Center for Immigration Studies calculates that 706,667 illegals have gotten away and entered America under this administration. Biden’s got-aways slightly overshadow Washington, D.C.’s 705,749 denizens.

At least these “got-aways” can be estimated. Other illegals invaded the USA while being neither perceived via infrared equipment nor observed through binoculars.

How many people broke into America completely surreptitiously?

Your guess is as good as any.

Biden now plans to plunge his border-demolition tactics from merely queasy to fully vomit-inducing. While Biden gives illegals free cell phones and tickets to ride virtually anywhere in America, he punishes diligent Border Patrol agents for doing their jobs.

Last September, several equestrian Border Patrolmen resisted scores of Haitians as they tried to penetrate U.S. soil at Del Rio, Texas. These federal officers rode atop horses that galloped back and forth while these Haitians waded up from the Rio Grande.

Leftists screamed that these agents used whips to beat the Haitians into submission.

“This is another clear demonstration of just how much our immigration system is rooted in anti-Blackness,” said Jane Bentrott of Justice Action Center, a public-interest law firm that represents these Haitians.

“As we all know, it also evoked images of some of the worst moments of our history, where that kind of behavior has been used against the indigenous people of our country, has been used against African Americans during times of slavery,” Vice President Kamala Harris demagogued on ABC’s The View.

Not be outdone, Biden decried the officers’ actions.

“It was horrible what you see, what you saw — to see people treated like they did, with horses barely running them over and people being strapped,” Biden told journalists at the White House. “It’s outrageous. I promise you, those people will pay.” Biden added, “There will be consequences.”

But the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general begged to differ. As the Washington Free Beacon reported, the IG “cleared the agents of criminal wrongdoing” and declined further investigation.

Moreover, federal attorneys must have missed Biden–Harris’s “guilty as charged” memo. On June 10, administration attorneys walked into the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., to argue the case of Haitian Bridge Alliance et al. v. Biden et al. While POTUS and VPOTUS condemned these Border Patrolmen and likened them to slave drivers, federal lawyers fought a class-action suit by Haitian illegal aliens who complained of racial discrimination, in addition to these supposed whippings.

But rather than apologize to these Haitians and Zelle them damage payments, the Biden administration told them to pound riparian sand.

“Individual plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that they have standing to bring their claims,” Biden’s attorneys pleaded. Translation: Get lost — your case doesn’t deserve to be heard. With that, these lawyers, who work for Biden, did not assure that these “horrible” Border Patrol agents “will pay.” Instead, they moved to dismiss the Haitians’ case.

So, the mounted Border Patrol agents rode into the sunset.

Not so fast.

Biden ignored the DHS IG’s lack of interest in these purported whippings. He disregarded his own administration’s rejection of the Haitians’ complaints. Biden even spurned the objections of Agence France-Presse photographer Paul Ratje, whose images ignited this controversy.

“I didn’t ever see them whip anybody,” Ratje told KTSM, NBC’s El Paso, Texas, affiliate. “That’s something that can be misconstrued when you’re looking at the picture.”

Facts be damned. Biden stayed on mission.

The Washington Examiner reported last week that Biden’s U.S. Customs and Border Protection planned to hammer these federal officers with “administrative violations” for whippings that never occurred and hurt no illegal aliens. These agents slapped reins at horses but never snapped whips at Haitians.

This revolting development merits an abuse-of-power lawsuit against Biden by these once-mounted Border Patrol agents. For now, they are relegated to desk jobs and forbidden to defend America’s boundaries on horseback. Team Biden prohibits them from practicing this very special skill.

Rather than the “nice guy” who captured the White House by promising to Make Washington Normal Again, Americans are stuck with a snarling, vindictive old man who takes the U.S.–Mexico “border” even less seriously than his former boss’s tragicomic Syrian “line in the sand.”

More Confusion From Biden White House on Taiwan - The American Spectator,"Despite recent calls for the United States to end its policy of “strategic ambiguity” over Taiwan, the Biden White House continues to talk out of both sides of its mouth on the issue, thereby producing not strategic clarity but confusion. On Sunday, the president on 60 Minutes stated that U.S. troops would defend Taiwan “if in fact there was an unprecedented attack.” Pressed further, Biden said that American forces would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.

But as the New York Post reports, the White House immediately “walked back” the president’s comments, saying that the U.S. policy of strategic ambiguity has not changed. As Ronald Reagan memorably said to Jimmy Carter during one of their 1980 debates: “There you go again.” This is now the fifth time that the White House has “walked back” the president’s seemingly unambiguous commitment to defend Taiwan if it is attacked or invaded by China.

During a visit to Japan earlier this year, during a trip to New Hampshire last November, during a CNN town hall last October, and during an interview with ABC News last August, the president stated that the U.S. would come to Taiwan’s defense. Each time, White House spokespersons reiterated that U.S. policy had not changed — in other words, the president misspoke. (READ MORE from Francis P. Sempa: Could the Battle of the Taiwan Straits Be the Trafalgar of the 21st Century?)

This is getting very dangerous. The repeated mixed signals emanating from the Biden administration over our Taiwan policy have surely caught the attention of Chinese leaders and our allies in the Indo-Pacific. Biden has replaced strategic ambiguity with strategic confusion. It is time for Congress to step into this void of confusion and to make clear to Chinese leaders that an invasion of Taiwan will result in a congressional declaration of war against China. It should not have had to come to this, but our president and his White House can’t seem to get their act together. For far too long Congress has abandoned its constitutional authority to declare war, effectively ceding that power to the president. The results have not been pretty — Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq.

Strategic ambiguity served a useful purpose when China was our de facto ally during the last two decades of the Cold War. It has outlived its usefulness now that China is our peer competitor for global leadership. But instead of strategic clarity, the Biden administration’s policy of strategic confusion has only made war more likely. It’s time to end the confusion.",https://spectator.org/biden-is-utterly-failing-to-deter-putin/,2022-09-20
Biden White House Takes the Bait on Lindsey Graham’s Abortion Bill - The American Spectator,"“We will introduce legislation … to get America in a position at the federal level I think is fairly consistent with the rest of the world,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina on Tuesday, introducing a bill that would ban abortion across the country after 15 weeks. The bill includes exceptions for rape, incest, and risks to the life of the mother.

As long as the Democrats hold the Senate, the bill, of course, will go nowhere. It appears that Graham has simply proposed it as preelection jujitsu, designed to expose the extremism of Democrats on the issue. If that is his goal, he has already achieved it. The White House took his bait, denouncing the bill’s minor limitation on abortion in splenetic terms. “This bill is wildly out of step with what Americans believe,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, President Joe Biden’s press secretary. “The President and Vice President are fighting for progress, while Republicans are fighting to take us back.”

Wildly out of step? This statement ignores that a majority of Americans feel far more ambivalent about abortion than anyone in the Biden administration. Only 19 percent of Americans support abortion in all cases and at all times — the maximalist position that Biden holds. (READ MORE from George Neumayr: Biden Faces Setback in Forcing Religious Doctors to Perform Abortions and Transgender Surgeries)

The Pew Research Center reports:

As in the past, more Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances (61%) than illegal in all or most circumstances (37%). But in many ways, the public’s attitudes are contingent upon such circumstances as when an abortion takes place during a woman’s pregnancy, whether the pregnancy endangers a woman’s life and whether a baby would have severe health problems.

It continues:

[L]arge numbers of Americans favor certain restrictions on access to abortions. For example, seven-in-ten say doctors should be required to notify a parent or legal guardian of minors seeking abortions. And most of those who say abortion should be legal in some cases and illegal in others say that how long a woman has been pregnant should be a factor in determining whether abortion is legal or illegal (56% among all U.S. adults).

Cocky Democrats continue to act as if the Dobbs decision only poses a political problem for the Republican Party. In recent days, they have been confidently claiming that the decision will undoubtedly redound to their benefit in the fall elections. That the decision has highlighted their own extremism on abortion never seems to occur to them. It is their fanaticism on the issue — evident in their overreaction to Graham’s slapdash bill and their policing of anyone in the party who isn’t maximally pro-abortion — that is sure to cost them politically over time.",https://spectator.org/biden-liz-cheney-kinzinger-racial-supremacy/,2022-09-14
Biden’s Big Lie About Social Security and Medicare - The American Spectator,"Democrats and the corporate media have often accused former President Donald Trump of using a propaganda strategy called the “Big Lie” to convince Americans that the 2020 election was stolen. They remind us that Adolf Hitler coined the term in Mein Kampf and that his minister of propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, perfected the technique. Essentially, it involves relentlessly repeating a colossal lie until the public eventually comes to believe it. It is little wonder that the Democrats and the Fourth Estate are so familiar with this strategy — they employ it themselves every election cycle.

Their Big Lie of choice is the perennial claim that the Republicans are plotting to gut Social Security and Medicare. President Joe Biden repeated that yarn during last week’s State of the Union address: “Republicans say if we don’t cut Social Security and Medicare, they’ll let America default on its debt for the first time in our history.” After being loudly booed for that whopper, he went on to say, “If anyone tries to cut Social Security … and if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I’ll stop them.” This is an ironic assertion coming from a man who, as a U.S. senator, once bragged about his own attempts to cut both programs:

When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well, I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once; I tried it twice. I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time.

Utterly unabashed by his own hypocrisy, Biden flew to Florida two days after delivering his surreal SOTU speech and told a crowd at the University of Tampa that their GOP senator, Rick Scott, has a plan to sunset Social Security and Medicare. He then admitted that this claim was “so outrageous that you might not even believe it.” That would indeed be a sensible response because Scott’s American Rescue Plan doesn’t mention either program. This didn’t deter Biden from elaborating: “Look, I know that a lot of Republicans, their dream is to cut Social Security and Medicare.” He then solemnly pledged to fight these fiends.

Take a moment to consider just how weird this whole performance really was: The president of the United States, a man who once boasted about his many attempts to cut Social Security and Medicare (plus Medicaid), told a group of Americans that he would prevent those programs from being slashed by Republicans who have no plans to cut them. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has explicitly stated, “Cuts to Social Security and Medicare, they are off the table.” In fact, he reiterated that pledge on Fox & Friends, during a discussion of Biden’s ludicrous SOTU address and the boisterous Republican reaction to his transparent lies:

The president was trying to goad the members and the members are passionate about it. But the one thing the president was saying is something that he knew was not true. I just spent an hour with him. I’ve said it many times before. Social Security and Medicare are off the table.… He’s trying to play politics with the debt ceiling by not negotiating, by lying about our position.

Inevitably, the corporate “news” media has ignored Biden’s long history of calling for Social Security and Medicare cuts while warning the public to be very skeptical of GOP pledges to leave the programs intact. On Friday, the Washington Post ran an op-ed titled, “Sorry, Republicans, no one should trust your word on Social Security.” Its author, Paul Waldman, recites the usual talking points about Scott’s dark designs and the foiled plots of former House Speaker Paul Ryan. He even includes a non sequitur about Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare during Trump’s tenure in the White House.

This was an obvious attempt to implicate Trump in the alleged plot to cut entitlements, despite his opposition to meddling with Social Security and Medicare. Trump released a video in January urging Republicans not to cut the programs: “Under no circumstances should Republicans vote to cut a single penny from Medicare or Social Security.… The seniors are being absolutely destroyed in the last two years.” Meanwhile, the corporate media is also attempting to implicate Trump’s main rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. CNN dug up various 2012 quotes from then-congressional candidate Ron DeSantis:

A CNN KFile review of comments from DeSantis’ 2012 congressional campaign found he repeatedly said he supported plans to replace Medicare with a system in which the government paid for partial costs of private plans or a traditional Medicare plan. In one interview with a local newspaper, DeSantis said he supported “the same thing” for Social Security.

The authors of this CNN article, Andrew Kaczynski and Em Steck, somehow neglected to mention one of the most important features of DeSantis’ position on restructuring these programs — it would not apply to current retirees or anyone about to retire. As he says in this interview with the St. Augustine Record: “I would not change Social Security and Medicare for people on the programs or near retirement or 55 and over.” He goes on to say that the reforms he supported would apply primarily to people of his own generation (he was 34 at that time) and that the goal was to keep the programs solvent over the long term.

That inconvenient fact, however, doesn’t square with the prevarications peddled by Biden, his fellow Democrats, and the corporate media. These people couldn’t care less about reforming the programs. For them, Social Security and Medicare are nothing more than weapons to use against Republicans. They know that the Big Lie about a secret GOP plot to gut these programs will scare millions of elderly Americans into voting for Democrats — despite their stunning incompetence and increasingly authoritarian policies. And Biden is the perfect messenger — a pathological liar with no scruples and even less shame.

Biden’s Budget Deficit Victory Lap Is Unearned and Unjustified - The American Spectator,"President Joe Biden is taking victory laps for last year’s reduced budget deficit. No one would be happier than me to see this number fall in a significant way. But the decline has nothing to do with the president’s policies, and it changes little about the dangers of our fiscal situation.

According to monthly reporting by the Treasury Department, we know the budget deficit for May was $66 billion. So far, the deficit for the 2022 fiscal year is $426 billion. With four months left, this year’s deficit will indeed be significantly lower than last year’s, which was nearly $2.8 trillion. There’s nothing like $5 trillion in COVID-19 relief spending paid for with borrowed cash to balloon a deficit!

Biden’s administration did nothing to bring about the deficit’s decline. Credit really goes to large increases in tax revenues as the economy rebounded combined with the decision by Democratic Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin and their Republican colleagues to block Biden’s expensive “Build Back Better” proposal. BBB would have made permanent many of the emergency programs created or expanded during the pandemic, and had it passed, government spending and deficits would be heading even higher than they are today.

That said, the still-too-close-to-$1 trillion deficit for FY 2022 is inexcusably large. More worrisome is the cost that we taxpayers must shoulder because of the pre- and post-COVID-19 deficits. According to that same Treasury report, in May, the U.S. government paid $56 billion in interest payments on its debt, up from $44 billion in April. As of now, total interest payments for this year are $311 billion. With four months still to go on this figure, we can assume a total interest cost for FY 2022 of at least $500 billion.

This is just the beginning. Before the pandemic and the inflation unleashed by irresponsible government spending and easy money, the Congressional Budget Office projected that in 2050, interest payments on U.S. debt would consume 8 percent of GDP and 40 percent of government revenue. These projections assumed modest increases in interest rates over a long-term period. However, as of today, the short-term figures look optimistic as inflation and the Federal Reserve’s response to it are boosting interest rates.

Higher interest rates today will raise interest payments shortly thereafter, as so much of our debt is short-term. According to the Treasury, total interest on marketable debt in May was 1.73 percent, up from 1.66 percent in April, and rising. At this pace, we could reach 2 percent by the end of the year. A calculation by the Mercatus Center’s Jack Salmon finds that a 1 percent increase in interest rates would result in annual interest payments of $1.06 trillion while a 2 percent increase would elevate these annual payments to $1.45 trillion.

It’s expensive for sure, but it is also a vicious cycle if the interest is paid for with yet more borrowing. More borrowing raises total interest payments. In addition, if one believes (as I do) that most of our current inflation is rooted in recent fiscal irresponsibility, then more borrowing to pay for more interest will only add more fuel to the inflation fire.

Finally, as the average interest rate on marketable debt approaches 2 percent, we are getting close to the threshold that some left-leaning economists say should trigger concerns about the size of government debt.

In 2020, economists Jason Furman and Lawrence Summers weren’t worried about this. Interest rates were historically low and seemed destined to stay low. Still, out of academic rigor, they laid out some markers for when we might start worrying about the debt: “As a new guidepost, we propose that fiscal policy focus on supporting economic growth while preventing real debt service from being projected to rise quickly or to rise above 2 percent of GDP over the forthcoming decade.”

Today, debt held by the public is about 98 percent of GDP, so with a 1.734 percent interest rate, we are currently spending 1.7 percent of GDP on interest payments. If the Federal Reserve does have to raise rates significantly higher than projected to tame inflation, we really should start to worry.

In other words, the budget deficit might be smaller than at the height of the pandemic, and that is a good and predictable thing. But it’s no cause for celebration as interest rates and servicing costs could push us into worrisome territory sooner than we think.

Biden’s Choleric New COVID Czar - The American Spectator,"The White House has announced that Dr. Ashish K. Jha will soon replace Jeffrey Zients as the Biden administration’s coronavirus response coordinator. The good news is that Jha, unlike Zients, is an actual physician. The bad news is that, since the advent of COVID-19, his public statements concerning the pandemic have been tainted by partisan politics and malicious ad hominem attacks on any heretic who dares to question establishment coronavirus orthodoxy. Dr. Jha once appeared on The View, for example, to accuse Stanford University’s Dr. Scott W. Atlas of spreading unspecified “misinformation” during the latter’s brief tenure as advisor to then-President Trump.

Anyone reluctant to believe this cheap shot was more about politics than public health should consider that Jha also pronounced Trump rallies dangerous, yet insisted that BLM riots were not. He made this claim in a tweet: “I spoke to @CarlaKJohnson of @AP said that I thought President Trump’s rallies are dangerous. They are very risky. Before you lose your mind and call me a hypocrite for not calling BLM protests dangerous, let’s examine some facts.” The “facts” proving those BLM riots safe turned out to be that the rioters were outside in roving mobs and, according to Jha, wearing masks. He ended his absurd thread with this revealing tweet: “I don’t find protests against racism and political rallies to be morally equivalent.”

Predictably, Dr. Jha has been a vocal supporter of government-imposed vaccine mandates — including the constitutionally dubious “workaround” promulgated by the Biden administration under the aegis of the Occupational, Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). He was among the signatories to a joint statement, coordinated by occasional Biden advisor Ezekiel Emanuel, calling on the business community to forgo legal challenges to the mandate. Fortunately, this was ignored by the affected entities and the Supreme Court struck down the mandate in a January ruling. In keeping with his affinity for government directives, Dr. Jha is also very much in favor of “vaccine certificates.” He wrote the following in the Economist:

How will you know if the person next to you on a bus, aeroplane or checkout line is infectious with covid-19? Should you know? How can you keep yourself and your workplace safe in a way that is equitable and protects privacy? As countries administer covid-19 vaccines, having a vaccine certificate — a simple, reliable and secure way to determine who is inoculated — will be critical to making work, school, restaurants, houses of worship and other places safe for everyone.

This was written before the OSHA mandate was invalidated by SCOTUS, a ruling Dr. Jha deemed “very disappointing.” Yet it presumably demonstrated that mandatory vaccine certificates will suffer the same fate if imposed at the federal level. It’s far more conceivable that vaccine mandates and certificates will pass constitutional muster if established at the state level. Still, it’s clear from Jha’s public effusions that he has considerably more faith in government coercion and surveillance than in the individual judgment of ordinary Americans. This isn’t an encouraging trait in a COVID response coordinator who surely understands that the disease is entering an endemic phase the management of which doesn’t call for sweeping federal edicts.

Dr. Jha’s partiality for big government mandates is related to his most unprofessional proclivity — the need to level personal attacks on anyone who possesses the temerity to disagree with any aspect of his own rigid public policy positions. The cheap shot involving Dr. Scott Atlas noted above is by no means unique. During a New York Times podcast aired in January, Jha discussed what he called “the rise of the quasi-experts,” which he defined as “a group of people with good titles” who should know better than to render heretical opinions about the pandemic. Among the heretics he has lumped into this category is Martin A. Makary, MD, MPH, a surgeon and public policy expert at Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins University:

He has never been held back by being wrong. So he says stuff — he had this pronouncement that we were going to hit herd immunity in April 2021. Turned out not so much.… But he’s a professor at Hopkins. If you are a normal American, and this is a guy at Hopkins — one of the leading institutions — who seems and is really smart … how do you deal with that? That’s the challenge. People are struggling to figure out who are the real experts and who is just making it up.

In addition to going after Drs. Makary and Atlas, the good doctor has also maligned Nobel Laureate and biophysicist Michael Levitt, Stanford Professor of Medicine Jay Bhattacharya, and Harvard epidemiologist Martin Kuldorf. Their crime, according to one of Dr. Jha’s typically politicized tweets, was to participate in a public health roundtable with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R): “Wondering why @GovRonDeSantis fully opened bars, restaurants? May be partly b/c he held roundtable w @MartinKulldorff, @DrJBhattacharya, @MLevitt_NP2013 yesterday.” Not coincidentally, each of these “quasi-experts” has long opposed the misguided and destructive lockdowns Jha advocated when COVID-19 arrived in the United States.

In the end, DeSantis followed their advice and Florida has achieved a lower per capita death rate than other large states, like New York, that followed the kind of restrictive policies favored by Jha. This suggests that the country might have been better served if President Biden had chosen one of the targets of Dr. Jha’s venom to replace Jeffrey Zients as his administration’s coronavirus response coordinator. Instead, we are getting a political partisan who will brook no deviation from the coronavirus orthodoxy that has wreaked so much havoc to the physical, psychological, and economic health of countless Americans. But hey, he’s a “real expert.”",https://spectator.org/biden-ministry-of-truth-mayorkas/,2022-03-21
Biden’s Classified Documents Scandal Proves the National Media Is Dead - The American Spectator,"There is no denying it anymore: the national media is dead. The truth is that they have been for a while, but their disgraceful coverage of Joe Biden’s classified document scandal is just the latest proof that they are not to be trusted and have no credibility to cover virtually any topic that does not fit their leftist worldview.

They can’t provide us with the facts when it comes to the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of masks or COVID vaccines and some of the deleterious side effects that seem to be associated with them. They bloviate that the world is going to end soon due to global warming — unless we switch to electric vehicles and ban gas stoves.

They fixate on Jan. 6 — in an attempt to paint all Republicans as QAnon conspiracy theorists — while referring to violent BLM riots with gigantic fireballs as massive as any found in an Indiana Jones film as “mostly peaceful.”

They tell us men can get pregnant and that CRT either isn’t being taught in schools, or that it’s really just teaching about slavery — and not how all white people are supposedly brutal oppressors who will always be racist solely because of their pigment.

They don’t care about the rule of law. They support excessive government overreach in the form of COVID mask and vaccine mandates. And they excuse mob violence and smash-and-grabs if the cause justifies the means.

They only pretend to care about holding members of Congress who embellish their resume accountable if they have an “R” next to their name — but are willing to turn the other cheek if a Democrat senator who’s whiter than the Pillsbury Doughboy tells us she’s Native American.

The leftist propaganda media is anti-American. They are anti-law enforcement. They are racist toward black conservatives. They are bigoted toward straight white men. They are sexist toward women whose ideologies do not align with their own. They don’t care about anti-Semitism or anti-Asian discrimination — unless they can selectively wield it as a sword to hurt Republicans. And they are sympathetic toward woke fraudster CEOs who embezzle billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency from customers — but donate to the correct left-wing causes.

It’s hard to comprehend how anyone can still read the New York Times or the Washington Post when their pages are filled with nothing except contempt for working-class Americans, anti-Republican drivel, and race-baiting stories that are usually lacking in facts and short on key details, but almost always find a way to blame America and white people in particular not only for past sins, but for supposedly continuing to oppress minorities.

These so-called news outlets do not seek to inform. Their only mission is to defend the Democrat Party at all costs, even if it means running cover for a man in the Oval Office who has no business managing a bowling alley, let alone serving as commander-in-chief.

Sure, the corporate media has always been left of center. We know they always hated Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and every other Republican on down.

Yes, they spent eight years fawning over Obama’s presidency while overlooking his association with left-wing radicals and anti-Semites, downplaying the Benghazi disaster, ignoring the weakest economic recovery in history, praising the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, refusing to hold the president accountable for failing to draw the red line in Syria, and informing us that Hillary Clinton’s email scandal was much ado about nothing.

They concocted the most ludicrous conspiracy theories about Donald Trump, including that he colluded with the Russian government and that he plotted to overthrow our government — all with the sole purpose of undermining his presidency.

But now, these so-called newsrooms are willing to ignore actual crises and scandals relating to the president — solely because he’s on their team.

Most of the legacy media refused to assign any blame to Biden for the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the worst border crisis in U.S. history, which has occurred under Biden’s watch, apparently doesn’t exist. The massive crime wave in mostly Democrat-run cities, thanks to soft-on-crime prosecutors in the wake of the “defund the police” movement, is a figment of our imagination. Inflation, fueled by drunk spending on Democrat special-interest pet projects is no big deal.

And just months after the national press promoted and even encouraged a thuggish raid on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence over documents that he had the authority to declassify, we’re now being told by the same dishonest hacks that it’s not a big deal that Biden had classified documents at his personal office in D.C. and in at least two different locations in his Wilmington home — including in his library and in his garage, next to his beloved Corvette.

It’s not a big deal that the Department of Justice allowed Biden’s lawyers to search through his home for classified documents — even though they likely did not have a security clearance. It’s no big deal that Hunter Biden was paying his father a monthly rent of $49,910 to live in that home, even though he listed himself as the owner of the house where unauthorized documents were being stored. It’s not a big deal that the exact same amount that Hunter was paying his father to live in a home he reportedly owned just happened to be the exact same amount that he deposited for a shared D.C. office with a Chinese energy company.

It’s not a big deal that we did not find out about any of this until two months after the midterms. It’s not at all irresponsible for Biden to somehow justify having unauthorized documents in his garage of all places with this profoundly idiotic statement: “By the way, my Corvette’s in a locked garage, OK? So it’s not like they’re sitting out on the street.”

All of this is too inconvenient for the corporate media, which is why they have all but stopped talking about it — and diverted all of their attention to George Santos and what they keep telling us is a fractured GOP.

In the inevitable event that new developments occur in this sad saga, they will continue to repeat whatever talking points Biden’s attorneys provide them.

As is often the case with the corporate media, their biggest crime remains the sin of omission.

Biden’s Classified Documents Scandal Won’t Go Away - The American Spectator,"The photo you see here was taken in 2013. It shows then–Vice President Joe Biden standing in the Oval Office with his back to the window. Next to him stands Obama’s press secretary and to his front is an assembled group of reporters. Biden is holding — and apparently referring to or even reading from — a document clearly marked “Codeword” and “Classified.”

We’ll never know if that document is one of the dozens or hundreds of classified documents — many reportedly classified as “top secret” and which include intelligence information on Ukraine, Iran, and the United Kingdom — that have been recovered from Biden’s “think tank” in D.C. and his home in Delaware.

Biden’s possession of classified documents in his home is just as illegal as was former President Donald Trump’s and former Vice President Mike Pence’s. Biden’s media minions are trying to belittle the scandal but it just won’t go away. Nor should it.

The New York Times recently declared that the government classifies too much information and documentation. That may be true, but it’s no excuse for Biden’s negligence and irresponsibility.

At last count, there have been five searches of his Delaware home and garage. The latest resulted in six “items” being taken. The “items” could very well be boxes holding dozens or hundreds of classified documents. Some of the documents were taken from his office when he was vice president, and some were taken from his office as senator, which he occupied from 1973 to 2009.

Members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence were briefed on the Biden and Trump classified documents scandals a few days ago. They have demanded to see copies of the documents held by Biden and Trump, but the intelligence community is refusing to produce them.

They — and we — have no knowledge about what categories of classification most of the documents recovered from Biden’s home and think tank were in, but we do know that some — perhaps many — were classified as “top secret.”

There are three categories of classified information, which range from “confidential” — the lowest — to “secret” and the highest, “top secret.” Codeword information is within the top-secret category, which also includes sensitive compartmented information (SCI), satellite intelligence, codes, codeword programs, and special access programs, which are usually covert operations authorized by special presidential order and often leave blood on the floor.

How did Biden take classified documents from the Senate? Biden served on the Judiciary and Foreign Affairs committees but never on the Intelligence Committee. Thus, he would — and should — have had far less access to classified documents than a Senate Select Committee on Intelligence member.

Taking a classified document from the Senate requires a considerable degree of irresponsibility and, perhaps, ingenuity. I asked my friend, retired Missouri Sen. Kit Bond, about it. Bond served as vice chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, and I asked him how classified documents — and conversations about classified information — were handled when he and Biden were in the Senate.

Bond told me, “We kept ALL of our papers and discussions in the SCIF. I never even thought to take anything out.”

A SCIF is a “sensitive compartmented information” facility that is regularly swept for bugs and is supposedly sealed tight against electronic monitoring. When I served in the Pentagon, we had several SCIFs available for such discussions, including “the Tank,” a room without windows that was sealed with a bank vault–like door when we were inside. Like Sen. Bond, it never occurred to me to not handle those documents — or any conversations about classified information — with anything but the utmost care.

To my knowledge, there is only one SCIF available to senators and congressmen. It’s a sealed room in the Capitol building to which admission is supposed to be limited.

As a senator or vice president, Biden had no authority to declassify information or documents. Trump had that authority when he was president, but his handling of classified information is under investigation — as is Biden’s — by a Justice Department special counsel.

There is little difference between Biden’s handling of classified documents and Trump’s, with two exceptions.

First, Trump resisted turning over the classified documents in his possession. Second, Trump’s claim that he had declassified all of the documents is undocumented. Trump’s claim, made in a Fox News interview, was simply nonsense.

In that interview, Trump said:

Different people say different things but as I understand it, if you’re the president of the United States, you can declassify just by saying it’s declassified, even by thinking about it. Because you’re sending it to Mar-a-Lago or wherever you’re sending it. There doesn’t have to be a process. There can be a process, but there doesn’t have to be. You’re the president — you make that decision.

Baloney. Trump could have declassified documents by simply scribbling “declassified” on them, adding the date and his signature or initials. But he didn’t do that. There is a process and it has to be followed or the supposed declassification isn’t effective.

The worst of the handlers of top-secret information was then–Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her staff. They frequently exchanged classified information — including top-secret information and satellite intelligence (“SITK”, i.e., “Special Intelligence Talent Keyhole”) — on Clinton’s totally unsecured “Clintonmail” private email system. Any foreign power could — and many probably did — intercept some or all of those emails.

Clinton’s conduct, and that of her staff, was so obviously and blatantly criminal that only then–FBI director James Comey could conclude that there was no prosecutable offense in their conduct.

There are now two Justice Department “special counsels” who are (separately) investigating Trump’s and Biden’s illegal possession of classified documents. In the context of either case, each is highly unlikely to result in prosecution. The Clinton case alone would make a mockery of either special counsel if he tried to bring a case against either Biden or Trump.

The Select Committee on Intelligence — whose primary function is oversight of the president and intelligence community’s actions with respect to intelligence matters — should be given copies of all of the classified documents found in Trump’s and Biden’s possession.

The Select Committee on Intelligence should also be given whatever damage assessments the intelligence community has made or is making with respect to the Biden, Trump, and Clinton possible leaks of classified information. (A damage assessment is an exercise to determine what effect, if any, the presumed disclosure of secret information has had.) That information, too, is being withheld from the Select Committee on Intelligence.

In Biden’s case, the scandal goes beyond him and his staff. Biden’s “think tank,” the University of Pennsylvania–affiliated Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, enabled Biden to earn $900,000 while giving a few lectures at the university.

The Penn Biden Center is alone among former presidents’ such groups in that it produced little to none of the academic research that is normally produced by these groups. Its founding also corresponded with an increase in Chinese donations to the University of Pennsylvania. Were there leaks of classified documents or information to China or other nations? We may never know, but the special counsel investigating Biden’s illegal possession of classified documents should damned well find out.

One final note. There is a report that a long 2014 email authored by Biden’s son Hunter and sent to his business partner, Devon Archer, was found on Hunter’s laptop and contained classified information on Ukraine.

Did Hunter Biden get that information from the documents carelessly stored in Joe Biden’s house and garage? If so, the statute of limitations has probably run out on punishing that crime. Nevertheless, the special counsel investigating Biden’s reckless handling of government secrets should find out.

Government secrets have always been too vulnerable to discovery by foreign spies. Joseph Stalin, according to The Mitrokhin Archive — a compilation and explanation of documents stolen from KGB files — knew about the Manhattan Project’s development of the atomic bomb before Harry Truman did. There are too many other examples — the Walker spy ring, Edward Snowden, China’s relentless cyber espionage, and many others — to catalog here.

But foreign spies are only half of the problem. As long as presidents, vice presidents, their cabinet members, and their staffs are careless with our nation’s most closely held secrets, those secrets will never be safe.

Biden’s Coming Iran Fiasco - The American Spectator,"President Joe Biden has followed in President Barack Obama’s footsteps in rewarding Iranian bad behavior with carrots rather than punishing it with sticks. Biden is desperately seeking a new Iranian nuclear deal despite prevarication by Tehran and continued troublemaking in the Middle East. Worse still, after crafting a bad deal, the Biden administration is reportedly going to attempt to avoid congressional oversight by advertising it as a continuation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that President Donald Trump walked away from.

Since 1974, Democrats have repeatedly shown themselves to be weak sisters on foreign policy and national security, but Biden is proving to be the worst of the lot. At least he is consistent. As a member of the post-Watergate Senate class of 1974, he was a leader in selling out our South Vietnamese allies by refusing further funding of the Vietnam War, an act that ensured the fall of Saigon. Democrats were instrumental in engineering the communist Sandinista takeover in Nicaragua in 1979 and watched from the sidelines as radical Islamists took power in Iran. Meanwhile, an emboldened Soviet Union felt free to invade Afghanistan.

Under Clinton, the United States made some toothless efforts to stop al-Qaeda in the wake of the World Trade Center bombings and the repeated attacks on American citizens overseas. This set the scene for 9/11. Obama’s feeble response to the Syrian government’s use of chemical weapons on its own people emboldened the Russian- and Iranian-backed Assad regime to perpetrate continued atrocities on fellow Syrians; these victims included not just those who were fighting for freedom but innocents who happened to get in the way as well.

Now, we have Biden. Not content with having engineered the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, he wants to engineer a return to the lifting of sanctions against a regime in Tehran that has repeatedly shown contempt for our country and its leaders and flouted international norms. Let’s take a moment to review Iran’s actions since Biden became commander-in-chief. First, Iranians have continued to meddle in the affairs of the struggling democracy in Iraq. Their malign influence has been instrumental in ensuring that a stable Iraqi government has not been formed since 2011. The only contribution that Biden has made in the struggle against Islamic extremism has been the drone strike that killed the incompetent al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul. Zawahiri would not have been there to begin with but for Biden’s craven abandonment of Afghanistan. Iran’s ayatollahs have also created mischief in places as diverse as Syria and Yemen. While indirectly negotiating with the United States over a nuclear agreement, the Iranians have tried to hijack unarmed U.S. drone reconnaissance ships on the high seas. Tehran has demonstrated no good faith whatsoever.

I have not talked to a single foreign policy analyst who believes that Tehran will abandon its aspirations to gain nuclear weapons under a renewed version of JPCOA. It will do what it has always done, which is lie, deceive, and impede legitimate inspections of its nuclear facilities while our feckless president trolls for a Nobel prize for his efforts to “stop proliferation.” He is neither respected nor feared in Tehran, and that is very dangerous.

Contrast this with Trump’s performance. In response to blatant meddling by Tehran in Iraq, he ordered the killing of Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, Iran’s alleged war criminal commander of the Quds Force, and threatened worse when the Iranians retaliated with a missile attack on a U.S. base in Iraq. Then, things got quiet until the 2020 election.

Trump was no warmonger while in office. He attempted to make peace with North Korea; when rebuffed by its leader, Trump wisely gave the effort up. Conversely, when insulted by Iran, Biden has upped the ante in inducements against the advice of the Israelis and other Middle Eastern players. The Iranians understand firmness. When they unwisely fired on U.S. forces during the Iran–Iraq war, then-President Ronald Reagan unleashed Operation Praying Mantis, taking out several Iranian military installations in the Persian Gulf. In contrast, Biden appears more than willing to reinforce failure.

Worse still, some observers, such as former State Department negotiator Matthew Zweig, believe that the president plans to circumvent congressional oversight of any agreement by claiming that he is merely overturning the executive orders negated by Trump when the former president pulled out of the original JCPOA. If the Democratic congressional leaders go along with that sham, they will be abrogating the oversight role of Congress in foreign policy. Whether one agrees with former Vice President Mike Pence’s decision to buck Trump on the Jan. 6, 2021, imbroglio, he upheld the independence of the legislative branch. It is doubtful if current Vice President Kamala Harris would challenge Biden even if she grasped the seriousness of the issue.

Iran is not a partner of the United States. It is a sworn enemy. It despises our values and is determined to become a nuclear power. Negotiating with it is folly, but folly has become the norm for this administration.

Biden’s Corruption of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships - The American Spectator,"In February, the Biden administration celebrated the “first anniversary of the reestablishment of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships.” Most Americans probably don’t even know such an office exists. George W. Bush had created it to give faith-based charities access to federal grants. But that’s clearly not Biden’s motivation for maintaining the office. In the case of Christian adoption and foster care agencies, Biden has blocked, not facilitated, access to federal money, which has resulted in a lawsuit against his administration.

For Biden, the office exists not to protect faith-based charities but to enlist them in his left-wing politics. The office’s supposed first-year accomplishments, according to his administration, include: pushing his vaccine mandates, fighting “systematic racism,” “strengthening pluralism,” supporting porous immigration policies, and advancing his climate change activism.

The office should be renamed the White House Office of Politicizing Faith-Based Charities. Its current work has nothing to do with religion per se. Biden’s use of the office would have brought a smile to the face of Saul Alinsky, the notorious community organizer who popularized the politicization of religion. An agnostic, Alinsky urged his disciples to exploit churches in their work, as they provide a “passport of morality,” reams of money, and organizational resources. In an interview with Playboy, Alinsky bragged about his easy manipulation of the Catholic Church in Chicago.

On all things COVID, the Biden administration has been openly Alinskyite, using churches to promote its decrees while denying religious exemptions to their members, a matter on which the administration continues to lose in court. Melissa Rogers, who heads up the White House Office of Faith-Based Charities and Neighborhood Partnerships, has written about the value of using churches as vaccine clinics: “Some Americans are far more comfortable getting their shot in a house of worship than in a doctor’s office. Seeing congregational leaders get vaccinated first can further relieve anxiety and be a powerful refutation of baseless conspiracy theories.” (READ MORE: Biden Coerces Christians)

In addition to roping the religious into the administration’s agenda, Rogers has been meeting with atheists. This is evidently part of the office’s new “religious equity” mandate. According to the White House “fact sheet” on its accomplishments, the office is “promoting religious equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility.” This is the Biden administration’s way of saying that previous presidents spent too much time focused on Christians, and that it is going to direct its energies to non-Christians.

Notice that the Biden administration, while dismissing the religious freedom claims of Christians, takes threats to Islamic religious expression very seriously. Rashad Hussain, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, tweeted out in February: “Religious freedom includes the ability to choose one’s religious attire. The Indian state of Karnataka should not determine permissibility of religious clothing. Hijab bans in schools violate religious freedom and stigmatize and marginalize women and girls.”

This is coming from the same administration that supports the participation of biological males in female sports and considers the objections of the Little Sisters of the Poor to Obama’s contraceptive mandate a “war on women.”

In Biden’s State of the Union address last week, he reiterated his support for the “Equality Act,” which would force religious hospitals to perform transgender surgeries. It is hard to imagine a more egregious violation of religious freedom than that one. Yet Biden’s office of faith-based charities can claim that Americans are free to live their “faith without fear.” Its aforementioned fact sheet speaks about “antisemitic, xenophobic, and bigoted attacks against people of faith — targeting synagogues, predominantly Black churches, and Muslim and Sikh communities, among other communities” — while saying nothing about anti-Christian bigotry.

The reason for that omission is simple: the Biden administration is practicing that bigotry. It automatically considers the historic teachings of Christianity on morality “discriminatory.” The only form of Christianity it will accept in the public square is a politicized one that aligns with temporal liberal goals. But that is just a Christianity without Christ, a subversion of religion that produces pols like Biden, who could tout abortion in his address last Tuesday, then turn up the next morning with ash on his forehead.

We often hear liberals say that they want church and state separate. But they don’t. They want the two conjoined, with religion reduced to a servant of the state. Their goal is to take religion out of religion and put politics into it. From time to time, they may fake an enthusiasm about the “unique” contribution of religion to public life, but in practice, they impede it and only permit its connection to government if it does government’s bidding.

It is for this reason that Biden’s “faith-based” office has no faith. Some have called the office pointless. But it is worse than pointless. It is an insidious corruption of religion.",https://spectator.org/biden-naming-commission-recommends-uss-chancellorsville-confederate-war-victories/,2022-03-06
