5 Reasons Why Republicans Failed in the Elections - The American Spectator,"Republicans imagined Nov. 8 to be Christmas arriving seven weeks early. They woke up excitedly only to unwrap boxes of broken glass and dog mess.

Political actors who passively expect to find victories gift-wrapped under the tree deserve such presents.

Why did expectations beat Republicans so decisively on Tuesday?

5. Dems Vote on 30 Election Days, Republicans Vote on 1

The math of encouraging our side to vote on one day while the other side uses over a month in some cases to ensure that its people cast ballots predictably gifts the other side an advantage. Democrats bested Republicans in early and mail-in ballots by 44 percent to 30 percent in New Hampshire, 69 percent to 21 percent in Pennsylvania, and 49 percent to 29 in Michigan. In Florida, where Ron DeSantis went out of his way to encourage early voting and Republicans administered an educational beatdown to Democrats, the GOP won the early and mail-in vote by 43 percent to 37 percent. Principle does not require conservatives who lament turning Election Day into Election Month from instructing supporters to not mark ballots on all but the last day of voting; stupidity does.

4. Hyper-politicized Is the New Normal

The people who politicize late-night comedy, sports, awards shows, and story hour at the local library, who boycott this cereal for where it advertises and that fast-food chain for the causes one of its owners once supported, naturally all vote. So long as this total-politics mindset — which its beneficiary, Joe Biden, ironically addressed Wednesday in saying that Americans “don’t want every day going forward to be a constant political battle” — prevails, kiss off the idea that in-power Democrats will take the foot off the gas during midterm elections. The hyper-politicized wear a uniform and come out to play for their team no matter the conditions (high inflation, sputtering gross domestic product, scary crime, massive deficits). That Democrats voted into the U.S. Senate a brain-damaged man who never held a real job prior to entering politics illustrates the hyper-partisan new normal.

3. Dobbs Animated the Abortion Demographic

The Dobbs decision energized pro-abortion voters and caused complacency in pro-life voters. The abortion demographic — unmarried women — favored Democrats over Republicans by 37 percentage points. Dobbs ratcheted up intensity; it also exposed that most of the people do not side with most of the angels on the issue. A tic that forces people to believe that majorities always believe what they believe prevents many from acknowledging this reality on abortion and so many other questions. In Kentucky — not exactly New York — a pro-life ballot question failed. Ballot measures swung in the direction of the pro-abortion side in Montana, California, Vermont, and Michigan, too. While one school of thought encourages Republicans to avoid talking about such an unpleasant issue that favors the opposition, another indicates that in imitating Teller rather than Penn conservatives ensure through their silence that voters hear one side of the argument.

2. The Faustian Bargain on S0-Called ‘Election Denial’

Donald Trump pathetically still talking about how he really won in a “landslide” reduces him to a Miss Havisham–like figure refusing to take off the wedding dress or throw away the decades-old wedding cake left on the table. The word for any politician mired in the past rather than talking about the present and future? Loser. Moreover, insisting that external injustices rather than internal defects caused a defeat robs one of the ability to correct mistakes. Trump making the donning of that frayed, yellowing gown a precondition of his support ensured primary victories and general defeats in winnable races in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and points beyond. Republicans ridiculed their opponents’ Jan. 6, 2021, obsession as distant from voters’ Nov. 8, 2022, concerns, but MAGA’s fixation on Nov. 3, 2020, strikes as not only more distant but cultish. Like Hare Krishnas, the members of this sect appear to one another as intensely devoted to something holy but as vacant and unsettling to everyone else.

1. Democrats Made It About Trump, and Trump Cooperated

An elderly billionaire with winning ideas but a loser’s ego started the 2022 cycle by putting pride ahead of principle (and party) in orchestrating a doomed primary challenge of solid conservative Brian Kemp in Georgia. He ended it by unwisely teasing a presumed presidential-run announcement and by calling Ron DeSantis, who turned out to be one of the saving graces for Republicans in 2022, “Ron DeSanctimonious” in a bizarre attack on a fellow conservative days before an election. In between, he emasculated J.D. Vance in front of his supporters by claiming that “J.D. is kissing my ass” for support and generally stole the stage from candidates he reduced to cheerleader roles. For an encore, he bragged that he got more votes in Florida than the night’s big Republican winner and kicked when down the losing candidates he supported. Democrats, savvy enough to see a loser where those with 2020 voter-fraud fixations saw winners, poured money into the primary campaigns of so-called MAGA candidates; all who won in the spring lost in November. While supporters of Trump loyalists blasted Mitch McConnell for pulling money from their favored candidates, Marc Thiessen dished hard facts in the Washington Post by noting that PACs affiliated with the Republican Senate leader spent $238 million on Republican candidates this cycle, while Trump’s PACs, despite raising $161 million, spent about $15 million. The Richie Aprile of American politics essentially told candidates he ostensibly supported, “If there’s anything you can do for me, let me know.”

Inflation at a 40-year high, an economy that shrank for two quarters this year, violent crime rising in large cities, a porous border, and events in Afghanistan and Ukraine highlighting the lack of respect for Biden all figured to make 2022 a strong year for Republicans, particularly in the context of the history of midterm elections serving humble pie to the party in power and reapportionment favoring the GOP. Instead, Democrats added governors, Republicans made single-digit or maybe low double-digit House gains, and the elections again look a better-than-even bet to stalemate the Senate.

Yes, encouraging developments occurred in New York and Florida, particularly in Miami-Dade County. And Republicans took the speaker’s gavel from Nancy Pelosi. But Democrats should and do celebrate 2022 as stealing victory from the jaws of defeat, and Republicans should and do mourn it as a missed opportunity.

Republicans need not passively sit by for another Election Day disappointment. They can take the corrective action.

They must address the early-voting gap by prioritizing mail-in ballots the way they once dominated on absentee ballots.

If conservatives wish to win elections and leave abortion to the states, then persuasively making the case for the people governing themselves instead of the courts imposing one-size-fits-all rules and championing babies — surely a more sympathetic interest group than grown men demanding a place in the woman’s locker room — needs to become a priority. One need not, and should not, fixate on such an indelicate subject around election time. But conservatives — not candidates but conservatives — who stay silent in an ongoing argument lose that argument.

Trump, a president who did right on foreign policy, immigration, judges, regulations, and so much else, cannot move on from his loss. So, Republicans must move on from him. This cure would prove worse than the disease if anyone interprets it as returning to the approach of the Romney-McCain-Bush era of squish Republicans. Fortunately, Virginia’s Glenn Youngkin in 2021 and Georgia’s Brian Kemp in 2022 offer a template. They won by deftly staying loyal to conservative principles without tethering themselves to the former president’s personal grievances. Embracing his ideas while ignoring him — the latter always a wise course when dealing with one suffering from a personality disorder involving narcissism — seems the best of many bad options.

Acknowledging defeat hurts. But winners, who offer congratulations rather than shout no fair, will find the key to future victories in current defeats.",https://spectator.org/5-reasons-why-republicans-failed-in-the-elections/,2022-11-11
"A Republic, But Only If We Can Keep It - The American Spectator","As Benjamin Franklin was leaving the Constitutional Convention, he was asked, “What have you given us?” He answered: “A Republic, if you can keep it.” That probably happened, but even if it didn’t, the exchange captures two fundamental truths about our Constitution.

Most of the attention has focused on the word “republic,” although in recent years that word has increasingly been misquoted as “democracy.” That mistake is both revealing and disturbing. The Founders knew their history; they understood the differences between a republic and a democracy, and with Plato and Aristotle, they approved of the former but not so much of the latter.

One key reason for their disapproval of direct, as opposed to representative democracy, was that disruptors like Donald Trump who talk a good game can get themselves elected in a direct democracy. They are less likely to prevail in a republic, which builds multiple levels of vetoes by elites into the selection process for leaders. That feature of democratic republics insures a modicum of consensus, which is necessary for government to function.

Unfortunately, the Electoral College never worked the way the Framers intended. States passed laws requiring their electors to vote in accordance with the popular vote in their state, rather than to exercise their independent judgment about who would be the best president. An extra-constitutional feature that once functioned to temper direct democracy with checks and balances was the selection of candidates by political parties rather than primary voters; since the 1970s, politicians have become independent policy entrepreneurs who no longer depend much on political parties.

It is inconceivable to me that a Donald Trump could have emerged as the candidate from the “smoke-filled rooms” that once reigned supreme at national presidential nominating conventions. He probably could not even have made it past a vote by party leaders such as the “super delegates” that the Democrats have wisely retained beginning on the second ballot at their nominating conventions.

We have gradually dismantled most of the features that once made us a republic, not a direct democracy. That has created the current crisis in which a democratically elected president is relentlessly opposed — and hated — by a large portion of the elites in our society but is popular enough with the people that he might well get re-elected. The response by the disloyal opposition, “the Resistance,” was described brilliantly by Attorney General Barr in his historic speech to the Federalist Society. Most of it is a sophisticated account of constitutional history and a defense of executive power against encroachment by the other branches, but what is most relevant for present purposes is that many people who should know better are so angry that they will stop at nothing in what they see as their sacred mission to obstruct President Trump. A sure sign confirming how bad things have gotten is that some “Nevers Trumpers” actually called for Barr’s impeachment for delivering what they called a “lunatic” speech to the “authoritarian” Federalist Society. Ever hear of the First Amendment guys? Ironically, they confirmed his point.

This level of hostility is puzzling because many of President Trump’s policies were once espoused by those who now revile them. A good example is pulling back the U.S. military from quasi-imperial missions to promote “stability” around the world. Ending “American imperialism” was the signature program of the Left in the wake of the Vietnam war, but if Trump wants to end “endless wars,” they now oppose it. Another example is building a wall on our southern border, which prominent Democrats including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Chuck Schumer all voted for when it was someone else’s wall.

A lot of the loathing of President Trump is stylistic. Vanity Fair called him a “vulgarian.” He is not the son of a great political family, nor did he work his way up through the ranks of politicians. He is a nouveau riche outsider from Queens and it shows. He delights in doing crude things that defy convention such as having affairs with porn stars, making public references to the size of his genitalia, and poking fun at the physical features of his opponents in Congress. These boorish behaviors are “not the way we do” in polite society. Worse yet, he does not consult with the career staff as they think he should, and that slight may yet be his downfall.

In view of the partisan mess that our country is now because the press and about half of the political establishment want to topple a duly elected president, we should all bear in mind a second aspect of Franklin’s famous answer that often goes unnoticed: its use of the singular indefinite article, “ A Republic,” or in the words of the Pledge of Allegiance, “one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.” But only if you can keep it.

Today it is increasingly in doubt whether one nation indivisible is something we can keep. We live in different worlds, depending upon our sources of information. The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said, “Everyone is entitled to his own opinions, but not his own facts.” How quaint and old-fashioned that seems; today both sides live in different realities created by CNN and MSNBC, or Fox News and Sean Hannity.

Recently the second edition of a book advocating the secession of Texas from the United States was published, Texit: Why and How Texas Will Leave The Union. There is also one about the secession of California, Calexit. It was originally a comic book about heroic revolutionaries who resist a fascist president who wants to deport all illegal aka “undocumented” immigrants. Somehow a comic book seems appropriate for that simplistic narrative about a complex problem, but the idea of California seceding is now also a serious movement.

A century and a half ago we fought the first American civil war over whether we would continue as one nation indivisible. I doubt whether any modern-day Lincoln would send troops to fight the secession of Texas or California; instead, like the Brits and the Scots in 2014, we’d probably hold a polite referendum.

My father told me that he and my mother had a deal: “We would discuss decisions, but if we couldn’t agree, she would make all of the little decisions and I would make all the big ones. After 45 years of marriage,” he continued, “we have not had to make any big decisions, but if we ever do, I intend to make them.” I chuckled, nodded and went on with my life as a clueless teenager. Years later I understood: in a marriage — as in a nation — there aren’t many “big” decisions that are worth putting the union itself at risk over.

A letter in Lincoln’s handwriting hangs on the wall of the Wadsworth Atheneum museum in Hartford. Lincoln personally was opposed to slavery, but in reply to abolitionist editor Horace Greeley, Lincoln maintained that even abolishing slavery was not worth sacrificing the union: “My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that.”

I don’t agree with Lincoln that saving the union was more important than abolishing slavery, but then, he is one of our greatest presidents and his letter shows how important he considered preserving our republic as a single nation.

As we consider the impeachment of Donald Trump, I hope that both sides will keep their grievances in perspective and remember that it is only “a Republic” if we can keep it. Or in the lingo that millennials understand, “Democracy … means sharing a country with ass–les you can’t stand.” Thank you for that, Bill Maher. Ben Franklin and Abe Lincoln are nodding and smiling.",https://spectator.org/a-republic-but-only-if-we-can-keep-it/,2019-11-19
The Answer to Every Mass-Shooting Whodunit: Republicans! - The American Spectator,"Bruce Willis merely saw dead people. Democrats see the Republicans who murdered them.

The latest manifestation of this supernatural power occurred in Colorado Springs, where an admitted heroin addict, arrested last year for threatening to bomb his own mother, murdered five strangers in a gay bar over the weekend. But, according to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the blame falls not in Colorado Springs but in Washington, D.C. Republicans did this.

“After Trump elevated anti-immigrant & anti-Latino rhetoric, we had the deadliest anti-Latino shooting in modern history,” AOC tweeted. “After anti-Asian hate w/COVID, Atlanta. Tree of life. Emanuel AME. Buffalo. And now after an anti-LGBT+ campaign, Colorado Springs. Connect the dots, @GOP.”

Whoever called Republicans the stupid party never tested AOC’s IQ.

Conspiracy theorists who talk a mile a minute about the Bilderbergers and WTC 7 and grassy knolls command others to “connect the dots.” Rational people operate on evidence.

Does anything beyond what kids do with a pencil support any of AOC’s dot-connecting?

In Uvalde, site of the “deadliest anti-Latino shooting in modern history,” locals remembered the shooter once walking around with a bag of dead cats (behavior typically observed at GOP conventions). His Wendy’s co-workers and participants on Yubo separately nicknamed him “school shooter.” A classmate says he picked fights and beat animals (an initiation rite of the Young Republicans).

Does AOC really believe Salvador Ramos drew from “anti-Latino rhetoric,” rather than his own demons, to murder those children and teachers?

In Buffalo, an insane, racist 18-year-old murdered 10 African Americans at a local grocery store. His strange behavior included wearing a full hazmat suit to school in response to COVID. He wrote a manifesto, and described himself as pro–gay rights, an atheist, and an environmentalist. The screed contains such statements as “There is no Green future with never ending population growth” and “If an ethnocentric European future is to be achieved global free markets and the trade of goods is to be discouraged at all costs.”

While his extremism uneasily fits in with either party, it seems far closer to AOC’s positions than to those of Kevin McCarthy or Ron DeSantis.

A reflexive blaming of ideological enemies for acts of great evil diagnoses an affliction far more sinister than politics on the brain. This tic reorients sympathy for the victims toward the political obsessions of politicians and journalists. It makes the murder of strangers about them. This is profoundly indecent. People who fall for it exhibit signs of delusional behavior. Professional journalists who recycle this worn template exhibit a disease less of the brain than of the soul.

Ironically, the tired narrative that the more reckless Democrats engaging in this ghoulishness advance posits that the killing stems from Republicans demonizing others. Psychologists call this projection. Laymen call it terribly convenient.

When James Hodgkinson, a volunteer for the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders, used Republican officeholders for target practice, guess whom the Left blamed?

“Somewhere in the 1990s,” Nancy Pelosi claimed, “Republicans decided on the politics of personal destruction as they went after the Clintons and that is the provenance of it and is what has continued.” She described the GOP as “sanctimonious” in the wake of the attempted slaughter on the baseball field. Daily Kos founder Markos Moulitsas bizarrely tweeted, “Republicans are getting what they want.”

The entire motive for progressives, after Jared Lee Loughner, after James Holmes, after Lee Harvey Oswald even, falsely blaming conservatives for murder stems from a desire to demonize people who do not think as they do. That, more so than murder, strikes fanatics as the most cardinal sin.

The gods did not bestow the gift to see dead people’s murderers upon all Democrats.

Jared Polis, the openly gay governor of Colorado who apparently lacks the sixth sense others in his party possess, explained: “We don’t yet know the specifics of why, what the motive was.”

We? He speaks for himself. The governor does not know the whys or whats in Colorado Springs. But a Millennial in the Bronx has a bead on the situation.

She always does.",https://spectator.org/answer-to-every-mass-shooting-whodunit-republicans/,2022-11-23
Anti-Trump Republicans Show Dysfunctional Love for the GOP - The American Spectator,"Washington

The Lincoln Project is a group of self-described alienated Republicans who want to make sure President Donald Trump loses in November.

Toward that end, the group has endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden for president.

Led by notables such as George Conway, who obsessively berates the boss of his wife, Kellyanne, on Twitter, as well as one-time GOP heavyweights Steve Schmidt and John Weaver, the group claims its goal is to reclaim the soul of the Republican Party.

That is impossible to believe, because they’re working not only to oust Trump but also to hand the Senate over to Democrats. If they succeed, the Democratic Party would control the White House and both houses of Congress. Every conservative policy they’ve allegedly worked to make happen would be trampled in a remorseless stampede of liberal activism.

They claim they are being true to the Constitution — as they clear the way for judges who see the indispensable document as the fruit of the poisonous tree.

In a December New York Times opinion piece, Lincoln founders wrote that they would punish Republicans who have exhibited a “craven acquiescence” to Trump.

Then whom do they pick on? Not the folks who wouldn’t care if Trump shot someone on Fifth Avenue.

The Lincoln Project has targeted vulnerable Republican senators like Maine’s Susan Collins. In a $1 million ad campaign, the group charges Collins “never stands up to Trump” and dismisses her as a “Trump stooge.” The male narrator also warned that Trump and McConnell “controlled her voice.”

Be it noted, Collins publicly announced in 2016 she would not vote for her party’s nominee. As she wrote in the Washington Post, Collins could not countenance the GOP nominee’s remarks about the disabled, a judge of Mexican heritage, and his disparaging of two Gold Star Muslim parents.

As proof, the ad offers Collins’ record of voting with Trump and McConnell 67.5 percent of the time — which in this hyper-partisan age shows unusual independence. By that FiveThirtyEight metric, Collins voted with GOP leadership less than any other Republican in the Senate.

In 2017, the Lugar Center named Collins the most bipartisan lawmaker in the Senate — because she works with people who have won elections.

Did I mention that the group raised $16.8 million from April through June — and a big chunk of that pile came from billionaire Democratic donors?

But you already figured that out.

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, investor Stephen Mandel gave $1 million to the Lincoln Project. Hollywood big shot David Geffen, Bain Capital exec Joshua Bekenstein, and billionaire Amos Hostetter, all big Dem donors, gave $100,000 to the project.

The Center describes the Lincoln Project as a “liberal” super PAC.

Some of that money, the Center noted, has found its way into the coffers of its “board members and firms run by them.”

I talked to Lincoln Project co-founder Mike Madrid, who told me, “I have not received any compensation at this point.” He added, “If I wanted to make money, I would have gotten involved in the grift that is the Trump campaign and Trump operation.”

A veteran GOP operative with an expertise in Latino voting trends, Madrid told me before he is a Republican, he is a conservative, and an American.

He is not coy about his belief that Trump is a racist who should have been impeached. Trump’s Thursday tweet in which he floated the idea delaying the Nov. 3 election should settle that score, he said.

Thus, the Lincoln Project has waged war, not just on Trump, but also “Trumpism,” which is a “threat to the Republic,” hence the decision to go after those who are enablers.

Collins did not vote to impeach Trump, Madrid said. So she has to go. If the Democrats take the Senate, so be it. He’s being true to his conservative principles.

There is a true French Revolution fervor to the Lincoln Project’s bid to punish not just Trump but those associated with him — and there is no such thing as too much character assassination.

The group also popped out a nasty ad about Ivanka Trump, the president’s elder daughter and senior adviser that lampoons her “Find Something New” campaign, which helps workers find more fulfilling career paths outside the traditional four-year college route.

“You can even get a job in the White House. Just ask daddy,” the bubbly Valley Girl narrator offers.

They don’t mention Ivanka Trump doesn’t cash a paycheck. Really, it’s just plain mean that they have attacked her for trying to help non-college graduates, a wonky issue that she has embraced, adopting wonk lingo, using “partner” as a verb and spending way too much time with put-a-mirror-under-his-nose-to-see-if-he’s-alive Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross because she cares about this agenda.

The ad is a primal scream of outrage that Ivanka Trump isn’t the shallow fashionista they want her to be.

The streets have given testament to rage on the American Left. Social media are the venue for rage among the American Right. Here you see the fury of the GOP’s no-longer-wanted luminaries. They say they love the country. They say they’re going after bad Republicans because they love their party. Yeah, right. Women know that kind of love. It’s the kind that drives a man to his nightstand where he thinks he will find the answer to his pain. And when he points that barrel at his wife, he’ll call it love. But what he is thinking is: If I can’t have you, nobody can.

Biden’s Banana Republic - The American Spectator,"Left-wing tyrants are famous for calling their ramshackle one-party states “democratic.” Joe Biden’s endless blather about democracy while treating his political opponents as “domestic enemies” belongs to this tradition. He equates democracy with unchallenged liberal tyranny. What he calls “threats” to democracy are nothing more than instances of public resistance to his attempts to build a one-party state in America. He wants docility, not democracy, and seeks to eliminate his political foes as crudely as any tinpot leader of a banana republic.

In the Clinton era, the Democrats sought to eliminate their political opponents a little more subtly. They set up “civility commissions” and the like to try and minimize the influence of Rush Limbaugh and company. But now they favor the most baldly undemocratic measures, rejoicing in Silicon Valley’s silencing of conservatives, the Justice Department’s targeting of parents as “terrorists,” and the drive to prevent the people from voting for Donald Trump again.

How is any of this different than a banana republic where one party ascends to power and uses it to wipe out its political opponents? This week’s announcement that the Justice Department is setting up a special unit to hassle conservatives under the guise of battling “domestic terrorism” befits the criminalization of political differences that mark a banana republic.

Sounding like cronies to a banana republic dictator, former CIA Director John Brennan and former high-ranking FBI official Andrew McCabe urge Biden to prosecute his political opponents. At the beginning of the Biden administration, Brennan, an old admirer of the Soviet Union (he once admitted that he voted for its plant in American politics, Gus Hall), burbled over the repression of conservatives to come:

I know looking forward that the members of the Biden team, who have been nominated or have been appointed, are now moving in laser-like fashion to try to uncover as much as they can about what looks very similar to insurgency movements that we’ve seen overseas. Where they germinate in different parts of the country, and they gain strength, and it brings together an unholy alliance, frequently, of religious extremists, authoritarians, fascists, bigots, racists, nativists — even libertarians.

McCabe calls mainstream conservatives violent: “It’s entirely possible that when the intelligence community, the law enforcement community, looks out across this mainstream… they didn’t assume that that group of people business owners, white people from the suburbs, educated, employed, presented a threat of violence. And now we know very clearly that they do.”

That these two left-wing political hacks held enormous power in American government illustrates its reduction to the status of a banana republic. The same staggering partisan recklessness that drove them to spy on Trump as a Putin mole undergirds their advice to Biden. Their essential counsel — throw your political opponents in jail — is exactly what you would hear within the governing circles of Castro’s Cuba.

Dictatorship, not democracy, is the terminus of modern liberalism. Wherever it prevails, democratic participation shrinks, not grows. The fundamentally transformed America of Biden’s imagination is just a left-wing autocracy in which judges and ruling-class mandarins deprive the people of democratic choice and cut them off from the Constitution.

In his ludicrous speech on Tuesday, Biden cast his annoyance at democracy as a fight for its “soul.” His whole agenda is to kill that soul and render the people servile. A president who treats half the country like dangerous dissidents, while celebrating flag boycotts and pumping critical race theory into America’s schools, has no interest in a democratic future for America. His goal is simply the consolidation and expansion of liberal power.

Many of the defining features of a banana republic appear under Biden: the cheap demagoguery about the rights of the “people” even as they lose those rights, the routine portrayal of political opponents as traitors, open political prosecutions for trumped-up offenses, and demands that the party in power be able to curtail the free speech of critics.

Biden says that the Democrats are the party of voters’ rights — the same party that wants to deny voters the choice of voting for Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton says that another Trump run could be the “end of democracy.” Such absurd and contradictory rhetoric smacks of the election-rigging in banana republics, where leaders get to determine who can and can’t run against them. What the Democrats call threats to democracy are merely proofs of it.",https://spectator.org/biden-banana-republic/,2022-01-13

How Republicans Can Keep Rebuilding the COVID Economy - The American Spectator,"Donald Trump and the Republican Congress brought the U.S. economy to life after Barack Obama gave us eight years of the weakest recovery since World War II. The partial shutdown of the economy driven by COVID fears reversed those gains, and yet by Election Day 2020, unemployment had fallen from a high of 14.7 percent to 6.9 percent, the stock market rebounded, and GDP growth exploded with a V-shaped recovery.

Republicans turned the economy around once, and then again. What will it take to keep us on pace to keep China and Europe in the rear-view mirror?

When President Trump was elected in November 2016, the S&P 500 jumped 5 percent before he even took office. Investors knew he planned to reduce business and individual taxes and that the threatened spending, taxes, and regulations of a Hillary Clinton presidency had evaporated.

The late 2017 tax bill brought the corporate tax rate from 35 percent — the highest in the world — to 21 percent, below China’s 25 percent but above Ireland’s 12.5 percent. The Trump tax cut also ended the U.S. policy of a worldwide corporate income tax that taxed profits of American companies when they brought their earnings back to the U.S. and after they had already paid taxes on those earnings in other nations, such as France or Japan. Several trillions of dollars in U.S. profits held in limbo overseas were made available for investment in the United States.

The lower corporate income tax drove stock prices up, and investment capital flowed to U.S. firms. Employers created new jobs, expanded operations, and increased wages, benefits, and bonuses. Walmart raised its starting wage to $11. No minimum wage law required — rather real, sustainable growth.

Individual tax rates were reduced at every tax bracket. The per-child tax credit was doubled from $1,000 to $2,000 and extended from twenty-two million to thirty-three million American families. The median income family of four received a $2,000 tax cut. The median income single parent with one child got a $1,300 tax cut.

Repealing the Trump tax cut would gouge the American middle-class family.

With Trump, regulations were significantly reduced, and the Obama–Biden–Clinton plans for ever more regulatory costs were brought to a halt.

The good news after the 2020 election is that a likely Republican Senate means Biden cannot repeal or reduce the pro-growth value of the 2017 tax cuts. Some of those tax cuts were enacted for ten years, and some, like the corporate income tax rate reduction, were made permanent. That is the base of a strong pro-jobs, pro-investment environment upon which we can build.

For the next two years, a Republican Senate will likely stand between Biden and Pelosi and their ability to repeal the GOP tax cuts. Executive orders and regulations will dribble out, slowing growth and killing too many jobs. But in 2022, Pelosi’s House, with its greatly reduced Democrat majority, will run for reelection with the millstone of their radical rantings and House legislation that never passed the Senate around their necks. As in 1994 in reaction to Clinton’s leftward lunge and 2010’s reaction to Obama, the Republicans will retake the House and strengthen their majority in the Senate.

Then, when Biden wants anything, the Republicans will have a wish list of pro-growth policies that they can demand for any spending plans Biden hopes to enact.

The following policies have wide support in the Republican caucus and would help us build on the GOP’s and Trump’s progress on tax reduction and deregulation:

End the taxation of inflation in capital gains. Today, Americans pay capital gains tax on the gain they earn when they sell a home, building, land, or stock. They pay tax on the real increase in value and the accumulated inflation. By executive order the president could rule that capital gains taxes would only be levied on the real, non-inflation gain of any sale.

End the double taxation of Americans who work abroad. We fixed the double taxation of American companies earning profits abroad. But individual Americans who work in, say, France pay both French income taxes and American income taxes. Only two countries do something that stupid: Eritrea and the United States. Ending this would make Americans working overseas more competitive.

Protect the three million students now in charter schools from the teachers’ unions’ demands that charter schools — free of union control — be defunded. Republicans saved the Washington D.C. Opportunity Scholarships from Obama. They can save charter school students across the nation from Biden and the NEA.

Don’t allow infrastructure spending without reforming the permitting process to reduce the time to build a new road or bridge. This would greatly reduce the cost of new construction.

Protect independent contractor laws from the demands of labor unions that everyone has to have a boss and be a target of unionization. Labor unions and Democrats enacted Assembly Bill 5, the California law banning ride-sharing and delivery drivers from being self-employed, independent contractors. Californians sent a shot across the bow of the Democrats and union bosses by scaling back that law through the initiative process on Election Day 2020.

End or restrict the Jones Act and the Davis–Bacon Act. The Jones Act increases the cost of shipping goods between American ports, and the Davis–Bacon Act mandates union wages on any federally funded construction.

Rein in the runaway cost of entitlements with the Paul Ryan reform that blocks grants for all welfare programs to the states and limits their growth to the increase in wages (once we have a GOP House, Senate, and White House). This would have happened already, but we lost that Senate seat in Alabama, weakening the Senate majority.

Put a knife in the politics of envy and class hatred by expanding the investor class. Already there are more than one hundred million Americans with a 401(k) or IRA. Fifty-three percent of U.S. families have such an account, and they see that the strength of corporate after-tax earnings is highly correlated with the increase in their lifetime savings. One hundred million owners of IRAs or 401(k)s are a less appealing target than “the 1 percent.”",https://spectator.org/category/news/,2021-01-01
Five Quick Things: Scenes From a Post-Republic - The American Spectator,"With deference to Lin Wood and Sidney Powell, and deference to Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, Victoria Toensing, Joe diGenova, and the others who have been fighting the good fight to save the American republic from the catastrophic damage a stolen presidential election would wreak, it doesn’t look good.

There are items worthy of optimism. There are court cases winding their way through the system, and there are, here and there, a few victories. There are state legislatures, even among those states whose systems abjectly failed on November 3, in which movements are afoot to decertify the results given claims of deeply flawed and illegally processed balloting.

But at the end of the day, what those of us appalled by the irregularities and highly suspicious manipulation that produced a nonsensical result — an unsellable candidate with no demonstrated appeal who ran a moribund public campaign, had no coattails whatsoever, whose vote was more noticeably isolated to Democrat-controlled large cities than ever before, and yet produced a higher vote total than any in American history — are doing is hoping against hope for some deus ex machina to save us from Bidenlonian Captivity.

Your author is also hoping that something will come along. Joe Biden as the American president in 2021 is every bit the disaster Herbert Hoover was in 1929 or James Buchanan was in 1857. A Biden administration portends catastrophe on fronts economic, technological, geopolitical, cultural and military. We can’t afford him, and we especially can’t afford the people who control him.

And yet the deus ex machina we are continually promised seems to slip away. It didn’t come in the Pennsylvania cases, though it should have. It didn’t come with the “kraken.” It didn’t come with Lin Wood’s Georgia suit. It didn’t come with Texas v. Pennsylvania. And now, it doesn’t appear to have come with the DNI report on foreign meddling in the election the Friday release of which has been scratched.

We’re hurtling toward January 20, and half the voting public will believe that the election is stolen and the republic is finished.

So what does a post-republic look like? Well …

1. Theft by a Thousand Cuts

The latest formerly highly respected American destined to be trashed by our corporate media as a loon and a crank is Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro, an old Washington hand well known in economic circles as a trusted adviser to both sides of the aisle. Navarro produced a report Thursday entitled “THE IMMACULATE DECEPTION: Six Key Dimensions of Election Irregularities,” which assembled all the available evidence from witness affidavits in court filings, statistical evidence, and official and other sources to build a matrix of findings in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona.

From the report:

From the findings of this report, it is possible to infer what may well have been a coordinated strategy to effectively stack the election deck against the Trump-Pence ticket. Indeed, the observed patterns of election irregularities are so consistent across the six battleground states that they suggest a coordinated strategy to, if not steal the election outright, strategically game the election process in such a way as to “stuff the ballot box” and unfairly tilt the playing field in favor of the Biden-Harris ticket.

Navarro’s formulation was that “This was theft by a thousand cuts across six dimensions and six battleground states rather than any one single ‘silver bullet’ election irregularity.” And he furthermore challenged that “Those journalists, pundits, and political leaders now participating in what has become a Biden Whitewash should acknowledge the six dimensions of election irregularities and conduct the appropriate investigations to determine the truth about the 2020 election. If this is not done before Inauguration Day, we risk putting into power an illegitimate and illegal president lacking the support of a large segment of the American people.”

When you have old hands like Navarro sounding alarm bells about the election, only to be slapped down by entities like Forbes magazine, which attacked the Navarro report as hinging “on debunked allegations that have largely been rejected when raised in court, and one nonpartisan ethics watchdog criticized Navarro for writing it,” and the “nonpartisan ethics watchdog” cited happens to be the far-left Citizens for Responsible Ethics in Washington (CREW), one of the more shamelessly partisan attack dogs the Democrats have (quoted in the Forbes piece is CREW’s Deputy Director Donald Sherman, a “nonpartisan” former staffer for Elijah Cummings), we no longer have the honest political dialogue a republic needs.

2. Unity, or You’re Gonna Get It

In a republic of laws, no presidential candidate, successful or otherwise, would put himself above the integrity of the process. Biden has blatantly flouted that convention, forming a fraudulent “office of the president-elect” and then demanding unity under his leadership while dozens of cases contesting questionable results were still traveling through the courts. When electors were seated on December 14, those demands began taking on the character of threats.

“In America, politicians don’t take power,” he said during a speech that featured nonstop coughing dismissed by Biden as the product of a cold. “People grant power to them. The flame of democracy was lit in this nation a long time ago. And we now know nothing — not even a pandemic or an abuse of power — can extinguish that flame.”

Considering that the very people he’s trying to settle down quite reasonably believe that the pandemic to which he’s referring was used as a vehicle for polluting America’s electoral system with highly vulnerable mail-in ballots, and their introduction in contravention to state election law laid down by state legislators as provided for in the Electors Clause of Article II of the Constitution was the very definition of an abuse of power by secretaries of state, governors, and courts in the disputed states, there could have been no more in-your-face statement from Biden’s mouth.

“Respecting the will of the people is at the heart of our democracy, even if we find those results hard to accept,” he went on to say. “That’s the duty owed to the people, to our constitution, to our history. You know, in this battle for the soul of America democracy prevailed. We the people voted. Faith in our institutions held. The integrity of our elections remains intact.”

If you don’t accept the results of this election, you’re apparently in dereliction of your duty as a citizen. Considering that immediately following the announcement of Biden as the winner of the election a gaggle of leftists inspired by AOC began flogging something called the Trump Accountability Project, which sought to ruin the professional and personal lives of people who had worked for the president, before a public backlash shot that idea down, it isn’t hard to see what’s coming for those who don’t meet Joe Biden’s standard of “duty.”

That standard, by the way, doesn’t apply to the people who refused to accept the 2016 election, as many of them, for example Neera Tanden and Jennifer Granholm, are slated for cabinet jobs in a Biden administration.

3. Everything Smells Like China

It isn’t necessary to recount the Eric Swalwell story, or how a Chinese spy named Fang Fang apparently plied him with sexual favors in order to compromise him as a member of the House Intelligence Committee. Axios did the work on Swalwell; in a functional and viable republic he would have resigned from public life in disgrace, never again to have his name mentioned in polite company. The word “treason” would be somewhat appropriate to bandy about in connection with his scandal, particularly in light of the Chinese Communist infiltration of our ruling class.

That infiltration is so pervasive the Chinese are actually bragging about it. By now you’ve surely seen the video of the vice dean of the School of International Relations at Beijing’s Renmin University Di Dongsheng, speaking to a live audience on a television broadcast, claiming that the Chicoms have had fixers on Wall Street taking care of all their American problems since the 1970s. The professor also confirmed, from the ChiCom end, everything said about Hunter Biden’s Chinese dealings.

But even without our national Di Dongsheng moment the level of nonchalance toward the Chinese infiltration apparent in our political class was inescapable. Consider House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s reaction when a group of House Republicans questioned Swalwell’s involvement on the Intelligence Committee. “I don’t have any concern about Mr. Swalwell,” was her response.

In a functional republic, a statement like that would mark Pelosi as a threat to national security for having taken so dismissive a position toward foreign intelligence services compromising members of her intelligence committee. But we are in a post-republic, in which it’s fair to question whether there are any California Democrats who are not compromised as Swalwell is. But give Pelosi some credit; so far she hasn’t awarded Swalwell a congressional medal for his alleged Fang Fang bang-bang, as former DNC press flack Brad Woodhouse suggested.

Of course, the single most China-compromised politician in America is Joe Biden. After helping to make him our “president-elect,” the corporate media is now willing to report on that fact. It almost feels like our elites, even some who formerly rebelled, feel safe to admit that they’re kowtowing to China and so should we.

4. A Hypocracy of Hypocrisy

Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo is the latest member of our “do as I say, not as I do” COVIDcrats who impose restrictions and mandates on the plebes with no intention of following them herself. Raimondo, just four days after demanding her subjects, er, constituents stay home, was photographed attending a wine and paint event at a Providence bar.

No mask on. Of course. Right after tweeting, “Please, stay home except for essential activities & wear a mask anytime you’re with people you don’t live with.”

A functional republic would have shot down most of these COVID restrictions from the very beginning, or at least once it was patently obvious they do more harm than good. But the cowardice of the American judiciary in failing, outside of a few exceptions, to pull the ruling class off the necks of the public has emboldened the Gavin Newsoms and Gretchen Whitmers of the world to make a mockery of American civil rights amid the spread, which they cannot control, of a virus with a 99.8 percent survival rate.

Not only are they hypocrites. They’re members of our new Hypocracy — government by the largest hypocrites available. The more false sanctimony, the higher the political reward.

5. What Happens Next?

A warning: anything goes in a post-republic. When the guardrails are taken down, and when the rules agreed on for a quarter of a millennium are thrown in the garbage, the opponents of the old-fashioned racist, sexist, patriarchal, homophobic, and otherwise-mean America as founded might well be disappointed to find that they don’t actually get to dictate the terms of the post-republic.

Does anyone think Joe Biden will get to reshape America in the months before he himself is reshaped out of the White House? You would have to be naive to believe that. Biden isn’t in control of anything. Does anyone believe Kamala Harris is up to the job as Biden’s successor? And does anyone believe that the American people will stand for what’s coming?

Oh, sure, you say, but the folks are too comfortable and too soft. They lack the bite to make any real trouble.

This might be true today. But let Biden destroy 10 million energy jobs. Let him waste American lives in a pointless war in some faraway part of the world as the globalist gang in Washington is addicted to doing, while China exercises its strategic will on, say, Taiwan. Let his “100 days to beat COVID” linger as “15 days to flatten the curve” has, with the attendant disaster among small businesses across America. Let the cultural Marxist aggressions step even further into transgender insanity and mandatory struggle sessions around “white privilege.” Let all the reasons a Joe Biden presidency is so dangerous begin to manifest themselves.

That’s when you see the real effects of the post-republic. Because those are not pretty. From Rome to Germany to Chile, history shows us that the post-republic is won by those willing to do whatever it takes to win the post-republic.

And everything our ruling class is doing and has done has been based on perverting our current rules, which disappear when the public stops believing in them.

Steal an election, and you break the republic. What comes after may break you.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/,2020-12-18
FBI Seizes Republican Congressman’s Cellphone - The American Spectator,"Republican Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania said that the FBI seized his cellphone on Tuesday while he was traveling with his family. According to Perry, a trio of FBI agents approached him with a warrant and demanded that he hand over the phone. Perry said that the agents “made no attempt” to contact his lawyer, who he says could have arranged for a handover of the cellphone. Perry said he was “outraged — though not surprised — that the FBI under the direction of Merrick Garland’s DOJ, would seize the phone of a sitting Member of Congress.”

According to a source who spoke with CNN, the seizure of Perry’s phone is connected with an investigation by the Department of Justice’s inspector general, who is also investigating other officials who sought to prevent the certification of the 2020 election.

Perry said that the phone contains information about his political and legislative dealings, along with communications with his wife, constituents, and friends.

Perry linked the seizure of his cellphone to the FBI’s Monday raid on former President Donald Trump’s residence at Mar-a-Lago. Perry referred to both the raid and seizure of his phone as “banana republic tactics” which were “unnecessary and aggressive.” Perry also said that the raid was particularly troubling in the context of the recent hiring of 87,000 IRS agents, which he suspected have been hired “to further persecute law-abiding Citizens.”

Perry has become known as a loyal supporter of Donald Trump, lending support to Trump’s claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent and opposing certification of the vote. Perry has attracted the attention of the Jan. 6 committee because of his communications with Trump prior to Jan. 6, 2021.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/a-further-perspective/,2022-08-10
The Hong Kong Banana Republic: China Scraps Primary - The American Spectator,"The Chinese government has invalidated Hong Kong’s primary elections after massive turnout spurred pro-democracy candidates to likely win control of Hong Kong’s city council in September. This weekend’s primary was the first election since the implementation of the controversial national security law at the end of June.

Were this electoral outcome to remain, pro-democracy candidates would likely have won up to 45 seats in the general election, according to primary organizer Benny Tai. This is well above the 35-seat majority required to put local leaders in control of the 70-seat city council. Instead, China has put their hand on the scales to ensure the candidates will not be seated.

While some democratic activists, like Umbrella Revolution founder Joshua Wong, have backed down in the face of the national security law passed in late June, this weekend proved there is still a hunger for democracy in Hong Kong. An estimated 600,000 Hong Kongers turned out to vote, far above activists’ initial expectations. Most estimates put primary turnout at 13 percent. This would have made it the primary with the highest turnout in Hong Kong since the 1997 handover.

Beijing and Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam stepped in late Monday night to ensure pro-democracy candidates would not gain control of the city council. They declared the election a violation of the national security law due to the political stances of the pro-democracy activists expected to win. As of now, the election has been invalidated and pro-democracy candidates are under investigation. The conclusions of the investigation will likely determine the makeup of the September general election.

Lam told the press, “If this so-called ‘primary’ election’s purpose is to achieve the ultimate goal of delivering what they call a ‘35+’ [majority seats] with the objective of objecting to, resisting every policy initiative of the Hong Kong SAR government, then it may fall into the category of subverting the state power, which is now one of the four types of offences under the new national security law.”

The logic itself is lunacy. How does an opposition party winning elections serve as a national security threat? Lam exercises a slippery-slope argument that if China lets Hong Kongers get this electoral victory, it will ultimately result in subversion of the Chinese Communist Party. But as Tai points out, “How can a power that is recognised by the Basic Law be breaching the national security law?” Pro-democracy candidates have declared their intentions to work within the confines of the Hong Kong governing documents to oppose Chinese takeover.

While never fooling anybody, China has shown its hand: this national security law will be used to crush any dissent in Hong Kong. Voters received no warning that the primary in which they were voting was a threat to national security. Only now that the results of the election were revealed to be disastrous for CCP control over Hong Kong, the elections are deemed a national security risk.

Is this the future of Hong Konger democracy? Elections and primaries are only valid when the ruling party remains in power? We should expect little more from the thugs in the CCP, yet this flagrant shirking of democratic norms and destroying the facade of one country, two-systems policy is deeply unsettling nevertheless.

China’s meddling in the primary shows its willingness to use the national security law aggressively during the general election onward.

China could be just playing with its new toy to put dissidents in their place in the hopes they will fall in line by the September election. More likely, however, is that since China is willing to invalidate an electorally meaningless primary, they are comfortable invalidating a general election.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/another-perspective/,2020-07-15
House Republicans Stand Up for Newsmax — And Free Speech - The American Spectator,"What is it with the intolerance of liberal elites?

DirecTV has targeted the conservative Newsmax for removal from the DirecTV platform because Newsmax is — gasp! — conservative. (And full disclosure, I am a Newsmax contributor.)

Over there at the Washington Examiner is a report that the Examiner has exclusively obtained a letter to DirecTV signed by over 40 House Republicans that accuses DirectTV of obeying Democrat calls to censor conservative media. The letter is addressed to John Stankey, the CEO of AT&T, William Morrow, the CEO of DirecTV, and Jon Winkelried, the CEO of TPG Capital.

The Examiner story reported that freshman Republican Rep. Wesley Hunt, the author of the letter along with 40 other GOP House members, told the Examiner this:

“I am deeply troubled by DirecTV’s decision to remove Newsmax from their lineup of channels,” Hunt said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “Deplatforming Newsmax is the latest development in the Left’s ongoing campaign to purge voices they disagree with from the public sphere. This decision by DirecTV and TPG Capital will cut off tens of millions of viewers who rely on Newsmax for their news and information.” …..“If Newsmax is removed from DIRECTV, in less than a year House Republicans will have lost two of the three cable news channels that reach conservative voters on a platform that primarily serves conservative-leaning areas of the country,” they wrote in the letter.

For its part, a DirecTV spokesman told the Examiner:

We deliver Newsmax to our national base of satellite and IPTV customers today at no cost to the programmer or our customers, ultimately offering Newsmax the ability to generate considerable advertising revenue at no cost … We’ve discussed with Newsmax on several occasions that we’d like to offer their programming, however, the network is now seeking significant fees that we cannot pass on to our broad customer base. Additionally, the same programming offered by Newsmax today is already available at no charge to 100% of U.S. households including our customers via NewsmaxTV.com, YouTube.com and on multiple streaming platforms like Amazon Fire TV, Roku and Google Play.

What is going on here?

The obvious answer is a full-out attack on conservative media with the objective of silencing it completely.

In fact, this is but the latest round in an attack on conservative media by House Democrats that began on Feb. 22, 2021, when, as the letter says:

Democratic members of the Energy and Commerce Committee wrote to AT&T and DIRECTV encouraging the censorship of conservative television networks One America News Network (OANN), Fox News, and NEWSMAX. Given the jurisdiction of the Energy and Commerce Committee over your companies’ business interests, it is reasonable to assume you took this letter seriously and complied with these demands. Indeed, less than one year later, on January 14. 2022. AT&T and DIRECTV notified OANN that you would no longer carry its programming, a separation that became final on April 5, 2022.

The letter also points to a stunning DirecTV conflict of interest. The platform carries “11 liberal news and information channels including Vice Media. The same individuals who sit on DirecTV’s board of directors also sit on Vice Media’s board of directors.” Curiously, the letter notes that “Vice Media appears to receive higher fees than Newsmax is requesting despite having a fraction of the audience.”

Is there no wonder why House Republicans have set up a House Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, chaired by incoming House Judiciary Committee Jim Jordan of Ohio?

That this latest move to silence conservative media is here is no surprise. Over the years, leftist elites have targeted the late Rush Limbaugh, Fox’s Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, and Laura Ingraham, and others for removal from their various radio and TV platforms. Years ago, the Clinton administration targeted The American Spectator for silencing because it couldn’t stand our magazine’s serious Clinton investigations, which included looking into the sexual antics of the then president.

The assault on Newsmax is merely the latest along these lines.

The hard fact here is that the American Left, whether in the media or beyond in other fields like academia, Hollywood, sports, and more has at its root the fascist impulse to silence all dissent, particularly from conservatives.

This time the target is Newsmax.

The next time it could be you.

"If Republicans Lost Races Due to Abortion, It’s Because They Didn’t Fight Back - The American Spectator","It appears that the issue of abortion played a significant role in the underperformance of Republicans in the midterm elections. According to the Washington Times, abortion “was the second most pressing issue on voters’ minds … [after] the economy.” The results — especially in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New Mexico — signal that statewide candidates who ran on a pro-abortion platform picked a winning issue. In California, Michigan, and Vermont, constitutional amendments to guarantee a “right” to abortion easily won support.

Even more worrisome for the pro-life movement, the voters in Kentucky rejected a pro-life provision to the state’s constitution, while a proposed provision to require medical professionals to make efforts to save the life of a baby born after a botched abortion was defeated in Montana. President Joe Biden, a professed Roman Catholic, announced that he would veto any GOP attempt to pass legislation that restricts or abolishes abortion. Politics in the next decade or so will likely determine what President Ronald Reagan called “the conscience of the nation” on abortion.

Today’s Democratic Party approaches abortion as a religion. The days of pro-life Democrats are long past. And very few Republican officials, especially in the wake of the disappointing midterms, appear ready to lead the fight to protect the unborn. That would be a mistake. If in fact the Republicans lost some elections in the midterms because of the abortion issue, they lost because they didn’t fight. Republicans mostly ignored the issue or downplayed it even as Democrats called them “extremists.” Republicans focused on the economy, inflation, high energy prices, illegal immigration, and rising crime rates in Democrat-run cities. Meanwhile, Democrats ran ad after ad calling Republicans “too extreme” on abortion. Republicans never answered those ads. Republicans failed to portray Democratic candidates who support unrestricted abortion up to the moment of birth — and sometimes even beyond that — as “too extreme.”

And Republicans should look at the electoral success of GOP governors who supported and signed very restrictive abortion laws. Every GOP governor who signed an abortion ban won reelection easily.

Here is the list and their victory margins:

• Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey won by 38 points

• Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis won by 19 points

• Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp won by 8 points

• Idaho Gov. Brad Little won by 40 points

• Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds won by 19 points

• Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine won by 26 points

• Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt won by 14 points

• South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster won by 17 points

• South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem won by 27 points

• Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee won by 33 points

• Texas Gov. Greg Abbott won by 11 points

• Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee won by 33 points

• Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon won by 62 points

Recent surveys also show that most Americans favor some restrictions on abortion, and only 8 percent of Americans believe abortion should be legal up to the moment of birth.

Yet, GOP candidates in battleground states did not attempt to portray Democratic candidates who favored no restrictions on abortion as extremists. They effectively left the abortion battlefield to their opponents and suffered as a result.

In 1983, a year before President Ronald Reagan faced reelection, he wrote an essay in the Human Life Review titled “Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation.”

It appeared in book form the following year with afterwords by C. Everett Koop and Malcolm Muggeridge, two staunch opponents of abortion.

Stephen Hayward noted that Reagan’s political advisers “were nervous about publishing such an article so close to his reelection campaign,” but Reagan’s response to their concern was: “I might not be reelected. We’re going with it now.”

Reagan, as we know, won a 49-state landslide despite his “extremist” pro-life position. Fred Barnes, writing in the Wall Street Journal, later called Reagan the “father of the pro-life movement.”

Reagan did not shy away from the fight to protect the unborn. Neither should today’s Republicans. That is the real lesson of the midterm losses this year.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/biden-watch/,2022-11-12
"In Northeast Pennsylvania, Pro-Life Means Republican - The American Spectator","There was a time not that long ago when virtually every candidate for political office in Northeastern Pennsylvania was pro-life, out of either conviction or political necessity. In this old, coal-mining region where European immigrants — many of the Roman Catholic faith — put down roots and raised families, to be “pro-choice” (i.e., pro-abortion) was religious and political heresy. And it didn’t matter if you were Republican or Democrat. That is no longer the case.

In pre-pandemic 2020, and just the other day (Nov. 5) in 2022, I attended the annual Prayer Breakfast of the Scranton Chapter of Pennsylvanians for Human Life. It was their 38th annual event. Two years ago, the principal speaker was former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, and the event venue was dotted with Republican candidates for local, state, and national office. I don’t recall seeing any Democrat officeholders or candidates. This year, Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, another former Trump adviser, appeared via live video, and the principal speaker was the Rev. Gerald E. Murray, a Catholic priest who frequently appears on EWTN, Fox News, and other media outlets. Again, the event venue was dotted with local Republican officeholders and candidates. There were no Democrat officeholders or candidates in sight.

One of the speakers at this year’s Prayer Breakfast was Ernie Preate Jr., the former attorney general of Pennsylvania who argued Planned Parenthood v. Casey before the Supreme Court, a case that upheld Pennsylvania’s law that imposed certain legal restrictions on abortions but did not reverse Roe v. Wade. (Full disclosure: I worked for Preate when he was district attorney of Lackawanna County and Pennsylvania attorney general.) Preate, a Republican, worked closely with then-Gov. Robert P. Casey, a Democrat, to fashion and defend a law that would pass constitutional muster. Preate and his entire family have been longtime members of the pro-life movement in Pennsylvania — his two brothers and one of his daughters were in attendance at the Prayer Breakfast.

Preate at the age of 82 still practices law and still has the ability to wow an audience. He praised the recent Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, which reversed Roe and Casey, but he told the audience that the pro-life fight has merely shifted from the Supreme Court to the state legislatures and governors’ offices throughout the nation. Dobbs, he noted, didn’t outlaw abortion; it merely returned that policy issue back to the individual states. And he noted further that some state appellate courts have ruled that their state constitutions protect abortion rights, and other state courts may do likewise. So, the struggle to protect the unborn goes on in the wake of Dobbs.

Father Murray, who studied canon law at Rome’s Pontifical Gregorian University, noted that in many states after Dobbs, abortions have dramatically decreased, but not in Pennsylvania — here they have actually increased, because other states have enacted far more restrictive abortion laws than Pennsylvania’s current law and some states have outlawed abortions under most circumstances. Father Murray also had critical observations about President Joe Biden, who often rhetorically wraps himself in the Catholic faith yet pledges to work to codify Roe v. Wade as the law of the land.

Defending the life of innocent unborn children was once a bipartisan cause in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Gone are the days when Republican Ernie Preate and Democrat Robert Casey, political adversaries, joined hands to protect the unborn. Today, Preate’s two daughters — Elizabeth and Alexandra — are leaders in the pro-life movement, while Casey’s namesake son, U.S. Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr., once a self-proclaimed “pro-life Democrat,” now favors, like his fellow Catholic president, making Roe v. Wade the law of the land.

New England Republican Governors Prop Up the Abortion Machine - The American Spectator,"A trio of Republican governors in New England are proving themselves to be just as vociferous as many Democrats in their support for killing the unborn. On Monday, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu told Jake Tapper of CNN that he has no plans to enact further restrictions on abortion in New Hampshire.

“Here in New Hampshire, we’re not changing anything,” Sununu said. “The access that women had to abortion today is the same as it was two months ago.”

New Hampshire law currently allows for abortions up to 24 weeks. When asked about states like South Dakota which have completely banned abortion, Sununu responded, “I don’t agree with that at all. That’s definitely not the rule of law in New Hampshire, so we’re going to keep it accessible, we’re going to keep it available and make sure folks have that choice.”

Meanwhile, Sununu’s fellow New England Republican, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, signed an executive order to protect abortion access on June 24, the day the Supreme Court released its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Baker issued a statement that said, “I am deeply disappointed in today’s decision by the Supreme Court which will have major consequences for women across the country who live in states with limited access to reproductive health care services.” The executive order prevents abortion providers from facing discipline or out-of-state charges and enacts a policy of non-cooperation with abortion-related extradition requests from pro-life states.

Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, another New England Republican, went a step further than Sununu and Baker. In a statement he issued the same day as the Dobbs decision, Scott noted that he had signed a law codifying a right to abortion and encouraged individuals to vote in favor of an upcoming constitutional referendum that would enshrine a right to abortion in the state constitution. Scott added that he hopes Congress will take steps to codify abortion as a right.

When seeing the actions of these governors, conservatives should understand that “Republican in New England” translates to “Democrat with tax cuts” in the Northeastern dialect. If the GOP does not wish to be attached to those who aid and abet the murder of unborn babies, they should consider some internal gatekeeping.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/d-c-politics-the-hill/,2022-07-11
Remember the Cost of a Free and Undivided Republic - The American Spectator,"If you open a paper this week, you will see ads for Memorial Day sales. Your inbox is probably being inundated with such ads. Along with sales, Memorial Day images include BBQs, parties, and pool openings. It’s the official beginning of summer. Many people travel to a beach, a lake, or a mountain. Some traditions include visiting a memorial park or a cemetery to honor the fallen. Whatever you do this Memorial Day weekend, spend a few moments thinking about the real meaning of the day.

It’s the day to remember those who gave their lives to keep our country safe and free so we can work toward prosperity. Memorial Day began as Decoration Day after the Civil War. The graves of the fallen soldiers were decorated to honor what they sacrificed — their lives — to keep our country united. Credit for Memorial Day goes to John Logan, who served as an Illinois congressman prior to the Civil War, volunteered as a Union soldier and was promoted during the war to general. In 1868, he issued an order to honor those who had died in the war.

“The 30th day of May, 1868, is designated for the purpose of strewing with flowers or otherwise decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of their country,” the order said. “We should guard their graves with sacred vigilance.” Logan described their deaths as “the cost of free and undivided republic.”

More than 600,000 American soldiers died during the Civil War, which remains the most deadly war for Americans.

While not all of us are called to serve our country in the armed forces or the political arena, we can all make a difference through the ways we live our lives. With freedom comes responsibility — responsibility to ensure that our freedom is maintained. Freedom is never free; it comes at a cost of lives, vigilance, time, and effort.

The Declaration of Independence provides the foundation for our country: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” We have life and liberty and must guard them both, but we are provided only with the opportunity to pursue happiness, not a guarantee of happiness. Whether you achieve happiness is up to you and is not the responsibility of our government.

In November 1863, then-President Abraham Lincoln reminded us of our responsibility when he delivered his address at the dedication of the Soldiers National Cemetery at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The Civil War was still raging. He was not the main speaker for the day but had been invited as an afterthought. His speech was so short (less than two minutes) that the photographer did not have time to get a picture of him delivering it.

Its 278 words don’t include “I” or “me,” but they do take the audience from our start as a nation and the American Revolution to Lincoln’s wishes for the future of our nation.

He said,

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that “all men are created equal.” … It is rather for us, the living, to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us — that, from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they … gave the last full measure of devotion — that we here highly resolve these dead shall not have died in vain; that the nation, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.

This Memorial Day, do as millions of others will be doing by spending a minute in silence at 3 p.m. local time, the National Moment of Remembrance. Remember the military men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our safety and freedom. After Memorial Day, take an interest and get involved in what it means to be an American. Help others understand the importance of being an American and living out the American dream. Educate your children about those Americans who have died so others could remain free, and reach out to veterans who were able to return home.

Let’s give thanks and increase our devotion to our country so our military men and women will not have died in vain.

Both the Republican and Democratic Bases Are Now Antiwar - The American Spectator,"In the Trump era, establishment Republicans were forced to rein in their desire to expand and maintain the American empire through military might and intimidation. Perhaps Trump’s ability to personally intimidate and aggrandize on behalf of a “strong America” satisfied their natural urges. But the election of Trump and his sustained popularity among conservatives and populists across the country held a lesson for those in the conservative establishment: your voters oppose empire, and are tired of sending their sons and daughters to unnecessary wars, wars we found out too late were never meant to be won.

Biden said very little about foreign policy during his campaign beyond criticizing Trump’s “America First” pronouncements. What could Biden say? Far leftists, angered for a second time in four years over being put in a corner by the establishment Democrats, felt much the same as most Republican voters regarding wars of empire on behalf of — as General Smedley Butler observed in the 1930s — wealthy war-conglomerate owners, investors, and racketeers all tightly connected to the federal government and Congress.

The reality on the ground is that your average citizen, whether left, right, or center, rejects the very idea of the American empire, opposes military adventurism, and fears the consequences of political trash talk that might lead to war. Take the libertarian constitutional-purist Sen. Rand Paul and his otherwise philosophical polar opposite, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. These seemingly strange bedfellows agree when it comes to a future of peace and an end to empire. So do the vast majority of Americans. Instructively, that’s even more true among veterans of recent wars.

Actually, opposition to militarism and empire has long been part and parcel of pure conservative philosophies and woven into the modern Republican cloth. The post-Reconstruction Republican party over time grew concerned with expansive government power, standing militaries, and territorial acquisition through colonization and war. Finally, in the early 1900s, this wing of the Republican Party emphatically rejected the imperialism of Republican Presidents William McKinley and Teddy Roosevelt, who constituted a powerful political force for many decades. The ideas of limited central government, enforcing constitutional curtailments of state power, and foregrounding the singular role of Congress to declare and fund war persist as a potent unifying theme; for many, they define what it means to be a Republican today.

While both parties honorably claim Thomas Jefferson as their political father, it was actually the early Democratic Party that most loudly clamored for states’ rights, and incidentally, free trade and anti-imperialism. While the political history of the Democratic Party has been checkered, it has tended to value local preferences and the rights of states and countries to exist without being conquered, invaded, or occupied by either a domestic or imperial army. These values and priorities— regardless of what a president does, be it Harry Truman at the end of WWII, Bill Clinton in his “humanitarian war” in the former Yugoslavia, or Biden verbally threatening Russia and China — persist in the hearts of rank-and-file Democrats too.

Just this past week, Congresswoman Cortez criticized the Biden administration, noting that “. . . the US spent decades contributing to regime change and destabilization in Latin America. We can’t help set someone’s house on fire and then blame them for fleeing.” She’s not only correct, but speaks for those on both the Left and Right. In criticizing the costs, moral evil, and unintended consequences of American empire, she is echoing the earlier Republican anti-imperialists who’d grown skeptical of the Republican expansionist McKinley, and the proto-Trump of his day, Teddy Roosevelt.

We might ask, then, who in this country actually does want war, expansion and empire? Last week, thousands of politicians and civic-minded people vied for primary election or turned in their petitions for public office across this country. Not a single one of them ran on a platform of empire. Not one advocated a new boutique war.

As President Dwight Eisenhower famously observed 60 years ago, those who profit from government funding for endless war, pugilistic policies, and the centralization of political power form a bipartisan minority, comprising a congressional-military-industrial complex. These war racketeers have infiltrated both the Republican and Democratic parties. They consistently push for the permanent transfer of wealth from poor and working people — mortgaging their economic futures, roads, schools, hospitals, and bridges — to line the pockets of gun-running defense contractors and their political allies.

Instead of being constantly told that 74 million Republican and 80 million Democratic voters remain at war with each other, imagine instead that 150 million Americans share values of peace and prosperity — reminding Congress and the president of their constitutional duties and demanding an end to this imperial scam.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/deep-state/,2021-08-04
Republican Loyalty to Trump Is in Short Supply - The American Spectator,"Long ago and, oh, so far away, an extremely famous Republican president was sitting drinking a bottle of his favorite, Johnny Walker Black. His companion was a high official but certainly no drinker. The question under discussion was, “Why are so many GOP representatives and solons deserting the party leader to join with the Democrats to move forward a bill of impeachment?”

Now, it’s good to remember that there was no Fox News Channel then and no Hannity and no Laura Ingraham and no Tucker Carlson. So there was a GOP channel, and it drew fantastic audiences, but it did not pull together a whole huge segment of the nation in a loyal marching order.

As I just said, the topic under discussion was why there was not a solid bloc of GOP M.C.s fighting tooth and nail to keep a GOP standard-bearer in office at the White House.

“The thing you have to remember,” said the rapidly aging president, “is that most Republican members of Congress aren’t fit to be dog catcher.”

This was a startling comment from a man who had been a solid Republican all his working life.

What’s worse is that with the passage of time and the demise of the man in question, I can no longer ask any follow-up questions. Why? Why were the Republicans in Congress so disorganized and slow to rally ’round the flag? Why, when the Democrats were so ferocious, were the GOP members so weak-kneed, so fearful, so damned afraid of being accused of being partisan when their living was in the most partisan game in the nation, namely, party politics?

All of this is racing through my bloodstream right now as a similar game is being played. Donald Trump has clearly done nothing seriously wrong. He has done the nation a huge amount of good economically and politically and militarily. Why are the GOP members deserting him not in huge numbers, but in numbers large enough to cost him the Oval Office if they keep at it?

Why are the Democrats so forceful and motivated and the GOP so laid-back?

I don’t know. There has just always been a power locus within the Democratic Party that just is not there among the Republicans. There is a power center within the Left that just does not exist inside the Democratic Party. The Democrats are more focused, more ready to fight, more willing to take to the barricades to win the game. And now, with the desertion of various women and Mitt Romney within the Grand Old Party, we’re seeing it again.

It’s a psychological issue. The Dems have no real political point of view they are willing to fight for and die for except for the life-and-death need to have power. Will this be enough? I am not sure. But I know that the party that wants to win the most has a very good chance of winning, and that scares me.

By every rational marker, the GOP should have a lay-down hand to win in 2020. A stellar record economically and in foreign policy. A charismatic leader. The only real question is who wants it the most. The Dems have offered Mr. Trump gifts from on high: Joe Biden and Liz Warren. Will that be enough? We’ll see. Nixon had enough gifts in 1972 to stay in office a thousand years, and it wasn’t enough. Will it be this time? We shall see.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/free-market/,2020-01-15
The Republican Party’s Woke Capital Awakening - The American Spectator,"One of the unfortunate vestiges of liberalism’s lingering influence upon American conservatism, and by extension the Republican Party that is conservatism’s default political vehicle, is the pervasive knee-jerk tendency to view government action as per se bad and private-sector action as per se good. This ideology, which might be called “market fundamentalism” or “private-sector fundamentalism,” takes on differing forms: in its more benign variation, a principled commitment to unwavering laissez faire, but in its more malignant variation, a less principled commitment to corporate boosterism and outright cronyism.

The realignment now unfolding before our eyes in American politics could finally retire the right’s long-standing and lamentable fixation with these bromides. On the former front, the realignment right’s leading institutions and proponents seek to recover the “Two Cheers for Capitalism” of Irving Kristol, allowing for a greater state role in channeling market efficiency toward the traditional conservative political ends of justice, human flourishing, and the common good. That theoretical recalibration is welcome and proper.

The real recent action, however, has been on the latter, more tangible front. In the aftermath of corporate America’s defenestration of the state of Georgia — best encapsulated by Major League Baseball’s obtuse decision to yank its All-Star Game out of the Peach State — over its passage of a milquetoast election reform law, the already-festering tension between the GOP and its corporatist Chamber of Commerce wing has reached a fever pitch.

Earlier this week, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who has previously made realignment inroads with his advocacy of “common good capitalism” and vocal support for unionization in Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama, plant, took to the New York Post to decry how “corporate America eagerly dumps woke, toxic nonsense into our culture.” Even more notably, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, a political disciple of Reaganite conservatism, took to the Wall Street Journal to pronounce that “starting today,” he will “no longer accept money from any corporate PAC.”

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., meanwhile, is only ramping up his assaults on Big Tech oligopolists, most recently expressed by his unveiling of the aptly named “Trust-Busting for the Twenty-First Century Act.” And on the House side, Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., is leading a campaign to foreswear all political donations from Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Twitter.

Those who came of political age associating the GOP’s low-tax, low-regulation policy plank with Big Business might be taken aback by the sweeping nature of this pushback, but in truth, the GOP resistance to corporatism has been a long time coming. The Tea Party era of 2009–12 took on a decisively populist, anti-corporatist hue, with its opposition to bailing out Wall Street and its resistance to other policies reeking of Beltway-style corporate cronyism, such as the Export-Import Bank that effectively amounts to a Boeing slush fund.

But the recent accelerant has been the emergence of woke capital as a destructive force tearing a grievously divided country ever-more asunder. As the cultural Left nears completion of its Antonio Gramsci–esque “long march through the institutions,” Big Business has joined the ranks of the academy, Hollywood, and the mainstream media as a sprawling national edifice beholden to the illiberal woke ideology. Whereas just nine years ago, Wall Street donated to native son Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign at a higher clip than it did to then-incumbent President Barack Obama, today corporate wokesters threaten boycotts of entire states due to Republican-backed legislation on wedge issues such as abortion and transgenderism — all while prostrating themselves before the (literally) genocidal commissars of the Chinese Communist Party.

Republicans are right to stand up and solemnly declare that enough is enough, already. There is no compelling reason to suffer through the humiliating bromance with woke capitalists, “battered woman syndrome”-style, while corporate America makes itself clearer than ever before that it hates Republican voters’ guts. Whether it is on human sexuality, the right to life for unborn children, gun rights, immigration sanity, or a host of other issues, woke capital treats the Republican Party as more of an enemy than it would ever dream of treating sadistic detention facility managers in Xinjiang, China.

Republicans should stop trying to prevent the unpreventable and permit their amicable divorce from corporate America to continue apace. Indeed, that divorce is a “blessing,” as the New York Post’s op-ed editor, Sohrab Ahmari, argued in January. The GOP’s future comes in the form of a multiracial working-class political coalition — not in the C-suite.

Republican Senate Challenger Explains Why He Supports Trump - The American Spectator,"Since announcing my campaign to challenge Thom Tillis to represent North Carolina in the U.S. Senate two weeks ago, the Swamp — Washington politicians and their consultants — has come out of the woodwork to challenge my support of President Trump.

In 2016, during the Presidential primary, like other conservatives I had my doubts about Mr. Trump. Without a policy record, I questioned whether he would govern as a conservative. Like millions of Americans, I could not more delighted, and frankly amazed, at how he has transformed this country in the last two years. His policies and leadership have more than fulfilled his commitment to conservatives and to the American people and I proudly stand with him in his initiatives.

Mr. Tillis, on the other hand, has publicly opposed the president numerous times. My doubts were in 2016. In 2019, Thom Tillis wrote a scathing op-ed opposing the President on the emergency funding for the border wall and he placed it in the Washington Post, the biggest opponent of the president in media, save MSNBC and CNN.

What’s worse, Tillis co-sponsored a bill with liberal Democrat New Jersey Senator Cory Booker to protect the Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s search and destroy investigation against President Trump.

When President Trump proposed cuts to foreign aid spending by 30%, Thom Tillis said “No.”

Thom Tillis voted to bust President Trump’s 2018 and 2019 budgets by $200 billion and voted to give Congress a veto over President Trump’s tariffs.

Veto power over the most successful negotiating position the President could put us in?

This is what Washington insiders do, they claim to be something that they are not. Tillis has proven, time after time, that he does not have the President’s back. When it comes to difficult decisions to do the right thing for the American people, President Trump goes one way, Tillis goes the other.

The Senate Leadership Fund, the Washington insider Super PAC that ran ads supporting anti-Trump Senator Jeff Flake two years ago, is now trying to tell the media and voters in North Carolina that Tillis is pro-Trump. I say actions speak louder than words.

That’s why President Trump has turned Washington upside down. He is actually accomplishing what he told the voters he would do in 2016. He cut taxes and cut onerous regulations on businesses to allow them to thrive, which they, and the economy have done. Job numbers at an all-time low. On foreign policy, he has crushed ISIS, brought home three hostages and Otto Wambier from North Korea. Despite all the naysayers, President Trump got North Korea to the table, is standing up to Russia and China and Iran and affirming our close alliance with Israel in the Middle East.

President Trump has been the most pro-life president in the last several decades and he has stood strong to protect religious liberty both on the domestic and international front.

After elected he worked quickly to repeal Obamacare only to be stymied by John McCain. On his signature issue, he has done everything in his power to build the wall he promised the American people he would build and is getting it done by finding bloated bureaucratic spending that could be better spent on protecting the American people.

Fulfilling your promises to the American people is foreign to the elite powerbrokers in Washington who want to keep the status quo and their padded consulting and lobbying fees.

The powerbrokers and establishment in the U.S. Senate, like Tillis and Mitch McConnell, want to keep their power and have shown they will oppose the president at will to do so.

These are the reasons North Carolinians need a new, fresh, outside-the-beltway conservative to represent them. Someone who can admit when they are wrong about this President and who can work with him to continue to fulfill his promises to the American people.

Republican Spenders: Where’s the Backbone? - The American Spectator,"Just three months after last November’s midterm elections, Democratic presidential hopefuls are already lining up. And the new darling of the left, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is blithely explaining her party’s outright embrace of old-fashioned socialism with the self-assured assertion that the left is “morally right.”

Do conservatives have the backbone to offer an effective alternative? The recent past is disturbing. While the nation continues to drown in deficit spending, Washington Republicans muffed many recent opportunities to reverse course.

Here are just three:

In 2018, President Trump and his Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, recommended a $9 billion reduction in appropriations for the Education Department. How did the Republican Congress respond? It went in the opposite direction, giving the department a $2.6 billion increase in appropriations over the prior year — an $11.6 billion increase over the administration’s request!

Similarly, the Trump administration proposed steep reductions in foreign aid and State Department funding which would have reduced spending levels back to those under George W. Bush. The Republican Congress responded by spending $11 billion more than President Trump requested.

In March, 2018, Congress passed a gargantuan $1.3 trillion spending bill over the futile protest of a handful of conservative Republicans. In an effort to exert some semblance of fiscal responsibility, the administration then proposed a rescission bill that would have clawed back some $15 billion of the $1.3 trillion spending bill. The House approved the rescission package. The Senate defeated it.

These three missed opportunities illustrate how we got in this mess. Our national debt now stands at well over $20 trillion, and the annual deficit is projected at over $1 trillion. And that’s in a year when the economy is robust and growing — just imagine what the deficit will be whenever we enter the next recession. Even with a Republican president and a Republican Congress, there has been no real appetite for cutting spending and moving toward a balanced budget.

Meantime, as liberals boast about “being morally right,” Republicans have failed to make the moral argument against more deficit spending. Is it moral to spend the nation into bankruptcy? Government has spent trillions of taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars on welfare programs to end poverty since the 1960s — but the poverty rate hasn’t declined. Was that spending moral? Was it moral to create a huge class of Americans who are permanently dependent on the government? The answer is no. It is immoral, and it is dangerous.

In economic terms, we are perched atop a time bomb. Deep down, we Americans agree with Ben Stein’s father: “If something can’t go on forever, it will stop.” Yet Congress has refused to reduce spending. Why? Because the American voters have too often elected representatives who ran as conservatives but lacked the backbone to vote as they had promised.

Former Senator Tom Coburn has written, “Big government’s false promise of easy living and smug security has wreaked havoc not only in the nation’s finances, but also in the American ideals of self-reliance and human dignity.” Arthur Brooks concludes, “The fact that we have hardly moved the needle on earned success after spending trillions of dollars is not merely a failure of public policy. It is the greatest moral scandal of our time.” J.D. Vance, in his blockbuster best-selling book, Hillbilly Elegy, poignantly portrays the devastating effects of well-intentioned entitlement programs. Millions of “rust belt Americans” have been shorn of their natural resilience and productivity and become trapped in lives of pessimism, hopelessness, and despair.

Winston Churchill once recalled that, as a young boy, his parents took him to Barnum’s Circus where the sideshow advertised “The World-Famous Boneless Wonder.” It was a giant slab of a man with no backbone. Although his parents determined it was too revolting for his young eyes, Churchill was haunted by this image for years, only to be confronted by it 50 years later as he gazed on the politicians of his day. The GOP needs no more boneless wonders.

As we look to 2020, the left is mounting their campaign for more of the same old failed policies. The conservative arguments — both fiscal and moral — against continuing down this road are clear. The only missing ingredient is a Congress willing to have the backbone to say NO — and to reverse course.

Republicans Are Missing the Point of Trump — Again - The American Spectator,"“It is rational to attack the police; nay, it is glorious. But the modern critics of religious authority are like men who should attack the police without ever having heard of burglars.”

— G.K. Chesterton, Orthodoxy

Casting about for someone to hold accountable after Republicans performed below expectations in the midterm elections, many Republicans offered a simple solution: Blame Trump.

“Trump stopped the wave,” said Jim Durkin, Illinois state House GOP leader.

“With regards to the governor’s office, there’s no way in a red year a candidate should lose by double digits…. And that really speaks to how poor our candidates were and how much Trump interfered in our primary process,” Pennsylvania Republican consultant David La Torre said.

“I think Trump’s kind of a drag on our ticket…. I think Donald Trump gives us problems, politically,” former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan opined.

The sentiment has been echoed across the country. But this blithe dismissal of Donald Trump — and, by proxy, millions of Trump supporters — is misguided. To borrow Chesterton’s metaphor, Republicans are attacking the Trump police without ever having heard of the liberal authoritarian burglars that he was largely elected to stop.

We’ve seen this movie before. Rewind back to 2016. Mainstream Republicans back then didn’t like Trump either. So why did he win both the Republican nomination and the presidency? It’s actually not that complicated: People were tired of woke bullies bossing them about, and Donald Trump stood up to those bullies. He said he’d stand up to China even though people called him a racist for it. Trump said he’d stem the flow of immigration from Mexico, and he was roundly criticized. But he didn’t back down from the liberal media that relentlessly attacked him. Trump kept speaking his mind. In contrast, Establishment Republicans largely forgot about the lower middle class affected by these policies. Trump spoke to the forgotten class — spoke for them.

And it wasn’t just the lower middle class. There were plenty of people who were tired of the varied left-wing bullies in their world. For example, I and my colleagues ran a study right before the general election in 2016 where we randomly assigned some people to a “woke/political correctness” prime. The prime wasn’t especially overwhelming: Participants in that condition simply read a brief statement explaining PC norms and filled out a four-item questionnaire about political correctness. Without the prime, our left-leaning sample went for Clinton. But simply having people briefly answer questions about political correctness caused a significant shift towards Trump, so much so that it almost wiped out Clinton’s lead among an otherwise left-leaning group of people. Why? Making people think about wokeness made them long for freedom from wokeness, from liberal bullies, and, well, Trump was their anti-authoritarian champion. He was the person who stood up to the bullies on their behalf. Trump at least wasn’t afraid of those bullies — like much of the Republican Party seemed afraid of them.

Polling data from 2015/2016 confirm this. People often didn’t like what Trump said, but they liked that he wasn’t afraid to say it. In fact, the best predictor of Trump support in one poll wasn’t all the things people often think of — age, race, anti-immigration attitudes — it was “feeling voiceless.” Trump was their voice.

These reasons are even more important today. And if Republicans want to win moving forward, they need to better understand this fact. They need to more fully “get” Trump voters. They need to understand the metaphorical Trump police and the authoritarian burglars.

While of course many Republicans besides Trump have since stood up to woke bullies successfully — and with less offensive language — I worry that quite a few Establishment Republicans are still missing the point. Consider these comments made by Morgan Boyd, a Republican official in western Pennsylvania: “It’s time for [Trump] to pass the torch to more mainstream, traditional Republican candidates.”

There will be many people who hear these comments and respond: “You mean those traditional candidates who trashed the Tea Party and sneered at the lower-middle-class voters Trump brought into the GOP? You mean those traditional Republican presidential candidates (like Mitt Romney, who lost Pennsylvania by over 5 percentage points in 2012) who had lost Pennsylvania elections for 24 straight years — until Trump won the state in 2016?”

As a result, instead of trashing Trump, Republicans should instead attempt to fully understand his appeal. Brit Hume said on Fox News that Republicans’ problem is now to find a way to “work around” Trump. I’ve no end of respect for Hume, but I could not disagree more. That is the Republican mindset that implicitly dismisses the legitimate concerns that Trump addressed. You want to work around all the people who Trump brought to the party? You want to work around all the lower-middle-class people you ignored — but Trump didn’t? You want to work around all the political independents who didn’t often vote for traditional Republicans — but did vote for Trump?

No, you simply can’t work around them. You have to show them that, although you are moving past Trump, you are capturing Trumpism. You have to embrace the populist movement that appealed to freedom-loving people everywhere. You have to realize that there are a lot of people like me, who didn’t vote for Trump or who didn’t like him, but who nonetheless liked what he did for the country. To many of us, traditional Republicans supported the uber-rich and ignored the fact that their own constituents have to fear what they say at work or else be fired for merely expressing a political opinion that their colleagues don’t like. Establishment Republicans didn’t seem to do much for them — but Trump sure as heck did. Maybe we were wrong about Establishment Republicans, but it often feels as though they don’t seem to like the person who did the most for those bullied people. Comments like those discussed in this article solidify this feeling — and will ultimately make it harder for Republicans to keep many of the people Trump brought to the party.

So, yes, of course the fact that Trump raised questions about the legitimacy of elections hurt the GOP in the midterms. Trump’s opinion on that issue was a loser from the start, and it is still a loser today. Indeed, the midterms suggested that more Americans agreed with me about election security than I realized. They are tired of the whole “stolen election” talk on both sides of the aisle. Note that famous liberal election delegitimizer Stacey Abrams was roundly crushed in the midterms as well. Americans essentially said, to both parties, “Enough with all the election-questioning stuff.” (Maybe election skeptic Hillary Clinton should take note, too, if she really wants to make another run at the presidency.)

But while analyzing the effect of Trump’s statements on election legitimacy is of course reasonable, if Republicans think they can just pretend that “OK, that didn’t happen” with Trump and “work around” him — they will have another thing coming.

There obviously is a path forward here. Gov. Ron DeSantis won big in Florida and captured quite a lot of the Trump vote by embracing many of the same Trump policies without as much of the accompanying Trumpy baggage. Indeed, this and other similar conservative wins help instantiate this piece’s key lesson for Republicans throughout the country: This time, as Republicans wrestle with the issues posed by another Trump run at the presidency, they should remember that — for all his flaws — the former president spoke for a lot of average people tired of the bullies throwing them under the bus. I am one of those people, and, unless Republicans plan to stand up to those same bullies with equal force, unless they convince us that their politicians care about the same things we do, they are going to lose a lot of votes in the other direction in 2024. This should be at the front of every Republican’s mind in places like Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, and Wisconsin. For many of us, we are tired of COVID lockdowns and masks and mandates and cancel culture and anti-science green-energy cults and (above all) the erosion of free speech in this country. We want to wake up in a free society, not this increasingly authoritarian dystopia that we find ourselves in.

Trump blasted many of those metaphorical burglars with loud trumpets. I can only hope “traditional” Republicans are listening.

Republicans Should Slowly Back Away From Ukraine - The American Spectator,"This is not an anti-Ukraine column and it certainly isn’t a pro-Russia column. What it really amounts to is a pro-life column, and particularly a pro-American people column.

And it begins with a recognition that the majority of Americans are pro-Ukraine. Most surveys show that as a people we are disgusted by Russia’s invasion of its neighbor and the atrocities committed there, and most of us want the Ukrainians to win that war.

Most of us would also like to see a world where Russia was run by someone less conniving, less brutal, and more interested in cooperation with the rest of Europe than Vladimir Putin. It’s pretty clear that he’s the bad guy here. For whatever provocations might have been dangled in front of his face, and there have surely been some, launching an offensive war against a sovereign country was a far more savage response than could ever have been warranted.

So all of that has been said. But as the last column in this space noted, this Russia–Ukraine war has outlived its usefulness, and it’s going to become an albatross around the necks of its supporters. Some of those people are Republicans, and they’re going to need to quietly back away from the unquestioning support with billions of dollars we don’t have for the meat grinder in Eastern Europe.

Yes, we want Ukraine to win. What does that look like? Apparently, according to Joe Biden — echoed now by the uber-predictable warmonger John Bolton — the Washington establishment is committed to the idea that winning the Russia–Ukraine war entails regime change in Moscow.

This is something that Hitler and Napoleon couldn’t pull off. Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelenskyy will?

“Why the angst? There is no long-term prospect for peace and security in Europe without regime change in Russia,” Bolton says.

Well, the angst is that Russia has the world’s largest nuclear weapons stockpile, and Putin keeps threatening to use it. If that doesn’t give you angst, you probably shouldn’t be involved in making decisions of this magnitude.

Do I believe Putin will use nuclear weapons against Ukraine or the West? No. Am I absolutely positive in that belief? Also, no.

A good rule is to take your enemies seriously when they say things. Even Joe Biden tells the truth from time to time, though his people often walk back his statements when he does. So when Vladimir Putin says he will drop the hot rocks as part of his war effort, it shouldn’t be discounted as a possibility.

And if he thinks nukes are a valid option to prosecute an offensive war, what do you think he’d say to the idea that we’ll take him out?

If Putin is the megalomaniac our elites continue to paint him as, the only prudent assumption is that he would use nukes to stay in power.

John Bolton does not represent the thinking of the majority of Republican voters. We tend to be a fairly bellicose lot, and on balance we’re willing to send in the troops. But most of us have learned, thanks to the abject failure of our globalist projects in Afghanistan and Iraq, to temper that jingoistic instinct — and watching the woke and vaxxed Biden military turn into a hyper-expensive health plan for the trans crowd has taken a major toll on our interest in deploying it to foreign shores.

Which is the direction this thing seems to be going. Every other day Biden is firing off checks for more billions to support the Ukrainians, without a whole hell of a lot of accountability behind the destination of that cash. We already know Ukraine is the laundromat for the globalist gang, and particularly the Biden crime family. It’s impossible not to realize the certainty a great deal of that aid is being stolen.

And should the war escalate, we’re going to eventually come to a choice.

Putin says he’s going to call up and send in 300,000 reserve troops to press an offensive in Ukraine. The problem is that his front-line divisions, the best and brightest who spearheaded the invasion, have mostly been worn to the nub by the Ukrainians using a lot of American surplus gear based on 20- to 30-year-old technology. There is zero reason to believe the 300,000 replacements, fresh out of boot camp, are anything other than cannon fodder.

Of course, the Ukrainians are pretty beat up, too. They’ve got to be more or less at the end of their rope as a cohesive army after their own losses. And there are nowhere near as many reserves Zelenskyy can call up. Though Ukraine is currently on the offensive in Kharkiv and Kherson and might well retake much of those territories. Russia has annexed four of the Donbas regions in eastern Ukraine; the West has rejected the announcements.

Some 12 million Ukrainians have already hit the road as refugees from the war. More are going to leave. The rest of Europe, already in the midst of a massive energy crunch and economic nosedive, isn’t in the best condition to take them in.

Worse, in 2021 Ukraine harvested some 32 million tons of wheat. This year it will harvest 19 million tons. Next year the estimate has it that no more than seven to 10 million tons will be harvested. That country is the bread basket of Europe, but it’s hard to farm effectively in a war zone.

The war will likely fall into a stalemate this winter. If Bolton is correct that there are forces inside Russia willing to move on Putin because the war has gone badly, then Putin will seek to break that stalemate. Either there will be peace talks and a negotiated settlement or things will escalate because he can’t afford for Ukraine to be his Vietnam (or Afghanistan, perhaps more pointedly in both Russia’s case and ours).

Which means nuclear weapons.

And what’s worse is that of late, Putin is not as bellicose as our own government. (READ MORE from Scott McKay: Consequences, Consequences Everywhere)

When Elon Musk tweeted a few days ago the outline of a peace settlement, one which was probably friendlier to Russia than Ukraine and the West would or should agree to, the Russians responded favorably. Ukraine’s leaders reacted with vituperation. And Zelenskyy is now saying he’ll sit at the peace table, but not until Putin is removed.

Nobody really believes Zelenskyy speaks alone. He says what he’s told to say by our government. And that means Vladimir Putin must believe that it’s American policy not to end this war until he is deposed or dead.

Ask yourself this: is the territorial integrity of Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO, worth the loss of an American city to a nuclear strike? If you’re a Republican member of Congress, would you support such a price to be paid?

This is not running from a bully. We’ve proved over the past six months that we could bloody Putin’s nose and leave him staggering. To date the Ukraine war has been a brilliant success from an American military standpoint — we’ve essentially unloaded second-line gear on a proxy and watched them wear out the largest army in Europe.

If the war were to end today, we would have won it decisively. Almost regardless of what settlement is made.

The great Chinese military philosopher Sun Tzu is said to have advised, “Build your opponent a golden bridge to retreat across.” A wise American leadership would be building that golden bridge for Putin, not openly plotting his downfall. Sun Tzu warned an opponent with his feet in the river will fight to the death.

When this war escalates, as it likely will without efforts made at building the golden bridge, the politics will turn in both Europe and America. They’ll turn ugly. Should Putin, his power and life threatened by loose talk of regime change, opt to use nukes, an armageddon beckons. No American interests in this war justify such a risk.

We’re less than five weeks from the midterm elections, which seem every bit as existential as the Ukraine mess could be, and the issues on the table cut decisively for the GOP. There is no reason to raise this war up to the public’s conscience as an electoral issue now.

But when the midterms are over, the Republican majority which I predict will arise in both houses of Congress will need to act as a brake to both the Biden administration’s words and actions, and it must serve as a limiting force to escalation of this conflict.

A twofold goal should guide our actions. We should seek a negotiated settlement to the Ukraine war preserving as much territorial integrity as possible for the Ukrainians, and we should offer up a denial of Ukrainian entry into NATO as a consideration for ending that war — something we can do, since we’ve already set a precedent that we would supply Ukraine with military aid as needed if they’re attacked. But if there are areas of the Donbas where the populace actually does want to join Russia, letting those go rather than seeing the war escalate is a sensible decision. Perhaps Putin would be willing to buy Ukraine out of those areas.

And second, given the instability of the Russian energy supply to Europe, the interruption of which by the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines has made clear regardless of who the culprit may have been, it should be American policy that a far larger percentage of the natural gas supplied to Europe than currently flows should come from the United States. We’ve spent more than $65 billion to back the Ukrainians in the war; we should be paid back at a profit by selling LNG to the Europeans.

And this should become Republican policy vis-à-vis Russia and Ukraine. Not regime change in Moscow à la John Bolton’s demand. Lest we forget, our record in installing friendly potentates to replace the ones we depose is not the best, and what comes after Putin could be someone even more unstable, more hostile to America, and quite likely in bed with the Chinese. If that should happen, Russia then becomes North Korea on steroids.

And let’s not doubt that possibility, particularly given the propensity, as Barack Obama noted, of Joe Biden to “f**k things up.”",https://spectator.org/category/politics/new-socialists/,2022-10-07
Restoring Faith in America Requires Putting the Founders’ Republicanism First - The American Spectator,"The top news story in Washington and with big media nationwide is that the multi-billion dollar mis-named Inflation Reduction Act and other policy victories will not only solve inflation but everything from global warming (or is that climate change?) to universal health and free college — resulting in the election of Democrats in November because they prove they get results.

The bill promised a mere $740 billion over a decade but it was on top of multiple trillions of dollars in earlier spending bills. How could it fail to Build America Back Better?

And the new 87,000 IRS tax agents will get the rich to pay it all back, right, just like it inadvertently posted 120,000 confidential files on its public website for all to see?

Unfortunately, the past record of results — even for America’s most deserving — was summarized by the Washington Post as “Millions spent to retrain veterans yielded few jobs”; and reported $45 billion fraud in unemployment insurance payments. More important, as columnist Megan McArdle warned readers, public debt now equals national GDP wealth and is sure to increase, ending the easy money available since the 2008 Great Recession.

What is the conservative response? Until recently most would have said, “Cut spending and rely on the market.” Now it’s more like, OK, we know government mostly does not work well and markets do better, but contrary to the old rhetoric the answer is not simply to spend less money and support the private sector.

It turns out that General Motors’ Mary Barra and other automobile CEOs not only supported President Joe Biden’s spending spree but lobbied for $30 billion in loans, tax credits, and privileges for their own companies. And they were not the only ones. Indeed, rightist critics from Sen. Marco Rubio to intellectual Oren Cass now say the need is not freer markets but to direct government money better to the “common good” by supporting rightist programs.

The critics are correct that the market cannot do everything. Yet, the answer cannot be more government programs that do not work. A forthcoming book by American Institute for Economic Research political economist Samuel Gregg, The Next American Economy, takes up the challenge by demonstrating the problems with today’s “state capitalism” and the damage caused by its century-long progressive control of Washington economic policy.

What is most appealing is that Gregg both recognizes what freer markets can accomplish but also that this does not mean perfect markets, following economist Adam Smith rather than David Ricardo. Too many on the right preach the market as if it is a machine rather than free human decision-making. But recognizing that critics on the right are rejecting rigid ideological answers, he explains that even supporting free trade does not mean there are no other considerations about foreign and domestic policymaking that also need to be kept in mind.

It is not merely a coincidence for Gregg that the Declaration of Independence and Smith’s The Wealth of Nations both appeared in 1776, or that America unlike most nations is to a great degree defined by its economy, which to the world basically is Capitalism. But the U.S. 1930s Great Depression “brought America to its economic knees” and to a significant degree resulted in a greatly expanded role for government in directing the economy, a roll that expanded dramatically again with the 2008 Great Recession. Today one must understand that the U.S. is far from being a Smithian free-market economy.

Gregg believes the U.S. now has only two choices, what he labels “state capitalism” and a real “market economy.” The former with its widespread market controls has become dangerously close to the dominant force in the American economy today. The latter requires a fundamental change in direction to become “what some of the most influential Founders thought should be America’s political destiny: that is a modern commercial republic.”

State capitalism aims to manipulate the market to promote “fairness” through statuary and regulatory power. Contrary to critics, Gregg demonstrates that even the 1890s tariffs actually held back industrial growth, as did later ones until the Great Depression of the 1930s. And prosperity did not explode again until the freer trade that followed World War II. But the economy became increasingly restricted again in the 1960s until the Great Recession, whose effects still restrict prosperity today. The increased business regulation, economic protectionism, industrial policy, and favoritism simply have not worked for the good of society.

The problem is that government experts cannot know enough to micro-manage such complex phenomena that include every transaction by billions of people worldwide and hundreds of millions of Americans. The relevant information is too disbursed for centralized expert regulators and can really only be understood by those deciding whether a trade is in their own interest. Under these conditions governmental decisions are based too much upon bureaucratic and business interests that generally redistribute from the middle to the more powerful.

As Gregg demonstrates in his book, most regulation “has nothing to do with the common good and everything to do with businesses wanting to avoid competition and legislators happy to oblige them.” His answer to crony capitalism is to reestablish consumer sovereignty by reducing regulation and limiting its negative effects, and he gives examples of how this can be done. While noting actual trade agreements often produce as much protectionism as freeing, he also concedes that much of the productive freeing is also socially disruptive. So, he suggests freedom-friendly ameliorations.

There are also national security, property theft, and labor infraction considerations in foreign trade negotiations that properly limit even free trade, especially with nations like China. Some like Sen. Rubio suggest generally supporting worldwide free trade means not caring about making America great, but Gregg insists that free national commerce and its republicanism are the epitome of what America is all about.

Gregg introduces a “Commercial Republic” ideal as model for a positive America-first political economy based upon commercial principles derived from the U.S. Founders. He especially relies upon The Federalist Papers by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay to defend our Constitution, citing multiple Papers to make the commercial case. But the Commercial Republic also rests on the Jewish, Christian, natural law and rights elements inherent in the founding documents. Gregg especially relies upon George Washington’s Farewell Address that he gave when stepping down as president, confirming Gregg in his use of our founding President to make the case in spades, although you will have to read the book to get the case in full.

Gregg explains how creativity, competition, and trade are what make real capitalism work. But what is so important about his book is that it presents these issues in their full complexity in order to respond to the “common good” critics directly and to show how true commercial markets can handle many of the problems they consider essential. In fact, the author is clear that there are legitimate limits to markets, especially regarding what Nobel Laureate F.A. Hayek called the rule of law within which real free markets must operate.

Gregg recognizes the difficulty of returning to a true Commercial Republic and that to do so “economic truth is not sufficient” in itself. Real reform also requires “a renewal of faith by Americans with America,” which is his challenge to his readers, and to you.

Day One of the Republican Convention: One Week of Honesty on TV Every Four Years - The American Spectator,"We have to wait four years to get one week of some honesty on TV networks in prime time. There is no other time during those 48 months when the mainstream television media give the Republican voice its say. So enjoy it because, almost like a comet, it just has arrived and soon will be gone for its next quadrennial appearance.

But that is what it is. Those networks — CBS, NBC, ABC, PBS, CNN, and MSNBC — will not give the Republican agenda or conservative perspectives any meaningful coverage, but they do give over two hours nightly for four days of the Republican presidential convention. Although the networks’ talking heads soon enough disparage everything that has transpired, they do allow the words to be spoken unfiltered for those precious two prime-time hours. That provides the rare opportunity for any fair-minded American who is open to something different from the usual pap to listen in and hear thoughts never otherwise conveyed.

On the first night of the GOP convention, Americans saw a moving short video compiling scenes of President Trump making promises, followed by scenes that depict how he ultimately kept those promises. Promises Made. Promises Kept. You don’t see or hear that on TV the other 47 months and three weeks of the Quadrennium.

Americans saw Amy Ford, a West Virginia COVID-relief registered nurse who helped with coronavirus patient overloads in New York and Texas, thanking President Trump for instituting major policy changes and pouring in federal assistance to fight COVID-19. “Donald Trump’s quick action and leadership saved thousands of lives,” she said. You don’t hear that the other 47 months.

After a week of Democrat hacks blaming President Trump for the virus, we were reminded on Monday night that the Word Health Organization had gotten it all wrong, initially reporting that humans could not transmit the disease to other humans. We were reminded that, with coronavirus beginning to imperil our nation, Nancy Pelosi was urging people to ignore the dangers and to travel to Chinatown. That Joe Biden called it “xenophobia” when President Trump rapidly restricted visitors from flying in from China and parts of Europe. We were reminded how miserably New York’s Andrew Cuomo and Bill de Blasio had done. By contrast, President Trump had implemented the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and Operation Warp Speed. You don’t hear that the other 47 months.

You may have needed to adjust the picture on your television sets during the convention’s first nights because we saw and heard from a number of Americans who appeared to be people of color, specifically Black, but according to the racist Joe Biden they must have been White. Joe Biden had said, “Well, I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.” But football legend Herschel Walker was there, endorsing and speaking for Trump. So was Vernon Jones, an elected state representative in the Georgia State Assembly, a Black Democrat voting for Trump. He said that the Democrat Party “doesn’t want Black people to leave the mental plantation,” and he sneered at Pelosi and Schumer for pandering to Blacks, as the two Democrat leaders paraded around the U.S. capitol with kente cloths. There was Kimberly Klacik, running for Congress in Maryland’s 7th Congressional District. There was United States Sen. Tim Scott from South Carolina. They all were exuberant in endorsing Trump. And, at least to the naked eye, they seemed Black.

On the other hand, Biden had said quite emphatically that, if you do not support Biden over Trump, then “you ain’t Black.” All of last week we were told that Biden is a man of character. Biden would never lie. Except as to his biography. And about his miserable grades in school. And about educational degrees he never actually received. And about his class ranking in law school. And that crazy phony story about risking his life to pin a medal on a guy in Afghanistan. And apparently how he met Jill, who apparently was married when he became amorous with her. But other than 20 or 30 or so times he was caught falsifying in public, basically Biden would never lie — except when he does. So, with his “you ain’t Black” credo, is the public to infer that all those prominent Black figures who endorsed Trump on Monday night really were White? Well, OK, maybe the cameras were off. But then that would mean that all the White people endorsing Trump on the screen the rest of the night really were Black.

A puzzlement.

There was Natalie Harp, a bone cancer survivor, who had been encouraged by medical personnel to kill herself, to agree to assisted suicide, so that by getting out of the way and dying early she could help society preserve resources for others. (Obama Death Squads? What Death Squads?) And yet President Trump, by his “Right to Try” initiative, had made it possible for Ms. Harp to access some newer medicines. And now, instead of being dead, she was at the Republican convention speaking energetically for President Trump. You don’t hear about that on the other 47 months.

After a week of Democrat lies about a president who “does not take the job seriously,” “does not care about people except his friends,” and does not take medical issues seriously, we were reminded of President Trump’s leadership roles in fighting the opioid epidemic, working to increase kidney patients’ access to life-saving care, increasing accountability at VA hospitals, working for transparency to control pricing on pharmaceuticals like insulin, and freeing Americans from Obamacare’s individual mandate. We were reminded that, under Obama and Biden, China enjoyed almost complete control over the production of pharmaceuticals we need. That if Biden ever gets in and the Democrats implement their socialized medicine proposals, “You don’t beat the odds — you become the odds.” You don’t hear that the other 47 months.

And so the excellent night went. Speakers reminded us that the Democrats now are so extreme that they advocate defunding the police. “Isn’t it ironic,” Vernon Jones asked, “that Democrat leaders have personal security to protect them? So why don’t they forgo their security and replace them with social workers, especially since that’s what they want for you and me?” You sure don’t hear that on prime time the other 47 months.

Black speakers continued praising the president’s support for their communities. He gave historic funding to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and guaranteed that funding long-term. By contrast, under Obama and Biden, the HBCUs had to return to Washington, hat in hand, every year to beg for renewed funding. In addition, Black speakers praised the president for supporting school choice to allow parents, particularly in inner cities where failed public schools are all too common, to opt out of bad local schools so that their children can get the same quality of education that children of wealthier families, like the Obamas, get. Moreover, the president also built the most inclusive economy, with record-high Black job participation and record-low unemployment. And the president reversed Joe Biden’s legislation that incarcerated more young Black males, as Trump introduced historic crime reform.

With so many Blacks endorsing Trump on Monday night and pointing to his long list of achievements for their community, in sharp contrast to Biden’s 47 years in Washington with no tangible results to show despite all his promises and half-century of bluster, it must have been a confusing night for Biden. So all of those Trump backers “ain’t Black?” But they clearly ain’t White. Where does that leave them? Tough for Biden to sort out.

Next came Andrew Pollack, father of Meadow, his daughter who had been murdered by that “scumbag” — Mr. Pollack’s accurate term — at the Parkland school shooting in Florida. Biden had said it had occurred when he was vice president. Mr. Pollack reminded us that it happened February 2018, and Biden was not in office. Trump was, and the president invited Mr. Pollack and other victims’ family members to the White House, not for a “photo op” but for an intense discussion to grasp the issues and get to the core of the matter of school violence. Pollack described the president as a good man and a great listener. Pollack was straightforward: “He formed a school safety commission … But I’ll bet you never heard about that. Instead, the media turned my daughter’s murder into a coordinated attack on President Trump.” At the presidential press conference aimed at amplifying on what had been discussed and learned about Parkland, Pollack remembered, the media’s first question was not about protecting kids but about a government shutdown.

Pollack was not finished. It emerges that the gunman who committed the mass murder had threatened previously to kill kids at the school, to rape them, to shoot them. In other words, the authorities had been warned about this “scumbag.” (Pollack’s word.) But the Democrats had implemented a typical progressive program called “Restorative Justice,” which blames teachers for students’ failures, thereby putting the kids and their teachers at risk. Pollack praised President Trump for shifting public policy the other way, focusing on “Discipline and Safety.” Biden has promised to bring back Restorative Justice. You sure don’t hear that perspective on Parkland and on school shootings on prime-time TV the other 47 months.

Next came Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the married couple in St. Louis who had to stand in front of their home, brandishing their firearms, to scare off rioters and threatening anarchists away from their homestead. The media had conveyed that the McCloskeys are right-wing extremists, borderline neo-Nazis. It turns out that they are perfectly upright citizens. In fact, they both practice law. In the end, it was not the rioters but they whom the city’s extreme-left Democrats charged with felonies while a Marxist activist stood outside their home with a bullhorn, yelling, “You can’t stop our Revolution.” You don’t hear that on the mainstream media networks the other 47 months.

And so it went throughout the night. Kimberly Guilfoyle, a Latina, great words but much too loud, which was surprising because she has tons of TV experience. Minority Whip Steve Scalise, who was shot and almost killed by a Bernie Sanders supporter. You don’t hear that the other 47 months. Scalise shared a moving story of how the president had consoled a family, Scalise’s relatives, after a loss. You don’t hear about Trump’s humanity and compassion the other 47 months either. Scalise was followed by Rep. Sean Parnell of Pennsylvania, who spoke of fighting in Afghanistan and about a terrible battle where his unit was outnumbered by 10 to 1 yet held the hill even as he was injured three times in the fighting. “I saw ordinary Americans become heroes,” he said. “We all bleed red…. United we were unbeatable.” And then, after 485 days, Sean Parnell came home and watched as Biden “spit venom” at an auto worker who asked him about gun rights.

This soon was followed by a segment that focused on a lesser-known, ongoing Trump achievement: bringing home American hostages locked away in foreign prisons. In three years the president has brought home over 50 hostages from 22 countries, including North Korea, Turkey, Egypt, Venezuela, India, Syria, and Iran. We saw six of them sit with the president in the White House, each serially thanking him for the freedom he brought. You don’t see or hear that on the news the other 47 months.

Next, a deeply moving speech by Maximo Alvarez, an American who had come here from Castro Cuba, who has a business called Sunshine Gasoline Distributors. Mr. Alvarez’s speech was filled with manifest emotion, as he tried to educate viewers that the Democrats’ socialist agenda is not new or “progressive.” Rather, he has heard it before, seen it before, and lived it before under Castro. “I’ve seen people like this before. I’ve seen movements like this before…. I heard the promises of Fidel Castro.” And the people of Cuba swallowed the communist poison pill: Spread the wealth. Defund the police. Free education. Free health care. “They sound familiar. When Fidel Castro was asked if he was a communist, he said he was a Roman Catholic. He knew he had to hide the truth…. When I hear the promises, I hear echoes of a former life I never wanted to hear again…. I choose President Trump because I choose America. I choose freedom.” You don’t see or hear that on the news the other 47 months.

The evening ends with three excellent speeches by three prominent cogs in today’s Republican Party: Nikki Haley, who was Trump’s first UN ambassador; Donald Trump Jr., who referred to Biden as the Loch Ness Monster of the Swamp; and a rousing tour-de-force keynote by Sen. Tim Scott. Haley noted that Joe Biden and the Democrats always blame America first, while Trump puts America first. Haley, as much a woman of color as Kamala Harris, only far more accomplished, emphatically stated that Political Correctness and Cancel Culture are plain wrong, and she challenged those who perpetuate the lie that American society is racist. She reminded us that her father wore a turban, her mother a sari, yet he taught 30 years at an Historically Black College while the mother started her own business. Haley rose to be a governor and, as noted, a UN ambassador.

Sen. Tim Scott brought it all home in a ringing and inspiring keynote that ended the night. The speech was so good that it was worth waiting four years for it, and it will resonate these next four years. That is the most conservatives can ask for from a biased left-wing media, one week where our side gets heard every four years.",https://spectator.org/category/politics/special-report/,2020-08-25
Day Three of the Republican Convention: One Week of Honesty on TV Every Four Years - The American Spectator,"Preface: A Stream of Consciousness on Media Bias, Mass Brainwashing of College Kids and American Voters, and Cancel Culture

Only one more day of truth left for prime-time television, and then we will have to wait four more years. In stark Game of Thrones lingo, Winter Is Coming, and we soon will resume being lectured on White Walker privilege.

It has been such a wonderful three days. I variously channel-surfed to stations I have not watched for years: CBS, NBC, ABC, MSNBC. It was so nice. It was like we had a fair and honest media again. Fair is fair, and they gave the Democrats four such nights last week. That is fine. And if we did not know better, we would be thinking that now the media honorably maintain the balance by giving the GOP four nights. But we know it all is an illusion, a mirage. Of the 209 weeks in a Quadrennium, we get one — actually only four of the seven days of that one week. The Democrats get the other 208.

It is a shame, because that kind of one-sided bias indeed does brainwash people. There is no question but that the lopsided domination of Left Media — the “mainstream” media — not only causes a falsified narrative to be disseminated, but it ultimately intimidates and brainwashes people. Of course it does. A person thinks to himself or herself a certain thought or idea and then finds that “everyone else” disagrees. In time, of course it impacts thinking. That is how the Left has taken over universities and truly brainwashed two generations of their own zombie White Walkers. Of course they have.

That is why we heard so much at this GOP convention about Cancel Culture and repression of conservative ideas. Left-wing professors mix their assigned course materials with their own propaganda. They load their syllabi to force students to read only one message, that of the Left. Even 40 years ago, when I majored in political science at Columbia University, I never once heard the name “Ayn Rand” except when I went into the student health clinic one time with an otolaryngological irritation, and the doctor, a closet libertarian, made small talk with me. All I had been reading for four years was Karl Marx, Frantz Fanon, Karl Marx, Stokely Carmichael, and the Friedrich Engels–Karl Marx Reader. That was then; it is so much worse now. Yes, Ocasio-Hyphen is not super smart, but she also is not super stupid. If we are honest, not just calling people names, we recognize that she speaks coherently, sat through four years of college, passed her tests, got a graduate degree. We fool ourselves by saying that she simply is “stupid.”

Rather, she represents something more egregious: O-Hyphen is what happens when you take an average — that is, a mediocre — intellect, and then force-feed it left-wing pulp for four or six years. That is why she says, in her alternate universe, that the 25th Amendment was passed to stop Franklin Roosevelt from winning a fifth term. That is not “stupid” in the purest sense; rather, that is ignorant — abysmal ignorance. That is why she cannot individuate between gas chambers and crematoria in Auschwitz, on the one hand, and ICE compassionately caring for, feeding, and medically treating illegal aliens on the other. And how can she be so ignorant that she does not know the 25th Amendment was passed well after FDR died in office? Because she was force-fed years of leftist pulp. Why is she a “socialist” (the homogenized name for “communist”)? Because that is what she was taught for six years, that is what she was assigned to read and to regurgitate on her exams: pure pulp fiction.

Of course the enormous media bias — 208 out of 209 weeks devoted to the Democrat-Left — tilts minds. People get deeply impacted by what they think the people around them think. It is rare to find people strong enough to defy the majority, the “common wisdom,” especially when the majority also can fire you and take away the livelihood you need to feed your family, if you do not conform. That is why so many professors who are conservatives hide their views on campuses, while the leftist professors bellow. That even is why some conservative professors publicly espouse a liberal perspective in the classroom but then privately struggle with their consciences off campus, as they share with others who share their views how deeply frustrated they are. It is a Cancel Culture in which we live. And that is why even “science” cannot be trusted on first blush, because even “science” is politicized. If you publish the right “science,” you get the grants and funding to continue your “research.” If you publish the wrong science, even though the data are unmistakable, your funding dries up, and you are canceled. That is the climate that needs to be changed.

When CNN fired my American Spectator colleague, Jeffrey Lord, for tweeting “Sieg Heil!” to the president of Media Matters, whom Jeffrey was criticizing for being anti-free-speech bigots, employing fascist-style tactics to shut down opposing speech in the tradition of repressive Hitler and Mussolini propaganda machines, Jeffrey was perfectly justified in using that hyperbole. No one thought he was advocating Nazism; that would be as insane an inference as when the Left media went crazy on Laura Ingraham four years ago, manipulating a photo where she waved to the GOP convention crowd with an understandably outstretched arm, and they said she had given a Nazi salute. It all is crazy. But CNN used that tweet as their excuse to drop Jeffrey as a commentator. That is Cancel Culture. It happens all over, in every institution where the Left holds sway. I live with it every single day in academia. I always am one joke away, one adjective, one noun away from being canceled. Take this joke, which is not even all that funny (by my finely honed New York Jewish Catskills humor):

“A priest, a pastor, and a rabbit walk into a bar. The rabbit says to the bartender: ‘Don’t look at me. I’m just a typo.’ ”

I would not dare tell that joke on a university campus. First of all, as noted, it is below my humor standards. But more than that, which snowflake will be offended? Someone who is a recovering alcoholic? An atheist? Or maybe someone who complains that the professor used an animal that is … White? Why didn’t the professor use a bear? Or a seal? Or a Doberman Pinscher in the joke? Well, duh, because that doesn’t work in that joke. A Doberman is not a typo of “rabbi.” But that is why Jerry Seinfeld no longer will do comedy on campuses:

The younger generation “just want to use these words,” Seinfeld said. “‘That’s racist, that’s sexist, that’s prejudice.’ They don’t even know what they’re talking about.”

So Day Three is an exciting respite, but the oxygen is waning and soon will be gone for 47 months and three weeks.

It was a great night, so inspiring that I stopped taking notes and just enjoyed it like a great symphony. OK, a symphony joke — since I am not on campus right now:

A guy goes to the cemetery where Beethoven is buried. As he approaches the grave, he sees it is open, and Beethoven actually is sitting up, with pages of music in front of him, vigorously rubbing it all out with an eraser. He is just erasing everything, and the page is titled “Ninth Symphony.” So the guy says: “Beethoven, what in the world are you doing in your grave?” And Beethoven says, “I’m decomposing.”

Day Three at the GOP Convention

OK, back to the convention Day Three. It was a wonderful night. An Ode to Joy. And yet it also was somber and about real life. Kayleigh McEnany told her deeply moving story of the double mastectomy she voluntarily underwent because she was diagnosed with the gene that can cause the same fatal breast cancer that killed her close relatives. She assured us that she knows this president, and he will cover pre-existing conditions. She also told us that he showed enormous personal caring, the side the media obscure. Trump deeply cares about people. There are so many stories of this genre that the media cover up. Kellyanne Conway spoke, and we know she is stepping out now to be a Mom after having done masterfully as counselor to the president. She has to focus on the child at home; besides that focus on Husband George, she also wants to devote more time to the kids in this era of remote learning via Zoom. Sister Deirdre Byrne, M.D., of the Little Workers of the Sacred Hearts, and a former army surgeon, talked forthrightly about the sanctity of life, a very different message and focus than the nun that Joe Biden had at his convention. Lou Holtz, the legendary Notre Dame football coach, gave a fabulous speech for Trump. Michael McHale, president of the National Association of Police Organizations, spoke about the chaos in the streets of Democrat cities and praised President Trump’s unbridled support for our First Responders.

After Rep. Elise Stefanik of upstate New York called out the shame and fiction of last December’s Democrat Debacle, the bogus impeachment that got crushed a few weeks later in the Senate like the spider it was, Jack Brewer spoke. He is a former NFL safety who set special-team records for tackles on teams where he played. He was emphatically pro-Trump, as NFL great Herschel Walker was the day before, and — like Walker and so many others speaking at the convention — he is Black. He returned to Joe Biden’s racist theme that, if you don’t vote for Biden, “You ain’t black.” Brewer is Black, as are Vernon Jones, the Georgia state representative; Kim Klacik, the Baltimore congressional candidate; Herschel Walker; U.S. Sen. Tim Scott; and the many other Black figures supporting Trump. Do you know who actually ain’t Black?

Joe Biden.

There was Chen Guangcheng, blind since his youth and a self-taught attorney, who was locked up in China for four years and then placed under further house arrest because he opposed the Communists’ one-child policy. He made it to America by escaping house arrest and fleeing to the U.S. embassy in Beijing. Unlike Ocasio and Bernie, Elizabeth Warren and the whole left-tilted Democrat Party, Mr. Guangcheng is fiercely pro-Trump and anti-socialism. Or, as Joe Biden might say, “Man, if you’re for Trump and against socialism, you ain’t Chinese.” New York Rep. Lee Zeldin spoke. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa talked about how Trump raced to support Iowa when it was hit with natural disasters that the media never covered, how Trump’s entire agenda has helped farmers significantly, while the socialist Democrat agenda that has enveloped Joe Biden is the most dangerous anti-farm program ever. Next came another Black former NFL football player, Burgess Owens, who is campaigning in Utah for a congressional seat. Like Jack Brewer, who spoke earlier, Owens also was a safety. Interesting that no one picked up on their field positions at a convention that has a salient theme that President Trump is the law-and-order candidate who will support safety while Biden and his entourage work to defund the police. Owens yet again put the lie to Biden’s “You Ain’t Black” racism.

Sam Vigil, whose wife innocently was shot dead while in her garage, praised President Trump’s “Operation Legend,” his crime-enforcement initiative that allows federal agents to work with local police in crime-devastated cities. He told us, “The police were overwhelmed. They needed help. Help arrived when President Trump launched Operation Legend in July of this year. Almost immediately, the FBI took over Jackie’s case. In a matter of days, they arrested four men. The fifth — the suspected killer — is in a Texas jail on unrelated charges.” A particularly powerful moment came next when Clarence Henderson, who was among those in the 1960 Greensboro sit-ins, took center stage to endorse Trump mightily. Instead of “If you vote for Trump, you ain’t Black,” Henderson said “If you vote for Biden, you don’t know history.” Henderson reminded us why he rightly is regarded as a civil rights hero and what real history teaches:

Walking into the Woolworth Department Store on February 2, 1960, I knew it was unlike any day I’d experienced before. My friends had been denied service the day before because of the color of their skin. We knew it wasn’t right. But when we went back the next day, I didn’t know whether I was going to come out in a vertical or prone position, in handcuffs or on a stretcher or even in a body bag…. It was the Republican Party that passed the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. It was the Republican Party that passed the 14th Amendment giving black men citizenship. And it was the Republican Party that passed the 15th Amendment giving Black men the right to vote.

They don’t teach it that way in college or grad school, and teachers who try to do so get fired or canceled. But that is the truth that sneaks onto the TV screen one week every four years. Henderson tied his message together by saying that “These achievements demonstrate that Donald Trump truly cares about Black lives. His policies show his heart. He has done more for Black Americans in four years than Joe Biden has done in 50.”

The evening wound down with two wonderful speeches. Richard Grenell, our former ambassador to Germany and then our former Acting Director of National Intelligence, powerfully praised Trump’s foreign policy achievements. Trump had charmed Angela Merkel but also got her to pay more towards NATO. While Obama and Biden flew in hundreds of millions in cash to Iran, Trump flew in the attack craft that evaporated Iran’s master of worldwide terror, Qassem Soleimani. We were reminded that, in a career spanning nearly half a century in Washington, the historical record shows that Biden has been wrong on almost every single issue that ever has come before him. Even on killing Osama bin Laden, Biden advised Obama to wait.

Mike Pence finished with a very fine vice presidential speech that touched on all themes of the convention and the Trump–Pence first term. It was wonderful to hear but a bit saddening, too, because it means we have only one more night of Truth left on mainstream TV media before the long cold night of 47 months and three weeks of left-wing media bias resumes. Savor it. If we want any other truth to get onto the NBC, ABC, CBS, PBS, CNN, or MSNBC screens between now and November 3, Trump and the GOP will have to buy the minutes. At least Cancel Culture still allows that. Don’t be sure that right will survive four years hence if the Left wins in November and extends their digital-media censorship beyond Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook to permeate into broadcast media.",https://spectator.org/category/sunday-report/,2020-08-27
Does Republican Sen. Loeffler Own a Portrait of Mao? - The American Spectator,"B

efore the November vote, Sen. Kelly Loeffler was running against Republicans as well as Democrats. Republican Rep. Doug Collins, who was eliminated by the November 3 vote, accused her of displaying a pricey Andy Warhol portrait of Mao Zedong in her home: “Seems a little hypocritical, or maybe it’s just enlightening.”

She denied ownership and accused him of photoshopping a picture he claimed came from Instagram. Since she outpolled Collins, knocking him out of the runoff, the issue must not have bothered many Georgians. But with polls showing her behind in the runoff, maybe she should embrace Mao. She could run some ads to that effect in Athens, home of the University of Georgia. It might help her win the student vote!

The issue does raise the question: are you what you collect? Despite Collins’ dark insinuations, there isn’t much evidence that Loeffler is a Maoist, whether or not the Warhol hangs in her foyer as claimed. In this case, at least, what she collects tells us nothing about her politics.

Perhaps collecting is a modern and urban replacement for hunting. In the past, accumulating a good collection meant haunting antique and junk shops, as well as attending out-of-the-way auctions. The internet has vastly expanded potential sources of supply. Collectors are still involved in the hunt, but it has grown to be much more complex and detailed.

I’m convinced it is a genetic quirk. You either have it or you don’t. If you have it, you are liable to collect almost anything. What you buy depends on a unique inner desire or interest. Which in some cases can be quite strange. A makeup artist at one of the cable stations where I was a talking head collected the macabre — coffins, skulls, and other such objects. Not what I’m into, but I certainly understood the underlying desire.

My interests have turned out to be constantly expanding. One of them is commie tchotchke. A Russian I’ve dealt with for years peddles the stuff on eBay. So my office areas are filled with Soviet desk ornaments, toy weapons, political commemorations, medallions, miniature military monuments, and more. Best are my busts. I’ve got Vladimir Ilych Lenin, of course, as well as Joseph Stalin. Neither killed quite as many people as Mao, but Stalin probably ranks No. 2 in raw numbers, with Adolf Hitler trailing in third place (though his attempt to eliminate an entire people puts him into his own uniquely odious category).

My favorite, however, are busts of secret police chiefs. I mean, what kind of a system celebrates the bad cops who arrest, torture, and murder people? Not just a few people. But thousands, even millions of them? I’ve got Felix Dzerzhinsky, also known as Iron Felix, the Polish communist who took over the newly formed All-Russian Extraordinary Commission, or Cheka, the first iteration of what eventually ended up as the better-known KGB. He died in 1926, so he was denied the opportunity to become a truly mass killer. His scraggly goatee makes him quite recognizable. All the commie notables showed up as his funeral to honor their designated murderer.

Even better is my bust of Lavrentiy Beria, Stalin’s factotum who was brought into what then was known as the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, or NKVD, to end the Great Purge and move the country back to more normal brutal repression, when there had to be at least a slightly logical reason before you were imprisoned or killed. Beria, conspicuous with his pince-nez glasses, handled a little of everything, including executing his predecessor, murdering Poles after the Soviet Union swallowed half of that nation as part of the Hitler–Stalin pact, managing wartime armaments production, and overseeing the nuclear weapons program. Supremely competent, he was prepared to imprison or murder even close associates to advance his position. He also was a serial rapist. (Shortly after Stalin’s death, his colleagues arrested and executed him. Ironically, his international views were liberal and he might have ended the Cold War three decades early.) Just think of who would honor such a person. Having his bust on my desk offers inspiration of sorts, reminding me of man’s supreme inhumanity to man.

It might make sense to try to collect a rogue’s gallery of busts. I’ve been to the People’s Republic of China but haven’t yet bought one of Mao, perhaps because they seem so common, being sold openly today. It actually takes a bit of effort to get Beria, since his likeness is hardly a hot item jumping off shelves in Moscow. I’ve also thought of looking for busts of Pol Pot, though I don’t know if Brother No. 1 went in for such things. There probably is one out there of Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian dictator who was crazy even by Soviet standards. Although North Korea, which I’ve visited twice, is full of pictures and statues of “Great Leader” Kim Il-sung, I don’t remember seeing any busts on sale.

In contrast, owning a Hitler bust would just seem creepy. He represents a higher form of evil, dedicated to committing genocide, rather than merely engaging in mass murder or, more accurately, mass killing, incidental to preserving power, reengineering society, or some other evil yet comprehensible political goal. There also is the swastika. Anyone collecting German militaria from World War II will end up with items with swastikas on them. EBay won’t allow the sale of anything with that symbol, which has led to some elaborate photo fakery and coded descriptions.

A few years back, an analyst with a human rights group who collected German as well as U.S. military items posted a photo of himself wearing a sweatshirt with an Iron Cross and was accused of being a Nazi sympathizer. In fact, the Iron Cross is a military decoration created in 1813 by Prussia’s King Frederick William III and has nothing to do with the Nazis. The collector also was attacked for using Flak88 as his web identity and license plate. That referred to the German 88mm gun, which became famous through its use against both aircraft and tanks. It is one of the most recognizable weapons of World War II. I hesitate to confess, given the woke world in which we live, that I spent my high school years devouring books on that conflict and I bought a model of the 88, which sits atop a file cabinet, an unmistakable symbol of the war.

But he also was attacked for owning military items with a swastika, though doing so no more indicates sympathy with Nazism than owning an item with a hammer and sickle demonstrates belief in communism. In this case, the attacks on him were consciously dishonest and politically motivated — I wrote a column about it at the time — and misconstrued what collecting is about. I have some World War I and World War II German military items. The former display imperial symbols, the later swastikas. That is a tragic aspect of history. As it is with all my commie stuff, which means my house has many times as many depictions of the hammer and sickle as any other political symbol, including Republican and Democrat imagery. (Yes, I realize some American Spectator readers likely believe that the Democratic donkey and Communist hammer and sickle are one and the same!) Still, aware of the extra sensitivity I try to be careful in what I put in public spots likely to be seen by other people.

Of course, collecting goes to far more than politics. As I’ve detailed before, I have collected some “turtle ships”, which reflect the history of Korea, which I study. I’ve accumulated lots of M&M containers and other items, reflecting my status as a helpless chocoholic. There are many chess sets: though I enjoy playing the game, I am far better at collecting chess items of all sorts. I’ve picked up lead Civil War soldiers, from both North and South, which engage in combat atop file cabinets and other assorted surfaces. A bibliophile, I own miscellaneous well-illustrated war histories, especially of the Franco-Prussian War and World War I. My first such acquisitions came while I was in high school and living in the United Kingdom, where my Air Force father was stationed.

So the next time a public figure is attacked for something they collect, don’t worry. The Mao portrait probably doesn’t mean they are a commie dedicated to launching an American version of the Cultural Revolution. Rather, they might like collecting Warhol. Or political figures. Or they might want to be seen as trendy. Or perhaps they fell in love with the artistic interpretation of a historical figure. Maybe they liked the unique color scheme. Anyway, it could be worse. They could collect something really strange, like gravestones. Or death masks!

Still, just reading about the Loeffler contretemps got me thinking. I really need a Mao bust or two. I’m going to look for one on my next trip to China. But I really don’t want to wait that long. Maybe there’s something on eBay …

From Silent Majority to Deplorables to Semi-Fascists: Elites’ Demonization of Republicans - The American Spectator,"Republicans in America are witnessing their own stunning anthropological metamorphosis.

It is like being conscious on an operating table while watching your body turn into a ghoulish creature. The celebrated Roman poet, Ovid, who lived during the time of Caesar Augustus, could never have imagined this transformation when he created Metamorphoses, a narrative poem about the evolution of history.

Once upon a time, Republicans were considered the silent majority: taciturn, honest folk who worked with their hands, creating things for other people, worshipping God in His kingdom. They paid their taxes, ate early, and went to bed early. Many came from the “show me” culture native to the state of Missouri and were skeptical of flashiness. Still others said the Pledge of Allegiance and had family gatherings worthy of a Norman Rockwell painting. They were not fashionable, and they had no use for the Nantucket-red accoutrements of Ralph Lauren, suitable for a croquet party on a long afternoon in the Hamptons.

Such people valued hard work and self-discipline; many were self-effacing. They were not into conspicuous consumption and drove cars designed in Dearborn and Flint, Michigan. They wore Timex and Hamilton watches, not Pateks. Some drove green and yellow John Deere rigs. They rejected Big Government, believing it a rude intrusion into the basics of life by careerist politicians down East, who wore heavily snaffled Gucci shoes in the frescoed halls of Congress. They liked heroes from the highly decorated soldier Audie Murphy to Joe DiMaggio of the New York Yankees. They were not taken in by the Beat Generation, hippie culture, and the psychedelic, permissive lure of the Age of Aquarius. Nor are they taken in today by the PC lobby and the cult of victimization, created by so-called progressive politicians who purport to be champions of others, fastidiously maintaining their careerist perks in political perpetuity.

Then suddenly, there was a metamorphosis. In the twinkling of an eye, as in 1 Corinthians, many Republicans were put into a “basket of deplorables.” In the famous 2016 presidential campaign speech by Hillary Clinton, she branded half of Trump’s supporters as worthy of censure or contempt. In a glib phrase, just a nanosecond by the time it was converted into electromagnetic waves by the mainstream media, half of the Republican electorate was characterized by Madame Clinton as wretched and dishonorable. She labeled many of the silent majority as “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.” Never in history had so many been characterized as so repugnant by so few. (READ MORE by Frank Schell: All the President’s Disconnects)

In cosmological terms, the red states were seen as flyover country, worthy of being observed only from the comfort- and mimosa-sipping first-class section of a wide-body Boeing 767. The implication was that the coastal elites knew how to think and live — and that they were “destined to govern and subdue,” like the British in India. Indeed, the entitlement culture of the Clinton dynasty was hard at work, suggesting that the elegant, omniscient, kale-eating elites of the coasts were vastly superior to the crude carnivores of the interior. This phenomenon brings to mind the words of then-Sen. Barack Obama, who, campaigning for the presidency in 2008, referred to working-class voters who “cling to guns and religion” — suggesting an atavistic no man’s land with vast brain-dead populations, a mutant species like the Eloi in H.G. Wells’ The Time Machine.

And the changing morphology continues today. Not long ago at a fundraiser in Maryland, President Joe Biden referred to supporters of former President Donald Trump as semi-fascists, also suggesting that there are very few “real Republicans” left. Technically speaking, Biden was referring to MAGA Republicans; but it is hard to define exactly what those are, other than many cheering people wearing red hats, some of which could of course be extremists. And by the time the commentators and social media picked up the message, it got blurred, the nuance was lost, and people construed what they wanted to construe: Biden says Republicans are semi-fascists — the specter of Stalin and Hitler, and other dictators who come to mind.

The breathtaking metamorphosis from reliable, hardworking folk to deplorables to semi-fascists is now complete — unless even worse caricatures emerge. But after all, what is so wrong with wanting to make America great again?

What will they think of next?

The Growing ‘God Gap’ Between Democrats and Republicans - The American Spectator,"“The biggest story about American religion and politics is that Democrats (specifically white ones) are becoming much, much less religious now.”

That’s Ryan Burge, religious pollster par excellence, in a year-in-review Twitter post that summarizes one of his most retweeted graphs of 2022. He puts statistical meat on the bones of religious disaffiliation: while in 1988 only 6 percent of white Democrats identified as atheists or agnostics, that number jumped in 2021 to 32 percent. That’s nearly one-third of all white Democrats.

The percentage of nonwhite Democrats who have fled God has also risen, but much less dramatically. It increased from 3 percent in 1988 to 8 percent in 2021.

Contrast that with Republicans, whose numbers of atheists and agnostics only increased slightly over the same time frame. In 1988, about 4 percent of white and nonwhite Republicans identified as such. In 2021, about 10 percent of nonwhite and 8 percent of white Republicans said they were atheists or agnostics.

When we peer into the future, we see the ‘God gap’ expanding. About 40 percent of millennials (born 1981–1994) and Gen Zers (born 1995–early 2010s) self-identify as “nones” (people who say they are atheists, agnostics, or “nothing in particular”). These are the same cohorts that rushed to the polls in the 2022 midterms and pushed many toss-up races to the Democrat ledger. While some studies suggest that the rate of “none-ness” in these generations may be leveling off, the fact that 40 percent of young people in this country claim no religion does not augur well for people of faith. (READ MORE from Tom Raabe: Losing the Youth Vote)

The bottom line is that in the last 30 years, the “God gap” between Democrats and Republicans has become a God chasm, and it’s likely to get deeper and wider as the years pass.

This brings to my mind Martin Luther’s favorite question, to wit: “What does this mean?”

It means, first of all, that the Democrats should find religion. And by “religion,” I mean religion that includes, you know, God, and not one that directs worship toward a putative entity whose name also starts with an uppercase “G” — Gaia.

As unlikely as it may seem, some in the political arena are advocating just that. After the Democratic Party passed a resolution a few years ago praising religious “nones,” Stephen Prothero, a well-known American scholar of religion, told the Deseret News’ Kelsey Dallas that it was an unforced error. Democrats are already known as the anti-God party; why are they focusing on the nonreligious?

“One of the reasons for the success of the Republican Party in my adult lifetime,” Prothero said, “is because they were able to position themselves as Christians and position Democrats as godless.”

Prothero wants Democrats to tap into the God market, if only to expand their political holdings.

If past be prologue, it’s not going to happen. This is the party that booed God at its 2012 convention, after all. (In 2008, the Democrats removed mention of God from their party platform; when in 2012 some tried to add God back, many in the assembly booed.) It also boasts a social platform that pushes against historic Christian morality at nearly every turn — including on abortion, same-sex marriage, gender identity, end-of-life issues, and religious freedom.

In November, the Senate passed by a 61–36 tally the ignominiously named Respect for Marriage Act, codifying same-sex marriage with all Democrats but one (Sen. Raphael Warnock sat this one out) and 12 Republicans. The American Spectator’s George Neumayr lamented:

The “gay marriage debate” is a zero-sum game that the “woke” have won and Christians have lost. Their banishment from the public square will now accelerate. In the eyes of the government, they will occupy the same moral category as segregationists, and the state will mistreat them accordingly.

The religious liberty battles surrounding same-sex weddings bear witness to this. The Left (in reality, a term synonymous with “Democrats”) offers no quarter to Christian wedding vendors wishing to honor their consciences, instead focusing obsessively on furthering nondiscrimination protections for their LGBTQ supporters. In case after case — be it involving bakers, florists, photographers, web designers, etc. — militant leftists bring charges against a lone Christian wedding vendor whose beliefs forbid him or her from servicing their weddings, even though plentiful compliant vendors are available nearby. Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop fame operates in suburban Denver; there must be plenty of bakers within walking distance of his shop willing to comply with requests for custom-made gay wedding cakes. (READ MORE: The Insane Persecution of the Christian Baker Jack Phillips)

Whether it’s following one’s beliefs as a wedding vendor (Jack Phillips, Lorie Smith, Barronelle Stutzman), praying in public as a government employee (Joe Kennedy), conducting business as a company (Hobby Lobby), or practicing religious faith as an adoption provider (Catholic Social Services of Philadelphia), the Left targets freedom of religious expression with unrelenting tenacity. Its preservation hangs by the thread of a single vote (sometimes two) in the Supreme Court.

Although spoken six years ago, the words of U.S. Civil Rights Commission Chairman Martin R. Castro sum up the Democrat stance on religious liberty: “The phrases ‘religious liberty’ and ‘religious freedom’ will stand for nothing except hypocrisy so long as they remain code words for discrimination, intolerance, racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, Christian supremacy, or any form of intolerance.”

Speaking of intolerance, consider the full-court press that the Biden administration has applied against religious freedom. Since assuming office, the Biden team has made noise about requiring doctors to perform medical procedures that violate their consciences; requiring the inclusion of abortion and sex-change operations on company health plans; requiring schools to hew to the transgender agenda in bathroom use or lose their federal lunch money; and a host of other threats to Americans’ religious activities.

As if that is not enough, look at the Democrat campaign to shut down religious meetings during the pandemic. The onerous, inequitable forced cancellation of worship services, or even group Bible studies or get-togethers (sometimes outside!), when “essential services” — which included malls, retail shops, casinos, hair salons, and even tattoo parlors in some places — were allowed to remain open, has had lingering effects on church attendance. Many churches report current attendance well shy of pre-pandemic numbers. Democrat governors and health officials kept churches shuttered long after it was necessary, if it ever was. Again, in many instances, a vote or two in the Supreme Court were all that restrained Democrat politicians from hitting religion even harder. Let’s hope that vote is still there when the next pandemic hits.

Let’s also hope the Democrats take seriously the appeal to find religion. It would be good for the country; it would be good for religious freedom; and it would be good for their souls.

The Rise of Hispanic Religious Republicans - The American Spectator,"The New York Times is famous for its anthropological studies of conservatives — what wags have called “gorillas in the mist” coverage. The newspaper’s latest anthropological installment is “The Rise of the Far-Right Latina.” That smearing label tells us less about the three Hispanic Texas Republicans profiled in the piece than it does the paper’s hysterical liberal bias and the left’s general obtuseness. Even prosaic conservatism, grounded in the country’s history and traditions, qualifies as “far-right” to woke reporters like Jennifer Medina, who never bothers to examine in the article the “far-left” character of the Democratic Party and progressive movement that is driving Hispanics into the arms of the GOP.

Medina does correctly report that Rep. Mayra Flores and other Hispanic politicians in Texas gravitated to the GOP not because of any moderate outreach by country club Republicans but because of the party’s perennial platform in favor of patriotism, faith, and the traditional family. Flores ran on the slogan “God, family, country.” (To the Times, this is bafflingly reactionary.)

“For years, Texas Republicans tried to win the Hispanic vote using a Bush-era brand of compassionate conservatism,” Medina writes. “The idea was that a moderate’s touch and a softer rhetoric on immigration were key to making inroads with Hispanic voters, particularly in Democratic strongholds along the southern border.” But that’s not what Hispanic voters wanted, she says, observing that Flores won her seat in a deep blue congressional district by “shunning moderates” and “wearing her support for Donald J. Trump on her sleeve—more Marjorie Taylor Greene than Kay Bailey Hutchinson.” (READ MORE: What the Victory of Mayra Flores Portends for the Democrats)

One hopes the GOP leadership is taking note here. Its success with Hispanic voters is contingent upon rejecting the wokeness of the Democrats, not aping them. It is the glaring contrast between the parties that explains the defections of Hispanics to the GOP. They come from a traditional culture that has little time for the gender and race obsessions of the Democrats and instills a work ethic that makes Hispanics more interested in capitalist opportunities to escape poverty than left-wing lectures about it.

This is true not only in North America but also in South America, where aspirational Hispanic evangelicals are pushing countries like Brazil to the right. Much like the failure of socialist wokeness in America, “liberation theology” leaves upwardly mobile Hispanics in South America cold. They want a hand out of poverty, not sermonizing about it.

Medina works hard to make Flores, Monica De La Cruz, and Cassy Garcia (the latter two are congressional candidates in Texas) look extreme. But this effort fails. For the most part, the women, dubbed by the GOP a “triple threat,” just hold standard conservative views on abortion and illegal immigration and simply want to live in a country that is recognizably American. The simple nationalism that Trump offers is comprehensible to them, if only because they come from a culture that takes such nationalism for granted too. What’s not understandable to them is a party that celebrates open borders, flag boycotters, and the desecration of its country’s history.

The man-bites-dog story is not the rise of Hispanic Republicans but the almost total indifference of Democrats, supposedly so sensitive to minorities, in losing them. Even as Hispanics ditch them in droves, they continue to prattle on about “gender fluidity” and critical race theory.

Medina, of course, portrays Flores as a religious weirdo. “As she moved into her congressional office across from the Capitol, Ms. Flores, an evangelical Christian, eyed the bare walls. She planned to put up a large photo of the SpaceX launch site in her district as well as images of Jesus,” Medina reports. “She had campaigned with the support of evangelical churches; her pastor carried out a ‘Make America Godly Again’ outreach effort and traveled to Washington for her swearing-in.”

Oh my. It apparently shocks the Times that not everyone shares its militant secularism. In response to the article, Flores has commented witheringly on the media’s hostility to her:

I was born in Burgos, Tamaulipas, Mexico, and raised with strong Conservative values to always put God and Family first. I have received only hate from the liberal media and constantly [been] told by the left to go back to Mexico. They don’t support us immigrants, they only use us for political power and don’t care about our well-being. I am here now and I won’t allow them to continue taking advantage of my people. The NYT knows nothing about me or our culture. Somos gente de Dios, Familia y Travajo [We are people of God, Family and Work], Si Señor!”

Indeed, woke media liberals and Democrats grow ever more myopic, too sheltered in their secularism and boutique causes to grasp the ordinary motivations of alienated Hispanics. Only a newspaper blinded by its own extremism would treat Texas’s “triple threat” as a bizarre “far-right” curiosity.",https://spectator.org/charlie-crist-governor-candidate-preposterous/,2022-07-10
Republicans’ Opportunity: Populism Without Trump - The American Spectator,"November’s result should not obscure the fact that Trump bequeathed Republicans a winning populist strategy. The question is whether there can be populism without his persona. Republicans should seek to find out, or at least they should be if they have any political sense. Trump has drawn Republicans the populist blueprint; now someone else must build from it.

There is an irony in a flawed candidate devising a nearly flawless political strategy. Both apply to Trump. Yet while the former has been overemphasized to the point of absurdity, inaccuracy, and distortion, the latter has been deliberately overlooked.

Democrats, establishment media, the Left, and the Republican elite all want Trump’s populism to disappear. They are all threatened by it and would love 2020’s outcome to be its obituary. If Republicans are smart, 2020 will be its rebirth in an even more palatable and potent form.

For two elections, Trump stole what the Left and Democrats believed to be their birthright: populism. Trump eschewed the elite, of which he could have been a natural member; the elite never forgave his apostasy. Instead, he forged an unmistakable — and undeniably effective and formidable — political populism.

While the Left and Democrats never could — and never will — admit it, Trump owned their terrain to an extent they have not for decades. Unable to attack him for a populism they have long supported in name only, they vilified and delegitimized him, but they were unable to “de-populize” him or his appeal.

Trump went after America’s working class by going after elite policies. Uncontrolled immigration, unbalanced trade, endless military actions abroad, and a general policy of putting America’s interests behind those of other nations and global goals all fell in his crosshairs. Like federal domestic programs that subsidized others, these elite programs’ costs were borne by America’s working class but bore them nothing.

As a result, in 2016 Trump improved dramatically on Romney’s 2012 electoral vote count — the place where elections are decided. Trump won two million more votes and added 98 electoral votes and six states (Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida) to Republicans’ column.

In 2020, Trump improved substantially in total votes, adding 11 million and increasing his share of the popular vote total from 46.1 percent to 47.2 percent. Yes, he lost five states from 2016 (Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona), but he did so by the barest margins: 159,000 votes.

In reviewing the 2020 outcome, it is crucial that its context by understood. Trump lost his five states by just 0.8 percent of the votes cast in these states. Further, he did so after four years of establishment media vituperation. For two years he faced organized opposition in the House, which included hearings and investigations and culminated in impeachment. This year he faced Senate trial, a global pandemic, lockdowns, economic collapse, and a summer of riots. In the election itself, there was an unprecedented use of mail-in ballots, which helped increase the vote total by almost 24 million votes, almost 20 percent higher than 2016’s. Still, he barely lost.

Despite what the opposition will insist, Republicans should see that Trump’s populism almost succeeded despite him. It also means that the prospect exists that it could do even better without him. The question is not whether populism worked for Republicans, but whether they will try to run with it again without Trump. The clear answer is that they would be fools not to try.

As evidence of its potency consider the populist approach’s electoral efficiency for Republicans. In 2016, Trump won his decisive additional electoral votes and states despite winning 1.1 percent less of the popular vote than Romney did four years earlier. Even with all the obstacles Trump faced in 2020, he still won the same percentage of the popular vote that Romney did in 2012 and 26 more electoral votes — while missing 63 more by less than 1 percent of the votes cast there.

Imagine a Trump populist message with a new Republican messenger. Just returning Republican and Independent suburban women would likely have flipped the outcome in the crucial battleground states. Republicans only need to flip 2 percent of the voters to win the popular vote, but just 0.5 percent on average to flip the five battleground states Trump lost in 2020.

The bigger question is whether Republicans will pursue populism without Trump. Trump has been so denigrated by the establishment media and political opponents — both inside and outside the party — that his obvious political accomplishment is overlooked. Trump arguably created a movement. His enemies would like nothing more than to have his nascent populist movement discredited with him.

This year’s contest was a realigning election. It was not in the way realigning elections are generally considered — geographically — but instead was a class realignment. This campaign removed all doubt as to which party represented the nation’s wealth and political and media establishment — its self-styled “elite.” The wealthiest states and urban areas went for Biden. The establishment media was for Biden. Big businesses went for Biden. Outside money was for Biden and Democrats enjoyed an enormous campaign cash advantage. Again, they were obstacles Trump and his populism almost overcame.

It was a class realignment election because of Trump. Of course, there are those who will dispute this for their own purposes. The Left and Democrats want to retain the rhetoric of populism for themselves. The Republican establishment want to retain the party for themselves after populism wrested it from them.

In the wake of this clear realignment, Republicans must ask whether they can realign themselves. Can Republicans raise a new messenger of the Trump message and seize the opportunity before them?

Why Republicans Won’t Abandon Trump - The American Spectator,"Glenn Reynolds of Instapundit fame says about climate change, “I’ll believe it’s a crisis when the people who tell me it’s a crisis start acting like it’s a crisis.” He means, of course, that when all those lecturing Americans about the end of the world give up their three yachts, two private jets, four 20,000-square-foot air-conditioned homes, then he’ll believe they believe their own bull about climate change. They don’t believe it’s that bad, which is why they live like Russian oligarchs. Why should anyone listen to them or subject themselves to rules they themselves ignore?

Using this same reasoning, Republican voters will believe there’s a corruption crisis deserving of impeachment when the people who tell them it’s a crisis start acting like it’s a crisis. The media, Democrats, and anti-Trumpers have been caterwauling for three years about President Trump violating norms, abusing power, bullying (and now bribing! Gasp!) governments, and generally using the power of the executive branch to act like he’s been crowned king. Whether this is true or not is up for debate.

Trump haters are confounded by Trump supporters. They ask, “If you believe it’s true that Trump does sketchy things, why don’t you care?” They ask the same question about the climate: “You concede that the climate is changing, so why won’t you do something about it?”

The answer: You first.

In the case of climate change, the religionists would recruit more adherents if they weren’t so utterly hypocritical in their lives. Maybe people would start cycling and driving a Prius. Likewise, the new converts to constrained executive power, adherence to norms, and a president who isn’t hostile to half of America would be taken more seriously if they ever took corruption seriously in the past. They didn’t. So current Republicans shrug with President Trump.

Here’s a smattering of what didn’t bother the corruption biddies with Obama: A daily, often illegal, executive order. Obama pompously threatened and humiliated the Supreme Court to their faces during the State of the Union. Anyone who disagreed with him was accused of racism. He called people who didn’t vote for him “bitter clingers” and “tea baggers.” Narcissism? He carried around a selfie stick and slow-jammed the news like a teenager. Foreign policy? He gave guns to Mexican drug cartels and pallets of money to the leading worldwide sponsor of terror. He started inane wars and ignored red lines. He used the power of the FBI, DOJ, and State Department to help his party surveil the leading candidate for the opposing party. And then, his minions in all parts of the government, continued their sanctioned behavior to unseat the duly elected president. Obama’s administration got rich while serving — both his secretary of state and vice president used their power for personal gain. His OMB revealed every person who worked in government to the Chinese, which resulted in murdered spies. Ambassadors weren’t pestered on Twitter; they were left to die. And then, innocent civilians were blamed for videos and imprisoned. What? Nothing? How about the active bugging of journalists’ homes, computers, and their parents’ homes? Still nothing?

And where was the media? Where were the righteous government workers and whistleblowers appalled at the president’s behavior? There were some. They were just fired, prosecuted, or imprisoned. Where was the investigation by Congress into the abuses of power and corruption? Nowhere. In fact, these same folks will, with a straight face, say that the Obama administration was “scandal-free.” Of course it was. Everyone was in on the scandal. The media actively covered for President Obama and still do.

Just this past week, the AFP published a story about all the kids locked in cages. Over 100,000! All the major news agencies picked it up. And then it was discovered that the story, a hit piece ostensibly on President Trump, was describing conditions at the border in 2015. Those poor, poor children were locked up by President Precious. Mustn’t hurt the precious. So, they didn’t correct the story. AFP deleted it. And so did everyone else.

Where were the talking heads intoning about the inhumanity? Suddenly very, very quiet.

President Obama was a divisive, corrupt, childish, narcissistic president, and there was no investigation. No digging for evidence. No 99 percent negative press coverage. A no-talent do-nothing community organizer with zero skills and a scant résumé made it into the Oval Office and was fawned over for eight years.

It wasn’t just his own party or the media. So-called conservatives like David Brooks liked the crease in Obama’s pants. Peggy Noonan praised him. The standard-bearers of conservative commentary carefully criticized him, if they did at all, lest they be accused of racism.

These same folks loved Jeb! and Marco Rubio and disliked Ted Cruz. They disliked Ted Cruz enough that they preferred Donald Trump over him.

President Trump is a terrible Republican. It’s true. Unlike most Republicans, he keeps his campaign promises. He reduced taxes. He attempted to get rid of Obamacare with Congress and did everything he could do by executive order when the GOP couldn’t get its act together. He reduced illegal immigration. His administration is rounding up pedophiles around the world. He made an environment safe for jobs by reducing regulation. He’s minimized American involvement in conflict. He’s sought to end needless interventions. He’s armed friends (Ukraine, Poland, Israel) and restrained enemies. He’s stopped playing games with the Palestinians and cut off aid. He moved the American embassy to Jerusalem. He removed America from the idiotic Paris Accords and the even dumber Iran Deal. Against an entitled bureaucratic morass, he has attempted to fulfill the wishes of his constituents, and in the process the economy has soared and families and businesses are thriving.

And Trump fights. That’s the main way he’s not Republican. He doesn’t cower in fear in front of a ravenous media. He raves back.

No one is used to this behavior from a Republican. Trump acts like a Democrat — keeping promises and pushing forward. To be a good Republican is to know his place: quavering, unsure of his convictions, fearful of being called racist, sexist, homophobic, and generally evil (so a normal Republican acts: as Democrat as possible in an attempt to be loved — it never works). Trump refuses to play that game. He doesn’t care if he’s loved by the “haters and losers.” He wants to get things done.

Republican voters, so used to being maligned, are loving winning. They know that the media, Democrats, and anti-Trumpers don’t care about corruption. Not really. Because if they did, the Obama administration would have been under constant scrutiny. It wasn’t. Every bad decision and bad action wasn’t just ignored; it was often cheered. The results were disastrous to the economy, to families, to foreign enterprises. No one seemed to care then.

Like the climate activist jetting around and lecturing everyone, the newfound D.C. concern about corruption, overreach, violated norms, and general political nastiness is self-serving. Those who spent the Obama years lecturing their lessers and now decry being insulted might consider looking inward. But they’re not. They’re excusing the Bidens’ and Clintons’ trading favors, enriching themselves, and being utterly corrupt.

Why should any American voter, never mind a Republican, pay one bit of attention to the impeachment fiasco and take it seriously? As more “facts” come out, the narrative helps Trump. One bureaucrat after another dislikes him, his style, his decisions. D.C. screams, “Corruption!”

Republicans’ response to this newfound concern? If you want to clean up the political climate, how about you start with your own house?

You first.",https://spectator.org/covid-economy-american-spectator-print-magazine/,2019-11-25
Why Would Republicans Rule Out Social Security and Medicare Reform? - The American Spectator,"If you follow policy debates long enough, arguments you never thought you’d hear can become key components of the two parties’ policy platforms. That’s certainly the case when it comes to some Republicans and their new “never touch Social Security and Medicare” position.

Over the weekend, newly elected GOP Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio tweeted that former President Donald Trump was “100% correct” to demand that “Under no circumstances should Republicans vote to cut a single penny from Medicare or Social Security.” Vance’s tweet was issued amid the debt-ceiling fight, but this position has long been held by Trump.

Trump is 100 percent correct. https://t.co/0zMlgWv5Ye — J.D. Vance (@JDVance1) January 20, 2023

Now, to be fair, the GOP’s well-intentioned engagement in the overall debt-ceiling dispute is limited by the short time Congress has to raise the limit, all but ruling out credible reforms of Medicare or Social Security. Reforming these two programs will take a considerable amount of time and require bipartisan action. However, this reality is no reason to assert that the programs’ benefits should never be touched.

I cannot wait to hear the grand plan that the “don’t touch Social Security and Medicare” Republican caucus has to address the $116 trillion over 30-year shortfall — that’s 6 percent of U.S. GDP — facing the two programs. No action from Congress means no money to pay for all the benefits. That means enormous cuts that will hurt the low-income seniors who truly depend on the programs.

Of course, if Vance and friends insist on not touching benefits, they could address the Social Security and Medicare shortfalls with enormous tax hikes. For Social Security alone, when the trust fund dries out, they will have to agree to immediately raise the payroll tax from 12.4 percent to 15.64 percent — or close to a 25 percent tax increase. Add to that the tax hike necessary for Medicare and then repeat the exercise over the years to fill the entire shortfall.

It’s not as if we haven’t been warning politicians that these troubles were brewing. Back in 2000, roughly when I started working on fiscal issues, experts already warned that the Social Security trust fund would run out of assets by 2037, triggering painful benefit cuts. Today, the situation has deteriorated further, with the trust fund now on track to run dry in 2035, along with any practicable hope for fixing the problem.

In other words, these problems shouldn’t surprise anyone. When Social Security started, life expectancies were lower. In 1950, there were more than 16 workers for every beneficiary. That ratio is now below three workers per retiree and will be only 2.3 workers per retiree by 2035. Add to this trend decades of politicians buying votes by expanding benefits beyond incoming payroll taxes and you have a true fiscal crisis on your hands.

That’s why it’s so alarming that so many in the GOP are giving up on educating a public that’s been brainwashed for years with misleading soundbites like, “You earned your Social Security benefits, so you are entitled to the benefits now promised,” or “There’s an account with your name on it.” Such misinformation has made serious discussion of reform very difficult.

There’s no question that retirees deserve fair treatment, but the facts are that the Supreme Court ruled in 1960 that workers do not have a legally binding right to Social Security benefits, and if Congress cuts benefits even by, say, 50 percent, it can do so — no matter how much anyone has paid into the program. It won’t come to that, but the ruling still stands. It’s also fiction that all the benefits that have been promised were earned by workers — they weren’t. That’s in part because current retirees are paid with taxes from current workers, not from funds saved out of the payroll taxes retirees paid when they were in the workforce.

It’s magical thinking to say that touching Social Security and Medicare is a nonstarter. Even more strange, many of the same Republicans want to spare these two programs while still putting Medicaid on the chopping block. Medicaid should be reformed too, but at least that program serves poor people. By contrast, the seniors who receive Social Security and Medicare today are overrepresented in the top income quintile while younger Americans are overrepresented in the bottom quintile. So, these guys want to cut benefits for poor people on Medicaid while subsidizing relatively wealthy boomers with taxes taken from relatively poor youngsters. Yikes.

The GOP’s transformation into the party of big and fiscally reckless government is proceeding apace.

The Year of the (Republican) Woman - The American Spectator,"Congressman John LeBoutillier once described Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill as “just like the federal budget — fat, bloated, and out of control.”

Physiognomy puts the science in pseudoscience when applied to politicians but little else. Our representatives come to represent, in a physical sense, their institutions. Chuck Schumer’s hairline signals Congress’s honesty; Jerry Nadler’s waistline, its gluttony.

Sen. Patty Murray, who won election to the United States Senate in 1992 as “a mom in tennis shoes,” three decades later looks like Edgar Winter dressing up as Captain Kangaroo for Halloween. The face of the cold, sclerotic institution goes before voters in this Washington after marinating for three decades in that other Washington.

Tiffany Smiley, with a name that suits her, transmits in technicolor versus the black-and-white radiating off her opponent. She runs in this race as the mom in tennis shoes. Aged nine when Murray first won in 1992, Smiley highlights by juxtaposition the worn-down-by-Washington incumbent, who has migrated from the Year of the Woman debutante 30 years ago to a part of the old-boys’ network now.

In recent weeks, Northwest institutions, such as Starbucks, issued cease-and-desist orders to Smiley’s campaign for using their imagery. The Seattle Times, which failed to notice Murray’s using its masthead in past campaign ads, suddenly finds it outrageous that Smiley does so, and in the way just about every candidate airing television ads does so — referencing newspaper headlines. The Seattle Seahawks, which honored Smiley’s husband, the nation’s first blind active-duty military officer, as its 12th man a decade ago, bullied her to stop using imagery of this event even though other candidates have appeared in Seahawks gear without raising the team’s ire.

Murray rejected a number of invitations to debate her opponent, a move that nonpartisan organizers called “unprecedented.” As a compromise of sorts, she finally agreed to participate in a single, one-hour debate to take place this Sunday after the state has sent most ballots to its mostly mail-in electorate. It curiously will air right after the Seahawks–Chargers game and in competition with television’s highest-rated program (Sunday Night Football). She also agreed to appear alongside her opponent at a town hall–style meeting on Oct. 30.

“She knows not to debate,” KIRO Newsradio host John Curley told The American Spectator. “You don’t gain anything by debating when you’re ahead like that. I think they were caught flat-footed. They didn’t think that Smiley would be as competitive as she is.”

The Cook Political Report this week shifted Washington from “solid Democrat” to “likely Democrat.” A Trafalgar Group poll showing Murray hanging on to a two-point lead perhaps reoriented opinion. While other surveys from September show Murray enjoying a comfortable lead, the lack of a poll for the past three weeks demonstrates the degree to which pollsters sleep on Washington’s U.S. Senate race.

Can you blame them?

Washington last voted Republican for president during Ronald Reagan’s reelection and last sent a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 1994 in Slade Gorton. The state seems only somewhat less left-wing than its short-lived CHAZ enclave.

Smiley’s pulling off an upset likely means not only that historians will speak of 2022 alongside 1994, 2014, and other electoral — to borrow a word used by Barack Obama in 2010 — shellackings but that it will go down as the Year of the Republican Woman. Five other Republican women, three of whom look like solid bets to win, run for the Senate. Long-shot Leora Levy, down by just five to Sen. Richard Blumenthal in a shocking new Connecticut Examiner/Fabrizio poll, now possesses an actual shot. Kari Lake in Arizona, Sarah Huckabee Sanders in Arkansas, Tudor Dixon in Michigan, and several other impressive Republican women compete in gubernatorial elections. (READ MORE from Daniel J. Flynn: Do Republicans Party Like It’s 1994 on Nov. 8?)

But only a massive wave would enable a political neophyte and Republican to defeat a five-term senator in a deep-blue state. And the wave that brought Tiffany Smiley to victory would already have brought many others there first.

However unlikely the upset, it seems more unlikely that something, or two or three things, that pundits now dismiss as unlikely will not happen on Election Night. And Washington voters know surprises.

In 1994, Speaker of the House Tom Foley, an understudy to Tip O’Neill, who, like him, began to look as though the physical embodiment of the institution, lost his Eastern Washington district via a shocking upset. Like Murray, he had served 30 years in Congress.

Foley looked untouchable until he looked like the wrong Washington. Patty Murray also looks untouchable. But after 30 years in the nation’s capital, she looks like the wrong Washington, too.",https://spectator.org/derailing-michigan-republican-primary-whitmer-presidential-run/,2022-10-21
