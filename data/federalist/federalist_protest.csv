Welcome to Neoconworld,"Twelve years after the September 11 attacks, threats of American involvement in Syria’s civil war have refocused attention on the region at the heart of our foreign policy: the Greater Middle East. By “Greater Middle East” I mean not only the Arab-Muslim heartland of the Arabian Peninsula, Mesopotamia, and the Levant, but the broader region stretching from Morocco in the west to Pakistan in the east, from Turkey in the north to Yemen in the south (with the exception, of course, of Israel). Many of the countries in the region are not Arab – Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan – but all are predominantly Muslim, and all are infected to one extent or another with the ideology of Islamism, built around the view that Muslims constitute a pan-national political entity and not merely a religious confession.

For the past five years, U.S. foreign policy has been made by senior elected officials and political appointees who, in the words of the Boston Globe, “built careers on [an] anti-war posture.” And yet, our policy in the Greater Middle East remains impervious to new strategic initiatives that seek to fundamentally alter the “neoconservative” course set by the Bush Administration. And while that much-used term is often abused or misunderstood, the policy it describes has taken on a life of its own. It’s still the neocons’ world, and everyone else is living in it. And the jury is still out on how it will end.

But this much is already clear: the old status quo is gone and cannot be reconstructed. The biggest loser in the post-September 11 world has been established order of a region previously dominated by Muslim and Arab strongmen who (while they might be seen as religious zealots by Western standards) sought to ground their rule on secular concepts like nationalism, who ran stable, tightly controlled police states and engaged in traditional power politics, and who successfully projected the internal tensions of their repressed societies outwards. The forces of popular change have come to the region, and for good or ill, they will not be denied. The harder question is what replaces the old order.

Digging To The Roots

Writ small, the September 11 attacks were a conspiracy by Al Qaeda – a terrorist group based in Afghanistan, Germany, and to a lesser extent Egypt and Pakistan, and consisting largely of Saudi Wahabbist Muslim fanatics – to attack civilian targets in the United States. Some observers argued from the beginning that we should focus on the conspirators and their organization, and forego broader ambitions.

The Bush Administration never treated the attacks simply as a criminal conspiracy to be isolated and punished, instead preferring to treat Al Qaeda as a symptom of a wider problem, and to seek out a solution that required digging deeper into the region’s pathologies in the effort to root out the entire problem once and for all. That approach recognized the reality that the organization of jihadist extremist groups was fungible; Al Qaeda was simply one manifestation of a larger movement. Al Qaeda’s own recent behavior illustrates this reality: holding a coordinated conference call with other extremist and terrorist groups that one intelligence professional described as akin to the “Legion of Doom”; current Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri calling publicly for more locally organized terror attacks like the Boston Marathon Bombing; radical imam Anwar al-Awlaki giving Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan the ideological encouragement to conduct a lone jihadist attack on an American military base.

The nearly unanimous decision to go to war in Afghanistan was made without real discussion of what our broader goals were, but the war in Iraq nearly a year and a half later forced the question into the open. Even with the publication of memoirs by most of the major players, we have never really had a full, candid accounting of the grand-strategic thinking of President Bush and his team between September 2001 and March 2003. Bush, in his own memoir, summarized his principles in four points:

First, make no distinction between the terrorists and the nations that harbor them – and hold both to account. Second, take the fight to the enemy overseas before they can attack us here at home again. Third, confront threats before they fully materialize. And fourth, advance liberty and hope as an alternative to the enemy’s ideology of repression and fear.

That fourth point was the source of the high-flying rhetoric about liberty and democracy and its connection to security in his Second Inaugural Address in 2005:

We have seen our vulnerability – and we have seen its deepest source. For as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny – prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder – violence will gather, and multiply in destructive power, and cross the most defended borders, and raise a mortal threat. There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment, and expose the pretensions of tyrants, and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom. We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world. …So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world. This is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary. Freedom, by its nature, must be chosen…

What was missing from all this was an explanation of how we planned to get to that end – precisely who the enemy was and is, and what our strategic philosophy would be in deciding when to use force, when to declare the mission accomplished, when to coexist with dictators who cooperated against the jihadists, and when to support insurrections that were aligned with them. Both Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld, in their memoirs, stressed the importance of stepping back and doing strategic thinking even in the bustle of war, but despite their respect for Bush, both memoirs have a little edge of regret that more such thinking wasn’t done from the top in a public way that would have given clearer direction to the missions in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The ultimate historic judgment of the Iraq War must be bound up with the eventual success or failure of the grand strategy it represented.

But just because the strategy wasn’t explicitly stated as such doesn’t mean a course wasn’t set. When the Bush Administration’s actions are considered in light of the thinking of conservative commentators and the justifications offered then and now, it seems clear that the Administration came, rather early, to the conclusion that the problem was the fundamental structure of the Greater Middle East (at a minimum its political structure). Because the solution to such a problem is not merely to launch missiles or drop bombs, but to change the governments of the region – a much more ambitious goal – it inherently required kick-starting the process by choosing a country to make an example. The obvious choice, for a variety of reasons, was Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, with which we already had continuous hostilities dating back a decade; the U.S. Congress had already, in 1998, declared a change in Iraq’s regime to be official U.S. policy. Regardless of the specific arguments made for the invasion of Iraq at the time, the ultimate historic judgment of the Iraq War must be bound up with the eventual success or failure of the grand strategy it represented, just as the ultimate worth of the sacrifices made in Korea and Vietnam are now subsumed in the larger context of the success of the Cold War.

The Nail Beckons The Hammer

President Bush’s “freedom agenda” came to be identified with the neoconservatives, an anti-communist movement dating back to the 1960s, in large part because when the planes hit the towers, the prominent ‘neocon’ thinkers in and out of government were the ones most ready with an off-the-shelf explanation for how you deal with such a problem, and their template resembled what ended up being put in practice in Iraq and Afghanistan. An accurate history of neoconservatism is too broad a subject for this essay, but it was merely one of several strands of thought on the Right that came to similar conclusions about the Cold War by the time of the Reagan era: that the struggle with Soviet Communism was an ideological one, an important component of which was demonstrating to its captive peoples and those on the fence that our system was superior in delivering a good way of life; that they should be encouraged to undermine and ultimately reject their home governments; and that we would not abandon them no matter how long that struggle took. This broad-based view that the Cold War could be won by rooting out the origins of the conflict had won out over the narrower model of containment that focused on dealing with specific provocations as they arose.

The virtue of the neoconservative model was that it had been proven as part of a long-term ideological struggle that succeeded beyond our wildest dreams by the early 1990s; we had won the Cold War without fighting a full-scale war with the Soviets, ushering in a massive global expansion of democracy and trade. Even Putin’s Russia, troublesome as it is, looks more or less like a success story compared to the Brezhnev era – and it looked better in 2002 than it does today. But the parallels were not perfect or entirely encouraging: the Cold War had taken 45 years to win, it had involved a huge, costly military and economic strategy that could not easily be adapted to an adversary that consisted of a loose confederation of non-state-actors and states allied only by convenience, and – perhaps most alarmingly of all – a key ally in the Cold War was the religious faith of Catholic, Orthodox and Muslim subjects oppressed by the atheistic Soviet empire, whereas the battle against Islamism would require convincing millions of Muslims to re-evaluate political doctrines that many of them believed were taught by their faith.

Moreover, the history of the neoconservative model in and before the Cold War offers its own cautions. Ideological competition presupposes populations that have sufficient freedom of action to do something about their governments, or (in the case of Japan between 1850 and 1900) a government that itself sees the benefits of change. Churchill dedicated extensive resources to fomenting rebellion against the Nazis during World War II – he famously directed the Special Operations Executive to “set Europe ablaze” – but the resistance movements in places like Poland and Greece were brutally suppressed; as historian John Keegan concluded from a review of the SOE’s operations, most had little impact on the stability of the Nazi occupation. Only external Allied military force was able to crush Hitler. Only the Union Army, rather than slave rebellions, defeated the Confederacy. The French Revolutionaries were rarely able to subvert their monarchical adversaries and had to meet them on a conventional field of battle. Since the dawn of the West, the history of civilizational clashes is long on the use of military force to defend and expand Western Civilization and short on the peaceable conversion of its enemies. Even in the Cold War, the U.S. was compelled to take to the battlefield to protect the populations of South Korea and South Vietnam from conquest.

The Jacksonian impulse: avoid meddling in the world until provoked, then respond with as much brute force as necessary to convince everyone not to get us that angry again.

The neoconservative approach to post-9/11 strategy was not the only one on offer on the Right. On the one hand was the “realist” approach, redolent of containment, that counseled working with the existing regimes in the region to ally against the non-state-actors and bring the bad-actor states in line. The realist school on the Right, preaching power politics, is in this sense often allied with the school on the Left that preaches the maintenance of order by international institutions (an approach that has regained its footing with the passage of time, but which was plainly inadequate to the task of organizing a response in the aftermath of an event like September 11). On the other was the “Jacksonian” approach. Put bluntly, the Jacksonian impulse is to avoid meddling in the world until provoked, and then respond with as much brute force as necessary to convince everyone, innocent or guilty of the attacks, not to get us that angry again. Jacksonians were thus in favor of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, but not in favor of sticking around long-term to clean up the mess.

Bush’s foreign policy team was by no means ideologically monolithic (just as Reagan’s was not); Dick Cheney, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice all hailed more or less from the realpolitik school of thought that prevailed under George H.W. Bush (although many of Cheney’s old aides, back in government, were identified with neoconservatism), and if you ever described Don Rumsfeld as a “neo” anything, you deserve to have your pundit card revoked. But then, in many ways the decision to seek a more structural, long-term solution was as much a product of Bush’s personality and temperament as any ideology. Bush had come into office believing in decisiveness and the use of political capital for large goals and distasteful of half-measures and short-term “kick the can down the road” solutions, and when possible, he naturally gravitated towards bold strokes. Setting the United States the ambitious task of igniting a regional revolution in the Greater Middle East would put all of these impulses into action.

Two Blog Perspectives

To understand the logic of the neoconservative project, it is worth looking back at two essays written at the time from opposite ends of the political spectrum, one on a right-leaning blog, the other for a left-leaning magazine.

Probably the most influential blog essay of the War on Terror was the “Strategic Overview” written in July 2003 by Steven Den Beste. It is interesting and telling, looking back, how much of Den Beste’s analysis and that of others on the Right at the time rested more on Arab culture than Islam, although its logic extends to the wider region. Den Beste’s essential argument was that we were dealing with a body of people that was (1) stuck in a constellation of failed states and a failed culture, (2) deeply ashamed by that fact, and (3) lacking either the will to face that fact or a political outlet in which to do something about it, and therefore were (4) encouraged to vent their rage and frustrations at those outside the Muslim and Arab worlds. Den Beste’s prescription was to break down the political order of the Arab/Muslim world and replace it with something more responsive to popular needs, demands and aspirations. An ambitious project, but one in line with the longstanding conservative view that men can change governments more easily than governments can change men. As Den Beste explained:

The large solution is to reform the Arab/Muslim world. This is the path we have chosen. The true root cause of the war is their failure and their resentment and frustration and shame caused by that failure. They fail because they are crippled by political, cultural and religious chains which their extremists refuse to give up. The real causes of their failure is well described by Ralph Peters. Most of the Arab nations suffer from all seven of his critical handicaps, and the goal of reform is to correct all seven, as far as possible. If their governments can be reformed, and their people freed of the chains which bind them and cripple them, they will begin to achieve, and to become proud of their accomplishments. This will reduce and eventually eliminate their resentment. Their governments would then cease needing scapegoats. Their extremists would no longer have fertile ground for recruitment. This is a huge undertaking; it will require decades because it won’t really be complete until there’s a generational turnover. But ultimately it is the only way to really eliminate the danger to us without using the “foot-and-mouth” solution (which is to say, nuclear genocide). The primary purpose of reform is to liberate individual Arabs. This is a humanist reform, but it isn’t a Christian reform. There will be no attempt to eradicate Islam as a religion. Rather, Islamism as a political movement, and as a body of law, and as a form of government must be eliminated, leaving Islam as a religion largely untouched except to the extent that it will be forced to be tolerant. The conceptual model for this is what we did in Japan after WWII, where only those cultural elements which were dangerous to us were eliminated, leaving behind a nation which was less aggressive, but still Japanese. No attempt was made to make Japan a clone of the US, and no such attempt will be made with the Arabs.

In Den Beste’s view, it was essential that “we had to conquer one of the big antagonistic Arab nations and take control of it” for the following purposes:

To place us in a physical and logistical position to be able to apply substantial pressure on the rest of the major governments of the region. To force them to stop protecting and supporting terrorist groups To force them to begin implementing political and social reforms To convince the governments and other leaders of the region that it was no longer fashionable to blame us for their failure, so that they would stop using us as scapegoats. To make clear to everyone in the world that reform is coming, whether they like it or not, and that the old policy of stability-for-the-sake-of-stability is dead. To make clear to local leaders that they may only choose between reforming voluntarily or having reform forced on them. To make a significant long term change in the psychology of the “Arab Street” To prove to the “Arab Street” that we were willing to fight, and that our reputation for cowardice was undeserved. To prove that we are extraordinarily dangerous when we do fight, and that it is extremely unwise to provoke us. To defeat the spirit of the “Arab Street”. To force them to face their own failure, so that they would become willing to consider the idea that reform could lead them to success. No one can solve a problem until they acknowledge that they have a problem, and until now the “Arab Street” has been hiding from theirs, in part aided by government propaganda eager to blame others elsewhere (especially the Jews). To “nation build”. After making the “Arab Street” truly face its own failure, to show the “Arab Street” a better way by creating a secularized, liberated, cosmopolitan society in a core Arab nation. To create a place where Arabs were free, safe, unafraid, happy and successful. To show that this could be done without dictators or monarchs. (I’ve been referring to this as being the pilot project for “Arab Civilization 2.0”.) …Neither Afghanistan nor Iran would serve the political goals. The conquered nation had to be one generally thought of as being Arab. The human and cultural material we needed for reform did not exist in Afghanistan. The “Arab Street” would not have been impressed by successful reform in Afghanistan or in Persian Iran.

In addition to Iraq’s strategic location and the various casi belli already in existence (also beyond the scope of this essay, but worth revisiting at another time with the distance of a decade), he also noted the important symbolic reasons why Iraq was well-suited to this project:

Saddam had become a hero to the “Arab Street”. He was thought of as a strong Arab leader who was standing up to the West. Though Iraq’s military had been decisively defeated in 1991, Saddam survived politically and this actually enhanced his reputation. He hadn’t won against us, but at least he’d tried, which was better than anyone else seemed to be doing. The “Arab Street” was proud of him for making the attempt. (This involved a lot of revisionism, such as ignoring Saddam’s earlier invasion of Kuwait, or the participation of large Arab military forces in the coalition army which fought against Iraq.) Iraq’s military had the reputation of being the largest, best armed and most dangerous of any in the region. If it could be decisively crushed it would be psychologically devastating. Baghdad historically was one of the great capitals of classic Arab civilization. Having it fall to outsiders would be symbolically important.

I would add that Iraq’s religious and ethnic diversity (the very thing that caused Joe Biden to argue for it being partitioned into three separate states) also presented both a challenge and an opportunity. A challenge, because of the sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shia that would break into something resembling a full-blown civil war in 2006, but also an opportunity, because Iraq could not be unified along monosectarian lines; it needed, and continues to need, some tolerance of pluralism within Islam to function as a single state, some mechanism for enabling tolerance and co-existence.

From the opposite end of the political spectrum, Josh Marshall, writing in April 2003, concluded essentially the same thing about the Bush Administration’s strategy, a strategy he found deeply troubling. He described his nightmare for the aftermath of toppling Saddam:

The United Nations and NATO are in disarray, so America is pretty much on its own. Hemmed in by budget deficits at home and limited financial assistance from allies, the Bush administration is talking again about tapping Iraq’s oil reserves to offset some of the costs of the American presence–talk that is further inflaming the region. Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence has discovered fresh evidence that, prior to the war, Saddam moved quantities of biological and chemical weapons to Syria. When Syria denies having such weapons, the administration starts massing troops on the Syrian border. But as they begin to move, there is an explosion: Hezbollah terrorists from southern Lebanon blow themselves up in a Baghdad restaurant, killing dozens of Western aid workers and journalists. Knowing that Hezbollah has cells in America, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge puts the nation back on Orange Alert. FBI agents start sweeping through mosques, with a new round of arrests of Saudis, Pakistanis, Palestinians, and Yemenis. To most Americans, this would sound like a frightening state of affairs, the kind that would lead them to wonder how and why we had got ourselves into this mess in the first place. But to the Bush administration hawks who are guiding American foreign policy, this isn’t the nightmare scenario. It’s everything going as anticipated.

Marshall concluded that, in the view of hawks within the Administration,

[I]nvasion of Iraq was not merely, or even primarily, about getting rid of Saddam Hussein. Nor was it really about weapons of mass destruction, though their elimination was an important benefit. Rather, the administration sees the invasion as only the first move in a wider effort to reorder the power structure of the entire Middle East…. [T]he administration is trying to roll the table–to use U.S. military force, or the threat of it, to reform or topple virtually every regime in the region, from foes like Syria to friends like Egypt, on the theory that it is the undemocratic nature of these regimes that ultimately breeds terrorism. So events that may seem negative–Hezbollah for the first time targeting American civilians; U.S. soldiers preparing for war with Syria–while unfortunate in themselves, are actually part of the hawks’ broader agenda.

Eight years later, events have long since taken on a life of their own, and while they have followed neither the precise outline of Den Beste’s positive or Marshall’s negative view, the essential trajectory has been the one projected: disruption of the long-ossified status quo and the ushering in of a revolutionary era that has replaced one longstanding tryanny after another with something different and (in the short run) more responsive to popular movements.

Set The Greater Middle East Ablaze

The Bush Administration was fond of touting the milestones of democracy and freedom (the two things are not the same), and in the early years they came in waves. At the same time, the forces of chaos threatened to overwhelm the progress. But as the years have passed, chaos has more often engulfed the enemies of democracy than its friends. Step back and consider the timeline of major events – not every battle or controversy, but the large-scale shifts between democracy, tyranny and extremism:

Along the way, especially in 2011, we’ve seen more modest protests and reforms or crackdowns in places like Morocco, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

Compare all of that to the face of the region in September 2001 – dominated by a few theocratic regimes (Iran and Taliban Afghanistan), a handful of Gulf monarchies, and a long row of strongmen – and you can see how far the project of remaking the face of the region has progressed. By no means is the news all good, but it’s all news compared to the statis that characterized the internal politics of most of the region before 9/11.

The Iraq War dominated U.S. political discussion for the greater part of five and a half years from mid-2002 to late 2007, and Americans have a tendency to focus on how the war affected our politics and foreign opinion of us. But it also gripped the attention of the Greater Middle East, dominating al Jazeera’s regional programming. For would-be democratic reformers, the scenes of voters lining up at the polls and even of squabbling parliamentarians in Iraq and Afghanistan presented an inevitable contrast to their own regimes. And, for that matter, for would-be Islamist revolutionaries, Iraq not only provided a place to prove themselves in battle, but also showed them how to run an insurgency in their own backyards. If U.S. intervention in the region wounded the pride of Arabs and Muslims, it also awakened them to the fact that maybe they could do it themselves – which was the idea of the neocon theory all along, that the process, once started, could develop a momentum of its own without requiring ceaseless American war. We would go to war in Iraq so we wouldn’t have to go to war everywhere else. The Bush Administration’s aggressive pressure also contributed to the dictators’ walkbacks – Qaddafi abandoning his WMD program, Assad leaving Lebanon. Where Saddam had shown a face of defiance, the Arab peoples now saw that even a bloodied, quagmired U.S. could bring the region’s strongmen to heel.

Iraq alone wasn’t the sole cause of the turning; al Jazeera, which had arrived in 1996 and really took off after 9/11, itself had a role in changing the way the region’s people saw their societies. As Rany Jazayerli put it:

Al Jazeera was, from its first day on the air, something the Arab world had never seen before: a television channel in Arabic, available to almost everyone in the Arab world, that provided a frank and reasonably unbiased source of news. It provided the unvarnished truth, and that made it extremely dangerous. If there was corruption going on in Jordan, it was reported. If there was a government crackdown in Egypt, it was reported. If a Saudi dissident living in exile in England had some scandalous information about the Saudi royal family, it was reported. All you need to know about Al Jazeera is that its greatest critics are the Arab governments, who have applied all kinds of pressure on Qatar – where Al Jazeera is based – to tone down the rhetoric… For the last 15 years, then, the Arab world has had the access that was denied them for so long. They’ve seen the truth about how oppressive and hypocritical their own governments are, and they’ve seen the truth about how messy and imperfect and yet ultimately how ennobling and empowering Western democracies are…And having already opened the barn door to letting the masses own satellite dishes, the governments of the region were mostly helpless to do anything about it.

Satellite TV would not be the only technological advance to grease the skids; the internet and social networks like Facebook and Twitter were also altering the playing field. But tools of communications can be a two-way street for propaganda and surveillance, as well; what makes them work is when they have something to talk about.

Flypaper

While the tide of Arab and Muslim revolution was surging in the Greater Middle East, it was waning in the West. Directly provoking the “Arab street” raised concerns about retaliation by the extremists, but the opposite has been true since the region really began boiling in 2005. We’ve seen three really large-scale terror attacks – the kind that require coordination and planning – far from the Greater Middle East since 9/11: the October 2002 Bali bombing, the March 2004 train bombings in Madrid, and the July 2005 bus and train bombings in London. India, still locked in a front-line struggle with Pakistani extremists, has not been so fortunate, being hit by terror attacks in Mumbai in November 2008 (the work of Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistani Muslim terror group) and again in July 2011. The same is true of Chechen terror attacks in Moscow in 2002 and 2010. (And, of course, Islamists within Europe have been busy with their own forms of homegrown mischief.) The decline in large-scale terror operations is partly due to good fortune, good law enforcement and domestic surveillance; certainly there have been a number of attempted terror attacks against the U.S. that got pretty far, such as the December 2001 “shoe bomber,” the December 2009 “underwear bomber” and a May 2010 truck bomb in Times Square. And smaller independent attacks, some of them with major death tolls, have continued: the July 2002 LAX shooter, the Fall 2002 Beltway snipers, the November 2009 Fort Hood shooter, the April 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing. But any accounting of major terrorist attacks since the invasion of Iraq shows a distinct shift towards attacks within the region itself.

This, too, was – as Marshall acknowledged at the time – an inherent, if usually unstated, assumption of the neocon grand strategy. People who are busy killing each other won’t have time to kill anyone else. A region that is pulling itself apart will not be able to project force outward. A region engaged in a mad scramble for power internally will dedicate its arms, its money and its excitable underemployed young men to winning that struggle rather than staging complex covert operations in another hemisphere.

Sowing dissension among one’s enemies has a long history; perhaps the most successful example was Imperial Germany’s success in taking Russia out of World War I by shipping Lenin into Russia in the spring of 1917. In this case, it’s a logical extension of the “flypaper theory” of the Iraq War. The idea that the region’s Islamic extremists should be enticed into Iraq to fight U.S. troops was sometimes referred to as a “flypaper” strategy – that they’d be drawn in and trapped where we wanted them, and thus that a bloody insurgency was actually good news. Flypaper may sound like a callous attitude towards the safety of American troops, but the thinking is actually the ancient motivation of men at war: confront and kill the enemy on the battlefield so he cannot disturb your homeland. It is perhaps a more cynical approach to the security of the local population – but then, it’s not unreasonable to want the problems of Iraq and other nations in the region to be played out on their soil rather than ours.

That was never the original war plan, of course; the insurgency may not have been adequately planned for by the Bush team, but it did not result from any provocation by the United States – it was wholly the independent decision of those who rejected a democratic political process in which the Iraqi people would be sovereign. Nevertheless, it was implicit in the broader idea of creating a contest for supremacy in the heart of the region.

And in that regard, even though American troops have left Iraq and are nearing their departure from Afghanistan, the flypaper theory writ large is alive and well. Civil war in Syria, Libya and Afghanistan, coup in Egypt, revolution in Tunisia…these are all conflicts that entice the jihadists to test their mettle and influence closer to home rather than travel to the West, and give them enemies other than the U.S., Europe and Israel against whom to vent their frustrations. In that regard, the current landscape may represent the fruits of the neocon project, but it’s also in line with old-fashioned cynical realpolitik (division to my enemies!) as well as embodying the kind of Jacksonian attitude towards one’s enemies that Harry Truman voiced in 1941 when he expressed the view that “If we see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany, and that way let them kill as many as possible, although I don’t want to see Hitler victorious under any circumstances.”

All of these attitudes are wholly foreign to President Obama and his national security team, but they have been neither willing nor able to put the genie back in the bottle, as the momentum and internal logic of the whirlwind have swept away one effort after another to re-impose order.

Where We Go From Here

The grand strategy of the neocons has long since passed out of their control, as few still have any influence with the Obama Administration or even in Congress. But the regional revolution they set ablaze is still with us, and they must trust that the path will be clear enough that even those skeptical of the project will make the proper choices. That is a dicey proposition, because few on either side of the political spectrum understand or accept the grand strategic proposition of turning the region’s angst inward to the battle for its own future.

On the Left, there remains no coherent grand strategy or even petit strategy.

On the Left, there remains no coherent grand strategy or even petit strategy. None of what is laid out above should excuse the Obama Administration from the choices it has made, its inability at times to face the new realities of the region for the challenges and opportunities they present, or its general preference (abroad as at home) for negotiating with elites rather than accepting the messy dynamism of popular sovereignty. In 2009, Obama spoke in Mubarak’s Egypt as if the region had been oppressed by President Bush rather than by its tyrants. Since then, as he has grudgingly let go of that illusion, he failed when he had the chance to encourage moderate forces to rebel against the old order in Iran and Syria, was flat-footed in Egypt and constantly behind the curve in Libya. He has seemed, at times, more interested in weapons than people, and completely oblivious to the efforts of Iran and its ally Russia to gain regional hegemony. He has managed neither a strong hand controlling events nor to wash his hands of responsibility for them. He has acted less like the world’s policeman than the world’s meter maid, handing out tickets to scofflaws.

On the Right, Jacksonian critics of the neocon project have tended to focus on Islam as an insoluble obstacle to reforming the region, a critique that I’ve written about before as presenting a collision between two longstanding conservative paradigms: the view of human nature as universal and the view of culture as overriding in its importance. But the facts on the ground have mooted that objection, as nobody has a practical solution if the problem is something inherent in the faith of a billion Muslims; we have no choice but to appeal over the heads of culture to the basic human desire for a better life on this earth. Despairing of a solution is no solution at all.

The way forward must focus on seeking to encourage and influence popular movements to proceed in a democratic, pro-freedom, pro-American direction rather than trying to put the Humpty Dumpty of strongmen – nominally respectful of Westphalian borders and disciplined by international sanctions regimes – back together again. The revolution has come; we should do what we can to see to it that the Islamists are not left alone to ride the wave, as they did in Iran in 1979, Afghanistan in 1996 and Egypt in 2011. And there is a role again for realpolitik as well; we should see the proxy battles between Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey as an opportunity to play balance-of-power politics in the region and prevent one side from gaining the upper hand.

After the fire of September 11, the neocon plan for the Greater Middle East brought not peace, but a sword. America doesn’t need to wield that sword in every conflict – this is a fight that affects us and one we can influence, but in the end it is not our fight to win because it is not our people who must make the final choice. But our ability to affect the course of events begins by recognizing that it’s still the neocons’ world, there is no way out of the fire but forward.

How To Explain What’s Happened In Ukraine To Your Friends,"Over the last week, Ukraine became a whole different country – politically and, one might say, mentally. The protests that have been going on in the nation’s capital, Kyiv, as well as over the country, for three months, resulted in the president being ousted from his post. However, this achievement came at a great cost: More than 80 people died during the last few days, and many are still fighting for their lives in hospitals. What caused this uprising and how the protesters managed to change the situation is explained shortly here.

What drove people to the streets?

The protests were triggered in late November of 2013 by the fact that the Ukrainian government refused to sign an agreement with the European Union (EU), which would facilitate trade between Ukraine and the European countries and make economic processes in Ukraine more transparent. This agreement had been anticipated by Ukrainian business and citizens alike as a chance to save struggling economy and as an opening to a possible membership in the European Union in the future. Being abruptly denied this opportunity, people gathered for a rally on Kyiv’s central Independence square or, as it is named in Ukrainian, the Maidan. And the protests that started off since have been dubbed “the Euromaidan.”

How did it all turn so violent?

Protests began as a peaceful demonstration demanding the resignation of the cabinet of ministers who failed to secure the European treaty, with middle class and students being the basic group of participants. The rallies, however, were not successful and looked likely to end without bringing any significant change. But then one night, riot police attacked the people at the square and cruelly beat them. Next morning, with videos of police brutality going viral, more people joined the protesters. After another attack of riot police mere days after that, one could find hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians from all over the country protesting in Kyiv. In other big cities, protests were happening, too, some of them resulting in the occupying of regional administrations.

What was the response of the government?

The pro-presidential political party that held the majority of seats in Ukrainian parliament reacted with passing of a number of laws criminalizing protest activity in mid-January 2014. Rigging the votes to get the laws adopted, the ruling party MPs made it illegal to go on a rally, to set up a protest tent, to occupy governmental buildings, and to publish articles discussing unlawful actions of public officials. From unprecedented limits on international NGOs to absurd prohibitions on wearing a helmet and having more than 5 cars in a row on streets (‘Yay, no more traffic jams!’, Ukrainians commented with sarcasm), the new rules, named “dictatorship laws,” were aimed to curb the protests.

Did it work?

Actually, people reacted with even bigger demonstrations, escalating in clashes with riot police. Police killed two protesters with guns. One of the protesters died of wounds, and another was found frozen to death in a forest after being kidnapped and tortured. Several protest leaders fled abroad. One of them, a leader of the protest-on-wheels group known as the Automaidan, was transported to get treatment in Europe after being abducted and tortured into saying he was a US spy. Many activists were arrested with possible prison terms ranging from 8 to 15 years. This pushed government and the opposition to negotiations. After the loss of lives and police atrocities, new faces in the same system was not enough. Protesters demanded resignation of the president and a change of Ukrainian constitution, which would take away central powers from the president.

Did the government meet the demands?

On the 18th of February, a parliamentary session was scheduled that was supposed to introduce the negotiated changes to the constitution. However, the pro-presidential party refused to address this issue during the session. After that, the protesters stormed police cordons and some of them were killed. Protesters were pushed back to the central square, where the clashes continued. During the next two days, as clashes ended and the protesters were trying to restore the barricades, more than 70 people were killed by snipers, the riot police and hired thugs that cooperated with the police. The victims did not hold firearms and some were without protective vests. And several wounded protesters are reported to have died in a fire that consumed a building near the Independence square.

The tragic losses and murder orders prompted some pro-presidential MPs to join the opposition in voting for cease-fire decree in the parliament. A new majority with more ruling party MPs adding to its numbers voted for the changes to the constitution that made the president less powerful. A treaty was signed between the president and the oppositional leadership that sought to ban riot police from using guns and to set up early elections at the end of this year. Protesters, however, did not agree with the president being in office for another 9 months. A leader of one of self-defense paramilitary groups made an ultimatum for the president: if he does not resign, protesters will storm his private residence. Over the next couple of hours, the president left Kyiv, and the parliament set the date of next presidential elections on the 25th of May 2014.

What is happening now?

Current whereabouts of the former president are unknown. Meanwhile, the parliament passed the laws allowing release of political prisoners, one of whom is the former prime minister. Local conflicts continue in several cities. In Sevastopol, a city in Crimea that has a special status due to hosting a Russian navy base, there has been a rally that refused to recognize the local city government and elected a Russian citizen as an alternative head of city administration. A video of Russian armored vehicles in Crimea has appeared. The Russian Federation has not yet recognized current Ukrainian government.

What has been the role of international community in Ukrainian events?

Different countries and international organizations, such as the United Nations and the European parliament, called for peace and justice in Ukraine. Diplomatic representatives of the USA and the EU were present in Ukraine during the protests warning against the use of force against the protesters. Poland and Lithuania let in wounded Ukrainian protesters to receive medical treatment. Russia’s role has influenced the protests, too. First, a $15 billion loan suggested by Russia was the alternative that the Ukrainian government chose instead of the agreement with the EU. Second, more billions were promised to Ukraine before the biggest crackdown of the protests that involved mass killings. However, Russia revoked this offer after the resignation of the president, citing the absence of a new government as a reason.

Who are the people that went out on the protests?

People from different geographical regions of Ukraine and social groups took part in the protests. Sociological survey held at the beginning of February showed that 88 percent of those who continuously took part in the Euromaidan, were men, and women comprised 12 percent. More than half of all of them belonged to the 30-54 years age group, and 44 percent represented middle class – professionals and private entrepreneurs.

America Needs A Healthy Dose Of Elitism,"There seems to be fairly universal agreement that our elites are a pretty sorry lot. Yet we all continue to refer to them as “elites.” This is a strangely prevalent misuse of terminology. After all, the word “elite,” like any other word, has a certain determinate meaning; it refers to a small class of persons possessing greater virtue, talent, or intelligence than other members of their respective peer category. An “elite” is simply someone who is better at doing the sorts of things his type of people do. The word has an indispensable moral connotation to it; someone who is “elite” is not just prominent, but deservedly prominent. When we refer to a Navy SEAL, for instance, as an “elite soldier,” we do not simply mean he is the soldier who gets sent on all the dangerous missions; we mean he is the soldier who gets sent on all the dangerous missions because he possesses greater training, fitness, and perhaps courage than the average soldier. So to attribute the label of “elites” to a class of persons known by everyone to be gravely deficient in virtue, talent, and intelligence simply makes no sense.

The same could be said about the term “meritocracy.” To possess merit is to possess a virtue or an excellence that is not common among one’s peers. Merit is a subject for praise. Again, the word has a clear moral connotation to it. A “meritocracy,” then, must simply be a form of social organization in which those who are most excellent, in whatever field or endeavor, typically rise to positions of power, in exclusion of those who are less so. But almost nobody believes that is the case with the organization of our society. The distressing fact about our society is how many fools and charlatans tend to rise to prominence in our cultural, economic, and political institutions. But to speak of a “meritocracy” comprised of fools and charlatans makes as much sense as to speak of a “plutocracy” comprised of paupers. Yet we do still refer to our society as a “meritocracy,” in the same way we continue to label the unimpressive kinds of people who rise to prominence in our society as “elites.” What is going on here?

I do not believe our habitual misuse of these terms to be a simple quirk of language, a mere shift in nomenclature occurring in recent years which points towards nothing of significance. I think these words are being used to tell a story – a story about the causes of the massive failure of civilizational leadership we are witnessing, and what can be done to redress it. That story is distinctively populist; the “elites” and the “meritocrats” (or even the “meritocratic elites,” as I have seen them called) are that small discrete clique who, by their presumption and myopia, have alienated themselves from the body of their countrymen, and have proceeded to rule with a disregard, and even hostility, for the opinions and welfare of a population they disdain. Their conceit and insular stupidity are the vices at the root of their gross shortcomings as leaders. The proper way to address this situation, then, is to appeal to the people at large, to assert their native virtue against the decadence of this arrogant coterie, and try to re-infuse into our institutions some of that egalitarian spirit which has been such a cherished value in our nation’s history. This is the tale I sense lurking in the background whenever I hear complaints of “elites” and “meritocracy.”

Our egalitarian instinct

There is no dearer story to the American people than a populist story. There is no tale we tell ourselves with such zest as the legend of the virtuous common man resisting the dominance of a corrupt and powerful few. There is no political instinct more basic to us than the egalitarian instinct. These inclinations have been instilled in us since our founding. It is hardly surprising then that they have surfaced at this difficult juncture in our nation’s history, or that we have reverted to our most familiar explanatory patterns to make sense of what is turning out to be a time of unique crisis for us as a people. This, I think, is the cause for the stories we keep telling ourselves of our decadents elites or unconscionable meritocrats, all pointing inexorably to our salvation by a populist movement that will return the common man to his rightful authority.

Unfortunately, those stories are wholly inapposite to the circumstances presently confronting us, and our inability to conceive of our situation outside of their contours inhibits us from apprehending both the true nature of our problems, and their authentic remedies. The hard truth for us to digest is that populism is no cure for this generation of failed leadership. Populism is what gave us these failed leaders in the first place.

There is no dearer story to the American people than a populist story. There is no tale we tell ourselves with such zest as the legend of the virtuous common man resisting the dominance of a corrupt and powerful few.

To appreciate why this is the case, we need to turn to one of the most insightful works of political philosophy written in the last century, Jose Ortega y Gasset’s The Revolt of the Masses. Recognizing that the distinctive political characteristic of modern liberal states was the increased share of influence wielded by the common man, Ortega attempted to delineate the intellectual and spiritual dynamic underlying this shift in power – what were it causes, and what were likely to be its effects on the character of the people, on their laws and on their culture. It is not a triumphal story he tells. According to Ortega, the “characteristic of the hour is that the commonplace mind, knowing itself to be commonplace, has the assurance to proclaim the rights of the commonplace and to impose them wherever it will.” The “mass men,” as Ortega calls them, are “those who demand nothing special of themselves, but for whom to live is to be every moment what they already are, without imposing on themselves any effort towards perfection.” In the past, such men never made any pretension to leadership, recognizing perfectly well that they lacked the necessary virtues and taste to occupy any such position.

Instead, society was led by “the excellent man, urged by interior necessity, to appeal from himself to some standard beyond himself, superior to himself, whose service he freely accepts…Life has no savor for him unless he makes it consist in service to something transcendental.” Such a man was the true noble, since “nobility is synonymous with a life of effort, ever set on excelling oneself, in passing beyond what one is to what one sets up as a duty and an obligation.” But now, after the “triumphs of a hyperdemocracy,” the mass man rules everywhere, and leaves traces of his self-satisfaction and general indifference to excellence on every single social institution. An implacable enemy to all standards, the mass man is nonetheless brazen in his confidence that he deserves to stand in the first ranks of his peers. A society comprised of such persons will necessarily be one incapable of upholding serious standards, for to do so means to prefer some and exclude others, and this process the mass man will not allow.

I doubt there are many modern Americans who can encounter an argument like this, with its explicit distinction between self-satisfied “mass men” and morally striving “excellent men,” and not feel at least a pang of discomfort (this is obviously why Ortega has never caught on in America, on either the left or the right). Our egalitarian instinct, as I noted, is rooted in the deepest part of our national character. But let me suggest that Ortega has placed his finger on the central intellectual and spiritual dynamic of our age, the tectonic cultural motion relentlessly grinding away below the surface of our political debates, directing and shaping them all.

Commonplace standards

We have, for several generations in America, “proclaimed the rights of the commonplace,” and imposed the commonplace standard upon all of our institutions, slowly – and sometimes not so slowly – eroding the standards of excellence which in past ages defined the missions of these institutions, in order to expand the scope of participation in their work. The people who rise to prominence in these institutions – our purported “elites” – wind up being the sort of people who can only measure up against such deracinated standards. They are the commonplace spirits who rise in a society defined by commonplace values. We ask less and less of Americans who wish to lay claim to leadership, and find that our leaders have less and less character and integrity with every passing year.

Most of us can recognize the extraordinary drop in what we might call our “civilizational standards” over the last fifty to sixty years, a steady decline in what we would consider excellence in the making of art, or in academic achievement, or in the qualifications for statesmanship . Far fewer of us discern the populist mentality behind this decline, the egalitarian fervor bubbling up in slogans like “everyone an artist” or “no child left behind” or “power to the people.” Far from being a “man (or woman) apart” from the general population, the modern “elite” is the person who is exalted when the “mass men’s” mediocre standards become a civilization’s highest standards, the kind of person whose pretensions to leadership can only impose upon the poor taste and uninformed judgment displayed by the greater portion of the general populace. Our alleged “meritocracy” does not work like the tide of a mighty river, raising a few ships to magnificent heights; it works like a great tide going out, leaving exposed a bunch of undistinguished rocks and debris.

The best place to look for an example of this leveling dynamic is in our universities. For one, the dynamic is unmistakable to anyone familiar with academia’s present state or with its history over the last several generations, and thus will serve as an excellent illustration of what Ortega is getting at. But equally important, the university has now become the chief source of legitimation for today’s “elites,” so that an understanding of the character of these institutions provides us with considerable insight into the character of the kind of person advanced by them.

Few conservatives will need convincing about the disastrous legacy of the student protests of the sixties. What is not commonly acknowledged, though, is that these protests were obviously part of a populist movement – indeed, the quintessential populist movement in our history. Mythology still hangs very thickly over this period. Many still imagine the protests as the revolt of high-minded idealists, ranged against the staid conformity and insularity of the traditional university, rather than a rampage carried out by a horde of unkempt, unlearned, unprincipled ignoramuses, intent to trample over every viable standard of scholastic integrity. Allan Bloom, who experienced their aggression first-hand, left us with some very blunt descriptions of the protestors’ thuggish inclinations in The Closing of the American Mind:

You don’t have to intimidate us,” said the famous professor of philosophy in April 1969, to ten thousand triumphant students supporting a group of black students who had just persuaded “us,” the faculty of Cornell University, to do their will by threatening the use of firearms as well as threatening the lives of individual professors.

The crucial point to gather about the protests is that they had nothing at all to do with concerns of scholarship, nor were they carried out by those with the slightest pretention to academic distinction. They were not about improving the universities at all, or about raising their standards. They were simply mobilizations for power on the part of a mob with no appreciation for what a university is supposed to represent. If the movement resembled anything at all, it was that scene in Henry VI, when Jack Cade and his riff-raff condemn the clerk to execution, for being a literate man.

What is striking is how closely the initial program of the protestors reflected Ortega’s account of the “mass man’s” character. Chanting “Hey Ho, Western Civ has Got to Go,” they abolished the canon, which had always represented the “standard beyond ourselves, superior to ourselves” by which young minds were challenged and nurtured. There is simply no such thing as academic standards in the absence of a canon. As Bloom notes, this abolition was “an exercise in egalitarian self-satisfaction that wiped out the elements of the university curriculum that did not flatter our peculiar passions or tastes of the moment.” In the place of the old canon were established the various departments of “Me Studies” – Women’s Studies, African-American Studies, Queer Studies, all the forms of institutionalized self-absorption fit to occupy those “for whom to live is to be every moment what they already are.” A “life of effort…in service to a standard beyond (oneself) became increasingly dissociated from a university education. As a primary consequence of the protests, says Bloom, “the university was incorporated much more firmly into the system of democratic public opinion,” which incorporation, of course, is the goal of any populist movement.

This first generation, the “founding fathers” as it were of the contemporary academy, imposed the habits of their commonplace mentality upon our universities with such ruthless efficiency that the stamp of their radical egalitarianism has not faded to this day. In the years and decades following their initial revolt, the leveling impulse they let loose came to shape more and more of academic life. The desire to bestow a college education on anyone and everyone became the dominant imperative of academic policy. Affirmative action and the dumbing down of college admissions tests like the SAT steadily eroded the standards applied to those who would gain entrance into college, while the accelerating momentum of grade inflation at the most “prestigious” of those colleges destroyed the standards formerly held up for graduation.

Crass utilitarianism

Alongside these ideological directives, market forces (take note, conservatives!) worked equally baneful ruin upon academic standards. A college education became transformed into a form of vocational training, and schools began discarding the ideals of liberal learning and replacing them with the crassest utilitarianism, evincing the same vulgar disdain for intellectual cultivation which prevailed throughout the majority of the public. Since a degree was now seen as a prerequisite for employment, greater numbers of young people sought enrollment in college, and the schools themselves, recognizing the profits to be gleaned from this expanded pool of applicants, did all they could to accommodate their matriculation – ie, dumbing down their curriculum even more.

A college education became transformed into a form of vocational training, and schools began discarding the ideals of liberal learning and replacing them with the crassest utilitarianism, evincing the same vulgar disdain for intellectual cultivation which prevailed throughout the majority of the public.

The upshot of all these forces stands before us in our contemporary universities – insular, directionless, superficial parodies of higher learning; institutions with zero relevance to the moral and intellectual development of their students; the kind of places where – to no one’s surprise any more – they study Beyonce or conduct live pornography in class. Because they still do function fairly well as centers of vocational training; because the departments of hard and applied sciences still fulfill their missions with tolerable regularity, the American public has entirely failed to notice that these institutions no longer even pretend to cultivate the wisdom and habits of reflection which alone can justify the existence of a university. I believe most Americans still conceive of Yale or Harvard as places where tweed-jacketed young savants stroll amid the arcades debating important questions, rather than as places where students rush out of their Harry Potter seminar in pajamas in order to make it on time to grab the free condoms at Sex Week. None of this is to say there are not still very many wonderful professors in our colleges teaching very many bright young people, in line with the highest standards of scholarship; it is just to say these people are mostly engulfed in institutions actively hostile to those standards. Some brilliant people still receive Phd’s, but there is no longer any reason to suppose someone with a Phd is an educated person, as once we could. Our colleges no longer educate; they credential.

At no point in the history of our country have our “prestigious” colleges operated according to such low standards, and yet at no point in our history have their professors and graduates conducted themselves towards the public with such arrogance and sense of entitlement. Our “elites” are the kind of students who can pull straight A’s taking courses like “Arguing with Judge Judy” (UC-Berkeley) and “Getting Dressed” (Princeton), aided by decades of grade inflation, and probably paying to have half of their papers written for them. They are the professors who marched in the protests in their youth, who now teach courses like “GaGa for Gaga” (UVa) and “Cyberfeminism” (Cornell) and have never once cracked a page of Aristotle or Milton. They are the extremely unimpressive people – faculty and student body alike – who make the modern university the joke it is. Bloom saw the advent of such people rising out of the wastage of the student protests: “The elite should really be elite, but these elitists were given the distinction they craved without having earned it. The university provided a kind of affirmative-action elitism.” The point is that our “elites” are validated in that status by institutions which do absolutely nothing to leave them meriting that status. And this, because for generations, those institutions have seen their standards all but obliterated by a variety of egalitarian pressures. The modern “elite” is just the mass man carrying around a meaningless sheep-skin and tassel.

The history and present condition of the contemporary university, then, cannot be understood apart from the dynamic Ortega brings to light: the dissolution of standards by an abundance of aggressive leveling influences, paving the way for the rise of a class of leadership distinguished by their complacency and lack of qualifications. I have focused, for reasons I’ve stated, on the university, but one could easily spot this dynamic at work in the ascension of our “elites” in other walks of life. Conservatives like to complain, for instance about “Hollywood elites” – the actresses and comedians and studio executives who wield such enormous influence over our culture – but it is impossible to imagine them possessing that influence absent what is quite frankly the atrocious taste of huge swathes of the American public, who dutifully consume the mounds of garbage those arrogant people produce. The media, on the left and the right, who do so much to distort the news they are supposed to report, are likewise inconceivable apart from the frivolous and uncritical mentality prevalent throughout the audiences they reach. Or what about the ongoing debt crisis, which causes such consternation – and rightly so – among those on the right? Why is this problem so intractable, except that the electorate – the vaunted “common man” – cannot face the reality of our desperate fiscal state, and refuses to vote in the kind of responsible leadership necessary to address the issue? Much more would need to be said about all of these examples, but I think the basic insight of Ortega, and its relevance to our crisis of leadership, is plain to see by now.

“Those who level never equalize,” wrote Edmund Burke, adding, “In all societies, consisting of various descriptions of citizens, some description must be uppermost. The levelers, therefore, only change and pervert the natural order of things.” The levelers who have been at work in America over the last several generations have not brought an end to society’s need for a ruling class; to the contrary, they have abetted the rise of the of most presumptuous, narrow, domineering ruling class in the history of our country. But it is a ruling class whose character is marked by everything that is most vulgar and stupid in our culture, a plebian elite, whose rise to power represents that “perversion of the natural order of things” Burke warned about.

What America needs, then, is a healthy dose of elitism – not the phony elitism which brings us “The Vagina Monologues” and the Common Core and Barack Obama, but a genuine elitism, a cultural-wide striving after greatness like the kind that once brought us Moby Dick, and John Witherspoon, and George Washington. We need a generation of magnanimous young people, “urged by interior necessity to appeal…to some standard beyond (themselves),” intent to live lives “in service to something transcendental.” And we need a whole system of institutions, serving as the basis of a rival culture, to harness, direct, and preserve their intellectual and spiritual aspirations – schools grounded in classical curricula and methodology; arts created by artists weaned on the masterpieces; local political organization committed to prudent, honest governance; churches committed to properly teaching their flocks about the inestimable spiritual riches stored up in their traditions. We need a return to standards of excellence, and the only sort of efforts worth our while now are the ones aiming at such a renewal.

20 Ways Media Completely Misread Congress’ Weak-Sauce Benghazi Report,"On September 11, 2012, Islamist militants attacked U.S. complexes in Benghazi, Libya. Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed, the first U.S. Ambassador killed in the line of duty since 1979. Three other men were killed and 10 were injured.

The media immediately turned it into a political story, focusing more anger on Mitt Romney’s comments about the administration’s blaming of a YouTube video critical of Islam than determining the facts of the attack itself. Many in the media thought it fine that President Obama jetted off to a high-dollar fundraiser before the bodies cooled. When various high-level government officials blamed either a YouTube video critical of Islam — or our laws protecting free speech, it didn’t generate much controversy among big media.

The media tended to parrot White House talking points about the attack even years later. So even though everyone with knowledge of the scene in Benghazi knew otherwise, the New York Times was claiming until Friday — just this past Friday — that al Qaeda had nothing to do with the attack on Benghazi.

Really. Less than one year ago, the New York Times ran one of its massive “projects” — Pulitzer Prize attempts, basically — around the following claim:

Months of investigation by The New York Times, centered on extensive interviews with Libyans in Benghazi who had direct knowledge of the attack there and its context, turned up no evidence that Al Qaeda or other international terrorist groups had any role in the assault. The attack was led, instead, by fighters who had benefited directly from NATO’s extensive air power and logistics support during the uprising against Colonel Qaddafi. And contrary to claims by some members of Congress, it was fueled in large part by anger at an American-made video denigrating Islam.

If there’s something true in that pile of horse manure, you’ll have to point it out. Within days this was thoroughly debunked by those in the know (albeit highlighted by media outlets such as CNN). But just this past Friday afternoon, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released “the definitive House statement on the Intelligence Community’s activities before, during and after the tragic events that caused the deaths of four brave Americans” in Benghazi. We’ll look through all the flaws with this report (.pdf) here soon, but first we need to talk about the media reaction to same.

Things seemed to kind of get going with this tweet at 5:47 PM:

The report and its appendices are hundreds of pages long. And I’d argue that the executive summary of the report is not well supported by the contents.

Do you sense a pattern here? The groupthinkers got to the keyboards and pounded out surprisingly similar headlines, whether they were from far-left partisan groups or just the typically left-leaning (in some cases left-careening) big media:

CNN: Republican-led report debunks Benghazi theories and accusations

Slate: GOP-Controlled Intelligence Committee Debunks Benghazi Conspiracies

Talking Points Memo: GOP Intel Report Debunks Its Own Party’s Nutty Benghazi Theories

Atlanta Journal-Constitution: GOP-led report obliterates Fox News’ version of Benghazi

I could go on and on and on and on and on. In fact, I only found one noteworthy story that didn’t adopt the groupthink.

And within a few hours, the story about this report became about Fox News’ coverage of same. See these tweets with links to stories:

Mediaite (@Mediaite) November 22, 2014

We’re going on six years of many major media outlets completely failing to inform their viewers and readers about numerous Obama administration scandals, but this is what the “media reporters” choose to focus on? Really? In just this past week alone, for instance, we had updates to the IRS scandal relating to targeting of conservative groups (some 30,000 irretrievably lost emails were found), updates to the many scandals surrounding Obamacare’s drafting (note which outlets are carrying substantive updates about Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber) and implementation (thank God for Peter Suderman or we might not have learned about the latest Obamacare surprise coming out in the latest Friday night document dump), news a huge Obama bundler and major gay rights activist being arrested for child rape, reports of emails revealing Department of Justice attempts to silence one of the rare tenacious reporters covering the administration, a teensie weensie little Constitutional problemo about President Obama usurping the legislative process, signing a secret order to extend the war in Afghanistan, and probably a half dozen other things I’m missing.

If there’s a story about media downplaying Obama administration scandal news, and boy is there, this Fox News not giving enough coverage to a weak-sauce Benghazi report sure as hell ain’t it. Let’s look at what else the media missed.

1. Many journalists obviously didn’t read the report.

Much less read it critically.

One might assume this both because of the speed with which they joined the groupthink and their complete and uncritical acceptance of what they heard the report said. I grant that they may have read the 2-page executive summary.

2. They forgot the well-known problems with Congressional oversight

The relationship between intelligence agencies and the members of Congress who are supposed to oversee them could not be more damaged. I’m not even talking about stuff like how the CIA admitted to spying on members of the Senate committee that is supposed to oversee the agency.

It’s actually the good relationships that are even worse. (And I’m not even talking about how sometimes members are married to people who work in the private sector on related topics.) One of the most common criticisms levied against the intelligence oversight committees is that they’re far too approving and accepting of what the intelligence community wants. I’ve covered the federal government for more than 10 years, so I’m familiar with bureaucratic jargon. Still, I was stunned by the level of obfuscating jargon I found in the report, and what a reasonable person might assume that meant:

@MZHemingway the idea that a Republican investigation into darkest CIA ops would yield shining, shocking truths is…implausible



JAMES ❄ POULOS (@jamespoulos) November 22, 2014

Exactly. This is, like, reporting 101. How did so many big-shot reporters miss just that initial skepticism we should all share when reporting on — especially — politicians?

3. “Mistakes were made.”

On May 1, 1973, Nixon’s Press Secretary Ron Ziegler famously said, “I would apologize to the Post, and I would apologize to Mr. Woodward and Mr. Bernstein… We would all have to say that mistakes were made in terms of comments.” Ziegler wasn’t the first to use the line “mistakes were made” but he made it so famous that it was included in obituaries when he died. The phrase is a cliched way to avoid responsibility for wrong-doing and to try to diminish the seriousness of allegations.

Guess what page “mistakes were made” appears in the explosive Benghazi report that supposedly exonerates everybody in the intelligence community that was within 3,000 miles of the deadly attack? Did you guess page one of the executive summary? Congratulations. You win.

4. Actual vs. caricatured complaints about Obama’s handling of Benghazi

Now, if you were to ask people who aren’t reflexively defensive of President Obama (as the media tend to be) what their main concerns with Benghazi were two years ago, they’d probably say something along the lines of:

That we allowed an ambassador to be assassinated by Islamist militants in Libya.

That we didn’t quite seem as concerned as we should have been, as evidenced by our commander-in-chief heading off to a Vegas fundraiser hours after it happened and a general patience about seeking justice.

That we claimed that an attack on September 11 probably actually had something to do with a silly video and nothing to do with Al Qaeda.

probably actually had something to do with a silly video and nothing to do with Al Qaeda. The we officially told the world that “since our founding, the United States has been a nation that respects all faiths. We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others,” as President Obama said.

That our Secretary of State said of a video made by an American that “We absolutely reject its content and message.”



That these statements were dangerously untrue. In America, you’re actually totally allowed to disparage any religion you want. (I myself have fun targeting Methodists.) (Sidenote, check out how our Secretary of State gave a rhetorical beatdown to the Nazis when they complained about a mock trial of Hitler held in Madison Square Gardens in 1934.)

That our media seemed more obsessed with covering for Obama than investigating what the heck happened that night.

Now, the report whitewashes, excuses or glosses over almost all of this and fails completely to get at any of the deeper and troubling questions about what’s wrong with our intel community. It only “debunks” claims if you think that bureaucratic ass-covering and rather strained justifications of what I would hope all Americans would agree was a clear intelligence failure count as “debunking.”

5. Let’s talk about the Feb. 17th Brigade

Here’s a case in point.

The report says that at “appropriately” (I assume they meant “approximately”) 9:40 PM, dozens of militants approached the compound and that “as the men approached, three Libyan security officers in a car outside the [Temporary Mission Facility] drove away without warning U.S. personnel.” Further:

“The State Department had contracted with the February 17th Brigade and the Blue Mountain Group to provide local security for the TMF facility. All available information indicates that the February 17th Brigade guards were inside the walls of the compound and did not detect or report information about the attackers before the attackers breached the gate.”

Now, the report doesn’t mention the Feb. 17th Brigade too much again (we hear the telling — for what it suggests isn’t mentioned — reference to some “helpful” members of the group a few pages later). And maybe it’s telling because the Feb. 17th Brigade — our security contractors — are now allied with Ansar al Sharia — the perpetrators of the attack — and the two groups have taken over large parts of Benghazi. Now, I know that you have to contract with bad guys when you’re doing shady but important work. But don’t you think that maybe a definitive report about how absolutely nothing went wrong in Benghazi that could have been prevented should include that we contracted out our compound security to al Qaeda affiliates there? I mean, maybe the group used to be totes awesome and only went bad after we left. Or, given how things went down, maybe they totally sold us out. But to not even discuss this issue strikes me as odd in the extreme.

Or what about this guy:

Wissam Bin Hamid’s name has surfaced time and again in the investigation into the Benghazi attack. He admittedly met with American officials in Benghazi just days before the assault to discuss security, and he reportedly refused to provide assistance once the attack was underway. The post-revolution Libyan government also worked with Bin Hamid and his Libya Shield militia, which was supposedly one of the strongest “security” forces inside Benghazi.

You will never ever ever guess where this guy is now. OK, if you guessed that a few weeks ago Ansar al Sharia released a 42-minute video featuring him, you win. However, you won’t find any mention of him in this report.

Another weird paragraph says that a Tripoli security team arranged with someone for some particular equipment to be there when they landed in Benghazi. But when they got there, the equipment was nowhere to be found and their interlocutor’s cell phone was turned off. Interesting.

Should these angles have been discussed in the “definitive” report on how everything is awesome? I kind of think so, don’t you?

6. Remember that New York Times report that was only updated on Friday?

I just want to point out that the first line of the report that supposedly makes Republicans look bad places blame for the attack on “armed militias with ties to terrorist organizations, including al-Qa’ida.” And while, yes, the Times did finally get around to updating their report to note that these militias have ties to al Qa’ida, they hedged as much as you could imagine and buried it on page 8. Why are we making fun of FOX, again?

7. Our response was slow.

Now, you can read the report as a big intel agency CYA or you can read it as just a really charitable defense of the decision making that night. But no matter how you read it, it’s striking how slow we were in responding to this crisis.

You know that line about how when seconds count, the police are minutes away? Well, here we had a situation where seconds counted but the nearest security team was 42 minutes away, because of various delays. And the Tripoli team didn’t even start for the air field in Tripoli until after that. And both cited traffic concerns.

Once the Tripoli team finally got to Benghazi, the equipment they arranged for wasn’t there and the group supposed to take them to the hospital (where they believed the ambassador to be) decided they didn’t want to go. The explosive report simply says, “it was not clear why those individuals did not want to travel to the hospital.”

Oh, and the “confusion at the airport lasted for about three and a half hours.” Oh. OK. And then the reason why they were able to leave was because the Libyan Shield brought vehicles to them. But the committee “uncovered no evidence” that the militia tipped off the attackers to the Tripoli Team’s presence. The attack of lethal and deadly accurate mortar fire just happened to take place 11 minutes after they finally arrived at their destination. After some difficulties, they were able to convince Libyan Shield drivers to help them evacuate.

8. Intelligence failures explained away.

A good example of how the report treads softly happens in Section 2, where we’re told that while intelligence agencies knew the threats in Libya were rising, they didn’t have any knowledge of a specific attack.

“There is no evidence of an intelligence failure,” the report says. But by that it simply means that nobody had given the CIA blueprints for an attack. I mean, we do know that Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri “had called for Americans to be targeted in Libya the day before the diplomatic mission was attacked, leading to speculation that al Qaeda’s leadership in Pakistan had some sort of role or influence in the attack.” This would seem to indicate that maybe our confidence al Qaeda had nothing to do with the attack was as misguided as our belief that there was no intel failure in predicting an attack on Americans there.

“One of the first questions [the committee] pursued is whether the U.S. government had or should have had intelligence that could have prevented or disrupted the attacks, and thus whether there was an intelligence failure.” This is idiotic. I mean, you might explain why we had an intel failure but there’s no question that we failed. By definition we failed. We have a dead ambassador, three other dead Americans and 10 severely wounded. All because of a surprise attack we were unprepared for. That’s a failure of the intelligence community.

But instead the report says the Committee “found no evidence of an intelligence failure, and an internal CIA analytic review provided to the Committee on January 4, 2013, corroborates the Committee’s findings.”

Wait, the CIA said the CIA didn’t fail? That’s not surprising at all. I mean, this may be what passes for intelligence committee oversight, but I think most Americans want to know why we weren’t more on top of the Al Qaeda leader’s warning or why we didn’t connect that to one of Al Qaeda’s favorite targets (diplomatic compounds) or why we forgot the significance of September 11. Or just why we weren’t better informed of who was friend and who was foe, who was working with whom and why and what we could do to prevent more dead Americans.

Examples of intel failures are brushed away as uncorroborated. To wit, the CIA apparently reported that “a former Transitional National Council security official in Benghazi said he received, very shortly before the attack, information of a possible imminent attack against the TMF and tried to notify the Libyan Intelligence Service the day of the attacks. However he was unable to make contact and relay the information.” Sounds like a failure. But the committee says it wasn’t corroborated by anyone. OK?

9. Try cutting through the jargon here.

Finding #2 says that the “CIA provided sufficient security personnel, resources, and equipment to defend against the known terrorist threat and to enable CIA operations in Benghazi. There is no evidence that the CIA turned down requests for additional security resources at the Annex.”

Well, we’ve already excused failures by saying that the CIA couldn’t have known of the threat. So the first line that they had appropriate resources for “known” threats is basically meaningless. And we already knew two years ago that Ambassador Stevens requested a beefing up of security.

Now, let’s say the request was never officially turned down but just never fulfilled, which is, in fact, extremely plausible. The end result is a lack of requested security but you could report that “There is no evidence that the CIA turned down requests for additional security.” See how bureaucratic jargon works? It’s like magic. (And if you’re immediately wondering how that first line about “known threats” doesn’t work in conjunction with the knowledge that Stevens requested more security, you are smarter than a typical reporter.)

Does a finding like that really “debunk” the supposed conspiracy theory that there wasn’t enough security? I don’t see how it does. Further, Finding #2 is something of a slap in the face of Ambassador Stevens’ memos to his superiors. These aren’t mentioned in the section.

Should I mention that this section about how everything was hunky dory mentions that “perhaps all of the [Diplomatic Security] agents were unarmed and one of them was not wearing shoes”? Or should I instead Groupthink my way into poking fun at conservatives and telling them to be ashamed?

10. Scathing indictment of how little our Feds understand about al Qaeda

As recently as Friday, the State Department was being mocked for its refusal to acknowledge that Ansar al Sharia is tied to Al Qaeda.

Finding #5 is fairly explicit about how a ragtag group of Al Qaeda affiliates launched the attack.

What’s going on with the State Department’s downplaying of Al Qaeda links? Well, I think it has a lot to do with Obama campaign pledges regarding Al Qaeda. You’d have to be a Major League Gruber to claim that the global Islamist militant movement is waning. But President Obama did make a lot of claims about Al Qaeda being “on its heels” or “on the run” or “decimated” and so on. To wit:

“Now, four years ago, I made a few commitments to you. I told you I’d end the war in Iraq, and I did. I said I’d end the war in Afghanistan, and we are,” said Obama. “I said we’d refocus on the people who actually attacked us on 9/11 — and today, al Qaeda is on its heels and Osama bin Laden is no more.”

To make this campaign rhetoric stick, our executive branch has claimed that it meant “core” al Qaeda as opposed to all the groups al Qaeda oversees and works with. Because if we know anything about al Qaeda it’s not that it’s a powerful decentralized operation with a global network. Oh wait, that’s precisely what we do know.

So Finding #5 says “A mixed group, including members of al-Qa’ida in the lands of the Islamic Meghreb (AQIM), al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI), the Muhammad Jamal Network (MJN), Ansar al-Sharia (AAS), and Abu Abaydah Ibn Jarah Battalion (UJB) participated in the attacks, along with Qadafi loyalists.

Of course it was a mixed group such as this! It was the White House that consistently downplayed al Qaeda’s involvement for so long. It’s not entirely clear why this finding is such a debunking of what people other than the New York Times have been saying.

11. The involvement of prisoners released from Gitmo

So that New York Times report I keep going back to includes a portion that says this:

The C.I.A. kept its closest watch on people who had known ties to terrorist networks abroad, especially those connected to Al Qaeda. Intelligence briefings for diplomats often mentioned Sufian bin Qumu, a former driver for a company run by Bin Laden. Mr. Qumu had been apprehended in Pakistan in 2001 and detained for six years at Guantánamo Bay before returning home to Derna, a coastal city near Benghazi that was known for a high concentration of Islamist extremists. But neither Mr. Qumu nor anyone else in Derna appears to have played a significant role in the attack on the American Mission, officials briefed on the investigation and the intelligence said.

Again, if you were reading conservative sites, you already knew that this wasn’t true.

But the report says he was almost certainly involved and that he was trained by al Qaeda. And that others who were involved were part of al Qaeda.

12. “They told us to wait.” “Yeah, We told them to wait.”

Remember a few months ago when FOX News had a special documentary “13 Hours at Benghazi”? This was an explosive documentary hosted by Bret Baier that featured three American security forces who were in Benghazi saying they disagreed with how long they were told to wait before trying to rescue folks at TMF.

You can watch the relevant portion here but I’ll just note that these men are speaking on the record about their experience:



Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com

If you’d rather read the relevant portion, here’s a transcript. The guys said they were ready to go within five minutes but they were held back by a top CIA officer named “Bob.”

“It had probably been 15 minutes I think, and … I just said, ‘Hey, you know, we gotta– we need to get over there, we’re losing the initiative,’” said Tiegen. “And Bob just looks straight at me and said, ‘Stand down, you need to wait.’” “We’re starting to get calls from the State Department guys saying, ‘Hey, we’re taking fire, we need you guys here, we need help,’” said Paronto. After a delay of nearly 30 minutes, the security team headed to the besieged consulate without orders. They asked their CIA superiors to call for armed air support, which never came. Now, looking back, the security team said they believed that if they had not been delayed for nearly half an hour, or if the air support had come, things might have turned out differently. “Ambassador Stevens and Sean [Smith], yeah, they would still be alive, my gut is yes,” Paronto said. Tiegen concurred. “I strongly believe if we’d left immediately, they’d still be alive today,” he added… In a statement to Fox News, a senior intelligence official did allow that the security team was delayed from responding while the CIA’s top officer in Benghazi tried to rally local support.

Here’s how this is “debunked” according to the report:

Finding #7: Prior to the CIA security team departing for the TMF, the Annex leadership deliberated thoughtfully, reasonable, and quickly about whether further security could be provided to the team. Although some security officers voiced a greater urgency to depart for the TMF, no officer was ever told to stand down.

Oh where to begin? Now, what the report does is explain the delay, not deny it. It characterizes the delay as thoughtful and reasonable. The guys who went on the record thought it overdone, but that’s a natural disagreement.

But note that while the guys said they were told to “stand down” by a top CIA officer, the “debunkers” say that no CIA officer was told to stand down. Later they say that no “stand down” order was given from CIA HQ or from the Tripoli Team.

Of course, these security guys never said that. They said they were told to stand down by an officer right there who looked them in the eye and was named Bob. Further, it’s rather obvious from the actual interview that their big point of dispute is that they were told to wait. The report confirms that is exactly what happened.

13. Explanations aren’t eviscerations

Similarly, Finding #9 explains “The Tripoli Team’s decision not to move to the hospital to retrieve Ambassador Stevens was based on the best intelligence at the time.”

And yes, this report says, that intelligence turned out to be completely inaccurate. (But remember, there were no intelligence failures, just inaccurate or insufficient intelligence that turned out to be disastrous.) But if the claim is that nobody moved to the hospital to help Stevens, explaining why no one moved isn’t the same thing as “debunking” the claim.

14.No focus on State Department or Defense Department

This isn’t a big thing but it’s worth noting that this review was of intelligence agencies. Therefore, it lacks a substantive discussion of State Department and Defense Department performance. Not that I’d expect any biting oversight of those departments, either, but since those departments also played (or didn’t play, as the case may be) roles in what happened, the lack of focus is just something to consider when declaring, as one media outlet did, the release date of this report the date when Benghazi was no longer up for discussion.

15. Did we mention that there was nothing good about the talking points?

Yeah, so, late in the report we learn that “the Administration’s initial public narrative on the causes and motivations for the attacks were not fully accurate.” You don’t say! Also that “The process and edits made to these talking points was flawed.”

And for this, the GOP should be ashamed? Really? It’s almost like a less obsequious press might think something else might be amiss.

Much of the report wishy-washily explains that there is a fog in intel gathering that makes things difficult to assess and that this kind of sort of excuses all the horse manure that was shoveled by the administration during the campaign-season terrorist attack.

Now, earlier in the report we’re told that “[Ansar al Sharia] posted a video on YouTube on September 12, 2012, claiming participation in the attacks” and we know that the head of al Qaeda called for attacks on the U.S. in Libya the day before the attack. We know that the attack took place on September 11, what even the most casual observer might note is a significant date. We’re told that the Defense Intelligence Agency said the attacks were pre-planned on September 12.

But you see, man, like a few weeks later the CIA totally thought it just happened to fall on September 11.

Let me be clear, as President Obama might say, if you’re a reporter reading this and think this sounds even remotely plausible and you think that this section is anything other than a great explanation of how idiotic the CIA can be, you are an idiot.

Everything about this section is groan-inducing. Such as that when a cable came from Tripoli to the CIA on September 14 that was the “first indication that there may not have been a protest,” according to deputy director Mike Morell, he wasn’t sure if he’d read it. Nevermind that we later learn that folks in Libya had within hours assessed that there was a lack of protests that day. I just have a hard time believing that the deputy director wouldn’t care if a Tripoli intelligence cable came around. Either way, by September 15, he’d gotten an email specifically saying there’d been no protest.

And when did Susan Rice go on television blaming a YouTube video for sparking a protest that somehow magically transformed into this super-effective double-location onslaught that took four American lives including an American Ambassador’s? That would be September 16.

That was when she said the actions in Benghazi were a “direct result of a heinous and offensive video that was widely disseminated.”

This report that supposedly makes Republicans look bad notes that Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes wrote on September 14 that “one of the goals of Administration public statements should be ‘To underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy.'”

Exactly the opposite, Ben.

Anyway, this report then claims, more or less completely implausibly, that Rice couldn’t have really known until afterwards that her assessments were incorrect. Um, OK. But maybe when you’re, I don’t know, trying to “underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy” because you’re focusing on campaigning more than truth-telling, you end up underscoring something that isn’t true. I don’t care if we have some difficult-to-swallow bureaucratic BS explanation that avoids tough questions and instead pats Susan Rice on the head as if she couldn’t be expected to do better. Or, rather, I don’t see why we let certain administrations get away with this type of explanatory defense while nailing other people to the wall for the smallest slight.

16. Wait, what’s this about Mike Morell again?

So the same Morell who accidentally didn’t read a memo related to a horrific terror attack and forgot to tell anyone about the cables from Tripoli also was this guy:

“Finding 12: Deputy CIA Director Michael Morell made significant changes to the talking points”

Wait, what? Are you kidding me?

But, the report says, it’s OK because, um, well, you see, he didn’t know Susan Rice or anyone else in the Administration would use talking points he made. And then the report says something about excellent beachfront property for sale cheap. No, actually it says he “made a large number of edits after a September 15 White House Deputies Committee meeting.” Oh dear.

Earlier drafts of the talking points mentioned al Qaeda but by the time Morell was done with them, he didn’t even include “Islamist” in them. Because our CIA is full of people who do not commit intelligence failures but can’t figure out that an al Qaeda attack on September 11 might be related to Islamism.

By the way, the CIA’s office of public affairs also stripped language about attacks and changed it to “demonstrations” and I am sure that had nothing whatsoever to do with it being an election year or their bosses allowing a major attack on the anniversary of September 11.

17. CIA could have done things better? You don’t say.

Finding #14 says “the CIA could have placed more weight on eyewitness sources on the ground and should have challenged its initial assessments about the existence of a protest earlier.” Of course, its initial assessment was right on. Within hours, the CIA noted that the attack was premeditated and there was no protest. It was politics that changed that rather obvious conclusion. And as noted above, the guys in Tripoli specifically told the agency that they had no evidence of a protest before Susan Rice received talking points making contrary claims.

Looking through all of this talking-point changing and reversal of initial assessments, and White House efforts to make sure everyone believed it was a protest, this whole “what difference does it make?” episode from Hillary Clinton sure doesn’t look any better (though I’m sure the media will continue to give her one of their trademarked passes).

18. Wrongly forced to sign NDAs?

Another finding is that no one was improperly forced to sign non-disclosure agreements. This is in response to the claims made by some that they were encouraged to sign multiple non-disclosure agreements.

The report in fact acknowledges that some of those who were told to sign secondary NDAs felt uncomfortable about it. It says “three of the six contractors who signed new NDAs testified that they believed CIA’s request for the new NDAs appeared odd.” But the committee feels strongly that everything was cool about it.

But how does this debunk reporting that contractors were asked to sign further NDAs or that the request felt it odd? The report confirms it. And it seems sensible that some might find it odd. Reporters shouldn’t delight in CIA explanations for why it was totally no big deal over other claims at odds with CIA talking points.

The report goes into twists and turns to explain that these secondary NDAs weren’t really tied to Benghazi, they just super seem like it. And further the report says that Director Brennan was “factually accurate” when he denied it had anything to do with Benghazi but then suggests he didn’t handle it well. What a mess.

19. If you can’t trust the CIA completely, who can you trust?

Finding #16 is “There is no evidence that the CIA conducted any unusual polygraph exams related to Benghazi.”

You’ll note a few things. Namely the word “unusual” and the phrase “related to Benghazi.” CNN reported that some people who had been in Benghazi were being polygraphed once a month. They also reported that was an unusual rate.

Does the CIA justify its claim by saying once a month is a totally usual rate? That the polygraphs were done at an unusual rate but weren’t actually related to Benghazi but, instead, something else agency related? Is the distinction related to the difference between the journalistic claim regarding “CIA operative” and the CIA claim that “no officer” was polygraphed? We don’t know. There is no substantiating evidence that would make someone believe the CIA over Jake Tapper on this one. Should journalists jump up and down and make partisan clowns out of themselves before asking these questions?

20. What a waste of two years.

The conclusion to the report claims “This report is the result of nearly two years of intensive investigation.” I’d like to see how they define intensive.

Because if you spend two years to come up with a report that one of our worst failures was not preventable and you don’t even explore, say, whether we were sold out by supposed friends who turn out to be al Qaeda affiliated, what are you doing with your time?

If I wanted to read a bunch of unconvincing explanations for bad behavior, I’d talk to a group of poorly disciplined children. We should expect a bit more from an oversight committee.

And as for the clown show of our reporter class who spent the last couple of years making B-E-N-G-H-A-Z-I acrostics? Joking about dead ambassadors and lacking curiosity are not as good looking as you think.

The Ferguson Riots Are Nothing Like The Original Tea Party Protests,"If you were reading left-leaning commentators over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, you probably saw a rather strange argument: that looting, arson and rioting in Ferguson, Missouri in the aftermath of the decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson for shooting Michael Brown was defensible on the grounds that it was equivalent to the Boston Tea Party or the Stamp Act Riots. The problem with this parallel is that it is at best willfully ignorant of history, and at worst a deliberate call for an escalation to violent revolution.

Given the emotions running high over the Brown case, protests were inevitable, and it was also inevitable that some protesters would get out of hand, as happens with angry crowds. But what happened went well beyond protests, to looting and arson of a Little Ceasars pizza joint, a small cake bakery, an antique store, a beauty shop, and other businesses, some of them small concerns owned by local African-American entrepreneurs.

Among the various efforts made by people on the Left to justify or defend this, we had a Time Magazine column, celebrities and other Twitter users and even a teachers’ guide pushing the parallel between the Ferguson rioters and colonial protests against taxation without representation. Ta-Nehisi Coates and Jamelle Bouie, who spent much of a day pushing these parallels and retweeting readers doing the same, went further:

@tanehisicoates It’s only violence when black people do it, my friend.



— Jamelle Bouie (@jbouie) November 26, 2014

(Notably, Coates backed off any effort to draw the parallel in his Atlantic column on the topic).

There are four major problems with justifying the violence in Ferguson by reference to the Boston Tea Party and the Stamp Act Riots, either in moral terms or in terms of the effectiveness of this sort of protest.

1. The Violence in Ferguson Targeted Innocent Small Business Owners

By contrast, the Boston Tea Party was directed at destroying the property of the government-granted corporate monopoly (the British East India Company) that benefited from the Tea Act. The Stamp Act Riots—as the first outburst, before the development of colonial leaders like Sam Adams—were sometimes less directed and more random, generating some mob violence similar to contemporary riots. But what made the violence effective was that much of it was aimed at government officials in charge of collecting the Stamp Act taxes, and others who collaborated with them, leading many to fear for their lives and property if they continued to cooperate. In contrast, the likes of local baker Natalie Dubose had done nothing at all to deserve having their businesses destroyed.

This has, in fact, been the pattern for most of the urban African-American riots of the past 50 years, from 1960s riots in places like Newark and Detroit to the Los Angeles riots of 1992 to Cincinnati in 2001: the destruction of local homes and businesses, some of which never return, and the decimation of the wealth (however modest) of the local black middle class. To say that violence and civil disorder, in the abstract, may be effective or justifiable proves nothing about the effect of this kind of violence, the wanton arsons and the self-interested looting.

2. The Boston Tea Party Provoked a Harsh Response

The idea that the Boston Tea Party could be used as a model for the Ferguson rioters ignores the fact that the Boston Tea Party didn’t work—at least, not in the sense of causing the British Crown to back down. To the contrary, the Crown did what governments often do in the face of civil unrest: close ranks and crack down. The Tea Party led to the military occupation of Boston and the near ruination of the city’s economy.

The Crown did what governments often do in the face of civil unrest: close ranks and crack down.

The Stamp Act Riots were, again, more effective, but only because they caught by surprise a government that was 3,000 miles away, slowed by eighteenth-century trans-oceanic communications and (in the aftermath of seven years of war) without the force on hand to impose order. But the longer term effect of the Stamp Act crisis was not to convince the British government that it should avoid antagonizing the colonists, but rather to persuade the Crown to exert more control over the colonies in order to avoid a repetition—precisely the spine-stiffening effect that prepared it for passage of the Tea Act and its subsequent response to the Tea Party.

In Ferguson, by contrast, the protestors aren’t going after a distant government an ocean away, but contending with local authority—the very opposite of the colonists’ demand for more local control. And local authority by its nature is more immediately responsive to push back at threats to the civil order.

3. The Founding Fathers Were Appalled By Mob Violence

Much of the citation to the Boston Tea Party and the Stamp Act Riots is, more or less, an effort to troll conservatives who like to cite the Founding Fathers. But the men who established the government we have today were, most of them, appalled by mob violence. Ben Franklin, whose wife had to turn away Stamp Act rioters with the family firearm, did everything he could in London to distance himself and other peaceful protesters of the Stamp Act from the charge of complicity with the rioters. John Adams, who had defended British troops charged with firing into the crowd at the Boston Massacre in 1770, supported the Tea Party but was horrified by more violent steps taken against merchants; the HBO series made from David McCullough’s wonderful book uses a fictionalized event to dramatize this, but Adams himself wrote in 1774:

These private Mobs, I do and will detest…These Tarrings and Featherings, these breaking open Houses by rude and insolent Rabbles, in Resentment for private Wrongs or in pursuance of private Prejudices and Passions, must be discountenanced.

This horror of the works of the mob was evident in Adams’ subsequent design of the separation of powers in the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780 (“to the end it may be a government of laws and not of men”), and after the unrest of Shays’ Rebellion in 1786, fear of the mob was one of the direct triggers for calling a Constitutional Convention. Our system of divided government, checks and balances, and staggered elections—all of them frequent targets of scorn by progressives these days—was purposely designed in good part to ensure that government by popular sovereignty would be deliberate and not ruled by mob passions and mob violence.

President Washington himself rode out in 1791 to crush the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania, and ever since, the usual pattern in American history—especially when riots are directed against local government—has more often than not been a backlash that puts down the rioters by force, as happened in the Draft Riots in New York in 1863. And contra Coates and Bouie, that has not been the pattern only when the rioters are black. Unrest among predominantly white college students, for example, was—just as much as urban African-American rioting in that era—a factor in the rise of Ronald Reagan to be California governor in 1966 and Richard Nixon to the presidency in 1968. When riots and lynchings have been effective, as they were in establishing Jim Crow in the 1870s, it was usually because they had local government on their side, and a weary and distant federal government (which under President Grant had originally reacted with blunt force against the KKK) was no longer on hand to respond. But the Klan of the 1870s is a poor role model for anyone looking for any kind of positive social change.

4. Rioting Works When It Leads To Revolution

This brings us to the final point, and maybe the most critical. We look back with some fondness today even to the worst mob excesses of the Stamp Act Riots and the Boston Tea Party, not because rioting was morally justified or successful in bringing about its aims, but because we see the ultimate result that those outbursts led to the American Revolution. Coates at least acknowledges this. But that’s exactly the problem: rather than accomplish their goals and de-escalate the crisis, what the riots and the Tea Party did was to make things worse to the point that we ended up at war for seven years. There was no peaceful resolution, only a bitter struggle that cost thousands of lives and required the colonists to take up arms against the government they had originally petitioned for redress.

The solution was not reform, but secession. But how is that an answer in Ferguson? And do liberals who regularly mock talk of the Second Amendment as a final bulwark against tyranny now embrace the idea of building armed militias to separate themselves from the United States, or even from the State of Missouri? Because if you’re citing the Revolution as your inspiration, you have to consider the full consequences of that choice.

Winning The Murdered NYPD Officers Blame Game Won’t Bring Peace,"On Saturday, two NYPD officers were shot and killed as they sat in their marked police car on a street corner. Investigators say that Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were killed by a gunman named Ismaaiyl Brinsley. They report that he wanted to avenge the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, who died at the hands of police in recent months. Brinsley killed himself after the murders. Earlier in the day he had reportedly shot an ex-girlfriend in Maryland.

Protests across the country have erupted in response to the police killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown and the lack of indictments for the police involved in their deaths. While many protests have been completely peaceful, some included looting and riots and chants calling for dead cops. More recent protests have come under the umbrella of #BlackLivesMatter, as Garner, Brown and other men killed in high-profile shootings were black.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio’s comments after the Garner decision, which discussed how he has trained his bi-racial son to be careful in any interaction with a police officer, angered many cops. They said he’s been insufficiently supportive of the difficulties they face. After the murders of Liu and Ramos, NYPD officers turned their backs on de Blasio when he arrived for a press conference.

And as tense as relations are in New York, social media erupted with some supporters of police trying to pin blame for the murders on anti-cop rhetoric emanating from critics of police overreach. This in turn led to responses from others that this was no better than when major media elites blamed Sarah Palin for the shooting of Gabby Giffords in a mass shooting in Arizona a few years ago.

That’s a horrible comparison.

Here’s a sample tweet response to claims that anti-cop rhetoric contributed to the officers’ deaths:

Those blaming deBlasio for NYPD killings were outraged when Palin/tea party were blamed for Giffords' shooting They were right then

Over at Reason, Nick Gillespie wrote:

Just as Sarah Palin’s defense of gun rights has zero culpability in the shooting of Rep. Gabby Giffords and Dallas’s right-wing “climate of hate” had nothing to do with Marxist-Leninist Lee Harvey Oswald’s assassinaton of JFK, it’s worth underscoring at every moment of what is already shaping up as a very ugly debate that the actual killer is the culprit here.

We should blame the individuals who commit violent acts for the violence, but these are really bad comparisons. The New York Times and other prominent media blamed Sarah Palin for the shooting of Rep. Gabby Giffords and Dallas’ “climate of hate” for the assassination of JFK. But there has been no evidence whatsoever in any way shape or form that Palin’s existence, much less defense of gun rights or electoral “targeting” of Giffords’ district, were even known to Giffords’ shooter, Jared Lee Loughner. And as much as I love a good conspiracy theory, there is no evidence that Marxist-Leninist Lee Harvey Oswald was in any way moved by any “climate of hate,” much less anything even remotely conservative.

Here’s why the Palin comparison fails.

Let’s not forget exactly what went down in the smearing of Palin four years ago. A PAC associated with Palin had put out a map with races to “target” and had identified those “targets” with crosshairs. This could not be more common for political campaigns. Indeed, progressive groups had put out similar maps with bulls-eyes for races they wanted to focus on. Some activists began blaming Palin for the shooting and the media responded by running wall-to-wall coverage of the map and pieces headlined “Did Sarah Palin’s Target Map Play Role in Giffords Shooting?.”

The Atlantic’s James Fallows wondered “whether there is a connection between” such “extreme, implicitly violent political rhetoric and imagery” as that published by Palin and “actual outbursts of violence, whatever the motivations of this killer turn out to be.” Was Palin’s map the equivalent, then, of “falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic?”

The Washington Post wrote a story headlined “Palin caught in crosshairs map controversy after Tucson shootings.”

Andrew Sullivan wrote, “No one is saying Sarah Palin should be viewed as an accomplice to murder. Many are merely saying that her recklessly violent and inflammatory rhetoric has poisoned the discourse and has long run the risk of empowering the deranged. We are saying it’s about time someone took responsibility for this kind of rhetorical extremism, because it can and has led to violence and murder.”

The New York Times’ Matt Bai wrote, “it’s hard not to think [Loughner] was at least partly influenced by a debate that often seems to conflate philosophical disagreement with some kind of political Armageddon.”

In “Imagery of Armed Revolution,” the New York Times’ Matt Bai wrote, “it’s hard not to think [Loughner] was at least partly influenced by a debate that often seems to conflate philosophical disagreement with some kind of political Armageddon.” He added, “The problem would seem to rest with the political leaders who pander to the margins of the margins, employing whatever words seem likely to win them contributions or TV time, with little regard for the consequences.” He said Palin and other used “imagery of armed revolution. Popular spokespeople like Ms. Palin routinely drop words like ‘tyranny’ and ‘socialism’ when describing the president and his allies, as if blind to the idea that Americans legitimately faced with either enemy would almost certainly take up arms.”

And at Psychology Today, neurologist David Weisman wrote that “The question is not ‘did Sarah Palin’s violent rhetoric cause this shooting?’ The question is ‘does inciting violence factor in a multi-factorial process?'” He concluded, “[a]lthough there is little clear evidence in this case, the data highlights the importance of butterfly events on human actions. Jared Loughner is clearly deranged. He drank deeply from internal insanity and external stimuli. His actions did not take place in a vacuum.”

You might also recall that when Palin attempted to defend herself from all major media blaming her for a horrific massacre in Arizona, we then saw a new round of angry media claiming she’d tried to dog-whistle evangelicals or something because she’d used the phrase ‘blood libel.’

The slur wasn’t just aimed at Palin but the entire Tea Party. As John Sexton pointed out on Twitter, Slate’s Jacob Weisberg had a good example of the form in his piece “How anti-government, pro-gun, xenophobic populism made the Giffords shooting more likely.”:

It is appropriate, however, to consider what was swirling outside Loughner's head. To call his crime an attempted assassination is to acknowledge that it appears to have had a political and not merely a personal context. That context wasn't Islamic radicalism, Puerto Rican independence, or anarcho-syndicalism. It was the anti-government, pro-gun, xenophobic populism that flourishes in the dry and angry climate of Arizona. Extremist shouters didn't program Loughner, in some mechanistic way, to shoot Gabrielle Giffords. But the Tea Party movement did make it appreciably more likely that a disturbed person like Loughner would react, would be able to react, and would not be prevented from reacting, in the crazy way he did.

However, in the case of Ismaaiyl Brinsley, we have reason to believe that he was at least claiming a motive of revenge for the deaths of Garner and Brown.

However, in the case of Ismaaiyl Brinsley, we have reason to believe that he was at least claiming a motive of revenge for the deaths of Garner and Brown. He allegedly put up an Instagram picture of a gun with a caption that said, “I’m putting wings on pigs today. They take 1 of ours … let’s take 2 of theirs.” He added hashtags for ShootThePolice, RIPErivGarner (sic) and RIPMikeBrown. A later post said he was “putting pigs in a blanket.”

If Weisberg could blame the Tea Party for the swirls of imaginary conditions, I have no doubt that he is working right now on his piece even more vociferously condemning #BlackLivesMatter for the shooting of NYPD officers.

Now, maybe we’ll learn that what we’ve been told about Brinsley was an elaborate ruse or that the information only seemed to come from Brinsley, but it is obvious that blaming anti-cop rhetoric is a completely different situation than blaming Palin and the Tea Party for deaths they had literally zero relationship to. It may still be wrong to blame anti-cop rhetoric but we already know from what we’ve seen thus far, that reporters have not similarly rushed to run anguished pieces blaming Eric Holder or de Blasio or other politicians.

Individual vs. collective guilt

Again, Nick Gillespie’s argument that people who kill other people should be held completely accountable for those killings is correct. The problem we have in the current discussion of #BlackLivesMatter is that some of the discussion has been about collective guilt.

What began as a potentially constructive conversation about the militarization of police forces; failures maintaining community policing standards; and how those problems affect certain communities disproportionately has unfortunately become mostly a droning monologue of political correctness and groupthink.

One of the regrettable things about the recent call for a less militarized and better community policing is that it seems to have been if not taken over then at least dramatically influenced by that sort of professional protesting contingent of socialists and communists. What began as a potentially constructive conversation about the militarization of police forces; failures maintaining community policing standards; and how those problems affect certain communities disproportionately has unfortunately become mostly a droning monologue of political correctness and groupthink.

Over at SocialistWorker.org, a recent write-up of protests included some interesting chants. I should note that I’m not even sure these reports are true. One of the protest write-ups claims that drivers who were blockaded by protesters gave thumbs-up signs and other shows of support. That sounds implausible until you remember you’re reading the Boulder, Colorado, update. It really might be true.

Anyway, in Boston, we’re told, protesters chanted “Eric Garner, Mike Brown, shut this racist system down,” and “Same story every time, being black is not a crime!” In Minneapolis they chanted “The whole damn system is guilty as hell.”

We’ve seen Smith College president apologize for saying “all lives matter” instead of “black lives matter.” And Huffington Post gives regular updates about what white people can and can’t do if they want to protest police overreach.

All this speaks to the way this discussion has moved from the individual responsibility of the officers in question to notions of collective and systemic guilt. And the response to the killing of these NYPD officers might show how difficult it is to turn that instinct on and off. It might also show why free societies tend to hold individuals responsible instead of groups. In fact, it’s striking how much of our problems achieving peace in these discussions stem from the way we fail to see people as individuals with dignity, be they black or white, cop or civilian. Every group, of course, has some bad actors. But we should be on guard against developing bigoted responses that apply to groups instead of individuals.

To go back to the Giffords example from 2011, CNN’s headline at the time was “Shooting throws spotlight on state of U.S. political rhetoric.” The Telegraph’s was “Gabrielle Giffords shooting: inflammatory rhetoric draws real blood.” When do we blame individuals for shootings and when do we blame groups? Should that change based on the politics of the situation?

The larger progressive political climate will really need to grapple with this. If, as they say, “microagressions” contribute to “rape culture,” how has the rhetoric surrounding Ferguson protests contributed to the murder of cops?

Consistency is key for everyone.

We’ve already seen that the comparison between blaming Palin for Gabby Giffords’ shooting is inappropriate. And while Palin’s map had the media in a tizzy for weeks, they never blamed (or even covered, really) the Southern Poverty Law Center, much less any broader movement, for putting out a “hate map” that led one activist to shoot up Family Research Council. So that’s not a comparison we can make either.

Yes, the media and those activists who hold double standards should be held to account. But there is very little to gain by actually falling down the rabbit hole of reflexive movement blaming with them.

But it is true that we’ve routinely seen the pro-life movement blamed for the violence perpetrated by solo activists against abortion clinics and those that end unborn lives via abortion. And the members of the pro-life civil rights movement can assure you how frustrating and unfair that is.

Conservatives are probably always going to be blamed by the New York Times for any and all ills, no matter how far-fetched the claim will be. But those who believe in individual responsibility can’t pick and choose when to believe in it. These cops were killed by one man, acting alone. We will likely learn more in the days to come about his political inclinations, his mental state, and his response to political rhetoric. If there is one thing that fair-minded people have learned from the media’s rush to blame conservatives for any and all violence, it’s that the actual story usually ranges from complete fabrication to very complicated tale.

Yes, the media and those activists who hold double standards should be held to account. But there is very little to gain by actually falling down the rabbit hole of reflexive movement blaming with them.

As we close out 2014, as another sad day of violence ends, could we also try to see the best in each other’s arguments? Let’s put the best construction on what others are trying to say and see if we can get slightly closer to living in peace with one another.",https://thefederalist.com/2014/12/22/winning-the-murdered-nypd-officers-blame-game-wont-bring-peace/,2014-12-22
How Bad Religion Has Bequeathed Us ‘An Anxious Age’,"Over drinks at a party, an acquaintance described for me her property in Vermont. What she and her husband do to care for over 160 acres they own is extraordinary.

They bought the land (which was adjacent to their home) to save the town from sacrificing it on the altar of economic growth. My friend tells me of the townspeople and tourists who enjoy hunting, fishing, hiking, and the natural beauty of the woods, paths, and water on her land. She and her husband clear the paths, care for the woods, and do everything—by physical strength or monetary necessity—to ensure this land is well-kept and available to anyone who walks, hikes, hunts, or fishes. She tells of the birds, the wild turkeys, the bears—she tells me stories—and as she speaks, my mind’s eye sees the animals and the people, and I tear up.

I admire the self-sacrifice and giving spirit she displays. I admire her earnestness, her lack of guile. Unchurched by choice, she is still a child of Maine and Vermont, a child of New England, and all the history and culture therein.

Joseph Bottum would call her a “Poster Child,” one of the categories of contemporary Americans he discusses in his book, “An Anxious Age: The Post-Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of America.” Bottum’s name for these folks, the heirs of the Puritans, may seem whimsical, but his analysis is quite sober.

A Poetic, Historic, and Theological Story

The broader thesis of this book may seem unoriginal on its face: The mainline Protestant churches have collapsed, leaving a void where once there had been a moral voice to temper democracy and capitalism. However, this important observation—a jewel, in fact—is contained among many others in this treasure chest of a book.

Bottum tells us the story of our country’s spiritual heritage.

Through his poetic, historic, and theological narrative, Bottum tells us the story of our country’s spiritual heritage. As he draws the arc of American culture and religion, we learn something about ourselves, for the story of America’s past—her loves, fears, strengths, weaknesses, conquests, and defeats are crystallized in our present story, as well. In Bottum’s analysis, it is easy to see one’s own story, even mine as an immigrant and Catholic convert.

Bottum is a superb storyteller, so it’s no wonder Mary Eberstadt writes that the book is “deftly analytical and also beautifully written[;] it has the head of Christopher Lasch and the heart of Flannery O’Connor.” If we but shut down our Internet, pour two fingers of Macallan neat, (or glass of wine, if you like) and “listen” carefully to the story Bottum tells, it may change the path we are currently on.

Poster Children: Modernity’s Unexpected Puritans

The first part of the book is a discussion of the Poster Children. These are the contemporary children (inheritors) of the Puritans and the mainline Protestants. These Puritan heirs have de-gospeled the gospel by throwing out Jesus and ascribing to their Protestant and Puritan ancestors all the ills of modern society.

Bottum picks up the story with the rise of certain “civic-spirituals” (my word, not his), followers of Max Weber and Walter Rauschenbusch, and the social gospel movement of the early twentieth century. Bottum asserts that the Poster Children—modern liberals—are in fact quite religious. Their gods are the pantheon of contemporary modern social issues: environmentalism, abortion on demand, redefining and recreating human sexuality, and the like. Their ecclesiology is civic. According to Bottum,

They are, for the most part, politically liberal, preferring that government rather than private associations (such as intact families or the churches they left behind) address social concerns. They remain puritanical and highly judgmental, at least about health, and like all Puritans they are willing to use law to compel behavior they think right.

These are the new elites. This is who occupies the public square. How did we go from the Puritans to Poster Children? Bottum skips the details of this history, but the first part, the question of how and why the Puritans devolved into Unitarians and Universalists within just a few generations, has prompted more than a few scholars and historians over the years.

Puritans were obsessed with purity: Pure religion, pure living, pure institutions, pure people. They even left England because, in their opinion, the Church of England had not purified itself enough from Catholicism. (And although their persecution takes front and center in the narrative we have heard, we will never fully understand their history and its consequences if we refuse to take the former reason into account.) They were perpetually finding fault within themselves and their ranks; they were perpetually refining, and this hit a breaking point of the human spirit, psyche, and culture. They had cause to be skeptical of man’s fallen reason and intellect, even their own, yet relied on it to interpret scripture, believing that the Holy Spirit would preserve them in this.

Perry Miller, in “The New England Mind,” writes:

Protestantism always ran a hazard that through excess of zeal its doctrine might be perverted to erroneous conclusions. Unsophisticated laymen could never understand, after they had been taught that the natural mind was abysmally incompetent and that God had uttered the truth in clear and simple dicta, why they should still need ministers skilled in the sciences, in rhetoric, logic, and physics, in order to hear and comprehend the explicit word of God. They argued with a naïve plausibility that since regeneration infused God’s own substance into the elect, then a regenerated man thereafter required no other mentor than the Holy Ghost, no other instruction than its ever-present promptings…



From the time of the Anabaptists at Münster, Protestant theologians strove with might and main to keep justification by faith from becoming a justification of illiteracy. Such a perversion of the doctrine was as horrible to them as the Catholic [one.] Too much zeal was no more commendable than a lack of it, and in this world much more dangerous, not only for creedal uniformity, but for society and the ecclesiastical order, since thereby any Tom, Dick, or Harry would think he had all the requisites of a good minister when he felt himself moved by the right spirit.

Amidst this uneasy tension regarding the intellect, the Puritan’s perpetual refining and purifying cleft this culture in two. Explicit cracks began to show in the form of the “half-way covenant,” the term used for children and grandchildren of Puritans who couldn’t prove a substantial conversion experience. Thus, they even “purified” their own families to the point of division. Formally, the doctrine of the half-way covenant allowed “half-way” members to become part of the local congregations, baptize their children, and grow to “full membership” under the watchful eyes of the elders. They were not given access to the Lord’s Table, nor the right to vote (they had a congregational form of ecclesiology).

Eventually Puritanism was cleft into a side which, in this dilemma cited above, took the “intellectual” route, becoming the liberal wing of religious society, reading the Bible ever more faithlessly until arriving at Unitarian Universalist positions. Those who took the “faithful” route became the biblical wing on a march toward fundamentalism.

We’re On a Mission to Save the World

But let’s get back to Bottum’s story, sometime later near the turn of the twentieth century. By this time, we have seen something like a reverse-Hegelian dialectic cycle occurring within Protestantism: sects start strong and faithful with unified purpose, then eventually there is a split in interpretation, and the liberal and faithful go their separate ways. The faithful slowly settle into an internalized, detached faith, until some portion of them wakes to new calls for Christian charitable action.

The churches began taking their cues from the culture, suppressing and deforming Christ and his message.

Bottum focuses on a statement by Rauschenbusch in what he calls, “the best one-sentence summary of the theological complaint that led to the social gospel movement:” “Because the Kingdom of God has been dropped as the primary and comprehensive aim of Christianity, and personal salvation has been substituted for it, therefore men seek to save their own souls and are selfishly indifferent to the evangelization of the world.”

Amid a comfortable, internalized, lip-service-only brand of Christianity, the social gospel movement arose. Even after centuries of Protestant splits with similar dynamics, Bottum chooses to place the fulcrum of our religious history at this point. Despite complications and fraying over the centuries, a distinguishable and relevant “mainline” of Protestant churches remained to define and regulate American culture well into the twentieth century.

Wrapping all the churches up to this point under the single name “Protestantism,” he writes, “Protestantism… was our cultural Mississippi, rolling through the center of the American landscape—and even the nation’s Catholics and Jews understood that they lived along its banks.” This Protestantism, alive in an asymmetric pluralism, gave America a conscience and a moral vocabulary. But after Bottum’s pivot point, when liberal Protestant theology took over the seminaries and the liberally-bred seminarians went into local churches small and large, the salt began losing its savor, and the light of the truth of Christ, which was to bring truth and salvation to the surrounding culture, became darkened.

The churches began taking their cues from the culture, suppressing and deforming Christ and his message. The alliance of the mainline with the social gospel movement, Bottum seems to say, led to the state of affairs before the end of the twentieth century, wherein “the central channel of American mainline Protestantism was almost dry.” Bottum mourns the loss of these denominations: “[T]he Mainline may have been an intellectually emaciated form of Christendom, as Catholic writers tended to insist, but it was all the Christendom we had in America, and it offered us a vocabulary with which both to criticize the nation and to support.” Precisely here, I respectfully disagree, but I understand his sentiment.

Religious Pruning Is Good

It is good that a dead and disfigured Christianity has perished. These apostate churches, and I mince no words here, these institutions whose Christian veneer finally gave way, were actually stumbling blocks to a real Christian witness in the public square. Not that an internalized and dissociated faith—no matter how sincerely salvific—is any replacement, of course. The ongoing death of mainline churches should be seen as an opportunity for authentic Christianity to rise—a Christianity that knows its identity is rooted not a priori in a political or social agenda, but in the gospel of Christ, from which our agenda must flow.

These institutions whose Christian veneer finally gave way were actually stumbling blocks to a real Christian witness in the public square.

Bottum’s Poster Children, and those whom I have labeled “civic-spirituals,” continue operating out of a loose Christian paradigm, but one untethered to the gospel of their forebears. Therefore, salvation for them is not in Christ but in the many causes—gods—who will cleanse them and the world from the sins of racism, bigotry, and the like. For all of their progression, they still retain their Puritan obsession with purity.

Bottum does a superb job telling us what happened and he tries to address how, as well. But I’m particularly interested in the why, because knowing will help us find ways out of our current and future cultural dilemmas. I believe this why is intimately tied to the anthropological problem of our misjudgment about the proper place of reason—a fundamental misunderstanding of who we are as man created in the image of God, or an identity crisis.

The Swallows of Capistrano Regenerate

In the second section of the book, Bottum tells of the rise and fall of what he calls the Swallows of Capistrano—that strong and moral Pope John Paul II generation that got some traction during the late 1980s and 1990s. They brought classic Christian vocabulary on morality and natural law back into the public square. This portion of the book takes an honest view of the hopes, strengths, and foibles of American Catholicism through this exhilarating time, and frankly made me wistful about missing out on the movement myself.

Just when these Catholic thinkers were on the rise, the priest sex-abuse scandals broke out.

But just when these Catholic thinkers were on the rise—and this greatly shortens Bottum’s treatment of them—the priest sex-abuse scandals broke out. This affected everything. The Swallows of Capistrano, he says, have not been able to re-establish themselves as an authoritative voice for morality, responsibility, and wisdom in the public square. I have to disagree again. Call it the hope of a convert. Better yet, call it the hopeful outlook of a fool who has peeked into the treasure chest of Catholicism and pleads for her betters to open it up and start unpacking.

Because America is so culturally Protestant, Bottum has difficulty seeing Catholicism as able to fill the void mainline churches relinquished through their apostasy. I know from my days as a Protestant that evangelicals of all stripes hope to fill this void, but I don’t see it happening. Secularists have told a narrative regarding right-wing fundamentalists that leaves a huge hurdle for evangelicals to overcome. Furthermore, evangelicalism’s thin intellectual heritage can’t take on secular philosophies. One of evangelicalism’s greatest blind spots is its sometimes-unintentional acquiescence to, and perpetuation of, the myth of a divorce between faith and reason. We know from Miller’s words above that this anti-intellectualism goes at least as far back as their Puritan spiritual forefathers.

Over-Intellectual Versus Anti-Intellectual

Like mother like daughter: modern Protestantism divides in the same way today. On the one side we see the syncretism of those who label themselves Progressive Christians, and on the other is the clinging to fideism (setting the primacy of faith against sin-damaged reason), by those who call themselves conservative Protestants. Although there is a spectrum in between, these two extremes dominate the overall Protestant landscape in America. Each side clings, puritanically, to its respective authorities: social conscience informed by rationalism on the one hand, and a literal documentary-prescriptive reading of scripture on the other.

Evangelicalism’s thin intellectual heritage can’t take on secular philosophies.

The Calvinist and Puritan notion that reason is not merely insufficient, but broken and twisted by sin, carries on to some degree in fundamentalist circles today. This view of reason contradicts the empirical experience of the rational secularist. However, because it is now such a part of the public narrative equating Christianity with right-wing fundamentalism, it (intentionally or unintentionally) puts many people in the position of believing they have to commit intellectual suicide to believe the truths of Christianity.

This is a problem with both modern atheist philosophy, which disrespects and discounts all previous thought that was the explicit product of a theistic worldview, as well as that of modern evangelicals, who have failed to leverage millenia of solid Christian philosophy into anything that gets traction in the broader culture. At the extreme end, you also find sects which, in the vein of the Unitarians of old, elevate human reason above God, leaving very little left by which to be called “Christian.”

While he does not address this in “An Anxious Age,” I suspect Bottum would see echoes of Puritanism in the “New Atheist” movement. Here is the rise of a certain atheistic scientism, its following composed largely of non-scientists who are quick to affirm their faith in the pronouncements of those they deem credible scientists, even when those pronouncements stray from science into the morally prescriptive realm. In fact, it appears the morally prescriptive “scientists” are those most willing to acquiesce to amassing such followers.

Regaining Public Trust in An Anxious Age

Rather than taking a low view of man’s intellect, promoting such a distrust of human knowledge, or conceding this false dichotomy between faith and reason, a Christian anthropology ought to echo St. Paul in Romans 1:19 and 20: “For what can be known about God is perfectly plain to them, since God has made it plain to them: ever since the creation of the world, the invisible existence of God and his everlasting power have been clearly seen by the mind’s understanding of created things. And so these people have no excuse.”

We need an intellectual evangelization.

In fact, along with the substantial philosophies of Saints Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, the Catholic Church does just that. This is why the Catechism of the Catholic Church states, “Our holy mother, the Church, holds and teaches that God, the first principle and last end of all things, can be known with certainty from the created world by the natural light of human reason. Without this capacity, man would not be able to welcome God’s revelation. Man has this capacity because he is created ‘in the image of God.’”

Certainly there are threads in the middle of the American Protestant landscape which today retain these and similar truths but, as Bottum asserts, they have become ineffectual in the culture.

If we want to bring love, beauty, truth, and goodness back to the public square, and if we want people to move from a human-reason understanding of God to a salvific understanding of God, we must respect the image of God in the secularists. We must respect their reason and meet them there. We need an intellectual evangelization. If not, the public square will continue to be dominated by the children of the Puritans—a people whose savior now is liberal ideology, and whose religious acts include activism aimed at destroying any remains of Christianity.

Poetic and historic, An Anxious Age tells us a sad story—a tragic story—of the demise of our country’s spiritual heritage. Like the water flowing down the Erie Canal, which kept cropping up as part of the book’s thesis, Bottum traces the ebb and flow of America’s soul, conceived when a Puritan’s boot touched the New England shores to where she lies now, with a certain air of senility about her dechristened public square.

Bottum ends “An Anxious Age” uncertain of the future. Perhaps it is his own anxiety reflected in the title. He ends still grieving the Protestant demise, but seems open to being convinced there may yet be hope somewhere. He just can’t see it. Bottum does not give a satisfying answer to the question: Who will stand for the voice of reason and morality in modern America? I think it’s because he’s unsure of not only who, but how that voice will rise above the din of the public square. He leaves the reader wanting, certainly if the reader seeks predictions, and literally ends with a “God help us,” the tone of which is hard to determine between hopeful and passive.

Bottum ends still grieving the Protestant demise, but seems open to being convinced there may yet be hope somewhere.

I am no prophetess, but I have tasted truth, beauty, and goodness, and I want it for my fellow man. Why is the story of the Poster Children instructive? Because it gives those who work and study at the intersection of faith and culture a way forward. When we understand the anthropological problem—a contradiction of our own recognition of rational faculties—that bred liberal Protestantism, which then led to liberal and Progressive evangelicalism, then we can stop applying band-aids and prescribing ineffective medication. Knowing the root cause of the disease, we can, as a union of Catholics and confessional and creedal Protestants, work together to regain public trust.

I say this because I believe that these two strands of Christianity have what it takes to unite in the public square even when they cannot fully unite theologically, yet. I believe this can happen because these strands of Christianity have fought against destructive philosophies about human reason, and have instead held faith and reason in an appropriate tension—all because they have kept two key ingredients of the Christian faith, which temper against rationalism and anti-intellectualism: the liturgy and the sacraments. Unpacking that is another day’s work.

The mark of a good book is to inform and impart wisdom. The mark of a great book is to inspire conversation, response, even disagreement. “An Anxious Age” falls into the latter category.

Can Gays And Christians Coexist In America? Part 1,"Can gays and Christians co-exist in America? As the saying goes, “Can this marriage be saved?” I still hope the answer is yes. But for now, it is very much up in the air—and the answer is no longer in Christians’ hands.

This is a provocative thesis on a sensitive topic, one many of us would rather not face. I had long hoped not to return to writing at any length about this issue, especially not when conservatives are winning so many other arguments these days, and this is one that persuades few people who have not already made up their minds.

While I have written repeatedly on efforts to enact same-sex marriage through the courts, I have never lifted a finger on fights to address the issue through the democratic political process, where it belongs—in part because same-sex marriages, if recognized by legislation, are never likely to crack 1 percent of all marriages, and so will by themselves have little impact on our society. Moreover, many of my allies on the Right and personal friends are gay or are supporters of same-sex marriage, and one hates to pick at the scab of a losing political fight that divides coalitions and alienates old friends. I agonized a very long time over how to fairly present this essay, which may explain some of its length (it will run in five parts this week).

But sometimes, both truth and faith demand a defense when under assault, and I also have many friends and allies who are religious believers and despair that nobody is telling their side of the story. When my faith itself, the faith of a billion Catholics, is being cast in public debate and popular culture as a bigotry that must be stamped out by any means necessary, I feel an obligation to rise in its defense. To lay down a marker, for those who insist that faithful Christianity is “on the wrong side of history . ” To explain why we stand where we stand, and why we must. And to consider how we have come to this pass, and what might yet be done.

Today, in Part I of this five-part series, I address two of the most common, misguided efforts to dismiss the Christian view of marriage and the Christian approach to homosexuality as some sort of invidious pretext: the fallacious claim that Christian teaching rests solely on the Old Testament Mosaic law, and the argument that if homosexual orientation is inborn, this somehow disproves Christian teachings.

Part II will discuss the persistent effort to delegitimize Christian doctrines on marriage by comparing them to Jim Crow and slavery. Part III will deal with the Christian concept of scandal and the differences between liberty-based and equality-based views of homosexuality. Part IV will return to the legal debate over whether a rational person could find any basis to distinguish opposite-sex from same-sex marriage, and explain quite how far one has to bend reality in order to conclude that none exists. Part V will examine the prospects for a Westphalian peace on these issues.

The High Stakes of the Marriage Debate

Many myths about the Christian view of marriage and the Christian view of homosexuality have become so pervasive that we hardly even notice them, yet it is considered rude or worse to counter (people who will not stop talking about the subject suddenly ask, “Why should you care?” when you respond). As a result, without a vigorous defense, believing Christians in this country face a genuine existential threat: that our culture and legal systems will declare the adherence to core Christian doctrines—unchanged for millennia, directly derived from the words of Jesus and the letters of St. Paul, and in the heartland of the legitimacy of Christ’s teachings—to be outside the bounds of civilized society in the way that the Klu Klux Klan is today.

Believing Christians in this country face a genuine existential threat.

Should faithful followers of the nation’s largest religious denomination, the world’s oldest and largest church, be run out of public life? Should those of us who still believe in the words of Jesus of Nazareth be afraid or ashamed to say so in public?

Make no mistake: these are the stakes, and trying to quietly keep our heads down and stay out of trouble will not long put off the day of reckoning. They are embedded in the legal argument that there is no possible rational basis for ever finding that any distinction at all exists or ever could exist between traditional opposite-sex marriage and same-sex marriage.

A series of judicial decisions have held that nobody who takes the traditional side of this argument could possibly be rational, reasonable, or motivated by anything but bigotry, and the Supreme Court may be on the cusp within the next few weeks of doing the same. The stakes are embedded in the language of debate itself, in which any response to arguments about the equivalence of same-sex relationships to traditional marriage is deemed “homophobia”—literally, a diagnosis that any person professing traditional Christian teachings (or traditional teachings of Judaism or Islam, for that matter) suffers from a phobia, a form of mental illness (a mental defect roughly half of all Americans still share ).

These are not the terms of debate used against reasonable people who can disagree in good faith; they are the terms of delegitimization, designed to brand the opposing argument as unfit to be heard in civil society, and its proponents as people deserving of being driven from full participation in that society.

Lest you consider this to be hyperbole, consider the array of public controversies the past few years that have organized pressure campaigns to treat opponents of same-sex marriage and adherents to traditional Christianity as pariahs:

This is aside from the small, petty battles like refusing to do business with people who oppose same-sex marriage.

Some of these are legal or political questions, and the law has frequently ridden ahead of culture and voters. But all signify a shift in social and cultural sentiment, starting among our social elites—lawyers, academics, entertainers, social scientists—that filters down to young people eager to accept what these authority figures tell them. So, while my prior writing on same-sex marriage has focused on the legal issues and the strictly secular rational basis for drawing a distinction between traditional opposite-sex marriage and same-sex marriage, it is the social, cultural, and religious argument that is central and preliminary to all the others, and that is where I will begin before circling back to law and politics in the second half of this essay.

Any response to arguments about the equivalence of same-sex relationships to traditional marriage is deemed ‘homophobia.’

For conciseness, some generalizations are unavoidable. As a Catholic, I discuss Christianity primarily from the Catholic perspective, but many of the issues facing Catholics are common to other theologically faithful, orthodox Christians, including evangelical Protestants, members of the Greek Orthodox and Russian Orthodox Christian churches, and Mormons, Orthodox Jews and Muslims. Where I discuss the contrary “LGBT” perspective, I am necessarily generalizing about a set of ideas and ideology that is pervasive in political and legal writing on this topic. But by no means do all gay Americans—who are not a monolithic political bloc—adopt the full ideology of the most vocal LGBT activists.

Christians can and should attempt to defuse some of these controversies at the margins, as I suggest in Part V, and are paying the price now for having failed to do so in the past. And the Republican Party, for reasons of its own rational self-interest, must find some way to reach a modus vivendi or détente on these questions, as political parties in our system always do when an issue in the public square turns against them.

But, ultimately, whether peaceful coexistence is possible is not ours to decide. We can only wait and see whether the proponents of same-sex marriage—flush with political power, brimming with unquestioning and judgmental certainty, and in some cases seething with long-nursed grievances—are willing or able to find any stopping point that does not force believing Christians into a choice between renouncing the central truth claims of their faith or being driven from decent society as if they were Klansmen. It is more likely that this will happen if we lack the courage to explain and defend our own beliefs. If we act as if those beliefs are an embarrassment, we only abet their suppression.

Marriage Is Central to Christianity

Let there be no doubt: the teachings (1) defining marriage as between one man and one woman, and (2) against homosexual sex, are so deeply rooted in Christianity that, to tear them out, you would need to destroy the foundations of the Catholic Church and nearly all Protestant and Orthodox churches, and compel them to deny the central claims for the truth and legitimacy of any of their teachings (undoubtedly, for some critics, this is a feature rather than a bug of this whole controversy). If this is a battle to eliminate those two teachings, it can only end with the extermination of Christianity in America. This is not exaggeration, but rather a clear-eyed understanding of the New Testament and the nature of the Church.

There are three primary lines of argument against these two core Christian teachings. All three of them proceed, not from any Christian premise about the truth or falsity of theology, but rather from the view that what the Church teaches cannot be true because of its perceived civil implications. These arguments all—there is no polite way to put this—involve significant amounts of willful ignorance and bad faith; they are unsustainable as theology, and in fact are deeply anti-theology.

God, Man, and Shrimp

The first line of argument made against the Catholic position is what you might call the “God hates shrimp” argument: that Jesus doesn’t say anything about homosexuality, and it is simply a part of the detailed rulebook of Leviticus and Deuteronomy that also has all sorts of rules Christians no longer follow, like the rule against eating shellfish. If you eat shrimp, the argument goes, you must not actually believe in the Bible.

If this is a battle to eliminate those two teachings, it can only end with the extermination of Christianity in America.

Now, first, this is no argument against Orthodox Jews, who actually do still follow the Mosaic Law. Jews may be accustomed to having their religion mocked and maligned, but that does not make it right. From a rigorous Jewish perspective, the rules given to Moses remain in effect just as on the day Moses came down from Mount Sinai. And Leviticus 18:22 & 20:13 are quite explicit in denouncing homosexual sex.

Second, as a matter of Scripture, the “God hates shrimp” meme is factually untrue, and reveals that the people making this argument have no clue what they are talking about. On the one hand, the Old and New Testament’s rules are not of equal weight to Christians, because Christians believe that Jesus fulfilled or superseded (one can have lengthy theological arguments over the precise wording) the old covenant, including the old Mosaic law, and commanded us to follow His teachings.

While that new covenant does not discredit the moral value of the Old Testament laws, it does suggest a reorientation that prioritizes moral teachings over things like dietary rules and rituals that Jesus rather conspicuously broke from in order to illustrate the small-mindedness of rule-obsessed Pharisees. As the Catechism, the Catholic Church’s formal statement of doctrine, explains:

The Old Law is the first stage of revealed Law. Its moral prescriptions are summed up in the Ten Commandments…According to Christian tradition, the Law is holy, spiritual, and good, yet still imperfect. Like a tutor it shows what must be done…However, the Law remains the first stage on the way to the kingdom. It prepares and disposes the chosen people and each Christian for conversion and faith in the Savior God. It provides a teaching which endures for ever, like the Word of God. The Old Law is a preparation for the Gospel….The Law of the Gospel “fulfills,” refines, surpasses, and leads the Old Law to its perfection….The Lord’s Sermon on the Mount, far from abolishing or devaluing the moral prescriptions of the Old Law, releases their hidden potential and has new demands arise from them: it reveals their entire divine and human truth.

If you’re curious, less formal explanations of why Christians do not follow all the Old Testament’s rules, from a variety of Christian sectarian perspectives, can be found here, here, here, and here (these are just Internet samples; on any topic of theology, the best stuff is in books and runs much deeper).

Part of that explanation, which I’ll return to below, is that the Old Law was a set of organizing rules for society under essentially theocratic rule (thus, the Old Law contains penalties—including death!—for various offenses), whereas the New Testament is much less interested in the ordering of society and instead instructs us first and foremost to order our own lives with a view to the next life:

In the Old Testament things like adultery or incest were punishable with civil sanctions like execution. This is because at that time God’s people existed in the form of a nation-state and so all sins had civil penalties. But in the New Testament the people of God are an assembly of churches all over the world, living under many different governments. The church is not a civil government, and so sins are dealt with by exhortation and, at worst, exclusion from membership….Why this change? Under Christ, the gospel is not confined to a single nation—it has been released to go into all cultures and peoples. Once you grant the main premise of the Bible—about the surpassing significance of Christ and his salvation—then all the various parts of the Bible make sense. Because of Christ, the ceremonial law is repealed. Because of Christ the church is no longer a nation-state imposing civil penalties.

The second reason why the “God hates shrimp” shtick is factually incorrect is that the New Testament does, repeatedly, express both the condemnation of homosexual sex and the definition of marriage as exclusively between a man and a woman. The opening chapter of Paul’s letter to the Romans is the most explicit on the former:

The wrath of God is indeed being revealed from heaven against every impiety and wickedness of those who suppress the truth by their wickedness….they have no excuse; for although they knew God they did not accord him glory as God or give him thanks. Instead, they became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless minds were darkened. While claiming to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for the likeness of an image of mortal man…Therefore, God handed them over to degrading passions. Their females exchanged natural relations for unnatural, and the males likewise gave up natural relations with females and burned with lust for one another. Males did shameful things with males and thus received in their own persons the due penalty for their perversity.

Paul returns to this theme again in 1 Corinthians 6:9-20 and 1 Timothy 1:8-11, and while there are a variety of English translations of these and other passages, any serious understanding of them will find Paul (or whoever wrote 1 Timothy) denouncing homosexual sodomy, as the terminology taken from the original Greek includes one word that “was commonly used to refer to young men who were homosexual prostitutes” and another that “literally means A man who has sexual intercourse with a man (arsenokoites). This was the commonly used Greek term to mean a homosexual. You really cannot get any more explicit than this.”

The talking-point that “well, Jesus never said that” should be recognized for what it is: a direct challenge to the authority of Paul and other early church fathers to speak with the authority of divine inspiration, and indeed a challenge to the inclusion of the epistles in the Bible at all. You do not need a lot of familiarity with Christian doctrine to recognize what a truly radical and literally heretical position this is.

‘Their females exchanged natural relations for unnatural, and the males likewise gave up natural relations with females and burned with lust for one another.’

From the Catholic perspective, the idea that only the Gospels can teach Christians is, literally, a renunciation of the Church itself—2,000 years of scholarship and ministry have been predicated upon the idea that the Church takes its authority from Jesus’ “Great Commission” to the apostles, and specifically his grant to Peter of “the authority to absolve sins, to pronounce doctrinal judgements, and to make disciplinary decisions in the Church.” From a Protestant perspective, Martin Luther’s theological basis for breaking with the Catholic Church derives from his reading of the first chapter of Romans—the very chapter that the “God hates shrimp” crowd would read out of the New Testament. You simply cannot tear up and discard Paul’s letters and find anything left standing of Catholic or Protestant theology.

As to marriage, Jesus weighed in quite directly and explicitly on the matter, most directly in the fifth and nineteenth chapters of Matthew’s Gospel. In the Sermon on the Mount, at Matthew 5:27-32, Jesus explains that his law is stricter than the Old Law in matters of marriage, divorce and adultery:

You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I say to you, everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart…It was also said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a bill of divorce.’ But I say to you, whoever divorces his wife (unless the marriage is unlawful) causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.

He elaborates on this teaching at, among other places, Matthew 19:3-12:

Some Pharisees approached him, and tested him, saying, ‘Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause whatever?’ He said in reply, ‘Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator “made them male and female” and said, “For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh”? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, no human being must separate.’ They said to him, ‘Then why did Moses command that the man give the woman a bill of divorce and dismiss [her]?’ He said to them, ‘Because of the hardness of your hearts Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. I say to you, whoever divorces his wife (unless the marriage is unlawful) and marries another commits adultery.’ [His] disciples said to him, ‘If that is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.’ He answered, ‘Not all can accept [this] word, but only those to whom that is granted. Some are incapable of marriage because they were born so; some, because they were made so by others; some, because they have renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this ought to accept it.’ (emphasis added)

Mostly the same passage appears in Mark 10:2-12. Jesus’ definition of marriage as proceeding from our creation as male and female was no oversight. Contrary to what modern readers unfamiliar with history might think, neither homosexual sex nor polygamy nor divorce were unknown in the ancient world. Quite the contrary. Same-sex relations were quite common in ancient Greece and Rome, and it is no accident that the topic came up repeatedly when Paul was writing to Greeks and Romans.

You simply cannot tear up and discard Paul’s letters and find anything left standing of Catholic or Protestant theology.

Polygamy appears often in the Old Testament, and was still common in many places at the time of Jesus. Divorce, as the Pharisees noted, had even been expressly permitted in the Old Law. Jesus, speaking to his own times, often had to explain things in terms that would be understood by the people of the day, but being divine and speaking for the ages, there is no reason to think that it was accident or error that he placed the complementary creation of male and female at the center of his explanation of the divine origin of marriage.

It is, in any possible good-faith reading of the gospel, only a man and a woman of which Jesus speaks when he says, “what God has joined together, no human being must separate.” In a single stroke, his definition excludes same-sex marriage, polygamy, and divorce. While that definition may seem radical in today’s America for reasons different from why it seemed radical then, it cannot possibly be written off as merely an artifact of its times without denying the divinity of its author. If this is the wrong way to describe marriage, then God is wrong and, with him, all of Christianity.

The Hard Road

The second popular argument against the biblical Christian teaching on marriage and homosexual sex is what you might call the “born this way” argument. Put simply, this argument says that homosexual orientation is inborn, inherent, or otherwise not a matter of personal choice, and therefore acting in accordance with that orientation cannot be immoral, because it can’t possibly be immoral to be who you are. There is a surface emotional appeal to this, but it does not withstand even mild scrutiny.

It is fairly clear that, at least for most gay men, homosexual orientation is something that is basically fixed and immune to outside influence by the late teen years.

First, a brief digression. As a scientific matter, we don’t actually know the origins of homosexual orientation—no “gay gene,” for example, has thus far been identified—nor do we know the equally important question (for scientific purposes) of whether homosexual orientation has the same origin in all people. Popular writing on the topic tends to just assume this latter point. For example, it may well be the case that gay men and lesbians come by their orientation in different ways, or at least we should not automatically assume they are identical in the absence of evidence.

Similarly, even within a single gender, the question of single versus multiple causes is an empirical one worthy of study to better our understanding. Without direct knowledge of causation, we can also not know for certain whether it is possible in any case for a man to change his sexual orientation in adulthood. One hopes—although recent history is not encouraging—that all these questions can be examined dispassionately by scientists dedicated solely to enhancing our knowledge, without regard to political agendas.

Absent direct causal evidence, we can only rely on circumstantial evidence. This is not to denigrate the strength of scientific conclusions that can derive from circumstantial evidence. For example, we do not know how smoking causes lung cancer, but the epidemiological evidence of correlation between smoking and lung cancer is so overwhelming that causation can be reliably inferred.

Without delving too far into the science, there are a number of theories about the origins of homosexual orientation—genetic, biochemical in the womb, environmental in childhood—and an ongoing debate over the extent to which they mesh with the available circumstantial evidence. But it is nonetheless fairly clear that, at least for most gay men, homosexual orientation is something that is basically fixed and immune to outside influence by the late teen years. The desire, by that point, is not a matter of choice: the heart wants what it wants, and the body wants what it wants.

This is a compelling argument for treating gays and lesbians with respect and human decency, and accommodating oneself to the reality that gays are not going anywhere and cannot simply be talked out of their heartfelt desires.

At the same time, it ignores reality to argue that no one has a choice between same-sex and opposite-sex relationships. The most recent survey data from the Centers for Disease Control, for example, shows that 2.5 percent of the adult population self-identifies as either gay or bisexual: 1.6 percent gay, 0.7 percent bisexual. As an overall percentage, it is possible that these poll numbers are skewed by some form of underreporting, although it’s the best data we have at present.

In any event, the proportion between the two groups is telling. Nearly a third of the people who self-identify as either gay or bisexual consider themselves bisexual. Whether or not you believe that people are born bisexual, it is ridiculous to suggest that bisexuality offers no choice. If you’re going to accept the monogamy inherent in marriage, you must suppress your attraction either towards the opposite sex or towards your own sex.

It should be sufficient to agree on these two basic points (i.e. that there are both effectively immutable characteristics and behavioral choices at issue) without wading into the swamps of related arguments over “gender identity” or whether children can be said to have a sexual orientation. Regardless of who does have choices, the unyielding reality is that homosexual orientation—in and of itself—is not a matter of choice for a significant number of people.

This is a compelling argument for treating gays and lesbians with respect and human decency, and accommodating oneself to the reality that gays are not going anywhere and cannot simply be talked out of their heartfelt desires. Indeed, the Catechism of the Catholic Church explicitly recognizes this: “The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination…constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided.”

It is also a compelling case, politically, against efforts to criminalize consensual homosexual sex. And it is an argument, within Christian churches, for more understanding of the unique burden carried by homosexual Christians in seeking to be faithful to Christ’s teachings. But none of this is, in any meaningful sense, a theological argument; to derive a principle that endorses homosexual sex from the fact that some people have an inherent and possibly inborn desire for it is the classic appeal-to-nature fallacy that assumes that whatever is natural must be moral.

The foundations of Judeo-Christian morality from the Garden of Eden forward are built on the idea that our natural desires lead us to sin, for which salvation from outside nature is required.

This is irreconcilable with Christian ethics. The foundations of Judeo-Christian morality from the Garden of Eden forward are built on the idea that our natural desires lead us to sin, for which salvation from outside nature is required. In fact, more broadly, the entire project of human morals and ethics assumes that what separates us from animals is our ability to say “no” to our instinctive desires.

The Gospels, and the rest of the New Testament, are shot through with repeated exhortations to not simply give in to the desires of the flesh and to accept that the teachings of Christ would be demanding to follow. Over and over, both Jesus and Paul tell us this, most memorably in this passage from Mark’s gospel:

If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than with two hands to go into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire. And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life crippled than with two feet to be thrown into Gehenna. And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. Better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into Gehenna, where ‘their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.’ (Mark 9:43-48)

These are demanding teachings for all Christians, gay or straight—even more demanding when combined with Jesus’ teaching in Matthew 5:27-32 (quoted above) about lust. The Catechism itself stresses, “Self-mastery is a long and exacting work. One can never consider it acquired once and for all. It presupposes renewed effort at all stages of life.” Jesus explicitly applied these teachings in this context. In the crucial passage on marriage, he concludes:

Not all can accept [this] word, but only those to whom that is granted. Some are incapable of marriage because they were born so; some, because they were made so by others; some, because they have renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this ought to accept it. (Matthew 19:11-12, emphasis added)

In short, to summarize in a nutshell a debate that spans nearly the whole of the Judeo-Christian and Western philosophical traditions, the fact that an individual moral teaching may be difficult to follow can be an argument for leniency and exception in its application, but it has never been an argument for deeming a moral teaching to be invalid, especially—in the Christian context—one that comes to us directly from the words of Jesus or the epistles of Paul. Such a line of reasoning, if followed, would eviscerate the entire concept of Christian moral teaching and replace it with something more like a book of manners.

Broadly speaking, Christians are instructed that sex must be confined to marriage, a longstanding and carefully reasoned interpretation of the Sixth Commandment (against adultery) that hundreds of generations of scholars have reaffirmed and that was reinforced, not superseded, in the gospels and the New Testament. These, too, are hard teachings to follow, and in the real world Christians often fail at them. We should not be surprised that gay Christians fail at them, too, but that should not stop us from calling it failure rather than trying to conform the definition of sin to “only things I never do.”

These are hard teachings to follow, and in the real world Christians often fail at them. That should not stop us from calling it failure rather than trying to conform the definition of sin to ‘only things I never do.’

In explaining why not everything that is inborn is therefore morally acceptable, defenders of conservative moral teaching tend, as moral teachers often have, to resort to argument by analogy. Analogies are drawn to other human tendencies that may be said, more or less, to be inherent, genetic, or otherwise wired into us, ranging from a predisposition to alcoholism, to other forms of sexual preferences, to the rather obviously extreme example of pedophilia. (One could just as easily analogize to positive traits or tendencies that we are born or grow up with, except nobody has moral proscriptions against those, so it’s hard to make a workable analogy out of them).

That brings us to one of the challenges of having a rational debate on these topics, because the response to any argument by analogy is not reasoned rebuttal but, almost invariably, the throwing of an apoplectic fit at the comparison. But the core question of every moral argument remains, whether it upsets you to ask it or not: does, or can, Christianity reasonably ask human beings to meet a higher standard of conduct than simply doing what we desire or are naturally inclined to do? The pedophile example, like analogies to Hitler in philosophical debates about war and politics, is designed to test the limits of this line of reasoning precisely because it is so extreme that almost nobody defends acting on pedophilic tendencies.

As will be discussed in Part III below, the issue of treating sexual orientation as an identity, and denying any distinction between identity and behavior, is a recurring theme in the divide between the LGBT and Christian worldviews. But as a matter of Christian theology, while biology certainly informs our understanding of the world, it does not eliminate the idea of moral limits on human behavior. To be a Christian is to recognize that human beings are called to be more than the sum of our biological impulses. To demand that those impulses be given the central place in our identity is to deem Christianity a dead letter, and set in place the human body itself as our idol.

PART II TOMORROW: Why the Christian view of marriage and sexuality is not at all like the arguments offered in defense of slavery or Jim Crow.

The New York Times Is Confused About Protestant Denominations,"The New York Times published a piece this week headlined “United Church of Christ Approves Divestment to Aid Palestinians.” It begins:

The United Church of Christ, one of the largest Protestant denominations in the United States, overwhelmingly approved a resolution Tuesday calling for divestment from companies that profit from Israel’s occupation or control of Palestinian territories, and a boycott of products from Israeli settlements.

Leaving aside the divestment issue, this is an incorrect statement. The United Church of Christ is not one of the largest Protestant denominations in the United States. Its membership peaked in 1960 at 2.2 million adherents. It slipped under a million members a couple years ago and is now down to only 979,239 members.

That means there are many, many, many Protestant denominations that are larger than the United Church of Christ. Back when it had 80,000 members more than it does now, there were at least 20 Protestant denominations that were larger.

The church has been hemorrhaging members for decades. It’s a personal story for me. My mom left the church in the late 1960s to become confessional Lutheran. The last family member who remained in the UCC escaped (also to become confessional Lutheran) a few years ago. The church takes hardline progressive positions on every issue, paired with lax doctrinal approaches on sacraments and Scripture. The result has been a steady driving away of members. Men, in particular, have fled. Only 38 percent of its members are male.

Why is it, though, that the media treat shrinking and declining progressive church bodies so well while disparaging those larger church bodies that retain their doctrines in the face of pressure? Consider the fluffy coverage generated for the Episcopal Church. This is another church with steep membership declines. In 1966, 3.6 million Americans claimed Episcopalian affiliation. By 2013, the latest year for which numbers are available, membership had dropped to 1.87 million. The Episcopal Church easily has the highest per capita count of media stories of any church body. I have no doubt that as stories celebrate the Episcopal Church following the U.S. government on its marriage doctrine, few stories will convey what this means for continued declines in the church body.

It is fine to cover every little thing the United Church of Christ does or the Episcopal Church does. These are church bodies that weigh in on the doctrines that journalists care the most about: secular politics and libertine sexual ethics.

But when so much ink is spilled on everything from divestment to the wholesale rejection of traditional Christian sexual ethics, it leaves less time and space to cover those many church bodies that have refrained from following the culture down whatever trajectory it’s headed.

Take this graphic developed by Pew, the progressive non-profit that funds its own research projects:

It purports to show a fairly even distribution of churches on the issue of whether to redefine marriage. But note that the denominations in support of redefining marriage include the Quakers, with fewer than a hundred thousand members, and the Unitarian Universalists who (if you include Canadian members) number only 162,000. We previously discussed the UCC. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which doesn’t take a position on the issue, is the largest at 3.86 million.

On the other side, the smallest denomination listed is American Baptist, with 1.3 million members. Southern Baptists have 15.74 million members. The Roman Catholic Church has nearly 70 million American members. The listed religious groups opposed to same-sex marriage are something like 15 times larger in membership counts than those that support it. Does it seem like that represents the actual media coverage on this issue? Or is every progressive step away from Biblical teachings on sex celebrated on front pages and tops of news reports while those that resist pressure to follow the U.S. government or cultural elites are given short shrift?

So no, New York Times, the United Church of Christ wasn’t even that big during its heyday. Now that it’s less than half of what it was then, it’s even less worthy of being called one of the United States’ largest church bodies. If its current rate of decline continues, it won’t even exist in the next few decades.

Given how poorly the New York Times covers religion news, as opposed to the political news progressive churches excel in, I’m not sure I want to see more coverage of the larger church bodies.

Why Women Like ‘Retro Sexism’,"“Know what I’ve been pushed to? What I’m just about ready for? To be married. To be married and to get knocked up, and to say to the contractor, ‘Put the pool in over there.’”—Diana Rutherford, in Philip Roth’s “The Anatomy Lesson.”

You’ll see her perched at a banquette at the bar after work: the millennial college grad nursing that outdated American dream of marriage, kids, and the house with the lawn and the white picket fence… She’s nursing a stiff drink, too, because husband-hunting is hard work these days, not to mention frowned upon in college-educated career-girl circles. She toys with a stray curl and sucks listlessly at (how fitting) an Old Fashioned, or a gin martini (but only one) if she’s out with an older man and wants to seem sophisticated.

She may go full-blown retro and have her hair done in pin curls, or it may be modern, but her lips are likely stained a crimson shade—Bésame’s Red Velvet 1946 as seen in ABC’s “Agent Carter” is a good bet these days. She’s dressed in something fetching and feminine that she got from Etsy, eBay, or one of the dozens of “vintage inspired” or reproduction clothing companies that have gained popularity in the last decade (PinUp Girl, Tatyana Boutique, Stop Staring, Collectif, Trashy Diva, Bettie Page Clothing, Queen of Heartz, Heart of Haute, Voodoo Vixen, ReVamp Vintage…the list goes on.)

Of course she’s seen “Mad Men,” but she will tell you she’s been dressing this way since before January Jones ever graced our television screens in all her manicured and wave-set domestic beauty—that it comes naturally to her, along with her maternal instincts, her culinary prowess, and her 36”-25”-37” measurements (well, those may require a little assistance from an old-school waist cincher, corset, or longline bra.)

However she came by it, our girl’s mid-century aesthetic—not to mention her domestic aspirations—is giving Third-Wave feminists fits.

They call it “retro-sexism,” and they’ve added it to their catalogue of First World Feminist Woes, along with such horrors as the lack of “trigger warnings” before writer Christina Hoff Sommers delivered a speech titled “What’s Right (and Badly Wrong) With Feminism?” at Georgetown University in April; the character Natasha Romanoff in Marvel’s “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” for wishing she could have children; the oppressive nature of George Lucas’s original “Star Wars” series for its exclusion of women and people of color; scientists who sport shirts with lingerie-clad babes and men who decorate their offices with “posters of greased-up women;” stay-at-home-moms who are “killing feminism” and enabling the war on women; the “tyranny” of home-cooked meals; Mark Zuckerberg, for wearing gray shirts; and other frivolous complaints of perceived sexism.

What Is Retro Sexism?

So what exactly is “retro-sexism,” aside from a hotword cooked up to give feminists more things to protest? In a 2010 video series for her website Feminist Frequency, media critic Anita Sarkeesian defined retro-sexism as “modern attitudes and behaviors that mimic or glorify sexist aspects of the past, often in an ironic way.”

Media critic Anita Sarkeesian defined retro-sexism as ‘modern attitudes and behaviors that mimic or glorify sexist aspects of the past, often in an ironic way.’

Professor of Cultural History Judith Williamson appears to have coined the term in 2003, in an Eye Magazine article exploring the phenomenon in the context of advertising. In the piece, titled “Sexism with an Alibi: Supposedly Ironic, Even Kitsch, Ads Still Keep Women in their Place,” Williamson wrote, “Retro-sexism as a social and stylistic phenomenon can be seen across all the media, from ads and fashion spreads to CD covers, where overtly sexist scenarios are couched in period setting and clothing, and/or presented with 60s/70s typography and graphics.”

What began as a critique of the revival of a 1960s-70s aesthetic in advertising has in more recent years evolved into a backlash against young women who sport vintage styles. The popular AMC 1960s period drama “Mad Men” has incited feminist wrath since it hit the airwaves in 2007. In a Ms. magazine piece from a few years ago, titled “Bringing Back Sexism with Style,” Anna Kelner lamented that “Mad Men itself might ascribe to the feminist agenda, but thanks to its pervasive impact on pop culture, the show is crafting a whole new generation of would-be Bettys (Draper’s stylish wife) not Peggys (the show’s ambitious ‘career girl’).” In Salon, Nelle Engoron piled on.

Not only did Kelner of Ms. fault glamorous Betty Draper for encouraging young women to entertain housewifery, but she also took offense at the inherent “oppressiveness” of 1960s chic, for its ability to signal the alleged “subservience” of the housewife: “The wives who tend to their Mad Men are allowed to grow up–but just barely. Stuck in the suburbs and squeezed into polyester garden party dresses, their emotions denied by their husbands and buried in their beehives, these women have to muffle their sovereignty. So when consumers reclaim the look of this past, they also emulate the ‘Classic’ woman-child it exulted–her signature style of repression and subservience.”

‘When consumers reclaim the look of this past, they also emulate the “Classic” woman-child it exulted–her signature style of repression and subservience.’

To wit: if you’re a young woman who raids the local Salvation Army or vintage boutique for the polished, put-together looks you see on period dramas, or you dig the hippie vibes in your parents’ college yearbooks and splurge on Megan Draper-y bohemian maxi dresses or 1970s suede hot pants in the designer vintage listings on Nasty Gal Vintage—which, “retro-sexist” or not, happens to be one of the fastest-growing retailers in the country—well, prepare for some searing feminist snark, because you’re committing the heretical crime of retro-sexism.

Perhaps more troubling, one sees the implication in such critiques that to opt out of the workforce to stay home and raise children, and particularly to do so while sporting stylish vintage threads and well-coifed hair, is an unthinkable fate for the modern college-educated American woman.

The Appeal of Pre-Feminist Apparel in the Postmodern Age

Interestingly, part of what feminists seem to find so objectionable about the pre-feminist look—and part of its allure for millennial women—is its inherent femininity. Clothing in the 1950s-60s era tended to be more fitted and tailored than contemporary clothing, more flattering to the female figure, accentuating women’s breasts, waistlines, and hips.

The quality and construction of garments from that period tend to be superior to those of modern day mass-produced clothing.

In the postmodern age of “everything is relative,” the argument that women in the postwar era had a superior fashion sensibility to their contemporary counterparts probably falls on deaf ears, but, matters of taste aside, it is a fact that the quality and construction of garments from that period tend to be superior to those of modern day mass-produced clothing. How many times have you bought a cheap T-shirt or pair of jeans manufactured in China that starts to fray within a matter of weeks?

Because most women were adept at sewing in the 1950s and 60s, they were able to tailor garments to better fit their individual body shapes, if not sew their own clothing entirely. Office- and evening-wear such as pencil skirts, sweaters, and “wiggle” dresses tended to be form-fitting, and even the iconic full-skirted day dresses that the word “housewife” conjures up were nipped in at the waist. Foundation garments such as girdles and waist-cinchers temporarily narrowed the waist, and brassieres emphasized women’s breasts, creating or amplifying an hourglass figure.

Perhaps not coincidentally, we associate this shape with fertility and childbearing. A study psychologist Devendra Singh began more than 20 years ago determined that men find women most attractive when they have a waist size that is 60 to 70 percent of their hip size. Why? Women with an hourglass figure have more DHA (an omega-3 fat which makes up much of the human brain and is critical to the development of a baby’s growing brain) stored in their body fat. Women with this waist-hip ratio also tend to be smarter and to have smarter children. As mentioned in the study cited above, women with smaller waists also have greater childbearing potential, for a variety of reasons.

The studies’ findings may further explain part of the appeal of bygone fashions:

Even though [Playboy] Playmates are taller than average and have unusually small waists, their figures are not so different from those of young European women today—or young American women of 40 years ago. Back then, half of American women in their late teens had BMIs less than 20, and two in five had a waist-hip ratio of 70 percent or less. Unfortunately, today’s average American woman is 20 pounds heavier than in 1970. Only one young woman in six has a BMI less than 20, and only one in 20 has a waist-hip ratio less than 70 percent.

A greater number of American women in decades past had this “bombshell” figure (think Marilyn Monroe or Jane Russell) with a teeny waist and curves—the type of figure most attractive to men, which nowadays we see mostly on Playboy Playmates. One wonders whether, although American women today are heavier on average, many of us respond to images of women with hourglass figures from the 1950-60s and associate the clothing of that era with those women’s waist-to-hip ratios—especially because the clothing accentuated women’s wasp waists and curves. Perhaps this accounts for an unconscious desire to emulate those women and their dress in a style reminiscent of that era—that is, among women today who wish to be attractive to men, and to marry and have families.

What if dressing like a pinup is less about looking ‘sexy’ than it is a subtle broadcast of a woman’s desire for procreation?

Philip Roth’s novel “The Anatomy Lesson” was published in 1983. Around that time, in 1986, the percentage of women aged 25 to 29 who had never been married was 26.9. Teenaged Diana’s dreams of marriage and pregnancy weren’t unattainable, statistically speaking. By contrast, in 2009, the percentage of unmarried women in the U.S. had climbed to 46.8 percent.

But the majority of millennial women want to be married one day, and to be mothers. Moreover, many women begin to experience biological urges to procreate in young adulthood. A 2011 study found that the “irrepressible, inexplicable urge to make a baby,” also known as “baby fever,” is “a bona fide physical and emotional phenomenon.” Although, according to the study, baby fever affects men as well as women, researchers also found that when asking 80 college students of varying ages “what they desired more — a baby or sex — women usually chose babies and men typically chose sex.” What if dressing like a pinup is less about looking “sexy” than it is a subtle broadcast of a woman’s desire for procreation?

If so, it likely proves doubly offensive to the man-hating, femininity-scorning, rabidly pro-choice contingent of feminism. Look no further than this Amanda Marcotte essay in which she delineates all the reasons she despises babies, or “time-sucking monsters,” as she calls them, and is repulsed by pregnancy. (She’s also likened pregnancy to a “broken leg,” with abortion being “the cast.”) It stands to reason that clothing which emphasizes and evokes femininity and fertility would disgust women with sentiments similar to Marcotte’s.

Fun-policing Feminists vs. Aspiring SAHMs

So if Joan Harris is your style icon, maybe it’s because you want to snag a husband and be a stay-at-home mom (SAHM). If so, have at it—you’ve got science on your side! Maybe, as our radical feminist friends would suggest, it’s because you didn’t take enough women’s studies courses in college to see that you’re propping up the patriarchy with your wardrobe. Or is it just convenient for third-wave feminists to pretend twenty-somethings are too dumb to know “classic woman-child repression” when they’re wearing it, rather than to confront the possibility that some young women consciously choose to adopt a pre-feminist look because they find it an aesthetically pleasing expression of their individuality?

What about the young woman who genuinely finds personal worth and fulfillment not in the cubicle or the corner office, but at home, keeping house and raising children?

Perhaps some of us even get a contrarian kick out of deliberately undermining the man-hating fun-policing that works itself into a tizzy over women who don’t toe the feminist line and screams “sexism” about everything.

Thanks to Betty Friedan, Simone de Beauvoir, the second-wave feminists who came after, and the contemporary cohort of shrilly protesting feminists, we all know that some women suffered great injustices and oppression back in the days of “Mad Men,” what with the stricter gender roles, socially acceptable sexism, constraints for women in the workplace, and the more limited opportunities available to women in general. But some women didn’t. Some women thrived in the role of homemaker.

Perhaps some young women today yearn for some of the elements of that era: for example, (especially for any girl who has had to navigate the aimless wasteland of college campus hookup culture), more structured courtship roles; higher marriage rates; the financial option to stay home with children when many households were able to rely on one spouse’s salary and benefits to support the entire family; the opportunity to pursue meaningful community and volunteer engagements rather than a career track; the prospect of having children at an earlier age without the pressures of simultaneously pursuing a career; and the freedom to pursue such domestic ambitions without fear of societal disapproval or stigmatization.

What about the young woman—like our languorous college grad-turned-career girl lolling around in bars, hoping to meet a man with whom she can build a life and a family—who genuinely finds personal worth and fulfillment not in the cubicle or the corner office, but at home, keeping house and raising children? The millennial counterpart to Philip Roth’s Diana, who at the age of 20 is chomping at the bit “to be married and get knocked up”? Do we imagine those are not the natural inclinations of many women? And why should it be wrong for a woman who fully embraces these inclinations to doll herself up in a fashion that evokes a time when the vocation of homemaking was common and widely accepted—merely because some women were historically unhappy in that role?

Perhaps some of us even get a contrarian kick out of deliberately undermining the man-hating fun-policing that screams ‘sexism’ about everything.

Of course, the idea that any young woman today might have traditional homemaking goals is anathema to the type of feminists who claim that “women were losing their minds pushing mops and strollers all day without a room or a salary of their own” and that “real feminists don’t depend on men. Real feminists earn a living, have money and means of their own.”

Even millennial feminists have trouble squaring the notion that women can enjoy being stay-at-home mothers: “Every time I hear someone say that feminism is about validating every choice a woman makes I have to fight back vomit,” writes Amy Glass at Thought Catalog, in a post titled “I Look Down on Young Women with Husbands and Kids and I’m Not Sorry.”

Do people really think that a stay at home mom is really on equal footing with a woman who works and takes care of herself? There’s no way those two things are the same…Having kids and getting married are considered life milestones. We have baby showers and wedding parties as if it’s a huge accomplishment and cause for celebration to be able to get knocked up or find someone to walk down the aisle with. These aren’t accomplishments, they are actually super easy tasks, literally anyone can do them. They are the most common thing, ever, in the history of the world. They are, by definition, average. And here’s the thing, why on earth are we settling for average? If women can do anything, why are we still content with applauding them for doing nothing?

In truth, plenty of single, childless women would like to be married and have children. A 2014 Huffington Post story, “The Truth About the Childless Life,” featured a series of women in their late thirties or early forties who were single and stricken about the possibility that they might never become mothers. For instance:

Joanna, a single 38-year-old attorney who left the partner track to move into the less demanding (and lower paying) role of legal marketing in order to attract men who did not find her profession competitive with theirs, is frustrated.



‘Here I am, almost 39, and I gave up so much potential in my career and frankly, in my income, just so that the men I dated no longer assumed that because I went to an Ivy League law school, I don’t want to be a mother. Now, not only am I heartbroken that I’m still single and not a mom, I regret taking a major step down in my career. People still call me a so-called ‘career woman’ as if I don’t have to work, and by taking myself off the partner track, I don’t even have a walk-in closet to show for it.’

The Huffington Post piece also noted “the CDC reports that of the 19% of women who remain childless between the ages of 40 and 44, half are childfree by choice. The remaining are unable to have children, by biology and by circumstance.”

Secondly, the popular conceit is that raising children is not “real work” because it doesn’t draw a paycheck, or that a woman who chooses to stay at home and take care of children is lazy or squandering her intellect. Yet what could be more essential, worthwhile, and fruitful than being responsible for your children’s moral, emotional, physical, and intellectual development? Further, the act of raising a child is crucial his or her emotional welfare, and also important for society at large. This is one of the reasons Jennifer Roback Morse, author of “Love and Economics: Why the Laissez-Faire Family Doesn’t Work,” argues that relying completely on outside help (nannies, daycare) to raise one’s children is not in society’s best interest:

Parents spend a lot of time wiping noses and tying shoes. These things might seem to be menial chores that any idiot could do. But as a byproduct of doing these mundane things, the parents convey to the child that he matters to them. He comes to allow them to matter to him as well. The family is the natural and best institution for creating attachment and teaching cooperation.



Of course, there is nothing wrong with hiring some help. But you cannot completely delegate the innumerable tasks that go into raising any particular child…



Parents have a primary responsibility to take care of their children. Completely delegating the care of children to hired help is not exactly an act of force or fraud. It is, however, an extremely negligent act. A free society cannot long survive if large numbers of people choose to discharge their parental duties in this most perfunctory way.

Retro-Sexism as Protest

Our millennial retro-sexist on the hunt for a husband doesn’t let the Amy Glasses and the Ms. magazine feminists get her down. In fact, she’s seized with the troublemaking urge to flaunt her femininity just to wind them up, to gleefully truss herself up in as many trappings of the pre-feminist era as she can afford and loudly proclaim to anyone in earshot: forget the boardroom, she dreams of spending her time in the kitchen and on the playground. Her greatest ambition in life is to be somebody’s wife and a mother. She’s a contrarian, and she has weaponized her appearance to protest the barrage of anti-matrimony, anti-motherhood rhetoric that the grievance feminists churn out.

She has weaponized her appearance to protest the barrage of anti-matrimony, anti-motherhood rhetoric that the grievance feminists churn out.

Such “retro-sexism,” is not, as Engoron assumes, a superficial glorification of bygone sexism, nor as Saarkesian imagines, hipster irony. It’s ideological. It’s an aesthetic and elegant “fuck you” to the strictures of man-hating, housewife-scorning feminism. For the girl who has spent four years on a liberal arts campus suffering through women’s studies classes that stipulate what “feminism” looks like and tout the biological “slavery” of childbearing, à la Shulamith Firestone, our young student all the while knowing that she aspires to get married and be a mother, it’s both liberation and counter-revolution.

It’s also a healthy expression of individuality and sense of self. Not all women want the same things. Grievance feminists’ penchant for vilifying women who deviate from their orthodoxy seems ironically illiberal, particularly given their frequent calls for inclusivity, tolerance, and women’s autonomy. Rather than embrace a woman’s freedom to choose the lifestyle she personally finds most fulfilling, intersectional feminism is bent on curbing her individuality if it does not conform to the movement’s principles. No wonder young female celebrities such as Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, and Lana Del Rey, among others, have all rejected the label of “feminist.”

The phenomenon brings to mind a passage from John Stuart Mill’s classic, “On Liberty”:

But the evil is, that individual spontaneity is hardly recognized by the common modes of thinking, as having any intrinsic worth, or deserving any regard on its own account… The majority, being satisfied with the ways of mankind as they are now…cannot comprehend why those ways should not be good enough for everybody; and what is more, spontaneity forms no part of the ideal of the majority of moral and social reformers, but is rather looked on with jealousy, as a troublesome and perhaps rebellious obstruction to the general acceptance of what these reformers, in their own judgment, think would be best for mankind. (emphasis mine)

So while the radicals wring their hands over Betty Draper and Meghan Trainor, women wearing makeup, get married, and getting pregnant, the millennial retro-sexist dons her best 1960s raw silk cocktail dress, adjusts her garters, and mixes up another Manhattan for her man (she’s snagged a husband by now, natch), while he waits for her to finish cooking dinner.

She does this not because she’s a dull housewife consigned to a lifetime of drudgery, but because she enjoys keeping house, cooking, and taking care of their children. It doesn’t make her “lose her mind”—although her lipstick and old-school seamed stockings might make her husband lose his.

Christian Missions And The Spread Of Democracy,"It has long been evident to me that the most successful societies in the world are former British colonies – the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, and to a lesser extent India and South Africa. I have usually attributed this to the British embrace of capitalism, merit-based civil service, and widespread education.

As long as these nations followed that model they prospered, but when they went off the tracks and experimented with socialism (as India did for a while) or dictatorship (as Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, is still doing) they failed.

Now comes Robert Woodberry of the National University of Singapore to argue that I have missed the point. In 2012, The American Political Science Review published a breathtaking article by him, “The Missionary Roots of Liberal Democracy.” I say breathtaking because of the comprehensive statistical analysis underlying his argument. He doesn’t just correlate missions with democracy, but he accounts for most other plausible explanations and he looks at conditions in Europe, North America, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Oceana, and also considers regional differences within many of these countries.

Protestants: The Unlikely Political Pioneers

What Woodberry finds is that wherever “conversionary Protestant” (CP) missionaries went, they laid the roots for modern democracy. Often, but not always, these were associated with British colonies. There were British colonies that had few missionaries and these areas were not especially well equipped for democracy, but when missionaries went to places untouched by the British, they had the same democratizing effects.

As we have seen with recent efforts in the Middle East, democracy is far more than a matter of elections. There are underlying conditions that must be met before democratization can succeed. Woodberry writes:

“… conversionary Protestants were a crucial catalyst initiating the development and spread of religious liberty, mass education, mass printing, newspapers, voluntary associations, most major colonial reforms, and the codification of legal protections for nonwhites in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These innovations fostered conditions that made stable representative democracy more likely – regardless of whether many people converted to Protestantism.”

The presence of missionaries who respected indigenous people enough to find them worthy of conversion created the right conditions for democracy.

He goes on to explain that fundamental to the beliefs of Protestants is the idea that people should be able to read the Bible for themselves. This was much less true for Catholics prior to the twentieth century. This one factor lead to a number of missionary activities, including helping indigenous people develop a written language (for the first time ever in some cases), printing Bibles and religious tracts in local languages, setting up schools to teach people how to read, and organizing non-governmental (and often non-religious) associations. They also worked to reform abusive colonial governments—especially in the British colonies, where they had more influence.

None of this is to say that all Protestants were kind or enlightened:

“Of course, Protestant economic and political elites were as selfish as anyone else. Protestant slave owners fought slave literacy, and Protestant settlers exploited indigenous people: however when missionaries were financially independent of the state, of slave owners, and of white settlers, missionaries undermined these elite co-religionists in ways that fostered democracy.”

So it wasn’t Protestantism per se that created the right conditions for democracy, but the presence of missionaries who respected indigenous people enough to find them worthy of conversion. Woodberry explains:

“… nonstate missionaries moderated colonial abuses, particularly when abuses undermined conversions and in British colonies (where CPs had greater influence). To reach their religious goals, nonstate missionaries punished abusive colonial officials and counterbalanced white settlers, which fostered the rule of law, encouraged less violent repression of anticolonial political organizations, and facilitated peaceful decolonization.”

As Information Spreads, So Does Democracy

Today we may think of missions as mere footnotes in the historical sweep of economics and ideology, but Woodberry argues that prior to the mid-twentieth century, “missionaries were the main source of information about life in the colonies.” They were well educated and dwarfed the presence of other organizations such as labor unions and NGOs. They had financial resources that were greater than all but the largest commercial banks.

Their interest in printing and distributing Bibles and other religious tracts largely drove the growth of printing throughout the Western world. In the 19th century, for instance, Bible societies were among the largest corporations of any kind. The American Bible Society printed and distributed over one million Bibles between 1829 and 1831, at a time when the total number of households in the United States was only about three million. Woodberry continues:

“CPs printed so many vernacular texts that it forced (indigenous) elites to respond. For example, within 32 years of importing a press to India in 1800, three British missionaries printed more than 212,000 copies of books in 40 languages and, along with other missionaries, created the fonts and paper that dominated South Asian printing for much of the nineteenth century.”

Protestant missions retained a level of independence from colonial rulers that made it possible for them to actively oppose abuses in several important ways.

He notes that the availability of printing itself was not sufficient reason for the creation of mass literacy and newspapers. China, Korea and Japan all had printing hundreds of years before Europe, they had moveable metal type long before the Europeans and thriving mercantile classes, but literacy was largely confined to the elite and newspapers never developed before the arrival of missionaries in the nineteenth century.

Wherever the missionaries went, they started schools for mass education of indigenous people, often against the wishes of white colonizers. They also imported the organizational models and tactics they developed during the movements for abolition, temperance, and other social reforms to third world countries in the 1800s.

Finally, the Protestant missions were mostly not sponsored by the state. This gave them a level of independence from colonial rulers that made it possible for them to actively oppose abuses in several important ways, especially in British colonies. The missions were financed by a broad mass of the faithful back home. These supporters could be mobilized to lobby parliament against abusive colonial governors. The missionaries generally came from reformist traditions back home and could apply those lessons with indigenous people, and the missionaries realized that colonial abuses made religious conversion much harder. As a result, wherever missionaries were most active, the colonial governments were pressed to curtail forced labor, apply similar legal standards to whites and non-whites, and allow the creation of organizations of local people.

All of this – mass printing, literacy, activism, and civic organization – created the conditions, skills and experience for local populations to better run their own affairs and participate in democratic governance independently not only of colonizers but also of the traditional elite in their own countries.

"The Pope Francis Effect: Enthusiasm, But To What End?","Right after the terrorism attacks of September 11, 2001, newspapers and broadcasts were filled with stories about Americans returning to their houses of worship in droves. Evangelical leaders and others claimed that a religious awakening was happening, seen as one positive result of the day of carnage. Maybe there was a tick upward for a week or two, but not only did the terrorism attacks not presage some kind of general spiritual awakening in the United States (at least for Christianity), the trend is actually toward more religious apathy, not less.

We’re now living in something that the media like to refer to as the “Francis Effect.” Like the September 11 Effect, this is about, supposedly, a reinvigoration of church life, particularly for Roman Catholics. Francis has only been in that office for two-and-a-half years but we’re told that he is such a stark contrast to his predecessor Pope Benedict, the media-opposed theologian who led the church for several years, that Roman Catholics are rushing back or finding new enthusiasm for their religious practices. He was supposed to “rescue the church.” What’s intriguing those who study these things, though, is that for all the good feelings reported by Roman Catholics, attendance at Mass is doing anything but rising.

As the New York Times reported recently, Roman Catholics report high enthusiasm for Francis. Some 63 percent have a favorable opinion, nearly as much as John Paul II had in 2002. And a slight majority say the church is in touch with Catholics’ needs, up from 39 percent in 2013. And yet:

But … Francis … has yet to create a shift in the dynamics of attendance and participation. When asked if their attendance at church had changed over the last two years, 13 percent said they were going to Mass more often, but 12 percent said they were going less, and 74 percent said nothing had changed.

One of the best pieces that explores this dichotomy — the genuine enthusiasm but the continued separation from the sacraments themselves — is “Love for Pope Brings Them to the Streets, Not Necessarily to Church,” by Zelda Caldwell in Aleteia. In her piece, agnostics, lapsed Catholics and the super devout talk about why they came to see Francis during his visit to Washington, D.C.:

Coral Keegan, age 24, who lives in Washington, DC but is originally from New York, is a baptised Catholic, but not a regular chuchgoer. She came because, “I like that he’s accepting of gays and lesbians, which the church didn’t do before.”



Does the pope make her want to go to Mass again? “No,” she said, “I don’t think it’s necessary for being a spiritual person.” Lying in the grass next to her, was Jorge Gonzalez, age 27, and originally from Colombia.



“I like how humble he is. He’s taken himself off a high, holy spot, and is showing himself as just a human being.” Raised a Catholic, Gonzalez doesn’t attend church regularly, and says that in spite of his positive feelings about the pope, he probably won’t start.

She talks to one ex-Roman Catholic whose grandmother is still in the church. He says he loves how Francis puts a positive spin on religious stuff. The BuzzFeed “I’m a Christian but I’m not…” approach, as it were. The next guy is agnostic and into Francis’ “celebrity.” The next is “not Catholic” and not even “religious.” A 68-year-old self-defined “lapsed Catholic” explains she likes his politics but probably won’t return to Mass. Only after all this do we meet someone who enjoys Francis and goes to Mass.

It reminded me of an email I got from a dear friend who would probably define himself as a “lapsed Catholic” as well. He wanted me to write more on Francis. He said, “I have nothing to do with any church these days but I try to live by the lessons of my youth, holding on to the basic Christian (Jews and Muslims share same basic theory) to love thy neighbor (or ignore the dumb bastard) and do your best to live in harmony.” He praised Francis for being an inspiration to all and then added, “I am not racing off to Mass just yet, but I don’t have the same angst over the church I once did.”

I responded by telling him to get his butt to church.

Unlike many traditional Christians (I’m confessional Lutheran), I really don’t mind Pope Francis terribly much. His emphasis on mercy and forgiveness is wonderful, in fact. It’s a shame this emphasis is tied in the minds of papal observers to a relaxation of the clear teaching of God’s Law instead of an emphasis of the clear Gospel of Jesus Christ rightly applied. Not just because he’s the head of the Catholic church but also because he’s the one promulgating much of the confusion, Francis is responsible for at least some of that muddled messaging.

Maria Kennedy Shriver said that the Francis Effect was about good feelings. She said priests are no longer feeling like they’re thought of as pedophiles and she is no longer embarrassed to walk into church. All because of Francis being a special kind of man.

One woman put her good feelings in chart form:

Not all the media narratives support this. After one of Francis’ speeches, the Washington Post had a story about how some people who had reported abuse by priests felt his remarks in support of bishops were “a slap in the face.” They wished he’d said more to them on the matter instead of praising the bishops for how they’d handled the crisis.

Still, the general mood, in the media and among various other groups, is far friendlier to the pope and his church than was seen prior to his arrival.

This is real. And in many senses this is good. It is certainly more enjoyable for Catholics than the hostility they were enduring previously, and it is a testament to the good traits of humility and love that Francis shows, even if he is a flawed human being who doesn’t exhibit those traits evenly or all the time.

But the pews

Let’s take a little side-trip to discuss American Protestantism. In “The Lost Soul of American Protestantism,” D. G. Hart examines one aspect of the American history of Protestantism. Right at the beginning he notes that most people view the Protestant church in America as being either mainline left or evangelical right. He argues that these two groups are really just two sides of the same coin. Sure, they may have different ideas about what being a moral person means or what political outcomes they seek, but they’re both emphasizing the earthly over the higher things.

In The Lost Soul of American Protestantism, D. G. Hart examines the historical origins of the idea that faith must be socially useful in order to be valuable. Through specific episodes in Presbyterian, Lutheran, and Reformed history, Hart presents a neglected form of Protestantism, confessionalism, as an alternative to prevailing religious theory. He explains that, unlike evangelical and mainline Protestants who emphasize faith’s role in solving social and personal problems, confessional Protestants locate Christianity’s significance in the creeds, ministry, and rituals of the church. Although critics have accused confessionalism of encouraging social apathy, Hart deftly argues that this form of Protestantism has much to contribute to current discussions on the role of religion in American public life, since confessionalism refuses to confuse the well-being of the nation with that of the church. The history of confessional Protestantism suggests that contrary to the legacy of revivalism, faith may be most vital and influential when less directly relevant to everyday problems, whether personal or social. Clear and engaging, D. G. Hart’s groundbreaking study is essential reading for everyone exploring the intersection of religion and daily life.

He argues that it’s better to contrast these two groups with confessional Protestants — the Lutherans, Presbyterians, Reformed, etc., — who emphasize sanctification, sacraments and the like.

Like pretty much everything else in Christianity, none of the concepts (or the reaction to them from elites!) are new. And you see similar divides in the church of Rome and elsewhere.

But when you look at this Francis Effect — not measurable in pews but in sentimental pieties, emphasis on “tolerance” and, always, always, more and more dialogue, you’d be forgiven if you immediately thought of the Episcopal Church or a similar church body.

It would explain a bit about why the media is so suddenly friendly to a pope, an office it has battled against for many years. As Ross Douthat warned “sometimes the enthusiasm is just a sign that the world thinks that it’s about to succeed in converting you.”

It would also explain the lack of change in actual church participation. To people outside an active church life, that may seem like no big deal. To the traditional Christian, life is centered around gathering the body of believers around Holy Communion and the preaching of God’s Word. It’s how we’re forgiven for our many sins and how we learn how to forgive others. It’s where we receive strengthening of faith. In this regard, attendance at a particular church is a very important measurement of spiritual health.

The Episcopal Church chose over the course of many years to locate its church life in solving social and cultural problems, even if it followed cultural trends from outside the church rather than led the way. The goodness of that approach has been debated at length. The success of the idea might also be up for debate. But in terms of its liberal agenda, it actually has been effective in achieving the changes it sought in society. Others note that the institution, for all the love showered on it by the media, is faltering in terms of having people in it.

It’s hemorrhaged members at rates unseen by most other groups.

Francis Effect, To What End?

So unlike some traditionalists, I’m inclined to agree that the Francis Effect is real and legitimate. And even in many ways good. But to what end is this effect?

Consider, along with the September 11 Effect, the common idea that baby booms are reported 9 months after electrical outages. It’s not true. (See, for example, “Scientific Findings: Post-blackout Baby Boom Really Is A Bust.”)

Of course it’s not true, though! Think about it. Think about a woman’s fertility, and how women are only fertile for a limited time each month. The idea that significant percentages of women would be fertile during the same hours-long power outage, that significant percentages of that group would have a partner, that significant percentages of the couple would have time to have intercourse during the outage, that significant percentages of those male partners would not have insemination problems, and that significant percentages of the couples wouldn’t be taking precautions to prevent conception, that significant percentages of otherwise-minded wouldn’t abort any children conceived during this copulation, and so on and so on.

Not all the time, of course, but many times we have babies simply because we’re having lots and lots of lots of sex and not preventing conception. Not because of a fluke power outage that caused a blip of romance, if it ever did.

In the same vein, think of the Francis Effect. Many Roman Catholics on left and right keep waiting for it to result in numerical or percentage increases in actual reception of the sacraments. It’s only been two-and-a-half years, certainly. But also, it’s been two-and-a-half years! A life of sanctification is not something gained by battling traffic once in your lifetime to see a pope give a few minutes of remarks.

It’s wonderful that some people say that Francis makes them feel the church is more welcoming to them. But if it’s just making people feel more comfortable in their politics, instead of making them feel the comfort of absolution, communion and strengthening of faith, that’s not much to get excited about.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/09/25/the-pope-francis-effect-enthusiasm-but-to-what-end/,2015-09-25
Vive Pope Francis,"I spent seven years as a not-quite-Catholic, so I could write a book on ways to recognize that your future may lie in Roman Catholicism. Here are a few noteworthy entries.

You might be a future Catholic if you constantly find yourself explaining to actual Catholics how their church is way more reasonable than they seem to suppose.

You might be a future Catholic if people wish you a Happy Reformation Day, and you feel sad.

You might be a future Catholic if you solicit your Protestant friends for their theological faves, and deliberately seek out the most laudatory biographies you can find of the church reformers, and still find that the vaunted figures of the Reformation appear in your mind’s eye as small, angry midgets, shaking their fists at the sky.

If this describes you, call your local parish office. You’ve clearly been bitten, and trust me! This bug does not pass in a hurry.

Gold-Standard Spiritual Insurance

Some people spend decades, or even whole lifetimes, as not-quite-Catholics. What finally pushed me into the forbidding, murky waters of the Tiber? Several things, but among them: a need for protection.

Emergency action of some sort was clearly required, because I was in imminent danger of getting squished.

After college, I spent two years in the Peace Corps, which I treated as a kind of extended theological retreat. I read piles of theological literature (sometimes literally by candlelight) in my apartment in Andijan, Uzbekistan. Six whole days after returning to American soil, I raced headlong into an Ivy League graduate program, and found myself surrounded by aggressively secular, highly intelligent atheists. My two-year read-a-thon notwithstanding, I felt like an ant in a grandfather clock. Emergency action of some sort was clearly required, because I was in imminent danger of getting squished.

It was a bracing moment, as though my draft card had just come in the mail. I felt the draw of those glittering ivory towers, and could readily appreciate the benefits of casting aside my anachronistic religious sensibilities for an appealing and highly prestigious career.

Inconveniently, though, I really did believe in hell. So, with my excitement at its lowest possible ebb, I bid farewell to the tide pools of mere Christianity, and got serious about purchasing some real spiritual insurance.

Conversion was one of the loneliest experiences of my life.

I could have quit my graduate program, but that would have been like fleeing to Canada. I could have sought solidarity among the liberal Episcopalians (the only Christian group with a noticeable foothold in my department), but that felt like a childish distraction from the real business at hand. I could have returned to my native Mormonism, and relaxed into the warm, comforting arms of a familiar community. That was unthinkable, because as much as I loved the Mormons, I did not believe.

In my intellectual-and-spiritual foxhole, only gold-standard security seemed adequate. I didn’t need Yelp reviews to tell me where to find it. Looking up local Roman Catholic parishes, I reflected nostalgically on happy days when I would engage in jovial debates with Mormon and Protestant friends, always in the comfortable garb of “the seeker.” Conversion was one of the loneliest experiences of my life.

The Passport Everyone Recognizes

Have you ever found yourself standing at a checkpoint on some strikingly non-Western border, waiting for likely corrupt officials to drag you through their phony baloney “security” routine? I have, a number of times. At such moments, you may feel nothing but love for your Canadian, Irish, and Liechtensteinian comrades, but it still feels great to have an eagle stamped on your passport. Everybody recognizes that eagle. Even the petty, two-bit tyrants of Kyrzbekistan know better than to mess with the bird.

When the chips are down, you start to notice that Protestant denominations are like dust in the wind.

I feel similarly about my Roman citizenship. People can develop their idiosyncratic tastes for Methodist revival meetings or Anglican hymnody, and that’s fine. I have both affection and esteem for my Protestant friends. When the chips are down, though, you start to notice that Protestant denominations are like dust in the wind. How many have we got now—eight million? Even the word “denomination” sounds transitory, like a kind of religion club. Outside of the immediately involved parties, does anyone even care about the disputes that hold particular communities together or drive them apart? I start falling asleep whenever I wade into a piece about the minutiae of contemporary Protestant disputes.

By contrast, everyone is interested in Rome. Virtually all of my Protestant friends have an explanation in their back pocket for why they aren’t Catholic. I cannot recall a single occasion in which I was pressed to explain why I haven’t traded in my Roman citizenship for a place with the Presbyterians.

On the other hand, secular friends (or enemies) have many times demanded to know why I would voluntarily fall in with the biggest and baddest of reactionary faiths, and I take that as a high compliment. Have you noticed in the New Testament how it’s always the devils who are quickest to identify Jesus?

Long Live the Pope!

The pope is the Catholic Church’s main figurehead, so whenever he does something noteworthy (makes a visit, writes an encyclical, dies), lively debate is sure to follow. Right away we can notice something striking: everyone wants to participate, whether or not they are Catholic. Somehow people implicitly recognize the Catholic Church’s business as everyone’s business.

Somehow people implicitly recognize the Catholic Church’s business as everyone’s business.

There is some adulatory coverage, but the bulk of it is either derisive or else sadly crestfallen. Some people are determined to be thrilled with the pope regardless of what he says, simply because he is the pope. Others will be happy only if he delivers the precise message they wish to hear. Those people, inevitably, are disappointed. A third group of people is determined to find fault with anything the pope says, simply because he is the pope.

Let’s cut through the noise. Particular popes come and go, but the pope is awesome for a very simple reason. Without him, we really cannot have one holy, catholic and apostolic church. A ship won’t stay on course without a captain. A military needs a commander in chief. Without a CEO, a company will descend into a lot of squabbling over competing visions and interests.

Catholicism is amazing in a million ways, with rich and fantastically cohesive intellectual, juridical, and liturgical traditions, more than a billion living members, and some of the loveliest art and architecture the world has ever seen. But popes, however you feel about them, are part of that package. A central leadership makes possible a kind of unity that would otherwise be entirely out of reach. That unity, in turn, provides the foundation on which this remarkable tradition, unparalleled in so many ways, has been built.

A central leadership makes possible a kind of unity that would otherwise be entirely out of reach.

Protestants try to protect their own tradition, such as it is, through their three “solas,” but this is a dramatically different arrangement. “Solas” have a reductionist quality to them, which is far less amenable to maintaining a longstanding tradition. Quite obviously, they have been far less successful when it comes to maintaining unity, and they leave Protestants in a more complicated relationship with Christian history, since there really is no one hermeneutical lens that smoothly encompasses their entire narrative from the time of Christ.

Very smart people have of course worked on this problem from a variety of angles. But it remains a challenge, and Protestants who become really absorbed by the issue of Christian unity have a disconcerting habit of jumping ship.

The Office Belittles the Man

Without a pope, the wheels would have come off the Catholic bus 18 or 19 centuries ago. (Cue laugh track! Like any institution could really last that long. Oh, wait.) He isn’t the most important or interesting thing about Catholicism, but he’s a necessary active ingredient.

The papal office has always been bigger than the men who filled it.

Remarkably though, history indicates the pontiff needn’t be good in order to fill his role adequately. Of course, it’s much better if he is good. But the office has always been bigger (sometimes much bigger) than the men who filled it. Some Catholics fail to understand this, and act as though every word the pontiff utters simply must be filled with rich wisdom beyond our ken. This is a mistake.

Many pontiffs really have been great men who dazzled the world with their wisdom and leadership. It’s always worth paying attention, because if you’re looking for spiritual guidance, you’re more likely to get it from the pope than most other living persons. On the other hand, there are clearly no guarantees. Some popes have been remarkable mainly as illustrations of the resiliency of the institution. To quote G.K. Chesterton:

When Christ at a symbolic moment was establishing His great society, He chose for its cornerstone neither the brilliant Paul nor the mystic John, but a shuffler, a snob, a coward – in a word, a man. And upon this rock He has built His Church, and the gates of Hell have not prevailed against it. All the empires and the kingdoms have failed, because of this inherent and continual weakness, that they were founded by strong men and upon strong men. But this one thing, the historic Christian Church, was founded on a weak man, and for that reason it is indestructible. For no chain is stronger than its weakest link.

Chesterton’s analysis may seem disconcerting at first, but in a way, this is a no-lose situation for Catholics. Papal triumphs prove how much the Holy Spirit can do with this unique and remarkable office. Papal failures highlight the remarkable fact that, through two millennia worth of blunders, the church rolls on.

Last Church Standing

In case it’s not obvious, I eventually warmed to life as a Roman Catholic. From a lonely and timid beginning, I moved on to enjoy a landscape that was rich and fertile (in more ways than one), and I can honestly say with John Henry Newman that whatever my difficulties, I have never doubted that initial plunge.

As a Catholic, my liturgical and intellectual life is anchored in something bigger than the Ivy League, the culture wars, and even than that eagle-stamped passport.

As a Catholic, my liturgical and intellectual life is anchored in something bigger than the Ivy League, the culture wars, and even than that eagle-stamped passport. My Vatican flag is flying right now, and it will stay up until the Holy Father is safely home in Rome.

I expect the secular world to stand at attention with rotten fruit in hand, ready to pillory the pope. Protestants, for their parts, are protesters by constitution, so I naturally expect some querulous complaints from their corner whenever Catholic issues are under discussion. Some can be received gratefully as constructive criticism. Others are basically petty, but gentlemen (and -women) should not be too fazed by a bit of heckling from the groundlings. Pope Francis seems like a magnanimous figure, and I’m fairly sure he doesn’t lose sleep over the jeers of American pundits.

If there’s ever a time, though, for urging people to consider the long game, this is it. Popes have made fools of themselves time and again, but that white robe has some pretty amazing staying power. Do you really want to lose sight of that greatness on account of some trivial dispute over carbon dioxide?

Enjoy your denominations, Protestant brethren! I wish you all the best, and I’m grateful and proud to be allies in vitally important cultural and spiritual battles. Nevertheless, I’ll stick with my church.

Actually, I’ll do better than that. In the gathering gloom, more and more people may find themselves, as I once did, feeling cornered and in need of spiritual protection. Friends, we’re keeping the lights on for you. This fortress has stood for 2,000 years, and we can always make room for a few more.

Why Do The Media Keep Helping Nancy Pelosi Avoid Abortion Questions?,"Luke Russert, a journalist with NBC News, tweeted the following yesterday:

A conservative journo asked Pelosi abt what constitutes a baby being alive: Pelosi, “I’m a mother of 5, I think I know more abt this than u”



Luke Russert (@LukeRussert) October 1, 2015

I’m not sure why there was the need to qualify journalist (or “journo”) with conservative, here, but it does highlight the fact that liberal journalists such as Russert seem incapable of asking pro-choice politicians even slightly challenging questions about ending human lives after those human lives have begun.

Asking Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a hardline defender of the practice of killing unborn children even in the latest stages of development in the womb (she calls late-term abortion “sacred ground“), what constitutes a baby being alive is a question any journalist should ask, and not just conservative ones.

Journalists love asking tough questions about abortion … so long as the recipient of those questions is pro-life.

Journalists love asking tough questions about abortion … so long as the recipient of those questions is pro-life. When the politician is pro-choice, they just can’t imagine even the first question you might ask. That’s because, it seems more than safe to say given the last two months of deferential coverage of Planned Parenthood, they are pretty big fans of abortion themselves.

For just one recent example of this, see how the media completely censored an independent report showing that the videos about Planned Parenthood’s human organ trafficking were not deceptively edited. This just weeks after running hundreds of stories on a Planned Parenthood-commissioned report from a Democratic opposition research firm saying otherwise.

In any case, deflecting the question about what constitutes a baby being alive with a statement about how many children she has should not be treated as totes awesome, y’all, as Russert and other journalists did. It should result in follow-up questions from other reporters who should treat abortion as a serious policy issue requiring tough questioning.

Or note this triumphant tweet from The Hill:

WATCH: Pelosi shuts down reporter on abortion: ""I know more about this subject than you"" http://t.co/gI8iX8j68z pic.twitter.com/NttjIlBMhRThe Hill (@thehill) October 2, 2015

By “shuts down” they mean, of course, “could not answer.”

From this exchange, the Washington Post wrung a piece headlined:

I screencapped it so that if they develop any shame and change it, like they did this piece of pro-Planned Parenthood puffery by Amber Phillips, we’ll have a record. Oh look at that! The URL tells the story of the original headline, but they did, in fact, change the headline, however many hours later. Now it says “Nancy Pelosi shut down a reporter’s abortion question in a press conference.”

This piece, by Kelsey Snell, seems to view asking reasonable questions of pro-choice politicians as something that journalists should not do.

Snell doesn’t know enough to tell us the name of the journalist asking the question, but she does, somehow, know that he or she is an “abortion protester.” Except, as the correction to her piece now admits, she didn’t know the reporter was an abortion protester. He wasn’t. She just assumed, I guess, since all the journalists in the mainstream outlets are so supportive of abortion and wouldn’t dare ask a question that casts even a moment of skepticism on the practice, that he must be a “protester.” The original story began:

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was not interested in entertaining questions Thursday from an anti-abortion protester who shouted a question to the California Democrat during her weekly press conference. The brief exchange came as Pelosi answered questions about a long-term budget and spending bill. The protester sat in the first row of the presser and spoke up over several other reporters vying to ask a question of the Democratic leader. It was unclear who the questioner was and for which news organization they worked.

“Protester?”

“Shouted?”

Simmer down, Snell. Asking tough questions and being tenacious is called journalism. And the reporter, Sam Dorman of CNS, was credentialed and was asking completely on-point and important questions about the most important human rights issue in the country. See, reporters haven’t been covering the story, but Planned Parenthood has been shown — repeatedly — to believe that the human lives they end have monetary value in the form of the body parts that can be gleaned from abortions. And Planned Parenthood, which is not only a massive supporter of the Democratic Party, is a recipient of $500 million in taxpayer funds annually. Just because many in the media love Planned Parenthood and love abortion with a passion that is truly intense doesn’t mean that they should completely lose all journalistic credibility in devotion of same.

The reporter asked:

“In reference to funding for Planned Parenthood: Is an unborn baby with a human heart and a human liver a human being?”

How can the humanity of the organs be so obvious and repeatedly affirmed by Planned Parenthood officials but the humanity of the life that was ended to get them be in question?

See, throughout those videos that the media refuse to cover, Planned Parenthood officials talk about the human hearts and the human livers that are so valuable to the purchasers of said organs. So an unborn baby (say “fetus,” a Latin word we use, if that helps you work through this question) has a human heart and a human liver, is it a human being?

How can the humanity of the organs be so obvious and repeatedly affirmed by Planned Parenthood officials but the humanity of the life that was ended to get them be in question?

That’s kind of the entire point of these Planned Parenthood videos. It’s actually a really good question, albeit one well beyond a press corps obsessed with not covering the videos.

Pelosi said, “Why don’t you take your ideological questions–I don’t, I don’t have—.” And then she offered the testimony about being a mother (Hey! So am I! And it’s awesome! It also has absolutely nothing to do with the reporter’s question!).

She finally said, “And I do not intend to respond to your questions, which have no basis in what public policy is that we do here.”

Yes, everyone knows that the question of whether we should help subsidize Planned Parenthood while it ends 330,000 human lives after they’ve begun, followed by chopping up those bodies for parts for sale, has “no basis” in the “public policy” we do here. Nosiree. Oh wait. The opposite.

The question is, though, why do reporters think they need to be so supportive of Pelosi avoiding answering these questions?

But why do reporters think they need to be so supportive of Pelosi avoiding answering these questions?

I linked above to a report of Pelosi saying that late-term abortion is “sacred ground.” Nevermind that Pelosi’s support of abortion all the way to the birth canal is a very radical position outside of the Democratic Party and American newsrooms. Late-term abortion is deeply unpopular in this country and mostly unheard of in the rest of the civilized world.

She gave that answer when a reporter asked her to explain the moral difference between what Kermit Gosnell did to babies born alive vs. aborting those same infants moments before birth.

But the most fascinating part of the exchange with the reporter and Pelosi is how reporters erupted in laughter at her first deflection. Here’s video confirmation of what I’m talking about:

Around 40 seconds into the video, you hear reporters erupt with laughter in support of Pelosi. I’m sure it will shock you to learn that Jeremy Peters of the New York Times, who covers politics in the Washington bureau of the news paper, is one of the ones guffawing. It will shock you even more to learn that Russert was another one of the liberal bro journalists to bust a gut.

Why in the h-e-double-hockey-sticks should a “reporter” be laughing at Pelosi’s attempt to skirt a tough question about abortion?

That’s simply not journalism. Neither is Russert’s supportive tweet mentioning Pelosi’s standard statement when asked tough questions about abortion (“I’m the best Catholic in the world and I had babies. No follow-ups.”). Neither is Snell’s denigration of the reporter as an “abortion protester.”

If you can’t think of about 25 follow-up questions to one of the most powerful pro-choice politicians in the country when she repeats her line about her religion and uterus for the hundredth time, you are a bad journalist.

Stop your laughing. Stop your stupid praise-tweets. Stop your erroneous stories that allow politicians on only one side of the aisle to get away with avoiding tough questions.

This Mizzou Media Professor Wants To Ban Media Coverage,"After desperately trying to gin up media coverage of student protests at the University of Missouri, one of the school’s media professors is now furiously trying to “muscle” the press off campus to prevent them from covering student protests that rapidly spiraled out of control Monday.

Mizzou president Timothy Wolfe announced his resignation on Monday after members of the school’s 4-5 football team announced they would boycott team activities unless the school acceded to certain demands surrounding racial equality. Unsurprisingly, Wolfe’s resignation did little to quell the mob.

On Monday afternoon, activists who had demanded Wolfe’s resignation abruptly demanded that media stop covering their activities on the public campus of the taxpayer-funded university. At the center of those demands was Melissa Click, an assistant professor of mass media within Mizzou’s communications department.

In the video below, you can see Click ask for “muscle” to help her bully a Mizzou student into not covering the ongoing mob protests:

“You need to get out, you need to get out,” Melissa Click demanded of the person filming the protest. “You need to get out,” she continued before trying to grab the camera out of the videographer’s hands.

“I actually don’t,” the journalist told Click.

“Hey, who wants to help me get this reporter out of here,” the media professor then hysterically exclaimed to the assembled mob. “I need some muscle over here!”

According to her bio on the University of Missouri website, Melissa Click specializes in “audience studies, theories of gender and sexuality, and media literacy”:

Her research interests center on popular culture texts and audiences, particularly texts and audiences disdained in mainstream culture. Her work in this area is guided by audience studies, theories of gender and sexuality, and media literacy. Current research projects involve 50 Shades of Grey readers, the impact of social media in fans’ relationship with Lady Gaga, masculinity and male fans, messages about class and food in reality television programming, and messages about work in children’s television programs.

Click’s dissertation for her Ph.D. from the University of Massachusetts Amherst was about the “commodification of femininity, affluence and whiteness in the Martha Stewart phenomenon,” according to her CV. You can read the full dissertation here.

Before today, Click had furiously tried to gin up coverage of the Mizzou protests. On Saturday, Melissa Click posted on Facebook a request for national media coverage of the Mizzou grievances:

@JoeWalljasper @CaitlinSwieca yet a couple days ago she was courting the media… pic.twitter.com/8uZsQQfv2k



Kevin Hardy (@kevinmhardy) November 10, 2015

The interactions captured in the full video prior to Melissa Click’s anti-journalist interventions were no less Orwellian.

“You need to back up if you’re with the media!” a voice in the background yelled to the journalists trying to document the protest. “You need to respect the students! Back up!”

“I am a student,” Tim Tai, a student photographer trying to cover the protest, responded.

After Tai protested that the crowd was trying to push him, several people in the crowd laughed, tried to cover the camera with their hands, and responded, “Okay, then we’ll just block you.”

“You don’t have a right to take our photos,” one of the protesters asserted, apparently unaware that he was on taxpayer-funded public property that is by law open to the press.

Later in the video, the crowd aggressively started pushing the reporter around in an attempt to get him to stop covering their behavior.

“They have an education to get and a life to live,” a woman identified as Janna Basler, the assistant director of Greek Life & Leadership at the university, yelled at the photographer.

“I’m trying to document this for history,” Tai, the photographer, told the crowd.

“Everybody else has documented it,” Basler declared. “You gotta go.”

“You are infringing on what they need right now, which is to be alone,” Basler, a taxpayer-funded university employee, said of the assembled crowd. Basler did not elaborate on how participation in a large, anti-speech mob was consistent with needing to be alone.

At some point on Monday, Melissa Click locked her Twitter account to prevent the public from viewing any of her tweets. In 2013, she published a paper on the use of social media in pop culture. She has not published any peer-reviewed research since then, according to her resume.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/11/09/meet-the-mizzou-media-professor-whos-trying-to-ban-media-coverage/,2015-11-09
5 Classic Sports Moments Progressified For Today’s Campuses,"The University of Missouri football team scored its first victory in five weeks on Tuesday, forcing the resignation of university President Tim Wolfe in a protest over what’s been described as his inability to control the negative racial climate on campus. Although the movement garnered national attention and consumed two other faculty members in the process, it was hardly the only protest on a campus this week.

I have to admit, as I was watched Thursday’s Million Student March demand college loan forgiveness, it appealed to the guy in me who a worked a few awful gigs to finance an associate’s degree at Nassau Community College. Relax, ladies.

But then it dawned on me that if I didn’t foot my college bill somebody else would have to, at which point I got perplexed and ventured to a “safe space,” which for me is the world of sports. The sports fan in me assesses this week’s protest-palooza and can’t help but wonder what it would be like if some of the classic sports moments that have left such an indelible mark on our culture took place on today’s college campuses.

Could they? If so, would any of the outcomes change? The short answer is yes, and sometimes that’s not a bad thing (if you happen to be a Cubs fan).

Ladies, gentlemen, and anything else you may identify as, it is my proud honor to present to you five classic sports moments, if they had happened on today’s college campuses.

5. Bill Buckner’s Missed Ground Ball

On October 25, 1986, Bill Buckner missed a routine ground ball that cost the Red Sox game six of a World Series they ultimately lost in seven games. Buckner was vilified in Boston to the point that he had offers from the witness protection program, and the level of vitriol still resonated some 25 years later when Larry David did a “Curb Your Enthusiasm” episode about living as Buckner.

The next thing you know he’s starring in a viral video in which he fields grounders hit by Ellen DeGeneres.

If it happened today: Buckner is booed off the field, as per usual, but within minutes, a group of students who’ve never played sports, let alone lost their mortgage for an error by a guy getting paid millions to catch, begin a Twitter hashtag that champions Buckner as a hero just for trying. Upworthy posts an article about it, titled, “Aging First Baseman Blows World Series, What Happens Next Will Melt Your Heart,” and the next thing you know he’s starring in a viral video in which he fields grounders hit by Ellen DeGeneres.

Eighty thousand students sign a Change.org petition to get the Red Sox a World Series trophy just like the Mets, but it loses steam after someone gets offended by a joke Buckner told on his new Web series, co-hosted with Zack Galifinakis, called “Between Two Legs.”

Side note: a whole generation of Little League kids no longer feels pressured to keep their heads down when fielding a grounder, and U.S. baseball goes into a tailspin that lasts to this very day.

4. Lou Gehrig’s Goodbye Speech

On July 4, 1939, Lou Gehrig gave the most iconic speech in baseball history when he stood at home plate at Yankee Stadium and confirmed that he’d been diagnosed with a disease for which there was no known cure. The high-water mark of this is the sound bite, “Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.”

If it happened on Gehrig’s modern-day Columbia campus, he would get cut off halfway through by a group of feminists who accuse him of mansplaining his disease. We never do hear the money quote, and instead of 80,000 men crying because they feel sorry for him, we cry out of jealousy because he gets to die and leave this semantic cesspool behind.

3. Christian Laettner’s Famous Basket

On March 28, 1992, Christian Laettner of the Duke Blue Devils hit the most famous shot in college and arguably basketball history, a turnaround jumper as time expired that sent Duke past Kentucky in the Eastern Regional final.

Almost as shocking as Laettner hitting the shot was him attempting it, given that to do so he had to catch a full-court, inbounds pass from Grant Hill and get it off in less than 2.1 seconds. But attempt it he did, and what followed became so iconic it inspired an ESPN 30 for 30 called “I Hate Christian Laettner.”

Duke would be pressured to keep him off the court, lest they send the message that winning means more than feelings.

To give you an idea of just how grim it was, modern oddsmakers put Duke’s chances of winning at 1 in a Santorum. The odds of him being in the game today are even greater, because he was known far and wide as a bully or, as it was called back then, a fiery competitor who demanded the most of his teammates and often yelled at people to motivate them.

Laettner’s verbal excoriations of his teammates became the stuff of legend on campus, and if you don’t believe me, ask Bobby Hurley’s shrink. Nowadays, he’d be one cell-phone video away from becoming our social media villain of the week, and Duke would be pressured to keep him off the court, lest they send the message that winning means more than feelings.

There’d be 10,000 students holding up signs outside the arena that said, “I’m Bobby Hurley” and inside the arena, with no Laettner to carry them, Duke would lose that Eastern Regional to Kentucky, 98-72, despite the heroic efforts of Hurley, whom Oprah would hug when he fouls out of the game and eventually get invited to the White House for giving his all in the face of adversity.

Even if Laettner did make it into this game, he’d certainly be banned from the ensuing championship game because, during overtime, he accidentally stepped on the throat of a black Kentucky player named Aminu Timberlake. Are you gonna tell me people wouldn’t be interrupting Bernie Sanders rallies over that?

If this one pissed you off, here’s a Duke-themed drinking game to cheer you up: Try to type “Krzyzewski” into your phone and do a shot every time you get auto-corrected. But be sure to have some chalk handy to outline the corpses.

2. Steve Bartmann Ruins the Cubs’ Chances

On October 14, 2003, during the sixth game of a National League Championship series the Cubs were leading, a fan named Steve Bartmann reached over the wall to catch a foul ball and deflected it away from Cubs outfielder Moises Alou. The Cubs went on to lose the game and the series, and Bartmann became the most hated man in the history of Chicago. Consider this as proof that sports fans can get a little irrational, given that Bartmann didn’t start the Chicago fire and isn’t Rahm Emanuel.

Of course, on today’s campuses, Bartmann wouldn’t have been sitting in the front row, because cries of white privilege would have driven him to the upper deck. Instead, he would be replaced by a minority student who was on a hunger strike to protest Cubs fans blaming their misfortunes on a billy goat. Instead of reaching for the foul ball, the fan would have held up a sign that reads “Stop Goat Shaming.”

Alou would go on to catch the ball, but alas, the Cubs would get swept in the World Series, because, to quote Mother Teresa’s autobiography, “Singers sing, painters paint, and the f#@king Cubs always choke.”

Some of you are like, “Hey, he’s making stuff up! What is this, Politico?”

1. Doug Williams Becomes First Black Quarterback to Win a Super Bowl

On January 31, 1988, the Washington Redskins trounced the Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl, 42-10. Blowouts were a thing that year. For further reading, see Dukakis, Michael.

If you ask most scholars, the most offensive part of the Redskins name is the word ‘Washington.’

If you ask most scholars, the most offensive part of the Redskins name is the word “Washington,” but Native Americans weren’t the story that day. The big news was that Doug Williams became the first black quarterback to win a Super Bowl, a record that stood until Russell Wilson did it with the Seahawks in Super Bowl 48. (You might argue that Wilson should have two titles, but I’m gonna hand off to Pete Carroll on that one.)

Even with a black quarterback on the verge of making history, there’s no way this game could take place on a college campus today, and maybe that’s a good thing.

Within minutes of the Redskins winning the National Football Conference title game, the Twitter slactivists would have Roger Goodell on the wrong end of 2 billion “Dances With Wolves” memes, most of which they’d steal and re-post without attribution. Facebook would have a button that allowed you to change your profile picture to a Redskins logo in a no-smoking sign. Macklemore would bang out a Grammy-winning tune called “Same Tee-Pee,” and every college football team in the nation would boycott classes over the game, as opposed to the usual reasons college football players skip classes.

Ultimately, the National Football League would be forced to shoot a public awareness ad that showed its concern for Native Americans. The ad, coupled with a charitable donation to Native American causes, would buy the league enough support to go on with the game, albeit at a different location, at which point the increased attention would drive up ratings, and the NFL would double their ad sales and re-coup their donations ten-fold.

College kids would feel empowered because they effected “change” and they’d move on to their new quest for self-righteousness, despite the fact that absolutely nothing was done to improve the physical plight of the Native American.

Consequently, the phrase “Trail of Tears” would remain in our vernacular, albeit as a description of the walk to the car after another Missouri football loss.

Protests Show Millennials Don't Get The Concept Of 'Home',"The recent student protests at Yale University and the University of Missouri, sparked by accusations of racial insensitivity and indifference to it on the part of administrators, have been remarkable for their open hostility toward school faculty, the press, and the First Amendment. But they’ve also revealed a paradoxical understanding of the idea of “home” that’s consistent with larger demographic trends among millennials.

We know that millennials are waiting longer to move out of their parents’ homes (including the so-called “boomerang effect” of college grads moving back in with mom and dad), get married, start their own families, and buy their first homes. A recent Los Angeles Times story begins with the observation, “Young women are living with their parents or relatives at a rate not seen since 1940 as more millennial women put off marriage, attend college and face high living expenses.”

Clearly, millennials have a different relationship to home than previous generations. On one hand, they don’t want to leave it. On the other, as the protests have shown, they want to be free from the strictures that come with living under another’s roof. That is, they want to be in charge. Perhaps this is their parents’ fault, as Kevin Williamson suggests at National Revew Online, or maybe blame lies more broadly with endemic campus progressivism and what Ben Domenech calls the rise of “Reset Culture.”

Home Means Never Being Offended

Whatever the cause, somewhere along the way a swath of young people, many of them now enrolled at schools as varied as Yale and Mizzou, got the idea that you could be a full-fledged American adult while also demanding shelter from the tumult of adult life in America. These students do not want to feel uncomfortable or offended in any way, and they want their school administrators to guarantee this. This is what “home” means to them.

Everyone has by now seen the video of the young woman screaming at the professor-in-residence at Yale for disagreeing with her about his role as master of the college. His job is “to create a place of comfort and home for the students,” she shrieks. “It is not about creating an intellectual space! It is not! Do you understand that? It’s about creating a home here. You are not doing that!”



The blow-up was sparked by an email the professor’s wife, a Yale lecturer, had written about how students shouldn’t get too worked up about culturally insensitive Halloween costumes. It was a response to a memo from Yale’s Intercultural Affairs Council urging students not to wear cultural Halloween costumes that might offend some students. The professor’s wife had the temerity to suggest that maybe students should work out their differences about Halloween costumes on their own, which is precisely what the students did not want to hear. They wanted the school authorities to intervene.

Where ‘Safe Places’ Aren’t

At Mizzou, students had a similar sentiment: “We have asked the University to create spaces of healing and it failed to do so.” So they set up their own “safe space”— then proceeded to physically force student reporters out of the area. Outsiders are left to wonder exactly what they mean by “safe space,” since it’s obviously not safe for everyone. They seem rather to want a space that is entirely under their control, where nothing happens without their say-so. That their chosen space happens to be a university is of no importance. As one Yalie put it, “I don’t want to debate. I want to talk about my pain.”

What these students are couching in the language of tolerance and cultural sensitivity is in fact an attempt to exert control over people’s behavior by means of institutional oversight.

But they also want the school to facilitate them talking about their pain. The demands of protestors are telling on this point. At Claremont McKenna College, the latest campus to get hit with student protests, students demanded, among many other things, that the school create “institutional positions that serve students of marginalized identities and their unique backgrounds and personal experiences.” Much like Mizzou protesters, they also demanded greater racial diversity among faculty and staff, more administrative resource for minority students, and “mandatory and periodic racial sensitivity trainings for all professors.”

What these students are couching in the language of tolerance and cultural sensitivity is in fact an attempt to exert control over people’s behavior by means of institutional oversight. They point to “microagressions” in the classroom, a lack of administrative support for minority students, a failure to provide “safe spaces” or a “home” for students who feel marginalized—all of it proof, in their minds, of rampant “systematic racism” on America’s college campuses, even though it remains unclear whether some of the inciting racist incidents actually took place.

Forgotten in all this is that the entire purpose of college is to create an intellectual environment where students can sharpen their minds together outside the classroom in casual settings—often by debating one another. The college campus and residences are where young people are supposed to be trying out arguments and ideas on one another, learning how to think and debate and disagree—respectfully but also passionately and, because they are young, experimentally.

You try out an idea or argument, perhaps get bested by a peer, adjust, and come back the next day and try another approach. That process isn’t always comfortable and doesn’t always make you feel secure and cozy. It isn’t supposed to. Intellectual sparring is sometimes unpleasant, but more often it’s exhilarating and enlightening. More importantly, it’s an indispensable part of becoming an educated person, which used to be why people bothered to go to college in the first place.

Turning Life Into a Campus

That so many schools are caving to the demands of student protesters is a serious problem. Eventually, these students will graduate and be confronted by a world devoid of administrators to protect them from offensive speech.

The developers ‘are hiring a “social engineer” who will facilitate group events and maintain harmony among roommates.’

It’s no wonder, then, that millennials are seeking out “homes” that offer some form of institutional oversight. Consider the emerging housing model of dorms for grown-ups. One project, a developer in Syracuse building something called Commonspace, was profiled recently in The Atlantic. Residents lease a 300-square-foot microunit with a tiny kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. These units surround a common areas with a large kitchen, game room, and TV room. To complete the dorm experience, the developers “are hiring a ‘social engineer’ who will facilitate group events and maintain harmony among roommates.”

Thus has the role of coddling university administrator been exported, along with the notion that you can enjoy the benefits of community without putting up with the discomforts of it. These microunits are apparently soundproof, and “while the building might be designed for social activity, the actual apartments are built for introverts who want privacy. And of course, the social engineer is there to moderate disputes and kick out anybody who misbehaves.” Of course.

This trend is growing, with similar co-living spaces in New York, Boston, and elsewhere. Perhaps it makes sense for some people, but it’s no surprise that such arrangements would appeal to millennials who’ve spent their entire lives in carefully controlled environments.

The danger in expecting college to be a “safe place” where you don’t have to hear ideas you find offensive or ever engage in uncomfortable intellectual debate, and where there’s always an administrator to look out for your emotional well-being, is that you might come out expecting the world to be that way, too. Once you’re out here with the rest of us, you’ll look not to your erstwhile college administrators for protection from speech and ideas you don’t like, but to the government.

Paris Attacks Reveal U.S. Campus Protesters’ Utter Delusion,"In the wake of the terrorist attacks Friday night in Paris that left 129 dead and hundreds wounded, we can safely say the U.S. student protesters’ 15 minutes of fame are over. The protests, which began at the University of Missouri and Yale and quickly spread to other schools drawing national media coverage, were always quixotic, seemingly conjured out of thin air.

Vague accusations that minority students are systematically oppressed carried demands for “safe spaces” and an end to “microaggressions,” as if American college campuses today are enclaves of the Jim Crow South. Throw in calls for student debt forgiveness, free tuition, and a $15-an-hour minimum wage for all college employees, and you more or less had a series of Bernie Sanders rallies on campuses from California to Massachusetts.

The Paris attacks, perpetrated by a violent global movement animated by a fanatical interpretation of Islam, have unmasked these students’ claims for what they are: the narcissistic phantoms of a coddled and privileged generation. Oppression and bigotry are real, but you won’t find much of it on our college campuses.

We’re So Oppressed By Frou Frou Facilities

Consider elite Amherst College. A group calling itself Amherst Uprising last week issued a statement and list of demands to address “the legacy of oppression on campus,” which has made students and faculty alike “victims of several injustices including but not limited to our institutional legacy of white supremacy, colonialism, anti-black racism,” and so on. Apparently minorities at Amherst, where tuition costs more than $63,700 a year, are suffering terribly under this historical yoke, and they demand redress.

The supposed oppression of minority students from Amherst to Mizzou appears to be for the most part nonexistent.

Further down their list of demands is a frank rejection of the First Amendment: the college president must issue a statement condemning those who put up posters that proclaimed “All Lives Matter” and “in memoriam of the true victim of the Missouri Protests: Free Speech.” These were deemed “racially insensitive” to minority students on campus, “who are victim to racial harassment and death threats.” In turn of phrase worthy of the Cultural Revolution, those responsible for the offensive posters must be “required to attend extensive training for racial and cultural competency.”

But are minority students at Amherst and other schools really victims of “racial harassment and death threats”? So far, most of the protesters’ claims of discrimination have been unsubstantiated or, in the case of the infamous poop swastika at Mizzou, not at all what it first appeared to be. (In an ironic twist, an Amherst faculty member associated with the Black Lives Matter movement issued death threats on social media against a local city council candidate in August, which police took seriously but the college defended as the exercise of free speech.)

In reality, the supposed oppression of minority students from Amherst to Mizzou appears to be for the most part nonexistent—at best aspirational. But little wonder that if you’re taught to see racial injustice everywhere, you’ll find it anywhere: rumors of black students being turned away from a Halloween frat party, an innocuous reference to fitting the “CMC mold” (for which Claremont McKenna College’s dean of students was forced to resign), or some yokel driving by flying a Confederate flag. Such is the weight of “systematic oppression” on American college campuses today.

Let’s Talk About Real Aggression

Compare these microaggressions to the macroaggression unleashed on unsuspecting Parisians. For the terrorists who slaughtered concertgoers and bombed the soccer stadium, bigotry and hatred and oppression are not theoretical playthings but vital parts of a demented religious creed.

College students willing to shut down their schools and demand resignations over Halloween costumes and rumors of racial insensitivity can’t even distinguish between microaggressions and terrorism.

Issuing a statement of its own in the wake of the attacks, ISIS claimed responsibility, calling the 89 people killed at the Bataclan theatre “apostates [who] had gathered in a profligate prostitution party.” Of the terrorists, ISIS boasted, “Allah conquered through their hands and cast in the hearts of the Crusaders horror in the middle of their land.” The attacks were a retaliation for France’s role in “the Crusader campaign” in Syria, and “the first of the storm and a warning to those who wish to learn.”

College students willing to shut down their schools and demand resignations over Halloween costumes and rumors of racial insensitivity are unable to recognize the face of true bigotry. They can’t even distinguish between microaggressions and terrorism. A surprisingly large number of Black Lives Matter activists took to social media over the weekend to complain either that the carnage on Paris would steal their media spotlight or that Mizzou and Paris were equivalent. Said one typical post: “Look at all the racists on Twitter using the Paris tragedy to discredit the Black Lives Matter movement at home.”

It’s no surprise, then, that many college students can’t even bring themselves to honor the victims of terrorism. Three days before the Paris attacks, the undergraduate student government at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities rejected a resolution calling for a campus-wide moment of recognition on future anniversaries of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

“The passing of this resolution might make a space that is unsafe for students on campus even more unsafe,” said David Algadi, the university’s director of Diversity and Inclusion. “Islamophobia and racism fueled through that are alive and well.”

The students and sympathetic college administrators behind the protests, like many in the media, will no doubt conclude—as many of them already have—that the greatest thing we have to fear in the wake of the attacks is Islamophobia. The same delusion that makes them see racism and oppression everywhere also induces a fear of a backlash against Muslims that never comes.

The protesters are correct in exactly one sense: hatred and bigotry and violent oppression are alive and well in the world. But you won’t find much evidence of it on America’s college campuses. For those with eyes to see, you don’t have to look any further than the streets of Paris.

"Campus Protesters To Media: Sign This Loyalty Oath, Or Else","Campus protesters at Smith College banned reporters from covering a 12-hour sit-in on Wednesday unless they explicitly agreed to cover the protests favorably.

According to MassLive.com, the event, which drew between 300 and 500 participants, was organized to show support for Mizzou students who have been protesting what they say is racism on campus.

One of the sit-in organizers at Smith College told journalists that they were being banned because of “the way that media has historically painted radical black movements as violent and aggressive.”

“We are asking that any journalists or press that cover our story participate and articulate their solidarity with black students and students of color,” said Alyssa Mata-Flores, a senior at Smith College. “By taking a neutral stance, journalists and media are being complacent in our fight.”

Protesters at Mizzou attempted to bar reporters from covering the ongoing protests and entering a designated “safe space,” a public outdoor area in the middle of the taxpayer-funded public university. Given the wholly public nature of the public university, the Mizzou activists attempting to muzzle media eventually failed. However, since Smith College is a private institution, it appears that student agitators may actually be able to ban on-site media coverage of their antics.

Stacey Schmeidel, the school’s director of media relations, said the college was supported the decision of students to ban reporters who refused to take the students’ proposed loyalty oath.

“It’s a student event,” Schmeidel said, “and we respect their right to do that.”",https://thefederalist.com/2015/11/19/campus-protesters-to-media-sign-this-loyalty-oath-or-else/,2015-11-19
"Student Protesters, You Just Got Used","Heavily publicized student protests over alleged “systemic racism” at Yale, the University of Missouri, and Claremont-McKenna College have touched off a nationwide movement, with students at other schools eager to get into the action by issuing their own demands.

These have helpfully been collected together at a website called The Demands. The students’ list of all the things they want the world to provide them with drones on and on, but Walter Olson has already posted a preliminary summary, focusing on how the demands amount to a full-scale assault on freedom of speech.

But Olson made one comment in passing that caught my attention: “more jobs and a bigger and more entrenched establishment promoting diversity within the academy were among the most consistent demands.”

So I took a look for myself, and the more you read through the students’ demands, the more they look curiously like a full-employment program for the faculty who just happen to be egging on these naive youngsters.

A key theme in the demands is the creation of new posts in the university for jobs that consist of promoting a leftist agenda. Students at Brandeis demand, among other new positions, a “Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion.” Boston College protesters demand that the school “appoint a diversity officer at every college” and “increase recruitment and retention of students, faculty, staff, board of trustee members of color, international status, and female and/or gender nonconforming.”

The students’ demands look curiously like a full-employment program for their professors.

Students at Guilford College, in addition to proposing show trials in which “every week a faculty member come forward and publicly admit their participation in racism inside the classroom”—Mao Zedong, please call your office—also demand “the creation of a sovereign Office of Diversity and Inclusion to enforce these demands and keep the administration accountable—these tasks should not solely be carried out through the unpaid labor of students and faculty of color.”

That last point—getting paid by the university to engage in leftist political activism—is an important running theme in these demands. Brown University students demand “that the university support monetarily and otherwise departments and centers committed to social justice, as evidenced through anti-oppressive pedagogy…. Anti-oppression trainings should be led and organized by people of color with significant experience in anti-oppression activism or scholarship. Furthermore, those leading these efforts should be compensated and acknowledged for their labor.”

Yale Students frankly ask for “an increase of two million dollars to the current annual operational budget for each cultural center,” and money for “five full-time staff members in each of the cultural centers.”

At some of these schools, the demand for departmental goodies is very specific. At Brandeis, a demand for more minority faculty members is specifically targeted at the departments of anthropology, history, fine arts, sociology, and theater. One wonders how many employees of these departments are involved in the campus protest movement.

Or consider the very specific demands at Dartmouth.

Convert the African and African American Studies (AAAS), Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies (LALACS), and Native American Studies (NAS) programs into departments in order to provide curricular autonomy.



Give each department an increased budget and the authority for hiring more faculty (esp. tenure-track faculty).



Increase each departments’ budgets to fund student research. Incorporate into each department at least one queer studies class.



Increase the number of AAAS, LALACS, and NAS post-doctoral fellows.



Establish an Asian American Studies department with the above privileges.

Now isn’t that a wish list any academic department would slaver over?

At some schools, the demand for departmental goodies is very specific.

Oh, but it’s not just the expansion of their own departments that they want. At Mizzou, the demands call for “funding, resources, and personnel for the social justice centers on campus for the purpose of hiring additional professionals, particularly those of color.” But they also demand “that the University of Missouri creates and enforces comprehensive racial awareness and inclusion curriculum throughout all campus departments and units, mandatory for all students, faculty, staff and administration. This curriculum must be vetted, maintained, and overseen by a board comprised of students, staff, and faculty of color.”

So the various ethnic studies departments get to colonize every other department.

We can find the distilled essence of these demands in a single paragraph from the student demands at Brown University. It’s long and unwieldy, but I wanted you to get a sense of the bludgeoning repetition of this idea.

We demand an increase in faculty of color hires and retention. The current plan to double faculty of color is insufficient due to the dearth of tenured faculty of color, as well as the countless faculty of color who have left Brown due to a lack of competitive pay…. We demand that the Corporation of Brown University fund tenure-track hiring lines for specialty positions in each department across disciplines, and the continued cluster hires of junior faculty of color as done in the Departments of American Studies and History. By “specialty positions” we are referring to the deliberate hiring of faculty who work on critical issues related to social justice such as topics on race, gender, sexuality, ability, and class as they pertain to specific disciplines. Furthermore, we would like the instantiation of hiring committees that would ensure Brown offers competitive salaries to top faculty of color working in the aforementioned areas. In accordance with this demand, we implore Brown’s administration—with the inclusion of undergraduate and graduate students of color—to create an external board tasked with the responsibility of reviewing each department’s progress in hiring, retaining, offering competitive salaries, and creating opportunities for advancement for faculty of color who work on social justice issues.

Boy, the phrase “competitive salaries” comes up an awful lot in there, did you notice? This reads less like a manifesto of student revolutionaries, and more like a particularly aggressive salary negotiation. But this is not about higher pay for all faculty members. Notice in the middle the emphasis on “specialty positions,” we are defined as “faculty who work on critical issues related to social justice.” So it’s a special sinecure for those with the correct political agenda.

There is a lot going on in these demands, including an attempt to turn universities into organs of leftist indoctrination, with all opposing viewpoints rigorously purged. (The Dartmouth demands include a provision specifically targeting the school’s conservative student newspaper, the Dartmouth Review, while Boston College protesters demands that their school “Reform Pedagogy & Curriculum to Reduce Eurocentric Focus and Address Racism and diversity in the classroom.” So much for “academic freedom.”)

Much of the students’ agenda consists of commanding universities to hire a specific group of people.

But underneath the creepy totalitarianism, there is a more mundane and practical purpose. Once you’re attuned to it, it’s hard not to be struck by how much of this agenda consists of commanding universities to hire a specific group of people: the professional campus “diversity” activists. Universities are exhorted to hire them, promote them, increase their budgets, pay them more, and create new offices for them with new powers.

And who do you suppose is supporting and encouraging the campus protests? Who taught them the ideas they are using, and who is egging them on? The very same faculty and administrators for whom the protesters are demanding more money and power.

Everyone who has ever spent time around a university or with academics knows that beneath all the high-flown ivory tower stuff, there is a constant scramble for money and authority. Every department’s job is to expand itself, to hire more faculty and administrators, to expand its budget, to get bigger offices in a nicer building. Now the “social justice” faction among the faculty has found a way to club everyone else into submission and win departmental office politics once and for all. Accuse the university of systemic racism, force its nominal leaders into groveling apologies, and then dictate terms to the rest of the system. Emboldened and seeing that no one wants to stand up to them, they’re even attempting to take over every other department of the university by foisting mandatory courses in “social justice” on the math department.

What looks like a student protest movement is actually an administrative coup.

So what looks from the outside like a student protest movement looks on the inside like an administrative coup by a small faction of the faculty, using naive and ill-informed students as their shock troops. No wonder marginal faculty members are climbing on the bandwagon and signing up to muscle out reporters and guide the young protesters. They hope to ride this to higher-paid, more secure, more powerful positions.

This also gives us an answer to the question of what will happen when the student protesters leave the coddled confines of the university and go out into a world where everyone will not walk on eggshells around them. The answer is that some of them never intend to leave. They hope to occupy some of those faculty and administrative offices and to be campus protesters forever—but with salaries and benefits provided by the very institutions they protest.

As for all of the other students, including the many who declare (sincerely or out of fear) that they are sympathetic to the goals of the protesters, you might notice that it doesn’t benefit them at all. They are the ones whose education will be watered down with tedious mandatory indoctrination sessions and who will have to spend four years of their lives living in fear of making the wrong move and offending the wrong people.

They might want to consider the way in which they are being exploited for the institutional interests of a very few people, who feed them a lot of high-minded guff about “systemic racism” while angling for bigger offices and cushier salaries.

I’m not sure they’ll pay much attention to that now. Being 19 years old, they are likely too absorbed in their own personal dramas, particularly those in which they can imagine themselves as the heroes. But later on, they might consider how much of their crucial educational years were diverted into a cause that mostly benefited the elders who were egging them on.

If they can figure that out, it just might count as a whole different kind of education. Just because you get to go to a fancy college doesn’t mean you avoid the School of Hard Knocks.

Most Students Can’t Afford Campus Protests,"The Yale University lecturer who faced a barrage of criticism for suggesting students could handle their own Halloween costumes without losing their minds has recently resigned, according to The New York Times. As college campuses across America are engulfed in similar chaos, it is worth looking at the probable effect of this radical unrest, not just on the universities and civil society, but on the student protesters themselves.

By spending their time on social justice activism instead of pursuing their studies, many of the protesters are making a mistake that could follow them for the rest of their lives. By emulating the radicalism of campus elites without actually having the security of membership in that elite class, they risk destroying the advantages their education was supposed to create.

The point of attending a university has always been to get an education. For the nineteenth-century college man or woman, the actual subject of the education often did not matter. Learning the classics did not enhance the job prospects of a young scion of a wealthy family, but made him “educated” and “well-rounded.” It was a way-station on the road to taking one’s place in society. College was a rite of passage, not a means of social or economic elevation.

From Bettering Oneself to Agitating Others

For most twenty-first-century college kids, things are different. Expanding college enrollment has helped educate the children of poor and middle-class families so they could find their place in a world of new, more intellectually demanding jobs. In the post-World War II ideal, a child would go to college, become qualified for a better job than his parents had, and thereby make himself and his future family more financially secure.

For some, college life became more about agitation and less about education.

It was a good plan and, with the decline of employment in farming and manufacturing, it was a necessary plan if the next generations were to adapt themselves for the new economy.

The intellectual freedom of the college campus made universities hubs for new ideas and, especially in the face of the civil disorder surrounding the Vietnam War, incubators for radical ideas. Besides learning new concepts, college students and professors could advocate for societal change in accordance with those ideas. For some, college life became more about agitation and less about education.

For tenured professors, there is no harm in this Their jobs are secure. For rich kids, campus radicalism is also without cost. Their family wealth and connections ensure they will find good jobs after graduation regardless of the condition of their academic transcript (with grade inflation, the transcript usually looked fine in any case).

Disrupting Everyone’s Education Carries Consequences

For the rest of the student body, though, playing fast and loose with their academic training risks grave harm to their future career prospects. For students from a poor or middle-class background, future employers may overlook a little campus radicalism as the excesses of youth, but behavior that results in suspension or expulsion would put them right back where they started, with only a load of student loan debt to show for it.

Their error is in copying the habits of a leisure class to which they do not (yet) belong.

Their error is in copying the habits of a leisure class to which they do not (yet) belong. The mistake is understandable: colleges today are luxurious, and many students do not have jobs while they are in school. They likely feel on par with their legacy admission classmates, and see social activism without recourse as a part of the package of things they earned with admission to college. They are mistaken.

The protests at Princeton are a useful example. The cause for the unrest, in that case, is the character of a Princeton president (and United States president) who has been dead for nearly a century: Woodrow Wilson. Wilson, who presided over Princeton University from 1902 to 1910 (and over the United States from 1913 to 1921) was a leading progressive Democrat, of whom Princeton is justly proud. He was also, as David Harsanyi notes, a virulent racist. Unfortunately for twenty-first-century progressives, a sizable fraction of Princeton’s campus is named after him.

They spent the remainder of their time at the school under the threat of expulsion.

So, protests. Besides this issue, the campus radicals demanded “cultural competency training for faculty and staff, an ethnicity and diversity distribution requirement and a space on campus explicitly dedicated to black students.” In the best imitation of their progressive forebears from the 1960s, this protest was accompanied by walk-outs and sit-ins.

This is not the first time such a protest happened at Princeton. In 1995, there was a similar protest over similar issues. The protesters were found in violation of “disrupting legitimate university business” and placed on academic probation. They spent the remainder of their time at the school under the threat of expulsion. Twenty years later, students occupying the school president’s office risk the same punishment.

Wasting a Degree Equals Conspicuous Consumption

The peril this poses to the protesters’ college degrees and future earning potential may be something they ignore because they are young, and young people take risks older people would not. But it is also emblematic of another idea, one sociologist Thorstein Veblen called “conspicuous consumption.”

Students are acting as though they are gentlemen of leisure, but instead of wasting money, they waste the opportunity for education.

In his book, “The Theory of the Leisure Class,” Veblen discusses how the rich consume goods wastefully and publically as a mark of their upper-class status. The “[c]onspicuous consumption of valuable goods,” he wrote, “is a means of reputability to the gentleman of leisure.” Here, all students are acting as though they are gentlemen of leisure, but instead of wasting money, they waste the opportunity for education. The old symbol of capricious waste was a plutocrat lighting his cigar with a hundred-dollar bill. Now, it is the scene of children at elite universities figuratively burning their diplomas on the altar of social justice.

Given the far-leftist bent of the student protesters, it is strange we should look to one of capitalism’s famous critics to explain their actions, but in an age where progressive presidents like Wilson are attacked for being insufficiently progressive, anything is possible. The companion to Veblen’s thesis is also useful: the rich, in his telling, waste money not just because they can, but to show the world that they can. The protests at Princeton and elsewhere diverge from the analogy because, in most cases, the protesters cannot afford it.

Ted Kennedy could become a senator after being expelled from Harvard University for cheating. That is the privilege of being a Kennedy. For the rest of the world, expulsion from college is a black mark on a resumé that can never be expunged. Student protesters, especially those not of the leisure class, should think hard about the value of their opportunities before committing to wasting them on the progressive cause of the day.

Bernie’s Hatred Of Work Is Why Trumpites Are So Mad,"Hillary Clinton hasn’t taken questions from the press since December 4. Of course, if she did that she might have to answer some hard questions, such as why did we just discover 64 more emails with classified information in her unsecure private email, bringing the total of mishandled classified emails to at least 1,730? Or why is a CIA officer serving a three-year sentence for a lesser crime?

Then again, I don’t blame Hillary Clinton for dodging the press. After all, she seems to have no problem getting away with it, especially since there’s no shortage of media outlets willing to grant her fluffy interviews designed to portray her in the most flattering light possible, such as this Facebook Q&A moderated by the online publication The Grio.

Feel free to dig in and marvel at the sub-Barbara Walters tenor of the whole thing, but I was particularly interested in the following exchange. It is a near-perfect encapsulation of the car crash between insidious American cultural trends and liberal politics, masquerading as a self-serving, Oprah-inflected “wisdom”:

Secretary Clinton, what advice would you give to your younger self in college that you didn’t know then?



You never know what’s going to happen in life. Get the best education you can, learn as much as you can about the world around you, and take opportunities as they come. And most of all, do what you love. Don’t take a job just for money – take a job because it’s meaningful. Find time for family. Find time for relationships. All of that adds up to a life that can provide a lot of satisfaction.



One of my favorite lines is, ‘I’ve loved and been loved. All the rest is background music.’ I never would have understood what that meant when I was in college. -H

While this reads like so much Hallmark pablum we take for granted, if you think about it, it’s hard not to be offended by this Forest Gumpery. Seriously, did she just say “don’t take a job just for the money”? Is that why Clinton and her husband spent a decade giving speeches to Goldman Sachs for $300,000 and a favor to be named later? Or struck million-dollar deals with shady post-Soviet oligarchs with terrible human rights records?

Open Disdain for Work Sparks Anger

But if there’s another piece of advice here that absolutely disqualifies Clinton for the presidency, it’s “do what you love.” The truth is, that is simply not an option for most people. When it’s 39 degrees and raining in February, do you think the guy who picks up your trash is staring at your acrid, bacteria-laden refuse at 6 a.m. and saying, “Thank God, I love what I do”?

Our ‘follow your bliss’ culture doesn’t begin to appreciate coal miners even as it obsessively venerates people whose contributions to society aren’t very tangible.

Indeed, it is precisely this cultural disconnect about the value of work that explains why there’s an open revolt in both parties and the future seems so uncertain.

If any one issue defines this election, it’s economic stagnation. Many Trump supporters in the GOP feel left behind by the twenty-first-century economy. They’re angry about it, because our “follow your bliss” culture doesn’t begin to appreciate coal miners or people who work in brake disc factories, even as it obsessively venerates empty celebrity and people like social media executives and hedge fund managers who are filthy rich in spite of the fact their contributions to society aren’t very tangible. Combine that with the self-loathing these guys feel from, say, being laid off and having to fake a fibromyagia diagnosis so they can collect disability and feed their families, and you have tremendous resentment.

Trump was not only canny enough to speak to this, but he still remains arguably the only candidate to forthrightly talk about issues such as immigration that are feeding this anxiety, even if he speaks about them with great ignorance. It’s regrettable in many ways, but it’s also not a mystery why 30 percent of Republicans are lining up to support a lunatic who has (allegedly) made a lot of money and wields considerable influence despite now being despised by our cultural betters.

Progressives’ Failed No-Work Utopia

The odd thing is that people are voting for Bernie Sanders overwhelmingly for kind of the same reason as Trump supporters, in that they don’t want larger economic issues forcing them to change their culture or lifestyle. However, the motivations of Sanders supporters are much less sympathetic. Millennials and many other progressive types now feeling the Bern seem to have been sold a bill of goods about how we live in post-scarcity techno-utopia. They can’t understand why they can’t “do what they love” without financial realities being such a killjoy.

They can’t understand why they can’t ‘do what they love’ without financial realities being such a killjoy.

A few years ago, in an article on the cultural obsession with Portland, Oregon, I took a look at this socioeconomic phenomenon in detail. Essentially, the state’s high taxes played a big role in driving a huge number of medium-sized and even national enterprises out of Oregon or out of business altogether. Portland’s celebrated “artisanal economy” is basically a result of overeducated hipsters who want to live in Oregon because the cost of living is relatively cheap and it’s beautiful, but there are no traditional jobs with opportunities for advancement.

So they’re all starting craft businesses and restaurants. When you have one food truck for every 1,000 people, as Portland does, that is a result of desperation, not necessarily the kind of enterprise and initiative you want to celebrate. Despite all this, everyone romanticizes this state of affairs when the reality is that bad blue-state governance means Portland is slowly moving from a functional city to a cultural theme park for rich people.

Many Portlanders like their lives that don’t contribute much, and if they could just get free health care—the governor who created the failed Oregon Health Plan and screwed up the state’s Obamacare exchange to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars was just run out of office on corruption charges in his fourth term—and erase their absurd college debt, they could afford the harissa-spiced Bloody Marys at the trendy new brunch spot and slide by selling colorful hemp guitar straps on Etsy without having to make any difficult or unselfish choices.

Many Portlanders like their lives that don’t contribute much.

This Portlandia phenomenon isn’t unique to Oregon. You see the same discontent in trendy urban areas across the country in places such as San Francisco, Silver Lake, Brooklyn, and so on.

Speaking of Brooklyn, the location of Hillary Clinton’s campaign headquarters is more than a little symbolic here. In 2008, when she was still the presumptive favorite and faced with progressive, youthful insurgency, Clinton rallied around defending the Democratic white working class’s bitter clinger constituency. This time around, it’s obvious she’s bound and determined not to make that mistake again and wants to co-opt the enthusiasm of Sanders’s campaign more than repudiate it.

If you’re a gun owner, object to being forced to bake a wedding cake, or a traditionally Democratic voter who still holds same decidedly unprogressive opinions that Clinton herself held five minutes ago, her 2016 campaign is likely to respond to your concerns with blog post festooned with Taylor Swift GIFs explaining why you’re the anti-Christ.

Reclaiming the Protestant Work Ethic

So here’s my rather immodest proposal for making America great again. We need a sea change in our attitudes toward work. Those of us who have easy jobs, let alone ones we love, better damn well remain grateful for the opportunities we have. And all of us, especially our elected representatives, ought to start showing one hell of a lot more appreciation and support for those among us who do the hard work necessary to provide the services and produce the goods that make America a safe, secure, and comfortable place.

My rather immodest proposal for making America great again: We need a sea change in our attitudes toward work.

That this needs to be said is damning indictment of how debased American culture has become. (Mike Rowe is just about the lone significant cultural voice in America screaming into the void about the value of work.) Not that long ago, we were celebrated for our “Protestant work ethic,” although, as with a lot of theological concepts, most Americans no longer have any frame of reference for what that means.

Although often associated with Calvinism, it is was first rooted in Martin Luther’s doctrine of vocation, which posits that we serve God by accepting our callings and employing our God-given abilities to do the work that needs to be done. Not because we get to do what we love, but because we do what needs to be done out of love for others.

One does not need to even believe in God to see that an economic order that arises from a culture where naked self-interest is tempered by expressions of respect and gratitude for those who willingly accept responsibility to take care of others is preferable to every man for himself. It’s also vastly better than the other extreme of socialism, where the fruits of our individual labor are disproportionately seized and redistributed without regard to our families and the community members we care about most and are best positioned to take care of.

The Rich Radicalize Politics

Early Americans, both because of their religious dedication and the necessity of conquering the frontier, ensured that valuing work was deeply embedded in our culture. Proto-libertarian thinker Frank Chodorov described the salutary effects of this on American politics in his 1962 essay, “The Radical Rich”:

There was a time, in these United States, when a candidate for public office could qualify with the electorate only by fixing his birthplace in or near the ‘log cabin.’ He may have acquired a competence, or even a fortune, since then, but it was in the tradition that he must have been born of poor parents and made his way up the ladder by sheer ability, self-reliance, and perseverance in the face of hardship. In short, he had to be ‘self made’ The so-called Protestant Ethic then prevalent held that man was a sturdy and responsible individual, responsible to himself, his society, and his God. Anybody who could not measure up to that standard could not qualify for public office or even popular respect.

Chodorov’s essay further notes that early American scions of great wealth—the Rockefellers, et al.—would have been anathema to the voting public should they have decided to enter politics. Ironically, it was first Teddy Roosevelt and later his cousin FDR, that supposed champion of the common man, who made the waters safe for rich dilettantes to enter politics; so much so that John D. Rockefeller’s great-grandson just retired from spending 30 years in the Senate.

Still, it was not that long ago that this perception that politicians should be self-made still held to a powerful degree. Indeed, I seem to remember a president who got elected by portraying himself as a bootstrapper from a small town in Arkansas named “Hope.” More than two decades later, the Clintons have pushed the envelope way beyond whether it’s merely acceptable for the rich to enter politics.

Now We Normalize Corruption

Getting rich off political influence isn’t new, but the Clintons—with their land deals, cattle futures, and palms being greased by Wall Street and foreign oligarchs—have made it acceptable to do so publicly. In this respect, the Clintons aren’t self-made at all. In fact, the way they exchange power for money is much more analogous to the corrupt Catholics who insisted that God’s forgiveness required indulgences that caused Luther to spell out the doctrine of vocation and gave rise to the Protestant work ethic in the first place.

The way they exchange power for money is much more analogous to the corrupt Catholics who insisted that God’s forgiveness required indulgences.

They’re hardly the only examples of this these days. The media and much of the public yawned when it was revealed that a corrupt Chicago developer largely paid for Obama’s million-dollar home. For his part, Donald J. Trump has hoovered up working-class support by repeatedly and disingenuously claiming he is self-made. The reality is that he inherited millions from his father decades ago, and he routinely lies about how rich he is (likely because he’s both a narcissist and not a great businessman). He’s gone bankrupt multiple times, and would be a lot richer if he’d just stuck his money in an index fund instead of slapping his name on hideous buildings.

Oh, and Trump’s about to end up on trial for defrauding people with a super-shady for-profit education scheme. What do you want to bet that some of the people defrauded were workers squeezed out of the new economy and looking for affordable education opportunities to change or reclaim their careers? That is to say, the very people whose interests Trump is now claiming he would champion as president.

Repugnant Ambition

The key to the Protestant work ethic—and by extension America’s success—was that it strongly encouraged wealth creation at the same time it valued certain kinds of wealth creation over others. In nineteenth-century America, you could still get rich by being a robber baron or wielding your influence in Tammany Hall, but that came with no guarantee you would be respected or liked. Voters were especially loath to grant the wealthy the power to run the entire country, let alone let them use the levers of power to dramatically undercut the values of ordinary self-reliant, hardworking Americans.

It seems as if twenty-first-century America has lost the capability to make value distinctions about economic success.

It seems as if twenty-first-century America has lost the capability to make value distinctions about economic success. Like so many other issues that divide the country, the accumulation of wealth is too often a Manichean issue. Either it’s entirely self-justifying or all significant gains are unfairly viewed as the result of exploitation. The good news is that principled conservatives and principled progressives are finally starting to find points of agreement on the damage that crony capitalism has been doing to this country.

The bad news, however, is that enough of the country is still locked into one of these delusions that we’re staring down the barrel of a Clinton-Trump election. When the common thread of your life is chasing power and money—as it is for so many politicians these days—“do what you love” is a repugnant ambition. It sure seems like Trump and Clinton are enjoying their jobs way too much these days.

"Melissa Click: One Bad Professor Fired, Thousands To Go","Melissa Click, the University of Missouri communications professor whom videos show obstructed the press and assaulted a student during last fall’s social justice protests, has finally been fired.

Click was acting as de facto communications director for the radical group “Concerned Student 1950” that, like many groups across the nation, was accusing, with no evidence, their campus administration with “systemic racism.” Click inflamed an emotionally charged situation on November 9 when word came that the president and chancellor had resigned for allegedly allowing racist symbols and slurs on and off-campus.

When student journalist Tim Tai, on assignment for ESPN, waded into the campus encampment with his camera, he was blocked by Click and others, including her husband, religion professor Richard Callahan, and Greek life administrator Janna Bassler, who identified herself as “Concerned Student of 1950.” Click, identifying herself as “communications faculty,” responded to Tai’s repeated claim to First Amendment rights by stating, “I get that argument all the time, but you need to go.” Thanks to Mark Schierbecker, another student filming the confrontation, Click’s angry face as she called for some “muscle” from the mob went viral.

Applications and donations plummeted. On February 24, 2016, after release and a lengthy investigation of an earlier video of Click’s confrontation with police during homecoming, the Board of Curators fired Click. They did so because no one on campus would start the process. Concerned Student 1950 accused the board of submitting to threats from lawmakers to cut the budget.

Lifelong Sinecures Foster Abuse of Authority

Thousands of professors, however, work without fear and do not feel bound to any job description by their employers: taxpayers and tuition payers. Compared to most working Americans, they enjoy incredible job security, comfortable compensations, and easy working conditions. In exchange, they abuse their authority by imposing their political views on students.

They may not physically intimidate students, but they ridicule dissenting students in class, give politically loaded assignments, and punish with grades.

They may not physically intimidate students, but they ridicule dissenting students in class, give politically loaded assignments, and punish with grades. Their scholarship follows politically tangential lines like Click’s, which involves studies of Lady Gaga and the pornographic novel “Fifty Shades of Gray.” (For several years, many courses in sociology and freshman composition have been dedicated to Lady Gaga.)

Click’s colleagues, including Callahan, Bassler (who enjoyed a month off during administrative leave), and Schierbecker’s German professor, who gave his students permission to leave class to attend the protest, are still employed. In contrast, my semester-to-semester contracts at state schools stipulated that I would fulfill a certain number of “contact hours” with students.

Trying to save her job, Click made two “apologies.” In the first, on November 10, 2015, Click did not admit to violating students’ First Amendment rights, but only regret for her “language and strategies” and for the way her actions “shifted attention away from the students’ campaign for justice.”

In fact, she began by offering “both apology and context,” calling her actions “mistakes” during a “historic day at MU—full of emotion and confusion.” Another apology the following day mentioned only Click’s impact on the School of Journalism and the Chancellor’s Student Publications Committee, where she had advised the student newspaper.

We Don’t Pay You to Violate Our Rights

More than 100 members of the Missouri Assembly saw through these self-serving deflections and on December 18 sent a letter to the chancellor demanding that Click be fired. Acknowledging the possibility of “some value” in “pop culture studies,” the legislators also conveyed their constituents’ concerns about Click’s “research” and expressed their disgust that Click “spent her paid time off from teaching [for research] to assault students, harass citizens of Missouri, and work in contravention of our Constitution.”

What about the power differential between professors and students? Is there no concern about such professors’ objectivity in grading students?

This action spurred 116 of Click’s colleagues to sign a letter in her defense. Several (Elisa Glick, English and Women’s and Gender Studies; Srirupa Prasad, Sociology and Women’s and Gender Studies; Rebecca Martinez, Women’s and Gender Studies; Karen Piper, Christopher Okonkwo, April Langley, and Clenora Hudson-Weems, English; and Callahan) were featured in the 2009 book, “One-Party Classroom,” in which David Horowitz and Jacob Laksin evaluated twelve of the nation’s most politicized institutions.

The signatories, bewailing the “ad hominem attacks on, and harassment of, Click personally” in the form of emails (actually quite mild), vouched for Click’s “outstanding record of teaching and research.” They echoed her own rationalizations by asserting that her actions “constitute at most a regrettable mistake, one that came, moreover, at the end of several weeks during which Click served alongside other faculty and staff as an ally to students who were protesting what they saw as their exclusion from and isolation at the University.”

The letter brings up troubling questions. Who were these “other faculty and staff” who served as students’ “allies,” and why should faculty be “allying” with one group of students? What about the power differential between professors and students (as with sexual relationships)? Is there no concern about such professors’ objectivity in grading students?

Let’s Apply Some More Double Standards

Amazingly the faculty claimed that Click was “wronged by the media” and called on the university to defend her “first amendment rights of protest and her freedom to act as a private citizen.” Ben Trachtenberg, associate law professor and chair of the Columbia campus’s Faculty Council on University Policy, even said Click’s actions were like “a lot of little scuffles and shoving” that don’t lead to the involvement of the criminal justice system.

He asserted lawmakers have no right to question Click’s use of her research time or bring up their constituents’ concerns about her research.

Joining in was the American Association of University Professors. President Rudy Fichtenbaum called lawmakers’ demands for Click’s termination “a real overreach.” He told the Washington Post that Click deserved due process, a hearing by a committee of faculty. Invoking academic freedom protected by tenure against “outside interference with the running of the university,” he asserted lawmakers have no right to question Click’s use of her research time or bring up their constituents’ concerns about her research.

“Legislators are not experts in that field,” Fichtenbaum declared; “they don’t know anything about that kind of research. Nor do I,” he said, adding, “I’m an economist. I wouldn’t presume to judge her research.”

Yet this economist feels qualified to defend a colleague on constitutional grounds. Nor did he question Click’s own wandering over to fields outside her own, namely to civil rights, criminal justice, and the law, presumably the concerns of the student group. Nor do her academic peers, in fields of literature, religion, and communications, when it comes to such issues.

Check Your Privilege, University Profs

When news of her firing came, supporters doubled down: at the faculty council meeting, no one supported her firing. In fact, faculty expressed concern about how the decision would impact “the ability of academics to participate in activism”! Fellow professors signed another letter of protest. The AAUP asked that her termination be rescinded, then threatened an investigation and “censure.”

At the faculty council meeting, no one supported her firing. In fact, faculty expressed concern about how the decision would impact ‘the ability of academics to participate in activism’!

What we have is a group of employees assuming the right to use company time in any way they want. Their outrage at outside scrutiny shows a level of privilege that no other profession enjoys. Attorneys, doctors, engineers, or manufacturers, all can be sued, but a professor who cheats students preparing for communications careers by teaching Lady Gaga cannot.

As Click and the earlier case of ethnic studies professor Ward Churchill showed, it is nigh impossible to fire a professor these days. Only the most egregious cases involving assault or plagiarism get that far.

I have seen this on the campuses where I have taught. One I have described before was a February 4, 2012, “teach-in” at the Georgia State University College of Education, designed to indoctrinate education students and teachers about using materials from the Zinn Education Project to protest Arizona’s legislation banning curricular materials that promoted overthrowing the U.S. government and immigration laws. At the end of the day, as participants made pledges to implement lessons learned, Georgia State University professor Jennifer Esposito promised to give “extra points” to students in her “Race, Class and Gender in Education” class for considering specific immigration bills in their policy projects and sending hand-written letters to legislators opposing immigration enforcement.

On March 19, 2012, I provided testimony about Esposito’s pledge to the Georgia Judiciary Non-Civil Committee. A member of the pro-illegal-alien crowd packing the room shouted out that I was “lying,” that she had been there. On March 30, 2012, I posted an incriminating video of Esposito. It shows Esposito promising to bribe her students to lobby legislators. Yet she is still an associate professor in the Department of Educational Policy Studies, and an affiliate member in the Alonzo A. Crim Center for Urban Educational Excellence and the Institute for Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies.

What we have is a group of employees assuming the right to use company time in any way they want.

According to her profile, she has served as a program evaluator for Teacher Quality Grant projects. In 2013, the year after making the “pledge,” she was placed on the University Senate, and serves on several university-level committees, among them the University Senate Diversity Committee and the Educational Leadership Search Committee.

The “actions” taken against Esposito, in response to my testimony and the videotape, were meaningless. A letter on April 16, 2012, from the university president to the committee chair stated the university attorney had found that “when the professor actually made the offer of extra credit to students on February 23, 2012, she informed them that she would assign extra credit to students who wrote letters either in support of or opposition to the legislators.”

The president and provost had instructed “all deans and vice presidents of their obligations regarding political activities so this information could be shared with their respective areas”; the dean—the same person sponsoring and emceeing the “teach-in”—“spoke with [Esposito] about the matter and provided her with a memo reminding her of her responsibilities under the policies of the Board of Regents as well as state and federal law regarding political activities.”

Ruin Society and Young People’s Prospects, Get Promoted

On May 7, 2012, I received a letter from the Georgia Board of Regents assuring me they “condemn the use of University System facilities and resources by any employee to further the employee’s personal political agenda. Such use is a violation of our students’ trust as well as a violation of Board of Regents policies governing political activities.” In the intervening four years Esposito has continued in the path blessed by the dean in neglecting real teaching for spurious scholarship advancing a political agenda.

The last time I know of when a college president simply fired a professor was in 1963.

The last time I know of when a college president simply fired a professor was in 1963. Albert Manley, the first African-American president of the black women’s college Spelman, fired Howard Zinn. The reason he gave was “insubordination.” Zinn had been using his post since 1956 to radicalize students, in defiance of his superiors and parents, by encouraging students to ignore campus rules regarding chapel attendance, dress codes, and curfews, and by taking them to pro-Soviet protests and events. In a 1960 essay for The Nation, Zinn contemptuously called Spelman a “finishing school” and bragged he had transformed it into a “finishing school for protest.” The AAUP is still smarting from Albert Manley’s “autocratic” actions, according to a blog post.

Zinn obviously was not doing his job of teaching history. He was disrupting the campus’s normal operations and putting young black female students in harm’s way. Unfortunately, after his firing Zinn taught at Boston University until he retired in 1988. He also wrote the bestselling “A People’s History of the United States,” which has been adopted at all grade levels despite the common bipartisan assessment displayed by the title of David Greenberg’s 2013 New Republic article: “Agit-Prof, Howard Zinn’s influential mutilations of American history.”

In 2013, when then-governor Mitch Daniels questioned the use of Zinn’s history for a summer institute for Indiana high school teachers, the Indiana AAUP Conference charged him with censorship. In response, professors held a Zinn read-in at Purdue and started a Zinn memorial graduate scholarship fund.

It’s time to break the stranglehold and demand accountability from professors—especially at publicly funded institutions. We need to bring back the idea that professors, like everyone else, have job descriptions and that they answer to their employers. We could start a new movement on behalf of students who want to learn, the kinds of students studying in the library and being interrupted by protestors last fall. We could call it Concerned Student 1963.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/03/07/melissa-click-one-bad-professor-fired-thousands-more-to-go/,2016-03-07
In Defense Of Trump’s Chicago Protesters,"Back in August, Donald Trump had strong words for Bernie Sanders after a Black Lives Matter protest interrupted a Sanders rally. Trump said, “I would never give up my microphone. I thought that was disgusting.” He went on to say, “That will never happen with me…I don’t know if I’ll do the fighting myself, or if other people will, but that was a disgrace. I felt badly for him, but it showed that he’s weak.”

On Friday night, Trump had the chance to show how he would react to a Black Lives Matter protest. He tucked his tail between his legs and scurried back to his jet. At least Sanders had stayed on the stage.

In the wake of the protest at Trump’s arena event, many on the Right have been quick to defend Trump as some kind of victim. This is spurious nonsense of the worst kind. Trump picked a fight, the fight came to him, and he cowered. It was a telling moment in his campaign. For a few fraught and frightening minutes liberal protesters succeeded in doing what conservatives have failed to do. They shut Donald Trump up.

For all his big talk, when the protests came he folded his tent and went home. These were chickens coming home to roost for him. For months we have seen how Trump deals with individual protesters. While most politicians politely listen to protestors and then respond, usually with a preface about how the right to protest is uniquely American, Trump took a different approach. He said “get ‘em out.” He said that in the good old days those kind of people got “roughed up.” He said he would pay the legal fees of his supporters who committed acts of violence.

The result of this bravado has indeed been violence. Last week, a Trump supporter sucker-punched a black protester as police led him peacefully out of the arena. Is there any doubt that the man who threw that punch (who has since been arrested) thought he was doing Trump’s bidding? Wasn’t he doing exactly what that sneering and snarling coward, protected by his Secret Service detail, had urged him to do? Trump is apparently looking into paying his thug’s legal fees. We’ll see if he keeps his word on that.

Trump’s Free Speech Was Not Violated

Free speech is a competition. While we do not have the right to silence anybody, we do have the right to speak more loudly and with greater moral authority than they do. Trump advertised a rally with tens of thousands of tickets available. Nowhere in the online form to buy tickets did it say attendees must respect Trump or quietly listen to him. In fact, at an arena rally for Trump I attended in New Hampshire, when a woman yelled out “Ted Cruz is a pussy,” she was not removed. Instead, the candidate trumpeted her viewpoint.

The spokesman’s appearance shows quite plainly that Trump could have appeared on that stage.

Trump’s spokesman took the stage Friday night to announce that, after consultation with authorities, Trump had cancelled his speech. The spokesman was not shouted down or assaulted. In fact, he delivered his message to a relatively quiet hall that only reacted loudly to the news that Trump would not appear. Chicago police have since said they did not advise Trump to cancel.

The spokesman’s appearance shows quite plainly that Trump could have appeared on that stage. He could have done what a leader does, and talked to the people. He could have taken the opportunity to show how, as he claims, he can unite the country and make it great again. But he didn’t. He cancelled the event rather than appear in front of people who were not committed acolytes.

Nobody violated Trump’s right to free speech. Those protesters have the same right, and they didn’t have access to the arena’s sound system. Free speech is a competition; it’s a marketplace of ideas. Trump took his microphone and went home. Unlike Sanders, he couldn’t take the heat. His rights weren’t violated, his ego was. But that’s how it goes. Welcome to the big leagues, Mr. Trump.

Protests Aim to Be Disruptive

The whole point of protests is to be disruptive. Conservatives believe that their forms of protest—Tea Party rallies, for example—are less disruptive than those of their liberal counterparts. This is probably true, but disruption is in the eye of the beholder. A pro-life protest outside an abortion clinic is viewed by many as disruptive. Many view as disruptive Rep. Joe Wilson yelling “You lie” during the State of the Union address.

Protesters of every political stripe make calculated choices about how much disruption helps.

Protesters of every political stripe make calculated choices about how much disruption helps their visibility and how much it hurts their cause. When colonists dumped a fortune in tea into Boston Harbor, they knew they were raising the stakes.

What happened on Friday night was much more restrained than the Boston Tea Party. But it served its purpose. Would I prefer that the protesters wore suits and quietly took the slings and arrows of Trump supporters’ ire in a dignified display of defiance? Sure. But they didn’t. It’s not 1963. Today’s Jackie Robinsons will no longer be the quiet, long-suffering Negro of black and white newsreels, nor should they be.

The Opportunity for Cruz

So how should Trump’s Republican opponents seize upon this opportunity? So far, they have handled it the right way. All three have condemned Trump’s incendiary language and correctly asserted that he has reaped what he sowed. They have made plain that anger is not and must not be the driving principle of American democracy.

Ted Cruz must ask America if this is the next four years they want. Do they want constant race riots and racial resentment?

We Americans smile, we persevere, we toil together and learn from each other. Our political emotions, although often irrationally ruled by fear, always return to love. What does Donald Trump love other than Donald Trump?

Ted Cruz must ask America if this is the next four years they want. Do they want constant race riots and racial resentment? Do they want hatred towards illegal immigrants? Do they want the call to cowardly violence that has morally bankrupted so many societies?

Or can Cruz call for a concerted effort to heal our divisions? Can Cruz calmly, despite his dull awkwardness, offer us a different way forward? Trump is as divisive a political force as this country has ever seen. Cruz, the hated senator, has the chance to be something else. He should take it, and prove he is the short-haired, boring guy who can set America back at ease.

I live in New York City. We don’t vote for a while. Trump hasn’t done an arena show here yet. Conservative friends of mine have already told me they will be protesting him when he does. They asked me to join them. I won’t be doing it.

But as I watch them raise their voices in opposition to his, I will be watching the best of America. This America challenges you and makes you fight for your views and values. That America confronted Donald Trump on Friday night. He had neither the head nor the heart to withstand the strong scrutiny of American democracy. And I thank Chicago’s protestors for making that clear.

Trump And His Protesters Both Hate Free Speech,"When it comes to Donald Trump’s “Go to Auschwitz!” thugs versus MoveOn.Org’s “Shut them down” rioters, I go for the full Kissinger: “It’s a pity they both can’t lose.” (Kissinger was talking about Iran and Iraq. Close enough)

But they aren’t losing. If fact, the sucker-punching Trumpies and sign-shredding socialists are both winning. The only loser is the principle of free speech.

Trump tells supporters to “rough up” protesters. He publicly suggests he will pay the legal fees of fans who beat up hecklers. He announces he’d personally like to “punch [a protester] in the mouth.” And the Trumpies cheer.

People who disagree with Trump’s politics announce their plans to “shut him down,” to disrupt his speeches and make it impossible for Trump and his supporters to rally. They scream. They yell. They destroy property—then brag they’ve succeeded in silencing their fellow Americans. They consider themselves heroes.

It’s the IWW versus the WWE. And I’d like to respond by saying, “Of course, they’re both wrong.” But is this an “of course” in America anymore?

Is Free Speech Dead?

Why should we believe a majority of Americans actually believe that free speech is an inherent good, the old “I disagree with what you say but would defend blah, blah, blah?” For days I’ve been hearing the opposite: Trump supporters happy that protesters are getting beat downs, and Trump haters thumping their chests in pride over silencing speech they don’t like.

Why should we believe a majority of Americans actually believe that free speech is an inherent good?

Even the people whose livelihood depends on it—the media—are celebrating assaults on free speech. Hours after he rushed the stage at a Trump event, CNN did a full, sit-down interview with Thomas DiMassimo—the progressive punk who, when he isn’t making videos of dragging the American flag across the ground under the protection of his own free speech rights, is advocating the use of violence to deny Trump’s. Best (or worst) of all: DiMassimo doesn’t see the irony.

Then again, college students are practically pale with irony deficiency at the moment, particularly when it comes to small-L liberal principles. “Feminist” students who shriek like banshees to shout down pro-life women speakers react in outrage at the micro-aggression of said speaker complaining of being “manhandled.”

Liberals simply no longer believe in the value of open discourse, in and of itself. Thus defending it has fallen to the Right—just in time for Trump to arrive.

From Freedom to a Free-for-Brawl

Let’s set aside the fact that Trump is a “conservative” in the same way that Hugh Laurie is a doctor (they both play one on TV). The people swarming to Trump certainly are not of the Left. It’s ridiculous for American conservatives to deny that they are part of the coalition of the Right.

They’ve watched Black Lives Matter rallies turn into riots, Occupy protests where trash cans get thrown, windows get broken, and cops get hurt, yet nobody gets called a ‘Nazi.’

The talk-radio Right absolutely shares Trump’s “punch him in the face” philosophy on free speech. You can say it’s because they’re (as I heard it growing up in rural South Carolina) “no-account white trash,” but there’s not a lot of data to back that up.

There is frustration and fatigue over being played. They’ve watched Black Lives Matter rallies turn into riots, Occupy protests where trash cans get thrown, windows get broken, and cops get hurt, yet nobody gets called a “Nazi.” This violence isn’t a “threat to the republic,” it doesn’t smear the political views of its practitioners. At least, not in “polite society.”

Now imagine you’re a Tea Party supporter watching all this. Your movement involved literally millions of people at thousands of events—and there’s more violence at one G-20 summit than you’ve had at all your events combined. Why, the Tea Party held a massive rally on the National Mall in Washington DC and literally left it cleaner than they found it.

But who are the “haters?” The “violent?” Who’s called “terrorists” by politicians and the press? They are. If you’re going to get called “violent racists” anyway, why not shout “Auschwitz?” Nobody wants to hear what you have to say, nobody cares about the people who are shouting you down—but the media and the Left demand that you respect free speech? No wonder many of the Tea Party Right have given up on playing by the rules.

The Left won’t defend free speech because they don’t believe in it. The Right won’t defend it because it’s a bat only used to beat them down. So where does that leave principled conservatives and libertarians? Vastly outnumbered.

"Conservatives, Stop Defending Violent Anti-Trump Protesters","The violent anti-Trump protests in Chicago over the weekend have met with uncharacteristic praise from some conservatives, who seem to think that the mob-activist, anti-free speech tactics of the Left might now be deployed to defeat, or at least temporarily silence, Donald Trump.

Here at The Federalist, David Marcus argues that by forcibly disrupting the rally enough to convince Trump to cancel his appearance, the anti-Trump protesters in Chicago “succeeded in doing what conservatives have failed to do. They shut Donald Trump up.”

He means this as praise, as if shutting down public events is the noble purpose of all protests in a free society. It’s not, and Marcus errs badly in conflating free speech with its opposite—mob rule.

Free Speech Isn’t Just A Competition

Marcus says free speech in a democracy is a competition, a marketplace of ideas. Protesting is the “best of America” because it “makes you fight for your views and values.” But of course that’s only true up to a point. Sure, in a competition, someone wins and someone loses. In a democracy, the idea is to channel that competition into elections and the formation of public policy, and to preempt political violence. Competition is thereby mediated and refined through accountable institutions and civic norms. One party’s candidate wins, the other loses. Fair enough.

The Left doesn’t just want competition, it means to silence its competitors.

But that’s not what the activist Left means by competition. They mean to silence their competitors. Witness the campus protest movement sweeping the country. In many instances, students have been openly hostile to free speech. In some cases, they have said so explicitly. In one particularly ironic case, communications professor Melissa Click, who has since been fired, called for “some muscle” to remove a student reporter who was trying to cover the Black Lives Matter protests at the University of Missouri.

It’s not just speech they wish to silence. Sometimes it’s duly elected representatives of the people. Witness the angry mob that descended on the Texas Legislature in June 2013, not just to protest, but to disrupt and shout down state senators trying to vote on a bill regulating abortion clinics. Recall the tens of thousands of pro-union activists that occupied the Wisconsin Capitol building in 2011, in a failed effort to prevent the legislature from passing Gov. Scott Walker’s labor reforms.

Left-wing Activists Don’t Want Free Speech

Such increasingly common tactics are deployed for one reason: to shut up the other side, in some cases literally by shouting them down.

Every time an angry mob shuts down institutions or disrupts the rule of law, voices on the Right murmur about the need to fight fire with fire.

This is more or less what happened in Chicago. Marcus claims no one violated Trump’s right to free speech by disrupting the rally, that it would have been safe for him to appear on stage. Maybe so. But anyone who read accounts of the protests—or of the protests the next day in Kansas City—knows that their purpose was to disrupt the event and force its cancellation.

Marcus claims that those trying to paint Trump as the victim are engaged in “spurious nonsense of the worst kind.” But there is of course an even worse kind of spurious nonsense, and it begins by conflating high-minded notions about competitive free speech and “the marketplace of ideas” with mob action.

After seven and-a-half years of feeling bullied by the Obama administration on everything from gay marriage to the IRS targeting scandal to the habitual use of the executive branch to harass political enemies, it’s understandable that conservatives might be tempted to adopt strong-arm tactics to silence their political enemies and gain back lost ground. Every time an angry mob shuts down institutions or disrupts the rule of law, voices on the Right murmur about the need to fight fire with fire.

Courting Mob Tactics Is Dangerous

They should resist. Mob activism is a tactic of the Left, and conservatives must reject it outright and emphatically. Conservatism, like American democracy itself, is in the end nothing if not a set of principles that preclude the kind of logic-of-power games the Left often plays.

Mob activism is a tactic of the Left, and conservatives must reject it outright and emphatically.

Conservatives should shun the prospect, even in theory, of unaccountable and unelected forces entering into our politics. We should indeed fight for our views, but we should fight with words and ideas. We shouldn’t be forced to fight with our fists, and we shouldn’t applaud those who do.

Flirting with mob power carries another, somewhat hidden danger. It doesn’t just destroy the principles upon which a free society is built, it also destroys the conscience of the free citizen. As Northrop Frye once wrote, “There can be no free speech in a mob: free speech is one thing a mob can’t stand. You notice that the people who allow their fear of Communism to become hysterical eventually get to screaming that every sane man is a Communist.”

Today, this logic is playing out predictably: Trump supporters attack protesters, anti-Trump protesters accuse his supporters of racism and bigotry, and meanwhile the institutions that bind together our republic continue their long decline. This is not America at its best, it is a glimpse of us at our worst.

Why You Should Wear Orange This Saint Patrick’s Day,"On this Saint Patrick’s Day, you are likely to take part in that time-honored tradition of wearing green. If not, you risk punishment by pinch, an especially popular custom on schoolyards and around office water coolers. Thus, wearing green on Saint Patrick’s Day is not only widely practiced, it’s virtually required. It’s hard to imagine the holiday without green.

But for a growing number of people, taking part in the holiday means wearing orange. According to this increasingly popular tradition, Protestants wear orange and leave green attire to Catholics. Thus, the color you wear actually depends on your religious affiliation. While this color tradition is not well known, it has deep roots in Irish history.

Protestant Irish have been known as “orange” ever since 1690, when William of Orange (William III), the king of England, Scotland, and Ireland, defeated King James II, a Roman Catholic, in the Battle of the Boyne near Dublin. King William’s victory would ensure Protestant dominance on the island, and has been a source of tension ever since.

‘Orange Protestants’ have been around for quite a while, but wearing the color on Saint Patrick’s is a relatively new phenomenon.

Although the “Orange” in William’s name actually referred to a province in southern France, the color reference stuck. This is why orange now appears in the Irish flag — to symbolize the Protestant minority in Ireland.

Thus, “Orange Protestants” have been around for quite a while, but wearing the color on Saint Patrick’s is a relatively new phenomenon. The first group to take part in the tradition appears to have been the Orange Institution, a Protestant fraternal organization (some might say terrorist organization) more commonly known as the Orange Order. Some members of the order wore orange in various parades on Saint Patrick’s Day as a mark of defiance.

Ironically, Saint Patrick himself would have been surprised by all of the fuss. Patrick wasn’t even Irish; he came to Celtic Ireland as a British missionary. More importantly, Patrick did most of his work in the fifth century, at a time when Christians were simply Christians, long before any division was evident between Roman Catholics and Protestants.

Therefore, Saint Patrick belongs to the whole church, not just Rome, and people of all colors and creeds should take part in the festivities. Yet for some Protestants, part of that fun involves wearing orange. So before the green-wearing Irish among you get into a pinching craze, think twice. Some of us wear orange for a reason.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/03/17/why-you-should-wear-orange-this-saint-patricks-day/,2016-03-17
The Forgotten History Of The Catholic Enlightenment,"The traditional story of the Enlightenment is one of Europe finally casting off the darkness of medieval religious superstition and moving into the light of modernity. Led by philosophers such as Voltaire, who vowed to “écrasez l’infâme” or “crush the infamous,” and outright atheists such as Diderot, the new thinkers were finally free of the need to even pretend that any of the old hokum was true. During the Renaissance and early Scientific Revolution, intellectuals had to accede to religion. These new deists, skeptics, and non-believers were then free to work unencumbered toward the betterment of mankind in this world.

But as Uhlich L. Lehrner’s new book The Catholic Enlightenment: The Forgotten History of a Global Movement makes clear, this is far from the whole story. Firstly, you can’t have leaders without followers—and most of those following Voltaire were Catholics. While the Enlightenment in Protestant England was a phenomenon to which the whole world, and Americans in particular, owes attention, on the Continent the Enlightenment’s center of gravity was in Catholic lands—particularly France and the Habsburg Empire.

Even more significantly, many of the leading Continental Enlightenment figures not named Voltaire or Diderot were confessing Catholics. These included Voltaire’s friend, the Catholic priest, scientist, and philosopher Francois Jacquier, and Fernando Galiani, a libertine who struggled with his faith while debating the existence of God with his friend Diderot in Paris salons. There were the English Catholic priests who in 1745 founded the Society of St. Edmund from exile in Paris as a rival to the Royal Society in London. Benito Feijoo, a Spanish Benedictine monk, exercised influence in almost every Enlightenment-era cultural war, from the rights of women to free speech to scientific inquiry.

Catholic female writers such as Josefa Amar and Madame Leprince—better known today as the author of The Beauty and the Beast—issued faith-based defenses of the rights of women. The Brazilian priest Ribeiro Rocha, the French Constitutionalist Bishop Henri Gregoire, and the elected King of Corsica Theodore von Neuhoff all made important contributions to the anti-slavery movement that were rooted in Catholicism. In issues great and small, both the foot-soldiers and generals of the Enlightenment were often Roman Catholic clergy or devout laypeople.

Obscured, But Not Obscure

This is not to say that eighteenth-century Catholicism got slavery—or equality between the sexes, economics, or censorship—right. As with Deists and Protestants, there were Catholic advocates on both sides of each issue, and those identified with what we’d now see as the right positions on these issues were often the exceptions or the revolutionaries.

But it does say something significant. Either all these brilliant people were for some reason blind to the contradictions between their Enlightenment ideals and their faith (which would be hard to believe considering Diderot was sitting across the room and throwing those supposed contradictions in their face) or there was something intrinsic in Catholicism that aligned with, and in many cases inspired, Enlightenment ideas and reforms.

Many of these examples show Catholic enlightenment figures actually ahead of the better-known skeptical, Protestant, or Deist peers.

The latter argument is bolstered significantly by the fact that many of these examples show Catholic enlightenment figures actually historically ahead of the better-known skeptical, Protestant, or Deist peers. Galiani wrote a passionate defense of economic liberalism 20 years before Adam Smith penned The Wealth of Nations; Feijoo’s Defense of Women (1726) preceded the proto-feminist works of Jeremy Bentham and the Marquis de Condorcet by over half a century.

Furthermore, Catholic Enlighteners were not marginal figures, but central to the era. The thoughts of these men and women and the deeds of Enlightened Catholic monarchs and ministers in France, Spain, Portugal, and the Holy Roman Empire echo through history. Catholic Enlighteners seem to be more obscured than obscure, unknown largely due to an English-language educational tradition that presumed that Protestantism and the Enlightenment (and in some more modern versions, full secularization) represented a substantial advance on Catholicism, which was at best a mere evolutionary vestige from the struggle to survive the Dark Ages.

When a Protestant establishment still was ascendant in the United States, revising the understanding of the Enlightenment might have proven just an interesting academic exercise. But as we move into the twenty-first century, Roman Catholics have gone from penniless immigrants to middle-class business owners to arguably ascendant within the establishment. Six of the nine Supreme Court justices and the Speaker of the House are Catholic, as were several prominent 2016 presidential candidates. The time will come when John Kennedy is not an outlier among presidents.

The time is ripe for a reexamination of Catholicism and the Enlightenment, the intellectual movement that laid the foundations for the Constitution.

Meanwhile, the secularization of mainline Protestant elite has left the Catholic newcomers particularly prominent. Likewise, the mainline Protestant educational and cultural institutions are largely secularized and stand in stark contrast to their Catholic counterparts.

On political matters, given what Paul Seabury famously dubbed the “trendier-than-thou” turn in the Episcopal hierarchy, those traditional Protestants who do care about faith in politics are as likely to look to Catholic prelates for representation and advocacy as their own. The time is, in other words, quite ripe for a reexamination of the relationship between Catholicism and the Enlightenment, the intellectual movement that laid the foundations for the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.

Scholarly Commentary Or Popular History?

Given the intrinsic interest and political relevance the topic holds, I wish I could recommend Lehner’s book. Unfortunately, I can’t. The 257-page volume holds out the promise of a great story and explosive history—I knew about only a few of the figures above before I read it. Nevertheless, stylistically and organizationally, it’s a mess.

The 257-page volume holds out the promise of a great story and explosive history, but stylistically and organizationally it’s a mess.

Lehrner doesn’t seem to have been able to choose whether he was writing a scholarly commentary or popular history, and the result hits the sour spot between the two. At critical junctures, the author, a Marquette University professor in religious history, has the annoying habit of referring elliptically to figures he doesn’t introduce. References such as “the great Oratorian and early Catholic Enlightener Richard Simon” go totally unexplained. This is baffling to someone who’s not a subject-area expert. Yet at the same time, we don’t get the granularity or deep dives that an academic volume should provide.

Both of these problems are amplified by the book’s circular structure. Instead of linearly telling the story of Catholic world in the Age of Enlightenment, Lehner has chosen a series of themes around which he centers his chapters—e.g. “Feminism, Freedom, Faith: Catholic Women and the Enlightenment.” Then he breaks down each by nation or sub-topic, and discusses the material therein synoptically. The result is that you read three or four canned little histories of the Jansenist movement in France or analyses of the reforms of the Portuguese minister the Marquis de Pombal without ever having a sense of overall narrative arc. It’s tremendously repetitive, yet disorienting.

Cheapening The Catholic Enlightenment

But its biggest flaw is Lehner’s failure to really probe the “why” in the story of the Catholic Enlightenment. He simply takes for granted that the self-proclaimed Enlighteners really were enlightened, that they were right and their opponents wrong. There’s the occasional nod to the Council of Trent, but no deep dive into the Catholic sources from whence all this thought sprung. The biggest questions are simply begged.

There is no deep dive into the Catholic sources from whence all this thought sprung. The biggest questions are simply begged.

There’s more than a hint as to why: In the introduction, Lehner makes it abundantly clear he sees the Catholic Enlightenment as a forerunner to the Second Vatican Council and the Pontificate of Francis. Need I say that the presentation of Vatican II as a recovery of Enlightenment wisdom after a dark age, his interpretation of the council’s meaning, and the links between it and the agenda of Pope Francis are also begged? Anything “modern” is assumed to be good; anything otherwise, to be cast off.

This cedes an enormous amount of ground. It makes the Catholic faith entirely too vulnerable to fashions of any given time, both then and now. It also diminishes the achievements of the Catholic Enlighteners. By buying into cheap Hegelianism, rather than exploring the tensions between tradition, faith and the world, the author (perhaps inadvertently) winds up characterizing tremendously brave intellectual leaps and theological discoveries as mere acknowledgements of the obvious. At times, you can’t help but get the sense that Lehner feels great saints, statesmen, and theologians all lived and struggled merely to provide anecdotal evidence for conclusions he’d already drawn.

It leaves you wondering who the heck the book’s audience is supposed to be. Who is at the center of the Venn diagram of people who care passionately about Catholic historical precedent, yet feel that adapting that church to the modern world is the right call on everything? The 50-odd academics who signed a letter to the editor in The New York Times last summer complaining that Ross Douthat was accusing them of heresy?

Reconciling Faith And Modernity

The great irony is that this approach—taking one’s cues from the world and the spirit of the times—was exhibited by the Enlightenment-era critics of Catholicism. On it they based their argument that Catholicism was outdated and doomed to obsolescence. The Catholic Enlighteners fought hard, and ultimately successfully, to discern what were the true and enduring elements of the faith—as opposed to mere traditions, which could be outmoded or in error, and then to defend those elements against the passing trends of the time.

Islamic tensions suggest an account of how a traditional faith re-stabilized itself and reconciled with modernity while remaining truly religious, could be useful to readers.

At a time when orthodox faith is yet again under attack from secularizers in the higher reaches of academia and culture, we could use a deeper dive into such an effort, and there could be other, more widespread interest. Islam is struggling both with adapting to the modern world and with a series of radical, democratic, and violent readings of its faith—not unlike Christianity during the Reformation, Wars of Religion, and Enlightenment. An account of how a traditional faith re-stabilized itself and reconciled with modernity while remaining truly religious, and one that did not take the success of this effort for granted, could be useful to readers of other faiths or no faith.

There are times in The Catholic Enlightenment when Uhlrich’s deep knowledge of and love for his subject shine through despite the volume’s weaknesses. His accounts of those in what we’d now call the developing world who passionately embraced the Catholic faith are fascinating. These histories were not emphasized either by old, Euro-centric models or by modern, ethnocentric historians who dismiss the idea that a native Goan or Argentinian Amerindian could fully buy into a non-native faith. But stories from the sublime (there was a flourishing of lay ministers among slaves in Haiti, despite white discouragement) to the ridiculous (the first revolt against European rule in India was plotted by disaffected priests in Portuguese Goa) prove that they could and did.

Indeed, Uhlrich argues persuasively that the peoples of Latin America built educational institutions and Catholic Church hierarchies that made a lasting and underappreciated contribution to what was, as his subtitle argues, a truly global movement.

If nothing else, this book—and even its shortcomings—serve to highlight areas for further inquiry. Fortunately, academia does seem to be noticing this period right now. Let us hope that at some point soon, a better-written book might similarly spark the public’s interest in this period of fascinating stories and significant figures.

"At Emory, Campus Totalitarianism Has Arrived","Universities, once supposedly the great centers of American “liberalism,” have spent decades working their way toward becoming totalitarian monocultures in which only one approved set of political opinions is tolerated. And now they have arrived at their goal.

Last week at Emory University in Atlanta, person or persons unknown went around campus late one night chalking messages on sidewalks in support of Donald Trump for president. It’s an example of perfectly normal campus political activity during an election year, except that there is no such thing as normal life on a contemporary campus any more.

The usual suspects went berserk, with a coterie of protesters marching on the administration building and demanding a meeting with the university’s president, James Wagner, and that he denounce Trump and any pro-Trump students. As one protester complained, Trump “is being supported by students on our campus and our administration shows that they, by their silence, support it as well.” Another declared that the administration is “supporting this rhetoric by not ending it.” Nothing less than full censorship will purge the university of the stain of Trumpism.

Nothing less than full censorship will purge the university of the stain of Trumpism.

Instead of giving these students a good talking to about freedom of speech and the need to toughen up and get used to a world in which other people don’t share their political opinions, Wagner issued a pathetically mealy-mouthed statement, including this great evasion: “During our conversation, they voiced their genuine concern and pain in the face of this perceived intimidation. … [T]he students with whom I spoke heard a message, not about political process or candidate choice, but instead about values regarding diversity and respect that clash with Emory’s own.” He talks about what they “perceived” or the message they “heard,” without evaluating whether any of it was rational or defensible.

It’s pretty obvious what’s wrong with all of this, and the Emory protesters were subjected to fairly widespread ridicule, including from many on the left. The universality of the reaction indicates, thankfully, that we don’t need to waste a lot of time bothering to examine why the student protesters’ reaction is hysterical and illiberal. It is a commentary on the state of mainstream “liberalism,” however, that some people have felt the need to spill a lot of electrons parsing it out in excruciating detail, as if it were a deep and difficult question.

Which brings us to the only really interesting question: if this is so obviously ridiculous, why did it happen?

Take a look at the protesters’ main line of attack. Aiming their protest at the university administration, they shouted, “You are not listening! Come speak to us, we are in pain!” And then consider Wagner’s response, which amounts to declaring that any feelings his students have must be automatically valid because they have them. (Or rather, any feelings they have are valid, if they represent the right campus pressure groups.)

All of this is exactly the template established last fall at the University of Missouri and Yale. At Mizzou, protesters got a university president fired for failing to grovel to them quickly enough; at Yale, they got a university official demoted for daring to mention such outrageous concepts as freedom of speech, tolerance of opposing views, and the university as an “intellectual space.”

Administrators know that when this happens, nobody is going to stand up for them.

If you want to know why Emory’s president didn’t shoot the protesters down immediately and give them a lecture about toughening up, that’s all you need to know. Student protesters on other campuses have already made an example of those who don’t kowtow to their will, and administrators know that when this happens, nobody is going to stand up for them.

Check out a cross-section of the reaction among Emory administrators, and see what I mean. It’s easy to laugh at the “special snowflakes” who whine about being traumatized by chalk. But there’s still some hope for these kids. Someday they will no longer be 19 years old, and many of them will go out into the real world and have a chance to grow up and learn better. What is not a joke is all the 50-year-old administrators who take the 19-year-olds seriously, and the grizzled professors who taught them whole theories about how the political speech of others is a threat that must be expunged.

And there’s one new twist that Emory gives us:

The University will review footage “up by the hospital [from] security cameras” to identify those who made the chalkings, Wagner told the protesters. He also added that if they’re students, they will go through the conduct violation process, while if they are from outside of the University, trespassing charges will be pressed.

It’s official: the campus is now a one-party surveillance state. If you support the wrong political candidate, the security apparatus of the university will be harnessed to unmask you and prosecute you for hooliganism. University totalitarianism has arrived.

As my readers know, I have no love for Trump or what he represents, and the most disturbing part of this story is how it fits into a wider story about the sick symbiosis developing between the authoritarian strains on both sides. If Trump wants to be a strongman threatening unfriendly newspapers with libel laws reshaped to make criticism of him a crime, then these campus protesters are the flip side. It reminds me of the way leftist protesters have begun targeting Trump rallies, deliberately baiting the sucker-punching brutes who are there to support Trump. This is happening because each side wants to be fighting the other, because the existence of the bad guys on the other side can be used to justify their own bad behavior.

But the universities have a 50-year head start in their slide into totalitarianism, and they have just taken a big leap downward in this race to the bottom.

Feminists Need To Do Better Than Donald Trump Knickers,"In a form of protest to Donald Trump’s often rude comments about women, such as this about Fox News’ Megyn Kelly: “You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her… wherever,” the company Bloody Marys is offering underwear that features Trump’s face where the blood lands.

Now, Trump’s comments are a bipartisan offense, but the Etsy creator of the period panties is donating $3 from each pair sold to Planned Parenthood, and offers a variety of mean baby-loving Republican faces you can have decorate your underwear. You can choose your “Blood Dumpster” from a drop-down menu.

While grotesque and infantile, I can’t see how this is a way to hurt Trump or any man in particular. Men often enjoy being infantile and grotesque. Tell a man that you are selling underwear where his face is snuggled right up to lady’s “wherever” and, well, he’s not going to be offended. Tell Trump that and he’ll take it as a badge of honor and probably start touting the sales of said product in his one-hour sit downs with Sean Hannity. One only assumes they aren’t made in China.

The Left Loves Excretions, I Guess

This is just more of the Left’s bizarre obsession with bodily waste that seems so oddly prominent this election. Between the “tampon tax”—which is clearly the major lever holding women back from vast wealth—and the previously insidious $9 copay on birth-control pills, the Left is going to put a whole 15 bucks back in your pocket each month. Equality, here we come!

Perhaps it’s a sign of our nation’s fabulous prosperity that we finally have the leisure time to consider our excrement in excruciating detail.

Combine that with multistate offensive on the horrors of gendered bathrooms, which are keeping this nation from being free or compassionate or something. Wrap it up with a favorite form of protest: the use of feces and urine to support abortions on demand in Texas. Simple conclusion? The Left has a serious excretion obsession. Perhaps it’s a sign of our nation’s fabulous prosperity that we finally have the leisure time to consider our excrement in excruciating detail. If so, one hopes more adversity comes our way just so our discourse may become more civil.

The second feature of this form of protest shows what baffles angry feminists the most. Men. They don’t understand them at all. Men aren’t going to be upset that you put their face on underwear; they aren’t going to hear a word you say if you decide to protest passionately about equal pay while topless. They aren’t going to take you seriously if you think you need the government to get you a raise.

Don’t Left-wing Feminists Have Anything Better to Do?

Even less grotesque but equally oblivious are efforts like actress Emma Watson going to the United Nations to deliver a “game-changing “speech on feminism. These are ridiculous when held to scrutiny. The UN is one of the larger perpetrators of violating women’s rights, with ridiculous acts like naming Iran to a council on women’s rights. Iran leads the world in female executions and recently ordered the hanging a 26-year-old rape victim.

UN peacekeepers also use their clout to commit acts like this:

UN peacekeepers shot dead a 16-year old boy and his father and raped a 12-year-old girl in Central African Republic, Amnesty International has alleged. The claims will intensify pressure on the beleaguered UN mission in CAR, already under scrutiny over its recent handling of allegations of child sexual abuse by French soldiers and its own peacekeepers.



The 12-year-old girl had been hiding in a bathroom during a house search in a Muslim enclave of the capital, Bangui, on 2 August, she told Amnesty. A man allegedly wearing the blue helmet and vest of the UN peacekeeping forces took her outside and raped her behind a truck. She said that he dragged her out of the room, and slapped her when she started to cry. ‘When I cried, he slapped me hard and put his hand over my mouth,’ the girl was quoted as saying by Amnesty.

Or the UN suspending this whistleblower:

A senior United Nations aid worker has been suspended for disclosing to prosecutors an internal report on the sexual abuse of children by French peacekeeping troops in the Central African Republic.



Sources close to the case said Anders Kompass passed the document to the French authorities because of the UN’s failure to take action to stop the abuse. The report documented the sexual exploitation of children as young as nine by French troops stationed in the country as part of international peacekeeping efforts.

This quote from watchdog Paula Donovan is especially damning considering the UN is the lefty go-to for pontificating about rights: “The UN’s instinctive response to sexual violence in its ranks – ignore, deny, cover up, dissemble – must be subjected to a truly independent commission of inquiry with total access, top to bottom, and full subpoena power.” This is the same organization that just days ago condemned only one country for violating women’s rights. Of course, it was Israel.

Whether it’s the low of period panties, excrement-laden protests, tampon taxes, or pontificating while oblivious of the UN’s lack of credibility, left-wing feminists aren’t really moving the ball forward. In fact, they may be setting women back.

Are You Crunchy? Thank Capitalism,"The term “crunchy” refers to the crunching sound of granola. When someone is called “crunchy” it refers to a certain lifestyle focused on living an environmentally friendly life. Think organic food, hiking, gardening with a composter in the backyard, and for moms, cloth diapers, breastfeeding, and maybe a natural birth in your own bathtub.

Generally, the term refers to the more politically, economically, and socially liberal among us. The intersection of liberal politics and the environmental left is in many ways a complete overlap. A good number of us conservatives, however, hide among the organic-kale-munching tree-huggers. We are conservative, but in our spare time can be found beating our bongos in non-partisan drum circles. Unlike our liberal crunchy friends, we know what we can thank for being able to live the lifestyles we chose: capitalism and representative self-government.

You Aren’t Forced to Use Cloth Diapers

My crunchy lifestyle manifests itself in a myriad of ways. Most clearly it is in my role as a mother. I’ve been known to use cloth diapers, which has become a litmus test for how crunchy a mother truly is. If you’re willing to put human excrement in the same washing machine with your clothing (though not at the same time), it’s the ultimate crunchy mother merit badge.

I cloth diaper partially to save money, and partially because I hated creating so much unnecessary waste. While many in Communist countries were or still are trapped cloth diapering out of necessity, those of us living in economic freedom in the West can do so (or not) of our own choosing. Thanks to capitalism, we have a countless number of brands to choose from. New cloth diapering businesses start every year, often from the homes of young entrepreneurial parents looking for the perfect way to cover their baby’s behinds.

Many in Communist countries were or still are trapped cloth diapering out of necessity.

We’ve graduated from the age of prefolds and safety pins, and now cloth diapering families have any number of “systems” to choose from: all-in-one, pockets, or hybrids. If a parent decides to use more environmentally friendly disposable options, there’s any number made out of biodegradable components that break down easily in landfills, and, in the case of at least one, can even be flushed down a regular household toilet.

That latter kind of diaper is offering a 20 percent off coupon in honor of Earth Day, because capitalism. If liberal crunchy parents decide to drive their Prius with Bernie bumper stickers to the airport en route to the socialist paradise of Venezuela, they should be prepared to pack diapers on the capitalist end, because they won’t find any at their destination.

Lifestyle Comforts the World Dreams Of

Childbirth and breastfeeding are yet other ways my personal crunch manifests itself in my life as a mother. I chose my midwife partially because the hospital her practice delivers in has all of the comforts of a hotel. Given a good number of other local hospitals to choose from, hospitals tout the amenities they offer new mothers. I had a large private room with a beautiful view of Princeton and my own shower, and my husband had a full pullout couch to sleep on.

Given a good number of other local hospitals to choose from, hospitals tout the amenities they offer new mothers.

After my children were born, a lactation consultant visited my room in the hospital to help me with first learning how to get my babies to latch on. Had I delivered a baby in Canada, the United Kingdom, or any other country with a socialist healthcare system (as many crunchy liberals wish we had), I would not have had the freedom to choose my care provider or lactation consultants to help me with the basics of breastfeeding. Several women in my community work as freelance lactation consultants. We can thank capitalism for their ability to be entrepreneurial small businesswomen.

Several months ago my son was diagnosed with a possible food allergy to gluten. The diagnosis came after visiting several specialists. Again, thanks to our healthcare system, I was able to shop around to find a doctor who listened to our concerns about his health. Now that he is on a gluten-free diet, I’m shopping in the gluten-free aisles a great deal. Thanks to the explosion of gluten-free eating as a fad diet for the health-conscious, we can buy remarkably well-made and gluten-free pastas, breads, ready-made meals and more.

The supermarket shelves of socialist and communist countries are bare, with only a handful of options. In the United States and across the capitalist West, different kinds of pasta and cereal each take up at least half an aisle in most supermarkets. Are you able to eat free-range eggs, organic kale, fresh juice from your Vitamix, and cruelty-free meat? Be thankful you live in a country that boasts more economic freedom than most.

Thank Freedom for Your Self-Expression

One place I sadly won’t be joining my crunchy friends is at political protests. I say sadly because I am secretly a big fan of some of the more catchy chants, and I’m a sucker for a good drum circle. Minus the rapes and squalor, camping out at Occupy Wall Street actually kind of looked like fun.

These protests are possible because we live in a free system of government.

These protests are possible because we live in a free system of government. While the Left spent eight years calling George W. Bush a dictator at protests, they were only able to do so because he was not. These same activists and professional progressive protesters provide the manpower for environmental and economic protests for Greenpeace, minimum wage, union disputes, and more. They are able to express all of these opinions, no matter how misguided, because we live in one of the freest countries in the world.

This Earth Day, as the crunchy among us celebrate the worship of all of the wonders Mother Nature has to offer, we have not only her to thank for the more natural lifestyles some of us may enjoy. We are able to buy Birkenstocks from Germany and a handmade hemp baby carrier, and put bumper stickers of our choosing on any kind of car or bicycle we choose because we live in political and economic freedom.

Melissa Click: Mizzou Fired Me Because I’m White,"Remember Melissa Click, the University of Missouri professor who lost her job after assaulting a student on camera and asking for some “muscle” to help get rid of him? According to Click, her dismissal from Mizzou wasn’t because she attacked a student in a pathetic bid to shut down free speech. Nope. Click says she was fired for being white.

In an interview with The Chronicle of Higher Education, Melissa Click speaks out about being fired from the University of Missouri after threatening a student reporter who was filming a campus protest she was participating in.

“This is all about racial politics,” she said. “I’m a white lady. I’m an easy target.”

Last November, Click became well-known as the media professor who told Mark Schierbecker, a student who was filming the protest, to “get out” of the campus quad where students and some professors were camping out. When he refused, she tried to grab the camera out of his hands and threatened him with “muscle.”

“Hey, who wants to help me get this reporter out of here,” she screamed to the assembled mob. “I need some muscle over here!”

But Click says that’s not at all what happened. According to Click, the headline about the incident should have been “Favorite Professor Fights to Support Black Students on Campus in Dangerous Situation.”

Her actions were fueled by an instinct to protect the black student protestors, Click said:

“Black people love me,” she tells a reporter.



Later, a black woman runs out of the Campus Bar and Grill headlong into an embrace with Ms. Click. It’s one of the protest organizers. Soon three black students surround the former professor. They sound protective. How is she? They’re concerned. They tell her they love her.



An image she returns to, on Facebook, is of black students who interrupted a Board of Curators meeting to protest her firing. One young woman is holding up a sign: “Ain’t Nobody Messin With My Click.”

Click maintains that none of her actions seemed were inconsistent with the way other faculty and staff members were treating the protesters at the time.

“I was in a space where even the chancellor was spending a lot of time,” she told The Chronicle. “There was no reason to think I was doing something that wasn’t sanctioned by the university.”

Here’s how The Chronicle described her supposedly sanctioned actions during the protests:

These are actions and remarks that, by now, she has apologized for countless times — both formally and informally. Some, however, point out that Mr. Schierbecker wasn’t the only one Ms. Click clashed with on the quad. She told a geology professor that questions he directed to the black students were inappropriate, he says, and asked him to leave. And she told two other cameramen they weren’t welcome, flinging mocking comments at one (“Wow, you’re so scary”) and leading the students in a chant to banish the other (“Hey, hey, ho, ho, reporters have got to go!”). Exactly why, many have asked, was the assistant professor there that day taking on such a lead role?

Her husband, who also participated in the Concerned Student 1950 protest at which Click berated and threatened a reporter, said she shouldn’t be punished, because she did the right thing.

“Academia is a place where you can follow your conscience,” her husband said. “Standing up for people who are trying to voice their concerns about their treatment shouldn’t be penalized.”

He did not explain why she apologized “countless times” for activities which Click asserts were allegedly “sanctioned by the university.”

In February, the University of Missouri fired Click. When she filed for unemployment benefits, she was denied. Now she spends her time anxiously looking over her shoulder at the imagined boogeymen stalking her while she shops for groceries:

But her nerves are perpetually on edge. In the dairy aisle of the grocery store, Ms. Click is vigilant. She takes a quick look around as she glances at the flier, then reaches for two packages of shredded cheese on sale.



She imagines someone watching. “Look,” she says in a high-pitched voice. “There’s Melissa Click, using coupons!” But no one is there.

At the end of the day, how does Click reconcile her actions with their consequences?

“I’m not a superhero,” Click said. “I wasn’t in charge.”

Upholding Free Speech Begins At Home,"I don’t talk to my parents much about politics anymore. Like many families across this country we avoid that subject, as it causes more rifts among us than we prefer to acknowledge. Life is simply more pleasant when we ignore the ideological differences that separate us.

It wasn’t always this way, of course. At one time I proudly touted my parents’ values and views. I attended pro-abortion rallies and wore anti-Bush buttons. I stood my liberal ground as best I could (given how little I actually liked politics), and would passionately battle anyone who seemed even remotely conservative. I couldn’t stand hearing opposing views, though, partly because they infuriated me, but mostly because I felt incapable of eloquently defending my side of the debate.

Yet my parents, as liberal as they were—and still are—stood firmly for the First Amendment. They weren’t shy about their disdain for Republicans and conservatives, and they were incredibly vocal for the causes they defended. At the same time, they raised us kids with the belief and understanding that we all—liberal, conservative, man, woman, black, white, or whatever—had the right to our beliefs, values, and voices.

Defending an Opponent’s Right to Speak

I often wondered how they could stomach listening to someone they disagreed with, then to go further to actually defend that person’s right to say such despicable things. Since we’re from Kansas, we were well aware of Fred Phelps and his Westboro Baptist thugs before they ever became national news. We saw them protest school graduations and proms before they ever took to protesting military funerals, yet my parents ensured we kids understood the value of their right to stage those protests and voice their beliefs, no matter how hurtful they were to others.

I regularly heard of the need to protect the speech of groups whose message was detestable.

The ACLU was widely praised in our home, as you can imagine. I regularly heard of the need to protect the speech of groups whose message was detestable, such as when ACLU defended the KKK’s right to hold a march in Maryland.

My parents sought to raise us without bubbles. We were well aware that there were people we disagreed with, and while we could certainly think they were complete morons or imbeciles, and while we might have the right to walk out, protest, or voice our own opposition, we had no right to silence them or prevent their views from being voiced.

My parents went beyond this, too, insisting that we needed to seek out knowledge even on topics we found contemptible. When I complained about being expected to know anything about the Bible when I was not a Christian, I was instructed that knowledge should be sought even on topics we disliked so as to help us become well-rounded individuals.

Defend It in Your Classrooms

It’s perhaps no surprise that as a young liberal I loved shows like “The West Wing” and movies like “The American President.” I’m slightly ashamed to admit that I’m still moved by the speech in the latter when President Shepherd defends free speech:

America isn’t easy. America is advanced citizenship. You gotta want it bad, ’cause it’s gonna put up a fight. It’s gonna say ‘You want free speech? Let’s see you acknowledge a man whose words make your blood boil, who’s standing center stage and advocating at the top of his lungs that which you would spend a lifetime opposing at the top of yours. You want to claim this land as the land of the free? Then the symbol of your country can’t just be a flag; the symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest. Show me that, defend that, celebrate that in your classrooms.’

Our classrooms today are far from bastions of free speech, though. We don’t celebrate or defend the rights of everyone to have his or her own views, values, morals, and principles—and to then voice them. No, we demand safe spaces and trigger warnings. We are told that the right to not be offended or hurt by differences in opinions outweighs our right to actually have and speak those differing opinions.

While my left-leaning parents raised us to champion the right of everyone to believe as he or she saw fit and express those beliefs publicly, today’s social justice warrior generation upholds feelings and vigorously fights to keep those feelings from encountering different viewpoints. Seeing 40 percent of my generation believing it’s okay to limit speech if it’s offensive to minorities leaves me wondering what the hell happened in the past couple decades to have caused this shift. This is not what I was taught and raised on—not even on the other side of the ideological aisle.

But our society has changed, even beyond college campuses and this delicate millennial generation. We shake our heads and tsk-tsk the ridiculous actions of butt-hurt students who would rather pull a fire alarm than risk hearing a conflicting viewpoint, but to some extent we all build safe spaces in our social media and our daily interactions.

Setting Personal Boundaries Is One Thing

We may still believe others have a right to their views and opinions, and we might champion their right to express those publicly, yet we also firmly hold to our right to not be burdened by those different opinions. We close ourselves off from views we don’t like. We hide friends and family who disagree with us. We surround ourselves with seemingly like-minded people who bolster our opinions rather than challenge them. We cut ourselves off from learning why those opposite us believe as they do, instead choosing to make assumptions about their stances.

It is our right to self police our circles, to block folks we find insufferable, and to do so as we see fit.

But that is where the real difference is. While most of us are likely to take measures to determine which views we will and will not expose ourselves to, and most of us are more than willing to choose safe topics like the weather and movies to avoid discussing anything that would lead to ideological dysfunction, we would not—hopefully—go to such extreme measures to ultimately silence the opposition we encounter.

We might walk away. We might disengage. We might choose to keep our young kids home from school so they aren’t exposed to a teaching we find contradictory to our values. It is our right to self police our circles, to block folks we find insufferable, and to do so as we see fit. This was that freedom we found in the Internet to decide what information we would digest rather than rely solely on the voices and opinions that landed on our doorstep in the morning.

Yet this isn’t enough for some, such those behind the new Twitter Trust and Safety Council who apparently felt we couldn’t be trusted to manage our own feeds, but needed their brilliant sensitivity and know-better-ness to protect our delicate feelings from such horrifying things as a difference of opinion or value.

Silencing Others Is Another

It’s one thing to protest a speaker whose stance we find appalling; it’s another to work to block them from being able to speak at all. It’s one thing to choose to walk away from a discussion; it’s another to try to silence another’s voice entirely. When we choose the latter routes, what do we teach our children about freedom, respect, and society?

It’s one thing to protest a speaker whose stance we find appalling; it’s another to work to block them from being able to speak at all.

My parents and I no longer share many of the same beliefs, but that’s okay. I am in no hurry to discuss the current election season with them, nor am I all that eager to follow them on social media again. To be completely honest, I’m perfectly content keeping our debates to whether my beloved IPA is better than their preferred imperial stout. I’d rather share laughs about their grandkids’ latest antics than to discuss our different views on the role of government in our daily life.

Yet I hope they understand that while I no longer stand on their political side, and have walked away from most of what they tried to teach me, I will forever appreciate their passion for our shared freedom of speech and their insistence that we kids fight for everyone’s right to not only disagree, but to also equally express our beliefs freely, passionately, and publicly.

Free Speech Doesn't Require Colleges To Sponsor Opponents,"It’s good that many Americans — even unlikely allies Charles Koch and Michael Bloomberg — are rallying to the defense of free speech on college campuses. The freedom to discuss ideas and reasoning is how people discover truth and, hopefully, find a degree of certainty in it.

But it’s important to ensure that our appeals to free speech do not undermine the search for truth. This point is especially important concerning religious colleges, which are founded upon the conviction that certain truths are revealed by God and require assent if we are to better understand our world.

Plenty has been written over the past year about the chaos on college campuses, violent protests against guest speakers, and college students who retreat to “safe spaces” to avoid having their feelings hurt by someone else’s opinion. Campus protests of guest speakers and “offensive” speech this year were so distressing they caused Koch and Bloomberg to join together in a Wall Street Journal column in May.

“Across America, college campuses are increasingly sanctioning so-called ‘safe spaces,’ ‘speech codes,’ ‘trigger warnings,’ ‘microaggressions’ and the withdrawal of invitations to controversial speakers,” the two billionaires lament. “By doing so, colleges are creating a climate of intellectual conformity that discourages open inquiry, debate and true learning.”

The typical reaction from conservatives, often the targets of campus protests, is to jump at the defense of free speech in every instance. Understandably so: most of the campus speech that is curtailed today concerns conservative-leaning ideas that are deemed uncomfortable or offensive by students who have been fed a regular diet of progressive thought.

Some Colleges Have Distinct Missions

It’s unclear if Koch and Bloomberg believe their arguments apply to private religious institutions as well as public universities. Many believe that distinction shouldn’t matter. But the question of who should be invited to speak on campus or receive honors at commencement is different when we’re talking about religious colleges, specifically Catholic colleges and universities.

Catholic institutions have a mission and purpose distinct from secular institutions, outlined by Saint John Paul II in the Catholic Church’s constitution on higher education, “Ex corde Ecclesiae.” A Catholic college is consecrated “without reserve to the cause of truth,” and it commits to act “in accord with its Catholic identity” in every official action or commitment. Both are commitments to truth: to reasoning and open dialogue about human observation and experience, and to God’s revelation. The two are not contradictory; in fact, the Catholic college is more open to truth than modern secular academia, which simply denies religion’s insights.

There is no place at a faithfully Catholic college for the head of Planned Parenthood or a public abortion advocate such as Wendy Davis to proclaim that killing the innocent unborn is a legitimate position. These one-sided advocacy events that blatantly defy the moral teachings of the church have no academic value, do not invite true dialogue on divisive issues, and — from the perspective of a Catholic college that embraces the Catholic faith — could spiritually harm students.

Discussion Is Different from Denial

Such lectures are unwelcome at Catholic colleges not because they’re offensive or “hate speech,” but because they deliberately lead students away from truth. Controversial issues should be addressed at Catholic colleges, which are as committed to reasoning as any secular institution, but it does not serve the cause of truth to promote intrinsic moral evils and outright denials of our faith.

Commenting on Davis’ endorsement of abortion while speaking at the University of Notre Dame last April, Ed Morrissey wrote at the conservative blog Hot Air:

Perhaps Notre Dame is due a half-hearted cheer, but a cheer nonetheless, for its decision to allow abortion advocate Wendy Davis an opportunity to speak on campus. …Notre Dame should have followed Davis’ appearance with someone who could challenge Davis on those arguments and represent church teachings. However, given what has happened at universities and colleges over the last several years, I’ll take a civil forum of heterodox views over the demand for indoctrination of a narrow ideological agenda any day.

Morrissey confuses students’ freedom to follow their consciences and wrestle with even thorny moral issues with a Catholic college’s commitment to seeking and teaching truth. The question is not whether students should be free to weigh various opinions, but whether Catholic colleges should deliberately invite abortion supporters to spew propaganda at Catholic students as long as there is “balance.”

While this type of forum or debate might be entirely appropriate at a secular college — where moral claims can never be held to the light of any certain moral truth — it’s completely irresponsible for a Catholic college to knowingly persuade students of heterodox views.

“Ex corde Ecclessiae” extols dialogue, including between faith and reason and “the Gospel and culture.” But it’s the responsibility of a Catholic college — really of any college — to aim this dialogue toward the pursuit of truth. The “privileged task” of a Catholic university, Saint John Paul II pointed out, is “to unite… the search for truth, and the certainty of already knowing the fount of truth.” Accepting that God is the fount of truth necessarily informs everything that we know and believe.

No More Scandalous Commencement Honors

We’re in the midst of college commencement season, and there’s no shortage of outrage going around from students and advocacy groups across the political spectrum. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) calls this time of the year “disinvitation season” due to the numerous protests of commencement speakers and honorees.

Marchese makes the mistake of disregarding the very mission of a Catholic college and its commitment to truth.

FIRE contends we should oppose protests aimed at disinviting controversial speakers to protect the free exchange of ideas: “[U]sing free speech to criticize selected speakers is superior to attempting to get the university to revoke the speakers’ platform,” FIRE’s Chris Marchese wrote in April. Marchese even cited the University of Notre Dame’s decision to honor Vice President Joe Biden with its most prestigious award for American Catholics, given “in recognition of outstanding service to Church and society.”

In promoting a good principle, Marchese makes the mistake of disregarding the very mission of a Catholic college and its commitment to truth. Notre Dame’s choice to honor Biden as an exemplary Catholic is perhaps the most scandalous commencement honor of the year, due to his lifetime of support for abortion and his more recent defense of same-sex marriage and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ contraception mandate.

Bishop Kevin Rhoades of Notre Dame’s surrounding South Bend said the university’s honor of Biden could “provoke scandal” by giving the impression “that one can be ‘a good Catholic’ while also supporting or advocating for positions that contradict our fundamental moral and social principles and teachings.” Rhoades noted the importance of Catholic identity and mission to colleges’ decisions about granting honors.

We Already Know the Truth, So This Isn’t a Search for It

In 2004, the U.S. bishops specifically directed Catholic institutions, including colleges, to not bestow honors on those who defy the church’s fundamental moral teachings. Honors for abortion advocates like Biden, doled out freely by Catholic college administrators, were already inappropriate per “Ex corde Ecclessiae.” But beyond issues of mission and responsibility, it just doesn’t make sense for a Catholic college to hold up someone who is an active and unrepentant champion of immoral activity as a role model for students.

The problem isn’t offensive opinions. The problem is promoting the legitimacy of positions that defy known truths God has revealed.

As Rhoades indicated, these scandalous honors send a dangerous message to students and the greater community. Those who advocate for abortion are not just dismissing some church teaching, they’re denying truth: the truth that human life begins at conception, is created in the image and likeness of God, and has an inviolable right to life. Unfortunately, many Catholic colleges still honor those who deny the sacred dignity of human life.

The recent string of platforms and honors being given to abortion advocates by Catholic colleges sparked 31 Catholic and pro-life leaders to join in a statement reminding college leaders: “There is no sensible appeal to ‘freedom of speech’ or ‘academic freedom’ to justify university-sponsored events or activities that hold up opponents of known moral truths for special honor, as if falsehood and immorality are to be celebrated and not firmly rejected.”

The problem isn’t offensive opinions. The problem is promoting the legitimacy of positions that defy known truths God has revealed, which should guide the formation of students at Catholic colleges. The protests against speakers and honorees at Catholic colleges who are openly opposed to church teaching are not opposed to rational, free speech in the pursuit of truth. Instead, they seek to uphold the mission of Catholic colleges and their dedication to the cause of truth.

Truth is a cause we can all support, respecting disagreement among not only individuals but also institutions that are genuinely committed to increasing and not diminishing wisdom — as so many campus radicals have tried to do.

"Under Pressure, Norway Reunites Seized Children With Family","A child welfare case in Norway that has been grabbing headlines and stirring protests worldwide came to a sudden end late last week.

The story, which I covered in depth for The Federalist in April, centers on Marius and Ruth Bodnariu and their five young children. Marius, a Romanian citizen, and Ruth, a native Norwegian, first ran afoul of Norway’s child protective services (called Barnevernet) in November 2015. After privately interviewing the family’s two oldest daughters at school, Barnevernet abruptly took all five children into emergency custody: first the girls, then the younger boys, and finally the three-month-old baby.

Charges focused on the family’s occasional use of physical discipline (which is banned in Norway), but lawyers pointed to troubling CPS statements about the Bodnarius’ Christian faith, suggesting religious discrimination had also played a role. Despite medical exams and interviews with family members, doctors, and neighbors, Barnevernet was unable to find any evidence of abuse. Still, the children were split up among three foster homes, where they stayed for months with minimal parental contact.

What Came of the International Outcry

What began as one family’s harrowing story soon widened into an overall look at Barnevernet’s practices and raw power. Norwegian law grants enormous authority to local CPS offices, allowing them to seize children, place them in foster care, and even move to terminate parental rights, completely outside the framework of the judicial system and its rules of due process. Moreover, as the BBC documented in its report on the Bodnariu case, the number of children seized by Barnevernet has risen sharply in recent years, with a lopsided impact on children of foreign parents. In many cases, like in Marius and Ruth’s, Barnevernet never even bothered to offer counseling or services designed to keep the family together.

The Bodnarius’ story soon sparked anti-Barnevernet protests at Norwegian embassies and consulates around the world. While Norway defended itself in the press, the Bodnarius’ infant son, Ezekiel, was quietly returned to his parents this April. Still, the local CPS pushed forward with its plan to declare the four older children permanent wards of the state. A final set of hearings—before a non-judicial “County Social Welfare Board”—began on May 30, 2016.

On Friday, June 3, the family website joyously announced the results of those hearings: Barnevernet had finally been forced to drop its case against Marius and Ruth Bodnariu, reaching an agreement to return their children. Because the case was dropped rather than ruled upon, there can be no appeal. After seven long months, Eliana, Naomi, Matthew, and John will finally come home.

According to a lawyer for the family, this outcome was reached after four days of hearings before the five-person county board. On the fourth day, the board encouraged lawyers for both sides to come to a settlement, but they were initially unable to do so. Finally, on Friday, Barnevernet got the hint that the board would likely rule against them. They agreed to drop the case, relinquishing their object of keeping the Bodnariu children in foster care until adulthood. Some of the children will finish out the school year in their foster homes, but the family will be fully reunited by mid-June.

“We are overwhelmed with excitement and indescribable feelings of happiness, to know that the children are finally coming home,” a close family friend told me.

Should Norway Get Credit?

While Norway’s defenders might point to this outcome as evidence that its system worked, Peter Costea, a Texas civil rights attorney who donated hundreds of pro bono hours to the case, vehemently disagrees. “The Norwegian system did not work,” he told me. “But for the international pressure on Norway, the children would not be home with their parents today. They would still be where they were back in November. I’m 101 percent certain of that.”

Costea believes the County Social Welfare Board was likely influenced by an international attorney petition recently submitted to Norway’s prime minister. Signed by more than 100 lawyers and law professors from around the world and members of European Parliament, the petition detailed Barnevernet’s “grievous breaches of domestic and international law,” calling on the prime minister to intervene. This created a stir in the Norwegian media and among government leaders.

“When lawyers talk, politicians tend to pay attention,” Costea said, noting that international protests and media also played a significant role. “I think the members of the County Board saw that the facts of the case stank. But in addition, they are locals—people from this small community in Norway that was receiving all this negative press—and they probably wanted it to end.”

Another advocate for the family gives little credit to the Norwegian government for the outcome of this case. “I am relieved to hear that this nightmare will be over for Marius, Ruth, and their children,” said Mike Donnelly, director of global outreach for Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), a homeschooling and parental rights advocacy group. “But the fact that it took months of international protests to influence Norwegian authorities to release the children—after they had decided to permanently remove them—is evidence of a serious problem in the Norwegian CPS system.”

Dr. Ben-Oni Ardelean, a Romanian senator, believes the enforced secrecy surrounding the case was especially a problem, which international attention helped mitigate. Comparing Norway’s lack of transparency to the tactics of a Communist regime familiar to Romanians, Ardelean concluded, “Sometimes it is difficult to even understand how such a practice has been going on in a country that calls itself democratic.”

The Fight Goes On

As a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), Ardelean has led pushes for real reforms in Norway’s child welfare system. PACE is a statutory organ within the Council of Europe, the continent’s leading human rights organization. On June 2 (the day before the Bodnariu case was resolved), PACE approved Ardelean’s measure to create a draft report considering to what extent Norway’s CPS is violating Council of Europe standards. The report will include recommended legal reforms for Norway and countries with similar CPS systems. Bodnariu family supporters saw this as a remarkable victory, not only for Marius and Ruth, but for all European families unjustly separated by heavy-handed bureaucracies.

Ardelean said he has no intention of letting the matter rest now that the Bodnariu family is reunited, noting “the system is still producing victims.” He and his allies will keep fighting for reforms. “We should be always vigilant,” he said, “and keep sacred the human rights, freedoms, and values in our democratic societies.”

Donnelly echoed the call for vigilance, and not only in Europe. “Regrettably, Norway is not alone,” he said. “Most western countries have CPS systems that are growing into bureaucracies that refuse to respect the family as the basic unit of society. Too many governments are too willing to traumatize children and families over minor disagreements.”

Indeed, as the Bodnariu children return home, their parents will certainly face the challenge of helping them transition and heal from the deep trauma of the past seven months—stolen months of their childhood that are likely to impact their entire lives. Friday’s statement on the family website, while otherwise jubilant, contained a simple request to this effect. Noting that the family is beginning a season of resettling and reintegration, it cautioned: “It is very important for all of us to respect the privacy and uninterrupted intimacy of this family.”

Dyson Is Wrong: Violence In Cleveland Will Solve Nothing,"In The New Republic, professor and civil rights activist Michael Eric Dyson calls for aggressive and potentially violent protests during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. This call to action by an important figure is likely to resonate. If recent riots at Trump events across the country are any indication, Cleveland could turn very ugly, very fast. But both Dyson’s approach to protest and justification for it are wanting. The violence he expects will not galvanize the nation—it will further divide it.

There are reasons to protest Trump, and effective ways of doing so, as I have expressed in these pages. Indeed, Trump himself has fanned these flames, predicting riots and offering to pay the legal fees of fans who become violent. But Dyson’s invitation, even encouragement, for violence plays directly into Trump’s divisive hands. Dyson fails to understand this because he misdiagnoses the country’s current racial strife in important ways.

It’s Not Obamaphobia

Dyson’s central premise is that white fear of a black president is a main cause of the increased racial tension we have seen over the past several years. As he puts it: “They are driven by rage that a black man today still represents a nation that once held black folk in chains, and which still depends on the law to check their social and political aspirations. Barack Obama so spooked the bigoted whites of this country that we are now faced with a racist explicitness that hasn’t emerged since the height of the civil rights movement.”

I recently wrote about the various causes of the rise in explicit racism, including the rise of anti-white rhetoric. White people have gotten the message that they are the root of all evil, and are rejecting that message. Putting that to one side, however: What evidence is there of this racist anti-Obama backlash? It has been a staple belief among progressives since the day Obama took office. But is it real?

A strong piece of evidence against the “racial backlash against Obama” theory is that the 2012 election did not feature anywhere near the heightened racial tension of this year’s contest. Surely four years would have been enough to bring the old-fashioned racists out. It is unlikely that those who did not act out of racial animus towards the president in 2012 suddenly would in 2016.

The fact of a black president is just that: a fact. The president has not become more black; nothing about his status has changed. But clearly something has been changing. Tribalism on all sides has grown, and we no longer believe our neighbors share our values.

The Obama Uncle Tom Myth

The second foundation of Dyson’s call to action has to do with what he perceives as Obama’s unwillingness to put the concerns of black Americans front and center in his administration. It is a strange attack that Dyson and Cornel West have been leveling at Obama for his entire presidency. While some have seen Obama’s beer summit and his statement that his son would look like Trayvon Martin as playing racial favorites, Dyson says Obama has not gone far enough.

It has always been unclear to me what black thinkers like Dyson and West want the president to do. Surely if Obama were to give a full-throated defense of reparations from the Oval Office, for example, it would exacerbate the racial animosity from whites that Dyson points to. But it seems like this is exactly what Dyson wants. Dyson wants white America to admit something, but it may not be something most of white America actually feels or believes.

This is the strange parallax through which Dyson views America. On the one hand, the mere fact of a black president has led to white hysteria, and on the other, the black president has supposedly gone out of his way to appear neutral on race. The center cannot hold these two arguments together.

What Does Dyson Want?

One must assume that Dyson is asking his fellow citizens to join him on the front lines in Cleveland. He expects a police reaction that will compel a violent response from him and his followers. He expects and perhaps looks forward to people throwing rocks, bottles, and Molotov cocktails. He is ready for the violence that will usher in the age of…the age of what? Where does the great mind of the modern civil rights movement think this violence will end?

This is precisely the point at which Dyson’s language comes to mirror Trump’s. Neither makes an explicit appeal to violence, but neither rejects the idea that violence might be needed. Dyson feels that white hegemony justifies his illiberal nod towards mob violence; Trump feels persistent political correctness justifies his nod towards violence. Both Dyson and Trump have long since abandoned the idea that actual dialogue can bridge these gaps. Only militant action can work now.

Let’s imagine that Dyson’s vision of Cleveland comes true. There are violent clashes between police and black protesters; cable news makes millions covering it. One or two new superstars of the movement emerge. Dyson himself mans the barricade, chanting, sweating, and holding his semi-automatic machine gun aloft in the service of justice! If people die, they die. This is bigger than that, this is the future of America, this is… Well? What is it, Dyson? What are you really asking kids to potentially die for?

Let’s Get A Grip

Trump has introduced a toxic level of racial vitriol into American politics. Only his most blind and sycophantic supporters would even pretend otherwise. So it is right and just to protest his troglodytic pronouncements. But there is a right way and a wrong way to do it. Expecting and advocating for violence is exactly the wrong way. It plays into his hands, and alienates white Americans who might otherwise be sympathetic to the concerns of Americans of color.

This is ultimately what Dyson misses about white Americans. We are not predisposed to hate a black president. We are not conditioned to fear and hate the black male body. Our relationship to it is far more complicated than that. It includes Trayvon Martin, LeBron James, Jackie Robinson, Mohammad Ali, Barack Obama and even Michael Eric Dyson. Blackness is not one thing to white people, just as I imagine it isn’t to black people.

If we are talking about a dignified and non-violent protest against Trump in Cleveland, then if I can swing the airfare from Brooklyn, I’ll stand with Dyson. I too believe that Trump has coarsened our rhetoric and poisoned our discourse in ways that might harm racial progress for a generation.

But I won’t surrender to Trump as Dyson has in his breathless column. I won’t accept the race war he offers. I read Dyson’s call to arms in good faith, and I find great fault in it. I hope Dyson will consider my words and amend his justification of violence.

Black Lives Matter’s Violence Undermines Its Credibility,"In the aftermath of police killings of two black men—Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota—Black Lives Matter (BLM)-led protests have sprung up in cities all over the country. While their grievances are clear and compelling, their methods of achieving redress are questionable and may hurt the movement’s long-term goals.

BLM may intend to do the right thing: enlighten the public about injustices within the black community, especially at the hands of law enforcement.

#BlackLivesMatter advocates dignity, justice and freedom. Not murder.



— Black Lives Matter (@Blklivesmatter) July 8, 2016



After the news of Castile and Sterling’s deaths hit the nation, BLM held a protest in Dallas, Texas. Although that protest started out peacefully, it ended in bloodshed when a gunman who had a vendetta against white cops murdered five and injured several other on-duty officers.

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick blamed BLM: “I do blame people on social media, with their hatred toward police. I do blame former Black Lives Matter protests ― last night was peaceful, but others have not been… this has to stop.”

The events in Dallas have set off a firestorm of protests, demonstrating just how livid and unruly the movement has become. Instead of protesting peacefully nationwide and despite condemning the Dallas shooting, BLM is doubling down in its protests, often violently. They shut down an interstate and major thoroughfare in Miami. In Oakland, protestors vandalized a police station with red paint and spray-painted streets, also stopping traffic on an interstate, during which protesters climbed atop a stalled semitrailer. Others lit a bonfire on the freeway.

Even widely viewed photos such as this one hide this aspect of violence, as the woman looks peaceful yet is being removed from a roadway she refused to exit of her own volition in an attempt to keep disrupting traffic.

Violence in Saint Paul

Police pulled Castile and his girlfriend over because he matched the description of an armed robbery suspect (at first media reported it was only for a minor traffic violation). It’s also reported he had a license to carry a firearm. It now appears as though those two pieces of information combined to aggravate an under-trained or trigger-happy officer, as the cop shot Castile four times and he died following the incident. Castile’s girlfriend shot this video live to Facebook, which went viral, fueling BLM to organize an impromptu protest on the streets of the Twin Cities Saturday night.

BLM shut down part of Interstate 94, a major highway in St. Paul, and although it appears to have begun peacefully, some people started throwing water bottles, pieces of concrete, rebar, brick, Molotov cocktails, and rocks at police. At 3:27 in this video you can see a person throwing a small firecracker towards the police. To break up the crowd and push them off the highway, police responded with flash/bang grenades. About 100 protesters were arrested and more than 20 cops were hurt, one with a spinal fracture.

Keep callin y'all. @mayorcoleman release all protesters now. https://t.co/t4UC3Jk2wd

Few people are likely to be sympathetic to Black Lives Matter when they protest police by throwing Molotov cocktails and rocks at them, spurring multiple arrests, then demand to be released.

Snarling At Police Has Got to Be Effective, Right?

Following Sterling’s death on Saturday, caught on video here, BLM protested in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he lived. BLM activist DeRay McKesson tweeted, just before he was arrested, that police were provoking them “for no reason.” But when you watch the clip, the police are walking alongside or escorting the protestors, and the protestors are the ones making snarky insults.

And now the police are pacing the protestors, provoking us for no reason. #BatonRouge https://t.co/bCGmh46x7T



— deray mckesson (@deray) July 10, 2016



When “a few hundred people” attempted to close off a Louisiana interstate, police headed them off and arrested between 30 and 40.

Good Cause, Bad Approach

BLM may wish to be peaceful, well-meaning, strategic, and persuasive, and these violent and disruptive behaviors are the actions of a relative few. Yet when the “few” are attacking police officers, it’s hard to overlook. As Barbara Reynolds, a minister and 1960s activist, wrote last year of the current movement:

Many in my crowd admire the cause and courage of these young activists but fundamentally disagree with their approach. Trained in the tradition of Martin Luther King Jr., we were nonviolent activists who won hearts by conveying respectability and changed laws by delivering a message of love and unity. BLM seems intent on rejecting our proven methods…[A]t protests today, it is difficult to distinguish legitimate activists from the mob actors who burn and loot. The demonstrations are peppered with hate speech, profanity, and guys with sagging pants that show their underwear. Even if the BLM activists aren’t the ones participating in the boorish language and dress, neither are they condemning it.

The BLM movement, unlike King’s, only seem to come out in droves following very specific murders: when white cops kill black people. Yet this is not the major scourge of the black community. Recounting his days as mayor of New York City, when crime was reduced by over 50 percent, Rudy Giuliani noted on Fox News,

Black Lives Matter hasn’t saved nearly as many black lives, if they’ve saved any at all, as I have. Where are they? Where are ‘Black Lives Matter’ when six kids get shot in Chicago by other black kids? The reality is we’re going to end this issue when we get control of the significant amount of violence in urban America within the black community. And it’s the police who are doing that. Black Lives Matter divides us.

Given the videos of the killings of Castile and Sterling last week, it seems clear BLM has legitimate grievances. But if they want to be heard and remembered as a movement that changed racial unrest in America, in line with the success of the 1960s civil rights movement, they must do so without provoking police or inciting violence. Until they can figure out how to do this, their actions will continue to besmirch their reputation and cause.

The GOP Convention Is Just An Empty Media Spectacle,"CLEVELAND — In Balzac’s novel “La Peau de Chagrin,” he attacks nineteenth-century French society for its superficiality and vacuity. He describes a scene at an opera house where no one in the audience is watching the opera itself. They are all looking around to see who is attending, whom they are with, and what they are wearing. The performance itself is ignored. It was a spectacle within a spectacle.

This is what the Republican National Convention is turning out to be. Not because people are looking at one another’s clothes or celebrity-spotting, but because the entire reason for the convention—selecting a candidate behind whom the party can unify—in a sense has ceased to exist. Everyone here is going through the motions, play-acting at nominating a candidate they believe in. The spectacle isn’t the nomination itself. It’s the media and police circus going on all around it.

As Jonah Goldberg pointed out, conventions have been stale and scripted for some time:

…the convention was a failure before it even began. Because most of us have only known political conventions as stage-managed infomercials, we’ve come to think that’s their actual purpose: to throw a grand party for the candidate who won the most delegates. But conventions predate that function by more than a century.

If a convention used to be about picking the candidate everyone could agree on, now it’s become a ceremonial coronation. The purpose, nominating an electable candidate, seems to have dissipated, leaving only the carnival, with featured speakers like Scott Baio and Ultimate Fighting Championship president Dana White.

This time, however, it feels like Donald Trump, with the help of the Republican National Committee and Reince Priebus, is going to crown himself. It evokes the painting by Jacques-Louis David that depicts Napoleon crowning himself emperor, rejecting the traditional role of the pope. This was Napoleon’s way of asserting he would be subservient to no power on heaven or earth.

Big Buzz, No Honey

So too with Trump, as evidenced by the suppression of NeverTrumpers’ effort to force a roll call vote on the convention rules Monday, by far the only moment here that has felt anything like a convention. Also, while the cameras show a packed convention floor of enthusiastic delegates, they don’t pan up to the lackluster attendees sitting up in the stadium seats. I was astonished Monday night to see so many empty seats.

The spectacle within the spectacle also extends to the rallies and protests outside. In the weeks leading up to the RNC convention there was broad concern that violent conflicts would erupt between pro- and anti-Trump groups, with particular fears that neo-Nazi groups would clash with leftist groups, as we saw happen in Sacramento in June.

Some were expecting professional, paid protestors to chain themselves to cement blocks on the freeway, or wrap their bodies with tubes filled with human feces. The Cleveland Fire Department trained its firefighters how to interact with such professional protestors, and organized special “cut teams” to cut them out of chains and other protester impediments. The Lawyers Guild of Ohio sent legal observers scattered throughout the event zone to keep an eye on the police and ensure they’re not violating protestors’ First and Fourth Amendment rights.

But so far, nothing has happened. The legal observers have been sitting idly by, and an acquaintance of mine in the fire department says he’s not been called out of the fire house during his cut team shifts, and has seen little action on his regular shifts.

Nothing to See Here—No, Really

Settler’s Landing, where a pro-Trump rally took place Monday, felt like a concert that booked too large of a venue. The most notable thing about it was that there seemed to be just as many media as rally attendees. While searching the area for people to interview, especially anyone under the age of 45, I found most of them were in fact journalists. Of those whom I did try to interview, at least half declined because they’d just spoken to a dozen other members of the press due to the high proportion of journalists to supporters.

The media, I realized, was just wandering around in a daze trying to find something, anything, to write about. We became the event, not the Trump supporters. The most exciting thing that happened was Eric Andre coming onstage during Alex Jones’ speech, talking nonsense about Jones sleeping with his wife, and Jones awkwardly trying to riff off it.

The protesters who did show up amounted to a few dozen at most. The police outnumbered them because they, like the media, thought there was going to be a clash, some drama, a show. But instead, the spectacle was the long line of cops on either side of the road, shoulder to shoulder, ready for a rowdy crowd that never materialized.

This was more or less repeated the following day downtown at Public Square, the large square near the Quicken Loans Arena, where various activists and protestors have been setting up shop. Here, numbers were stronger and there was a bit more vitriol and anger. But again, the police were so numerous that they almost outnumbered the protestors, many of whom were just your typical far-left and far-right radicals preaching fire and brimstone from both ends of the spectrum—the kind of protestors that might show up at any large event.

In fact, aside from the Trump rally on Monday, it’s been surprisingly hard to find Trump supporters to interview. Almost everyone you run into is either a delegate, a member of the media, or part of the political machine. They’re all there for one another’s pleasure, to make it look like something is going on. But just beneath the surface we know we’re the show, and that nothing is really happening.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/07/21/the-gop-convention-is-just-an-empty-media-spectacle/,2016-07-21
DNC Protests Reveal Another Party In Crisis,"PHILADELPHIA – Now we know why the GOP convention in Cleveland last week was so quiet: the protesters were saving their fire for the Democratic National Convention this week in Philadelphia. Bernie Sanders supporters—along with every stripe of left-wing activist, Baby Boomer hippie, and olive-clad anarchist—are pouring into the City of Brotherly Love. They are not happy, and they mean to be heard.

The City of Philadelphia is bracing for about 30,000 protesters each day of the convention this week, although the activists themselves claim many more will show up. A group calling itself Occupy DNC Convention is planning a major demonstration for Monday afternoon, and there are murmurs of a “million man march” on Tuesday.

An inaugural demonstration that began at City Hall on Sunday afternoon and moved south to FDR Park, near the convention arena, left no doubt that protesters are coming here from all over the country. Many I spoke with had volunteered for Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, either formally or through grassroots organizations, and they felt strongly that it was far more important to protest the nomination of Hillary Clinton this week than to demonstrate against the nomination of Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention last week.

Like Trump, DNC Protesters Think the System Is Rigged

Ironically, the reigning sentiment among most protesters here seems to echo something Trump said in his acceptance speech at the RNC: “the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders—he never had a chance.”

The conversation, chanting, and signage at Sunday’s demonstration conveyed this sense of outrage. For as many Sanders signs and T-shirts on display, there were just as many anti-Clinton placards. One pair of demonstrators carried signs warning “the criminal Clintons must be brought to heel.” Another group loudly denounced Clinton for picking Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine as her running mate, claiming the “conservative” Kaine just confirms that Clinton herself is no liberal. Two men carried a coffin labeled “DNC.” An RV making its way toward the marchers was emblazoned across the side with “Wikileaks” and “Occupy DNC.” One woman told me she had never been involved in politics before, but planned to protest Clinton “because of what they did to Bernie.”

The release of a large trove of DNC emails on Friday by Wikileaks is only adding fuel to the fire, confirming Sanders supporters’ worst fears about their party. The emails reveal how the DNC tried to undercut the Sanders campaign in ways large and small (one official even wanted to smear Sanders for being Jewish). In response, Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced Sunday that she’s stepping down as chair of the DNC, throwing the convention into last-minute confusion.

The Democratic Party Is in Crisis

Up to this point in the election cycle, the national news media has focused more on Trump’s usurpation of the GOP than the simmering civil war within the Democratic Party. This week in Philly, the simmering could easily come to a boil as the left wing of the party asserts its anger and frustration. “We’re here because the nomination was stolen from us,” one thirty-something Vermont woman told me. “Our democracy is rigged.”

Having just watched the GOP nominate a vacuous reality TV star who isn’t actually a Republican, I admit to feeling some sympathy for all these outraged Sanders supporters. With good reason, they feel like the DNC is cramming Clinton down their throats, and they want no part of it.

In fact, they have a better case to make than disaffected NeverTrumpers do on the GOP side. Republican leaders, after all, have only themselves to blame for Trump. They couldn’t stop a plurality of primary voters from casting their lots with a carnival barker who promised to shake things up. In the end, the GOP establishment turned out to be weaker than it seemed: it was unable to stop Trump’s takeover of the party, and now it finds itself in uncharted waters.

The Democrats might also find themselves in uncharted waters before the week is out. But in contrast to the rise of Trump, the impending nomination of Clinton has been rather less democratic, with hundreds of Democratic “super delegates” seemingly having settled the nomination long before all the primary votes were cast. The Wikileaks dump of DNC emails is just more evidence of what many Democratic voters suspected all along: the system was rigged against Bernie—he never had a chance.

What all this will mean for the general election remains to be seen. But this week in Philadelphia will illuminate a reality that the mainstream media has been eager to downplay: the GOP isn’t the only party in crisis. Democratic elites will almost certainly come out of this convention with their preferred nominee. But they will not come out unscathed. They’re about to find out firsthand, as the GOP establishment did, what happens when you ignore your party’s base.

In this case, the base appears to be all-in for the European-style socialism Sanders preached during his insurgent campaign. Whether Clinton can lurch that far left, and whether a majority of Americans will lurch with her, will then become a question as immediate as the legions of angry protesters amassing this week in the streets of Philadelphia.

Bernie Sanders Calls On A Divided Party To Support Clinton,"PHILADELPHIA – The Democratic National Convention is not going as planned. Inside the convention hall Monday night—the first of what will likely be four very long nights for party leaders—large swaths of delegates loyal to Bernie Sanders booed loudly, sometimes angrily, every time Hillary Clinton’s name was uttered from the microphone.

It began right away. When Rev. Cynthia Hale mentioned Clinton in her invocation, groans and booing broke out and soon morphed into chants of “BER-NEE! BER-NEE! BER-NEE!”

The booing and chanting went on like that all night. It didn’t matter who was speaking, Sanders delegates were willing to interrupt anyone—even Sarah Silverman, a stalwart Sanders supporter during the primaries who this night tried her best to sound enthusiastic about Clinton. Sometimes the chanting and booing stopped speakers short, sometimes it rose up after applause for Clinton had died down. But it was always there, casting an awkward pall over what DNC officials were hoping would be, according to the official schedule, “United Together Monday.”

But they weren’t united at all. And Clinton’s name wasn’t the only one that elicited jeers. Almost every mention of Clinton’s pick for vice president, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, elicited cries of protest—especially from the California delegation. “We’re just more progressive, demographically,” said Robert Shearer, an outspoken thirty-something California delegate. He strode around the convention floor giving interviews and holding high a “Never Hillary, Never Trump” placard. And he wasn’t alone.

Clinton Supporters Try to Hold Their Heads High

As the night wore on, one got the sense the DNC was trying to push back. The cheers for Clinton got louder, and speakers kept saying her name (and Kaine’s) despite the booing. Some of them even pushed back. Michelle Obama, probably the only person beside the president who could safely take a shot directly at Sanders supporters, said of Clinton, “When she didn’t win the nomination in 2008, she didn’t grow angry or disillusioned.” Later, she admonished the crowd, “We can’t afford to sit back and hope for the best.”

But it wasn’t enough. They kept up their protestations of Clinton and Kaine. It didn’t even matter if the speakers were Democratic superstars like Cory Booker or Elizabeth Warren. A very visible, and audible, faction of delegates simply would not leave it alone.

For all the discomfort and tension leading up to the night’s big finale, things really got awkward when Bernie Sanders himself took the stage. By then, the stadium was entirely full. When Sanders came out, the crowd went wild.

This time, the chanting went on and on. Sanders stood at the podium, unable to begin. When at length he did, he began by thanking “the hundreds of thousands of Americans who actively participated in our campaign.” He thanked those who contributed “an average of 27 dollars,” and the “13 million who voted for a political revolution”—the supporters who gave him 1,894 delegates. To wild applause, he said, “I look forward to your votes during the roll call on Tuesday night.”

He thanked the people of Vermont. He thanked his family. He thanked President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. He thanked almost everyone. But he didn’t thank Clinton.

Sanders urged his supporters to “take pride in the historical accomplishments we have achieved. Together we have begun a revolution to transform American. And that revolution, our revolution, continues,” he said. “I look forward to being part of that struggle with you.”

Eventually, he got down to the issue at hand and said, “Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States.” The cheering that followed resolved in chants of “BER-NEE! BER-NEE!” When Sanders launched into his pitch for Clinton, the crowd began to thin out.

Kaine: ‘Thumbs in the Eyes of Sanders Supporters’

The DNC’s Bernie Sanders problem isn’t just going away on its own. Flash points abound. Perhaps the biggest one, at least for the Sanders crowd, is Kaine. At a press conference Monday morning, a group calling itself Bernie’s Delegate Network told reporters it’s been conducting online straw polls, asking Sanders delegates their views on a host of issues.

The group’s national coordinator, Norman Solomon, said each poll is getting an average of 275 to 300 responses in a 24-hour period—what he considers “a good sample size” of Sanders delegates. When they asked delegates about Clinton’s VP pick, more than 88 percent responded that Kaine was “unacceptable,” while only 3 percent said the Virginia Senator would be “acceptable.”

“Clinton had the power to move toward unity,” Solomon said. But the choice of Kaine amounted to “political thumbs in the eyes of Sanders supporters.” Asked why the delegates could not just set aside their frustrations for the sake of unity, Solomon replied that the Sanders movement is rooted in “resistance-based movements” of the Left, not the “neo-liberal” policies of moderate Democrats like Kaine. “We’d hoped that Clinton would’ve sought to roll those back,” he said, “but Kaine is a sign of promoting them.”

Hillary for Prison 2016

Adding to the discord inside the stadium were thousands of protesters just outside. Multiple protest marches that began Monday afternoon converged in the evening at FDR Park just as the convention got going.

The protesters, it seems, will be a constant feature of the DNC this year, making a spectacle of all the issues that divide Democrats, from the Trans-Pacific Partnership to Marijuana legalization. But nothing divides them like Hillary Clinton. On Monday afternoon, for the second day in a row, a large group of protesters gathered at City Hall bearing anti-Clinton signs and banners and chanting, “No, no, D-N-C! We don’t want no Hil-la-ree!”

In a moment of supreme irony—one of many to come this week, no doubt—the mob of protesters cheered when a truck drove past bearing a huge sign reading “Hillary for Prison 2016,” which bore the unmistakable logo of Infowars.com—the conspiracy theory website of right-wing celebrity kook Alex Jones. The protesters had no idea. Each time the truck circled back around City Hall for another pass, the protesters gave a hearty cheer and waved signs declaring, “Hillary is the candidate of the war machine.”

More ominously for the Democratic Party, many protesters Monday were decked out in crisp new T-shirts and holding shiny new signs that read, simply, “DemExit.”

Democrats Explain Why They’re Protesting Their Convention,"When I told people I was going to Philadelphia to cover the protests at the Democratic National Convention, they asked the same question over and over: Why do liberals protest aggressively at Democratic conventions, and hardly at all at Republican conventions? Many people assume almost any candidate on the Democratic side should be preferable for progressive protesters to Donald Trump or any other Republican. So why make the party closer to their own interests look so bad?

I decided to ask a cross-section of protesters that question on day one of the convention. The answers I received varied, but also overlapped in some important ways. Almost everyone I talked to mentioned the recently leaked Democratic National Committee emails as a big reason for raising their voices against Hillary Clinton. But most said they had planned on protesting even before those revelations. They assured me the leaks had only confirmed their already deep suspicions.

Nobody I spoke to had anything very nice to say about Trump, but they did not have the same fear of a Trump presidency that many more moderate Democrats, or even anti-Trump conservatives, share. Make no mistake: they viewed Trump as a bad person, but not as the symbol of systemic oppression and corruption they feel Clinton is.

‘They Were Cheating’

Before getting into specific responses, it is important to note this year is not an anomaly. Ever since the 1960s, Democratic conventions have been protested more vigorously than their GOP counterparts. Also, of note this year is the geography. Philadelphia is easily reached by many more people than Cleveland, where Republicans held their convention, and is a more popular destination. Some people I talked to even suggested Cleveland’s gun laws allowing armed protesters may have tamped down participation.

Mary from Washington DC and her friend Ed from Columbia, Maryland, were fairly typical of the older, calmer contingent at the protests. Both were clad in Bernie Sanders T-shirts, and Ed was puffing away on his vape. Mary had volunteered and donated to Sanders throughout the past year and felt the DNC had ill-used her and Sanders.

“We had a candidate and they were cheating,” she said. But she added that her protest was “not about one candidate or the other, but about a revolution.” As is often the case in such matters, Mary was a bit vague about what that revolution would look like exactly, but it clearly included a system less rigged by those in power.

Ed answered my question more directly. “If we had gone to Cleveland,” he said, “it just would have been negativity. This can be more positive.” Both of them agreed that Democrats and the protesters were their “family.” But they also agreed Hillary Clinton is actually a Republican.

This idea that Democrats would be more receptive to protesters’ complaints was a common theme in the answers to my question. It makes sense: while Republicans could simply laugh off their ideas about income inequality and climate change, their demands paint Democrats in more of a corner. Like Hillary Clinton nodding nervously while being lectured by Black Lives Matter protesters several months ago, Democrats must give some level of credence to the causes of the protests.

No Regrets Despite Trump

A group of young women in their twenties who had travelled to Philly from St. Louis for the protests struck a different chord. They held a large red flag, a common sight at the protests, and had a much more defiant view. One sensed their vision of revolution was less metaphorical.

I spoke to Julie and Erin, who both said leftists’ real frustration was with the Democrats, not the Republicans. It wasn’t that they have any positive feelings about Republicans, more that the GOP is so heinous as to be beyond redemption. But when Trump came up, things got interesting.

Julie told me, “Trump is a fascist, but he’s not a politician. Hillary represents neoliberalism.” There was a sense of betrayal in her eyes and voice, as if a perversion of liberalism was a deeper sin than fascism. She went on to accuse Hillary of supporting coups in Central America and committing “femicide.” As we finished up, I asked Erin if she thought Trump could win. She said she did. I asked if that gave her any mixed feelings about protesting Hillary. Both assured me it did not — the same answer I had received to that question from Mary and Ed.

This no-regrets attitude in the face of a potential Trump presidency was common, but not universal. Earlier in the day, I chatted with Del and Michele from Kansas, outside of Philadelphia’s towering City Hall, where a Sanders protest was being held. He sported a Black Lives Matter T-shirt, while hers commemorated the march on Selma.

“The big shots need to hear us and think critically about what we are saying,” Michele told me. “That’s what we need to be a united front.” Del added, “People need to vent.” When I asked if they worried their participation in the protests might help Trump, I got a different reply. Michele winced a bit and began nodding her head. I could see the multitude of implications playing out in her mind. When she stopped nodding, she looked at me and said, “I do, I really do.”

Keeping Their Own Team Honest

Clearly, Hillary Clinton has to hope that in spite of their frustrations, most Sanders supporters take Michele’s balanced approach. Interestingly, unlike the more strident protesters I spoke with, Del and Michele had been in Philly for a different occasion. They were not veteran protesters, and perhaps might better reflect Sanders supporters on the whole.

In the end the question about why liberal protesters are so much more vociferous at Democratic conventions boiled down to the idea that these are the people who are supposed to care.

These are the people who are supposed to be on their team. It would be a mistake to confuse a few thousand dedicated protesters with the millions of Sanders supporters across the country. Many, likely most, will make peace with Clinton’s candidacy. But for the next few days, right across the street from her coronation the masses will be pushing back. How many do they speak for when they chant “Hell, no, DNC, we won’t vote for Hillary” nobody knows. But for a candidate as deeply unpopular as Hillary Clinton, none of this is a good sign.

Furious Sanders Delegates Coordinate DNC Walkout With Protesters Outside,"On the second day of the Democratic National Convention, peaceful but aggressive protests continued outside Philadelphia’s Wells Fargo Center. Inside, hundreds of Bernie Sanders delegates staged a walkout, which culminated in occupying the media tent. At a press conference Wednesday morning, delegate Karen Bernal of the Bernie Delegates Network confirmed that delegates objecting inside had coordinated with protesters outside. She gave no indication Sanders had anything to do with it.

Tuesday’s protests were larger and more vigorous than they had been on the first day of the convention. The harsh level of vitriol against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee remained widespread. Chants of “Lock her up” echoed the same at last week’s Republican convention. Demonstrators also carried signs reading #DemExit, a reference to the Brexit vote, indicating they are finished with the Democratic Party.

There were a few tense moments as some militant protesters scaled the barricades separating them from the convention. Those behind them began shaking the fences, and someone threw at least one water bottle at police. Pepper spray wafted through the air, but things calmed quickly as protest leaders regained some control over the crowd.

A Scene of Controlled Chaos

As night began to fall, word of the delegate walkout spread outside quickly. It seemed protesters were getting reports of the delegates taking over the media tent before that had been reported. Bernal, who was present, said the next day that “millennial” Sanders delegates were texting their movements to friends in the protests outside. Bernal described a generational divide, with younger delegates favoring a move to FDR Park to join the protests, and older ones urging more caution.

Eventually word spread that some delegates had joined the protests and were marching north on Broad Street away from the convention. About 15 minutes later, they met a well-organized southbound Black Lives Matters march at Oregon Avenue, a few blocks away. Here the marches converged, with some white protesters urging BLM to lead the way back to the convention. It was a scene of controlled chaos handled expertly by the Philadelphia police, many of whom were on bikes flanking the march.

After returning to the convention, Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, a favorite among the demonstrators, appeared and attempted to address the crowd. Chants of “mic check” meant to quiet the crowd rang out, and Stein was given a megaphone. But she was more or less inaudible amid the screaming crowd.

Interestingly, Stein had also been present during the delegate occupation of the media tent. This presents the possibility that the Sanders delegates coordinating with protesters outside were also coordinating with Stein, who has emerged as the favorite progressive alternative to Clinton.

Tell Us What You Really Think of Hillary Clinton

Last night’s events come amid Hillary Clinton’s scramble to shore up her left by appeasing Sanders supporters. Despite some significant concessions in the Democratic platform and rules, many Sanders supporters remain skeptical, if not downright derisive of Clinton’s promises to implement progressive policies.

It’s not just the masses outside who have been unimpressed by the convention so far. Bernie Delegates Network is an organization of Sanders delegates who have been surveying delegates. Today they offered some results that look very bad for the Democratic nominee.

BDN asked delegates: “Having heard the speeches at the convention, are you more enthusiastic, less enthusiastic, or unchanged about the Democratic ticket?” Fifty-five percent of delegates reported they were less enthusiastic, with a mere 21 percent saying their enthusiasm had increased. This number has to disappoint a Clinton campaign that feels it bent to Bernie on the platform and filled the stage with a number of progressive speakers.

If there was glimmer of hope for Clinton and the DNC in today’s press conference, it was that Sanders delegates seem unsure of where to go from here. They plan no specific actions, and there appears to be no agreement on whether to accept Clinton’s nomination.

Protesters are protesters—they are by definition more angry and extreme in their views than an average Sanders voter. But the delegate walkout coordinated with protests suggests disaffection with Clinton may be more widespread than mere protesters alone might indicate.

As Tim Kaine, who is deeply unpopular with Sanders supporters, takes the stage to accept the vice presidential nomination he will have to work hard to win back some Sanders folks. Bernal suggested walking back some previous statements about the Trans Pacific Partnership and support for big banks could move the needle. But for now, the schism in the Democratic Party is very real and very wide. Clinton must change that before Americans go to the polls in November.

Did Black Lives Matter Just Oust NYPD’s Police Chief?,"One day after Black Lives Matter protesters attempted to occupy New York’s City Hall Park, one of their central demands was met. With the resignation of Police Commissioner Bill Bratton Tuesday, the group can claim a victory in its effort to transform policing in America’s largest city.



Although Bratton’s resignation had been rumored for some time and he and the mayor deny protests influenced the move, BLM activists toasted the decision today. Republican Staten Island city councilman Joe Borelli says: “Essentially, they got what they wanted. Causation is not relevant, perception is.” The unmistakable perception is that the move, long in the planning or not, is a concession to protesters.

Along with Bratton’s removal, the protesters demanded that the New York City Police Department (NYPD) be disbanded, with its budget redirected to community activism. If, for some reason, the city government refuses to disband the police, protesters demand that “broken windows” policing, first championed by Bratton in the 1990s, be abolished.

Broken windows is a police practice of focusing on small, quality-of-life crimes to stem larger, more violent crimes. Its implementation is widely credited with New York City’s steep drop in crime under former mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg.

Black Lives Matter Protests

Late into Monday night, protesters in City Hall Park gathered and chanted “How do you spell racist? N-Y-P-D,” as NYPD officers looked on. According to some protesters I spoke with, the plan was to stay in the park indefinitely, in the style of Occupy Wall Street. While that did not happen, a large gathering of hundreds did essentially take over the park, which was cordoned off by police and fencing.

The atmosphere swung from jubilant to angry as activists poured out their frustrations over what they view as a racist and corrupt police force. One protester told me “this movement is trying to bring to light stories from people who have no other access to [presenting] information.” But other protesters took a harder line, insisting New York City’s police force was beyond redemption and must be done away with.

By midnight, the protest had mostly dissipated, and a relative calm was restored to the downtown Manhattan neighborhood. According to Gothamist, the protesters left to go to 8 Spruce Street, a privately owned park where approximately 100 stayed the night. There were no arrests.

Mayor Bill de Blasio, a progressive Democrat, was a champion of Occupy Wall Street. While running for mayor in 2013 he said, “Occupy Wall Street pulled the growing crisis of income inequality out into the light of day.” He was also at speaker at the occupation of Zuccotti Park 2011. This makes for an awkward situation, as his city government is now being occupied. Although unlikely to fall to a Republican in next year’s general election, there have been murmurs, specifically from black city leaders, of a primary challenge.

With pressure already building from the black community, Monday’s protests turned the screws a little tighter. Bratton’s resignation Tuesday may well provide an exhaust valve for Black Lives Matter’s anger at the NYPD and mayor. While it is possible Bratton’s decision to step down was already scheduled for Tuesday, its announcement provides a clear victory for those who took to New York’s streets Monday night.

Nobody Elected Black Lives Matter

If the mayor and police commissioner’s decision, or even the timing of the announcement, was influenced by Monday’s protests, it represents a dangerous surrender. Mayor de Blasio was elected to serve New York City, not Black Lives Matter. And nobody elected the latter. Even to allow the appearance that protesters are influencing police policy sends a dangerous message. Handing a big win to people who sing songs about how racist the police are legitimizes that contention.

While many people of all political stripes acknowledge and address growing concerns about police violence towards minorities, succumbing to demands is not a sound policy. That’s especially so when the city has already reduced penalties for many of the quality-of-life or “broken windows” crimes BLM is protesting. How far will de Blasio go to foster the perception that progressive protesters can persuade him?

Giuliani and Bloomberg left de Blasio with a city that, unlike many others such as Chicago, is not suffering from a crisis of violent crime. This didn’t happen by accident. It is the direct result of policing policies that have influenced departments all over the country. It is a result of practices that work. For the city to now begin rejecting police policies that have kept millions safe is a terrible idea that should give Gotham’s voters pause next year.

Police violence is a serious and complicated issue. It deserves full attention, perhaps even protest. But decisions about how to fight crime must never result from or appear to result from frustration and anger. The mayor, who has a history of angering his police force to the point where they have asked him not to attend police funerals, should know better. The timing of this announcement is a smack in the face of the NYPD and a wink and a nod at their fiercest detractors.

Bratton is moving on to a lucrative new job. De Blasio may have calmed some of his critics in the black community. But tens of thousands of New York police officers must watch as those who call them racist and corrupt celebrate the fulfillment of one of their central demands. Out of simple courtesy to those officers and the millions they risk their lives to protect, de Blasio should have waited to have Bratton’s resignation announced. But he didn’t. Surely, today anti-police activists in New York City are wondering: what demand can we have met next?

Tocqueville’s Insights Into Donald Trump’s Identity Politics,"It is now conventional wisdom that Donald Trump is running a so-called “identitarian” presidential campaign. The definitive aspect of his bid for the White House is that it arouses support or enmity in people as a consequence of their racial or ethnic identity.

Doubtless, identity is itself a loaded word, and more flexible in its definition than at first it may appear. (While we’re used to seeing identity as the way we see or announce or perform ourselves, more fully, identity concerns who we’re identical to and in what manner.) But the custom today is to view questions of identity and politics primarily—sometimes exclusively—through the lens of outrage. Identity politics inspires outraged action among in-groups and outraged reaction among out-groups. So Trump, on this view, clearly plays off the identity of aggrieved white people in a way that aggrieves nonwhites.

Obviously there is something to this analysis. It helps us see that Trump is ineffective at running as a champion of the working class because he is running, with whatever degree of intentionality, as something much more like a champion of the white working class. But the lesson here is an old one: in politics, class does not come first in America. Race relations, particularly those defined long ago by race slavery, do.

So it is important to understand in what way Trump’s identitarian campaign is new, or teaches us something new, and for that we should turn to America’s great intermediary between our origins and our future: Alexis de Tocqueville.

The Origins of Distinctly American Culture

It is really not a stretch to say Tocqueville anticipated everything important about how being human and being American have mixed and mingled since he wrote down his assessment of that grand subject. Nevertheless, few know much about his view of how racial and ethnic identity will continue to shape our social and political relations.

One of the reasons for this widespread ignorance is that Tocqueville shaped his discerning judgments around an analytical framework that put America’s religious identity first—first in time, first in logic, and first in importance. To make a very long story exceedingly short, Tocqueville traced the democratic ethos to Plymouth Rock, where the Puritans founded a dominant new culture revealing the brilliant insight that if human affairs are fixed in the realm of religious belief, they may be comfortably thrown open in virtually all other fields.

Politics, economics, business, science, technology, and art may all become realms of not only profound freedom but immense fluidity and change. The heart anchored in faith, the mind and body may range with a dynamism so unprecedented, on a canvas so out of proportion to the insignificant and interchangeable individual of the democratic age, that it attains a new kind of egalitarian heroism or majesty.

But this dominant, dynamic, Puritan-founded American culture was not, of course, the only American culture. There was, to the south, a not-so-pious, not-so-anchored culture ushered in by slavers, opportunists, and scoundrels, as Tocqueville has them. These folk—just as white as their northerly brethren, yet radically different—saw work as basically ignoble, and religion more as a mark of nobility than of reasonableness. By Tocqueville’s lights, America’s founding southerners imported an old, aristocratic culture much more than they founded a new, democratic one.

This great sort—present at America’s creation, and so ineffably persistent through time—mapped onto big ethnic categories. To the north, Yankees of English lineage; to the south, Scotch-Irish; and in the upper Appalachian middle—in the belt of states caught most in the crossfire of the Civil War, where many antebellum voters hoped to avoid a secession crisis by rejecting Abraham Lincoln for the Constitutional Union party—a volatile hodgepodge. (If you’d like proof Tocqueville was not a one-off in this analysis, and that this analytical framework has tremendous force backed by hard data, take a look at “The Cousins’ Wars” by Kevin Phillips, or “Albion’s Seed” by David Hackett Fischer.)

Two Distinct Ethnic Bases

In a world where whites are whites and whites are privileged and that’s the end of it, there’s little room for the insight that flows from Tocqueville’s analytical framework. That’s one reason why so few people have bothered to care lately that Trump’s supposed base of downwardly mobile whites actually includes elements of two separate and distinct ethnographic bases—a Yankee one with Puritan (and, in Britain, Roundhead) origins, and a more southerly one with more aristocratic (and Cavalier) ones.

Adding to the atmosphere of ignorance and incuriosity, the shared whiteness of these two bases is defined utterly by a key phenomenon no longer privileged, and perhaps sometimes punished, as a field of academic study: their shared Protestantism—and the vast gulf between their strains of Protestantism.

To make a long story short again, while northerly Protestantism generally held slavery to be ungodly and southerly Protestantism typically made the opposite claim, both types of Christianity, in Tocqueville’s analysis, prepared their adherents very poorly for the unfolding logic of the democratic age. While Catholicism and Protestantism were both theologically harmonious with the idea of unity in equality, Protestantism proposed that the structure of equal unity was fundamentally unmediated—a creed of me and my God, and none but Jesus come between—while Catholicism admitted (to a fault!) of a whole cosmos of intermediaries and intercessors far in excess of Christ.

However theologians might view these arrangements, Tocqueville the sociologist surmised that the inherent, inescapable stresses of flux, freedom, insignificance, and equality defining the democratic age were apt to place pressures on Protestants that they could not bear without the aid of fellow flesh-and-blood humans embedded in intermediary institutions—the sorts of institutions Protestants say they like, but fail in practice to privilege over their own proud individualism.

Alas, this delinkage of person from person, aggravated by the burdens and blessings found in free and equal everyday life, primes Protestants, on Tocqueville’s reading, for moments of crushing disillusionment and disenchantment that Catholics will be more likely, through the force of habit and mores, to avoid. Mugged by the reality of our interchangeably insignificant lives in free and equal society, Protestants will lose their pride at a stroke. When they fall, they will hit rock bottom.

Where the Two Precisely Diverge: Habit

Beginning to sound familiar? If Tocqueville saw that mainline Protestantism was headed for trouble—and ex-Protestants for even worse—we today ought to clearly recognize how America’s once-dominant creed has crashed and burned in different ways among America’s two different primary, original white ethnicities.

To be clear, there are some serious yet superficial similarities: look at opioid addiction, or suicides, or the numbers on individuals who have dropped out of the workforce, locked into disability, and been required to pay child support. Now look at the massive difference: for northerly whites who have inherited a partially collapsed but stubbornly persistent ethnically English (and theologically Puritan) heritage, ex-Christianity has contributed to a psychic vacuum that ethnic identitarianism cannot fill. For southerly whites with a different ethnic (and theological) profile, identitarianism does offer a salve or substitute for the destruction or diminishment of faith.

The reasons for Trump’s outsized success run deep, all the way to America’s origins and even beyond.

The reasons for this great divergence can be traced in a host of interesting ways, but Tocqueville would advise us to consider just one: habit. Already in “Democracy in America” he warned that one got the feeling Americans were so pious because piety was so popular. When the habit of institutionalized religious practice is interrupted or undermined, the likelihood of a tipping point and a rush to secularism dramatically increases. Despite northerly whites’ greater piety at America’s origins, they reached that tipping point in habits with a speed and surety that more southerly whites still really have not.

The point should now be plain: Trump has attained the success that he has because he uniquely appeals to elements of both America’s primary original white ethnicities—mixing post-Christian, democratic, money-chasing Yankee English values with still Christian, but still honor-and-shame-driven, scoundrel-and-slaver influenced, southerly Scotch-Irish values.

Logically, Trump would probably benefit in places where the ethnicities and their cultures have long mixed. (This is the truth about all the Pennsylvania talk.) But it is a mistake to conflate the two groups into some reified, uniform class. Making this mistake will cause you to imagine, for example, that future Trumpist candidates can catch a growing undifferentiated white populist wave, when in fact such a wave does not really exist and such candidates will very likely not embody the ethnographic sweet spot Trump does.

The reasons for Trump’s outsized success—and, if the pattern of disenchantment Tocqueville identifies holds, his coming outsized failure—run deep, all the way to America’s origins and even beyond. But they are particular reasons that defy abstract generalization. In America, white identitarianism is not only a dubious political platform, but an inadequate framework for political analysis.

Why Is The NFL Enabling Seahawks Anthem Boycotters?,"As we enter the first weekend of the NFL season, the Internet is abuzz with claims that the Seattle Seahawks are planning to protest the singing of the national anthem before their game on Sunday. The Broncos’ Brandon Marshall also refused to stand during the national anthem before last night’s season-opener.

These actions mirror a similar protest by 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick before pre-season games over the past two weeks. Kaepernick’s protest was largely directed at police. The quarterback also chose to wear socks with pigs in police hats to practice.

On Wednesday, Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin Jr. tweeted that critics of the Seahawks plans to protest the anthem couldn’t think logically:

https://twitter.com/DougBaldwinJr/status/773677964588306432

Thursday Baldwin walked back that tweet a bit, describing a vague “demonstration of unity” before Sunday’s game.

https://twitter.com/DougBaldwinJr/status/773969821360754688

Whatever the Seahawks have planned for Sunday, the silence from the NFL over this matter has been deafening. As of this writing, the NFL has made no statement on the Seahawks plans. In response to Kaepernick’s protest, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said, “I support our players when they want to see change in society, and we don’t live in a perfect society. …On the other hand, we believe very strongly in patriotism in the NFL. I personally believe very strongly in that.”

NFL Puts Its Thumb on the Scale

Goodell’s statement suggests players are free to express their social or political viewpoints while in uniform on the field. But another incident this summer showed the NFL taking a much dimmer view of mixing politics and football.

After the tragic murders of five Dallas police officers in July, the Dallas Cowboys asked the NFL if players could wear a decal on their helmets commemorating the officers’ sacrifice. In this case, the NFL did not support its players when they wanted to see change in society. When the Cowboys wanted to send the message that police officers should not be hunted and assassinated, the NFL gave a clear answer: no.

When actor James Woods pointed out on Twitter that the NFL allowed Kaepernick’s protest but did not allow the Cowboys to honor police, Politifact found his claim “true.” They pointed to a league rule that reads: “The League will not grant permission for any club or player to wear, display, or otherwise convey messages, through helmet decals, arm bands, jersey patches, or other items affixed to game uniforms or equipment, which relate to political activities or causes, other non-football events, causes or campaigns, or charitable causes or campaigns.”

On the one hand, rules are rules. On the other hand, each October the NFL honors breast cancer awareness month with players decked out in pink accoutrements for what is clearly a non-football cause. Perhaps celebrating police sacrifice is more political or controversial than fighting breast cancer, but clearly the league could have made an exception. It chose not to.

The NFL Has the Power to Stop This

This leads one to wonder if any rule would allow the NFL to ban players or teams from protesting during the national anthem. Seattle players have First Amendment rights, but so do Dallas players. Besides, the primary issue isn’t one of free speech, since the First Amendment applies only to government actions, and in this instance players are employees subject to private rules they agreed to in their contracts. The latest collective bargaining agreement between the Players Association and the NFL offers some guidance here. Article 51, section 6 says the following:

Public Statements: The NFLPA and the [National Football League] Management Council agree that each will use reasonable efforts to curtail public comments by Club personnel or players which express criticism of any club, its coach, or its operation and policy, or which tend to cast discredit upon a Club, a player or any other person involved in the operation of a Club, the NFL, the Management Council, or the NFLPA.

If it chose, the NFL could use Section 6 to bar players from criticizing the policy of playing the national anthem before games. Clearly, players protesting the anthem are also protesting the league’s decision to play it, and under the agreement the NFL has a right to stop them from doing so, not only during the anthem, but also during interviews.

Whether the NFL should use its authority to ban protests during or before games is a matter of debate. Whether they have the authority to do so is not: they do. The fact remains that while they chose to exercise their contractual right to stop the Cowboys from honoring dead police officers, they have chosen not to do so for those protesting the anthem.

When People Politicize Sports

The NFL and all sports have good reason for keeping politics out of their brand. People of all political stripes can come together for sports. One could easily imagine a situation in which the Cowboys became the conservative, police-supporting team while the Seahawks represent progressive values and support protests against police.

In Europe and South America this politicization of sport happens. Famously, Spanish powerhouses Barcelona and Real Madrid have represented different political factions for decades. In South America, Boca Juniors and River Plate have a similar history. This can lead to violent confrontations and a kind of enmity rarely associated with American sports. Unitas’ conservative Colts versus Namath’s libertine Jets and Joe Frazier’s fights with Muhammad Ali had political undertones, but these are rare exceptions.

So why would the NFL stick to its guns and disallow the Cowboys’ message of support for police while it allows players to protest police by refusing to stand for the national anthem? The answer is likely that while there was some anger at the Cowboys decision, the NFL knew any action against anti-police protestors would meet a liberal media firestorm. Put simply, all the NFL cares about is money and image. Stopping the Cowboys homage didn’t affect that, yet stopping the anti-anthem antics very well might.

There is one more important point to note about the Seahawks’ players “demonstration of unity.” This Sunday is not only the first of the regular season, it is also the fifteenth anniversary of the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001. Sixty officers of the Port Authority of New York, New Jersey Police Department, and the New York Police Department died in the terror attack.

Kaepernick assures us wearing socks with pigs in police caps wasn’t meant to refer to all police, just as racists regularly assure us they aren’t ever talking about all black or brown people. Presumably he and the Seahawks’ players admit there are some good ones. One hopes that everyone respects the sacrifices made by men in civic uniform 15 years ago.

Of all the days of the year, September 11 should be set aside to honor those who serve and protect us, those prepared to run into falling towers to protect their fellow man. If honoring fallen police officers is too political to be part of an NFL game, then the league should rethink whether protesting police during the national anthem should be allowed. If they do allow it, they cannot hide behind the First Amendment. It will be their choice, plain and simple, and a choice we should not soon forget.

"To Help Blacks, Colin Kaepernick Needs To Put Up Or Shut Up","Much has been made recently of Colin Kaepernick refusing to stand for our national anthem to protest what he sees as the oppression of black people. It now appears Kaepernick’s actions have influenced other players, with additional NFL athletes refusing to stand at attention for the anthem, and some even raising the black power fist in protest.

As a black person who is a football fan, I state plainly: this is stupid. The simple reason is the flag, our anthem, and the best parts of America that it represents are not the cause of black people’s problems.

Thus instead of insulting our nation and Americans who actually like what our flag stands for, these NFL athletes should use their money and fame to work towards actual solutions to the black issues they purport to care about. Here are four ways they can do so.

1. Rebuild the Family

The black family is in complete disarray. More than 70 percent of black children are born to single mothers. The studies show that children born to single mothers have worse outcomes in many significant areas compared to those born into stable, two-parent homes. That means our protesting athletes really need to address this problem.

How? They should start advocacy groups and research centers that press state and federal governments to eliminate welfare, housing subsidies, and other government handout programs that destroy incentives to work and eliminate the role of the black father as provider, thus decimating the black family and communities. While some conservative groups already do this, it would be much more powerful and meaningful coming from black NFL players.

Additionally, they should create awards, financial and job incentives, training programs, and counseling and mentorship centers for black men and women who choose to marry and raise their children the right way as married couples. Why not even start an ad or social media campaign around something like “Marriage is cool” or “Marriage pays,” featuring black celebrities who are happily married and showing the various health, economic, and sexual benefits of marriage?

2. Rebuild American Education

It is obvious that public schools in poor, black communities are an abysmal failure, with studies showing the blacker the school, the worse the performance. Protesting athletes should thus use their wealth to start excellent private schools in the poorest black neighborhoods, and then invest in research and collaboration to turn the schools into a national movement.

Studies also show that black kids become less popular as their GPA increases. This unfortunate phenomenon is known as “acting white.” Why can’t protesting athletes be or highlight role models who did well in school, and promote academic achievement? How about national awards and prizes for kids who do excellently in school?

Further, because many children in poor, black areas weren’t raised in loving, intact homes, many have serious problems with work ethic, discipline, attitude, and people skills. That means the educational projects athletes implement will have to include training in the type of soft skills that many poor black kids never got at home and that are not typically taught in schools—such as how to be on time, dress professionally, and speak proper English. All this may seem like a tall order, but given that Kaepernick has a $114 million contract, he certainly has the resources to get started.

3. Rebuild American Jobs

With their combined hundreds of millions of dollars, the protesting NFL players could start a venture capital investment fund that finances innovative entrepreneurs who’ll create jobs in poor, black communities. They could even partner with established venture capital firms for guidance, mentorship, and additional funding.

They could work with Walmart, which has announced a plan to spend $250 billion bringing jobs back to the United States, to develop programs to steer some of the incoming manufacturing to poor black areas, and then train the people in those areas to succeed in these new work opportunities. There are lots of possibilities here with as much money as the protesting NFL men have. It’s time for them to use their fame and fortunes to start serious initiatives to bring jobs to poor black areas.

4. Stop the Killing in Black Communities

Kaepernick says he has a problem with police brutality. But the facts clearly show that black brutality is a much bigger problem than police brutality: approximately 6,000 black people are murdered by other black people ever year, compared to just 300 killed by the police, and even fewer than that killed by white police officers.

Black crime is astronomical. The rate at which black people commit murders is a whopping eight times that of whites—34.4 per 100,000 versus 4.5 per 100,000. Despite being just over one-tenth of the population, black people also commit more than half of all carjackings. Just wrap your head around this reality. We absolutely must end black crime. It kills more Americans than terrorism, by a large margin.

Our protesting athletes should thus leverage their money and fame to end violence in black communities. Some ways they can accomplish this are: buying up drug houses and shutting them down; building up neighborhood security patrols in the most dangerous black neighborhoods, which has been proven to be a low-cost way of reducing crime in several studies; and by raising nationwide awareness of black crime in order to call for help and solutions.

I hope Kaepernick and friends will get to work ASAP on what I’ve outlined here, for the sake of their needy fellow Americans. And stand up for the anthem, for Pete’s sake!

Players Who Protest The National Anthem Should Quit National Teams,"A new feature of NFL pre-game analysis is the discussion of what postures players will take during the national anthem. Will they follow the lead of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and kneel? Will they link arms, like the Seattle Seahawks?

With the NBA pre-season beginning next week, journalists seem more interested in the possibility of anthem protests than in the odds of Cleveland repeating. The league’s two most popular players, LeBron James and Stephen Curry, have already announced their intention to stand during the anthem, while also expressing support for those who choose to protest.

But it’s not only famous players in the biggest leagues getting attention for these protests. Earlier this month, Megan Rapinoe, a midfielder for the Seattle Reign of the National Women’s Soccer League, knelt during the pre-game national anthem. She explained she did so to show support for Kaepernick, and because “we need a more substantive conversation around race relations and the way people of color are treated.”

People reacted to her kneeling more or less the same way they did to Kaepernick’s. Her team did not punish her (apart from still being called the Seattle Reign). Neither did the league. Her teammates supported her. The only unique response was when an opposing team short-circuited her protest by playing the anthem while the players were still in the locker rooms.

But Rapinoe, who is also a member of the U.S. women’s national soccer team, added a layer of complexity to her protests when she knelt before a national team match against Thailand, and again a few days later before a game against the Netherlands.

At this point it’s clear that race relations are a problem in America, as is how police treat too many black citizens. But whatever you think of these athletes’ protests or the appropriateness of their gestures, Rapinoe’s decision to kneel before the national team match is inconsistent with her decision to play on the team in the first place. If her unhappiness with the state of her country prevents her from standing during the anthem, it should also keep her off the field.

I’m Angry at This Country But I’ll Represent It

Before getting into the details of Rapinoe’s status on the national team, a quick look at her explanation for kneeling shows how shallow it is. For one thing, it’s obvious that Rapinoe doesn’t really want more conversation. If, after a year of dialogue, the consensus were that race relations are fine, you can bet Rapinoe would not be satisfied. She really means she wants more people to agree with her: she wants to persuade, and protesting the anthem is her means of persuasion.

She also explains herself by saying that she is “not saying we are not one of the greatest countries in world. Just need to accept that [it is] not perfect, things are broken.” But nobody believes America is perfect, and standing during the anthem does not imply otherwise.

When Republicans stand for the anthem, it’s not interpreted as a tacit approval of President Obama’s executive orders, or the Iran deal, or abortion laws. Conversely, when I see Democrats stand during the anthem, I don’t assume they’re suddenly satisfied with our gun control policies or immigration laws. The “attention means perfection” argument is a red herring.

But the strangest thing about Rapinoe’s protest is that she does it before she spends an entire soccer game representing the nation she’s protesting. As everyone rightly says, she and Kaepernick “have every right” to take a knee. Nonetheless, the implications differ when your team is not a local franchise of a private corporation, but the official team of the nation you’re protesting. At that point, the gesture is insincere at best and hypocritical at worst.

National Teams Represent the Nation, Just Like the Anthem

That’s because of the obvious fact that when you compete on a national team, you represent your nation. National team members set out to prove that their specific country, whatever its faults, excels at that particular competition. Even future Hall of Fame professional athletes are honored to compete in the Olympics for this reason. Ironically for Rapinoe, members of national teams share this representative quality with the flag and the anthem. The banner and song represent America in the sense that they embody elements of American identity and ideals; players do so in that they compete on behalf of the country.

By taking a knee during the anthem, Rapinoe is protesting what the other two symbols represent—a gesture that she proceeds to undermine the moment she takes the field. When she plays for the national team, she is as much a representative of the United States as the flag and anthem she declines to honor before the game.

As Jason Page succinctly puts it, “if you feel that strongly about standing for a national anthem dedicated to your country, then how can you run around for 90 minutes-plus donning those same stars and stripes?” The inconsistency has a mercenary air to it, as if Rapinoe wants to play on one of the world’s best teams without the attendant patriotism.

Call her protest brave if you like; it’s certainly not intellectually consistent. Consistency would mean sitting these games out. That sounds much more difficult than it is—so far she’s only knelt before international friendlies. Glorified scrimmages, they mean nothing for the team’s global standing. Also, the team probably would have survived without her: the United States defeated Thailand 9-0 and the Netherlands 3-1.

I don’t doubt Rapinoe’s sincerity, nor am I dismissing her cause. But if she believes her country does not deserve a basic sign of respect before games, she should refrain from representing it when her team returns to the field next month. That would be a consistent, difficult, and truly brave protest.

Why A Protest Vote For Trump Is Better Than Voting Third Party,"Image Credit Alexandru Nika / Shutterstock

Donald Trump is not going to be president of the United States. As the election winds down, those of us in the Never Trump camp, while wrong about the primary, have been proven absolutely right about the general election. No crowd sizes, enthusiasm gaps, or wave of new voters has emerged to save a candidacy that was doomed from the start.

My greatest fear in regard to the election, a Trump presidency, is not going happen. But my second greatest fear, a Clinton presidency, may well happen. As a voter in safe blue New York I can have no impact on the former—but I can use my vote to influence the latter.

It is very possible that voting for Trump as a protest against Clinton is the best chance I have to stave off a Clinton administration that runs roughshod over the American people and points to us saying, “This is what you asked for.” I understand that maybe a historic landslide is some redemption for the Never Trump GOP. I get that it might, but only might, push Trump’s base toward a more reasonable option in 2020.

That said, a message needs to be sent to Hillary Clinton, Democrats, and the media. For her to enter the White House with a huge mandate is unacceptable. Her flouting of the law, her disregard for the Constitution, the government and media’s unwillingness to hold her accountable for anything, all compel me to send a message with my vote that I do not consent.

The Election Of Repudiation

It is well-documented that the 2016 election features by far the two most unlikable candidates in modern history. One of them has been thoroughly and rightly repudiated. The other is Hillary Clinton. While many on the right have attacked Trump for his temperament, rhetoric, and positions, Democrats largely fallen in line behind their flawed nominee.

A message needs to be sent to Hillary Clinton, the Democrats, and the media.

It is easy and correct to blame Trump and the GOP who nominated him for the pass Hillary Clinton is receiving. The WikiLeaks emails showing incredible and troubling coordination between her candidacy and the Department of Justice, the media and corporations, have been all but ignored because of Trump’s obscene video leak. Curiously, like clockwork, every time a damaging revelation about Clinton appears, something worse, or at least more salacious, about Trump takes center stage.

It doesn’t really matter why this is happening. The result has been that Hillary Clinton’s lawless, reckless, and tasteless behavior has been buried under the avalanche of anti-Trump coverage. As DNC emails themselves make clear, the Democrats knew very well that Trump was the only candidate they were sure to beat. Even Ted Cruz would have been “even money.”

The Morality Of A Trump Vote

My objections to Trump have been strenuous, and I do believe that it is immoral to cast a vote that might put him in the White House. But at this point, there is almost no chance that my vote could help do any such thing. As a New Yorker, my presidential vote has always been essentially meaningless. But even so, I could not convince myself to cast it for Trump. As Clinton and her party’s reckless disregard for the basic tenets of democracy become more apparent, my view is changing.

Hillary Clinton wants to appoint Supreme Court Justices who “understand how the world really works.” What on earth can this mean other than trashing the constitutional rights of Americans if they seem imprudent? I don’t want a justice who says, “Sure, freedom of speech sounds good, but in the real world we have to punish you for certain political speech or anything we consider to be hate speech.” I don’t want a justice who says, “Sure, there’s a right to bear arms, but in the real world there isn’t.”

Hillary Clinton lied when she said she wasn’t Secretary of State when Obama set his red line against Assad using chemical weapons. For some reason that lie wasn’t called out by the moderators. While it is true that she was out of office when he backed down from his idle threat, she has yet to criticize him for this enormous mistake. In fact, she has praised his cowardly and dangerous decision.

The list of Clinton’s positions, practices, and ideas that are simply unacceptable goes on and on. As the threat of a Trump presidency has dissipated, those of us on the right who opposed him are prepared to focus on her glaring inadequacy. For those of us in non-competitive states, a vote for Trump increasingly appears to be the best way to send that message.

Why Not Support A Third-Party Candidate?

If the idea is to keep Clinton from receiving an electoral mandate, then couldn’t a third party vote, still keeping her vote total low, achieve that goal? Perhaps. But if Clinton beats Trump by 8 to 10 points and Gary Johnson puts up 10 to 15 percent, she still has a landslide. And what do conservatives gain from an impressive Johnson showing?

The point is to usher Hillary Clinton into office with a poor showing in which she barely beat the worst candidate in American history.

The point here is to usher Hillary Clinton into office with a poor showing in which she barely beat the worst candidate in American history. We want her looking over her shoulder. We want it to be clear that any sane Republican would have beaten her and that she faces that prospect in four years. She will already be dealing with pressure from the Sandernistas of the far left to abandon the center. Our Trump votes will send the clearest message that such an approach simply will not fly.

We Need to Make Our Protest Votes Count

When the horrible video of Trump jokingly describing sexual assault in an old man’s attempt to seem cool to Billy Bush emerged I felt some sense of vindication. Of course such a video exists—probably many more, even worse videos exist. It was everything that my colleagues and I have warned against come to life. But I felt no joy. Because I realized that Hillary Clinton had just been elected president. And I was a small part of the reason why.

I don’t regret my opposition to Trump. He is neither qualified nor fit to be president. But in choosing him, Republicans gave Hillary Clinton the presidency without a fight, likely the only way she could achieve it. The crisis has passed. As many of us predicted, Trump’s candidacy has imploded in an eruption of awfulness. Hillary Clinton is going to be the president of United States.

Any vote that a Republican casts on Election Day will be a protest vote. Yes, I’m angry at Trump for his war with House Speaker Paul Ryan, I’m angry that he has failed on every level to present himself as a reasonable option for president. But like Ryan, I understand that his loss is not the end of days, and that we need those voters so swayed by Trump back in the GOP next time.

I will cast a protest vote in November. Neither of the two major-party candidates are an acceptable choice. But the purpose of protest is to have influence on policy. I am, and will ever be Never Trump. But in this strangest of elections, while I could never condone him as president, I may well pull the lever to vote for him.

"Almost 500 Years Ago, The Pope Stole Time, And It Made Global Chaos","So it’s October and Reformation Day is just around the corner. You know, that day when Protestants worldwide celebrate justification by faith alone, by grace alone, by Christ alone, all alone, because most of their churches are emptying faster than a runway model’s transverse colon during Fashion Week.

If only this year were next year, because 2017 marks the 500th anniversary of the birth of the Reformation, midwifed by Martin Luther hammering on about something or other (you know how Germans get when Italians are the center of attention). Until that glorious celebration, during which more commandments will be broken than at a Clinton deposition, we will have to settle for Peter Leithart’s new book, “The End of Protestantism.”

Now I haven’t read it, which would be unfair if I were to claim any kind of objectivity in approaching the subject. After all, once you become familiar with a thing, you can only have contempt for it (think the European Parliament or other people’s children), and Leithart, a most amiable and learned chap, deserves better. I will say that I found the dust jacket a bust.

Doctrinal Purity Is My Income Security

Now, if I am reading his thesis off Amazon correctly, Leithart would like the various Protestant denominations to unite on some deeply sacramental level, to form a more cohesive Christ-focused front, now that the “end” of Protestantism—the reform of the church catholic along biblical lines—has more or less been accomplished, except in the very places that needed it most: Rome and Constantinople.

Well, I’m sorry, but count me out. I loathe ecclesiastical onesies. Remember! Doctrinal purity is my income security! Protestantism has broken into denominations that have fragmented into confessions that have fallen into schisms that have collapsed into sects for a reason. What that reason is I have no idea, but I do know that my fragment represents the fullness of the faith, and I can prove it if you’ll only lend me a Bible, an overhead projector, and a gun.

Don’t get me wrong: I’m as ecumenical as the next guy, assuming the next guy is Ian Paisley. “That we may all be one” is a praiseworthy goal if your goal is a bureaucracy just left of a Veterans Affairs hospital. But how can you expect evangelical types, whose ecclesiology is so low you’d have to dig to China to find an altar rail, make common cause with high-church Anglicans and Lutherans, those semi-reformed practitioners of labyrinthine liturgies and baptismal regeneration?

And certainly Protestants as a vague yet cacophonous demographic cannot be expected to co-commune with the Vatican. I realize we live in a time when religious liberty is under attack and that Christians should emphasize what unites rather than what Jesus said. But there are limits.

Now that doesn’t mean there isn’t much to admire about Catholicism. Consider the beauty of its cathedrals (marred by the presence of its bishops) and the wonders of its art (spoiled by the veneration of its subjects). But frankly, a list of Reformation grievances could be extended indefinitely, seeing as it comprises almost the entirety of Protestantism’s reason for being.

The Day the Pope Stole Time

But allow me to single out what is perhaps the greatest of Rome’s crimes against that pristine Christian faith found only in the minds of Southern Baptists. In October 1582, the pope stole time. Yes, time.

By the mid-1570s, the Julian calendar, established in 45 B.C., was ten days behind the real seasons of the year. The spring equinox was taking place on March 12 or thereabouts, and Easter was falling far too late in the springtime.

All this happened because the actual Earth year is about 11 minutes short of the 365 and one-quarter days set by Julius Caesar (which is what got him killed, although I may be mistaken about that). It’s really 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 46 seconds. (And some still argue for creationism.) Had that Julian drift continued to, uh, drift, Easter would eventually have been observed in the summer, with chocolate bunnies melting into mounds of malodorous goo, and Veteran’s Day celebrated sometime during the Eschaton.

So Pope Gregory XIII appointed a commission to tweak the traditional calendar. Under the leadership of physician Aloysius Lilius and Jesuit astronomer Christopher Clavius, two men whose names will live on in Wikipedia and nowhere else, the commission consulted with scientists and clergy, and after wrestling with various ideas for half a decade, it proposed eliminating three leap years every 400 (because math).

That would prevent further creep of the calendar against the seasons (except for a minuscule under-correction). But resetting the calendar so the equinox would come when it was supposed to, in late March, required a more drastic solution: ten whole days would have to be erased, vanished, like journalistic principle from a cable TV news reporter.

The commission sent its report to the pope on September 14, 1580. The pontiff issued a papal bull on February 24, 1582, declaring the new calendar would go into force in October (when there were few holy days and people could actually get some work done). In short, the day after October 4 would not be October 5, but October 15.

Cue the Global Panic

This was short notice, even for Catholic lands ever-eager to comply with Rome. Only Italy, Spain, and Portugal were fully ready by October—you know, those countries known primarily for their efficiency.

Many people thought their lives were being shortened by 10 days and started doubling up on their retirement contributions. The pious worried that saints might not listen to prayers that came 10 days “later” than the traditional saints’ days (saints being a petulant and petty bunch). Everyone’s birthday moved to a calendar date 10 days later, ruining party plans like nobody’s business. Rents, interest, and wages had to be recalculated for a month that had a mere 21 days. Boy, people were stupid back then.

The stalwart Prots in Britain and the Colonies held out for the old ways until 1752, at which point everyone woke up 10 days late for work. And those dentist appointments it took so long to book? Well, these are Brits. What dentist appointments?

As for the Russians, it wasn’t until the rise of the miserable, filthy Communists that they moved to the new calendar, in 1918. But what did they care? Monday, Friday, 1918, 2042. History, that relentless scold, will catch up with you one way or another.

Take This Deal Or Face the Consequences

Now here’s the deal: if we are to find inspiration in Leithart’s call to unity and go so far as to extend the right hand of fellowship to our friends in Rome, I demand a good-faith gesture on the Vatican’s part. As an heir of the Reformation, baptized into the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession, and a nephew to many uncles, I demand the return of those 10 days.

Steal our tithes, steal our peace, steal our childhood—but our time? I think not. Time is a commodity more precious than gold. Sure you can buy time and gold, but you can only pawn one.

Steal our tithes, steal our peace, steal our childhood—but our time? I think not.

I do hereby warn the Roman Catholic Church that if 30 days hence those 10 days have not been returned to the calendar, I will not be responsible for the rioting, the looting, the brazen thievery that characterized much of the English Reformation and is an almost constant state of affairs in certain parts of Naples.

“But won’t we suffer from the same paschal drift that afflicted the ancients?” some smart aleck is no doubt tweeting. “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,” said a guy who thought that still, small voice in his head was God and not his mother-in-law.

Now the present pontiff, Francis, has a reputation for being a gentle soul given to compromise, overflowing with empathy, an almost avuncular figure (assuming your uncle dressed like Liberace’s piano tuner). In short, a scourge to traditional Catholics everywhere.

As His Holiness lets loose with those confounding, off-the-cuff remarks that apparently undo every single dogmatified dollop of Catholic doctrine, could he not come up with one bon mot regarding our stolen time? Could he not, in the interest of peace, return to us our lost days?

Time flies, is eaten up, passes you by—but where does it go? Jersey? Why? The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is in Cleveland. But imagine it returning to you like bread cast upon the waters, which is probably the stupidest thing you can do with bread, but not with a subpoena (trust me on this).

Should Pope Francis still be alive and kicking by the time this plea is made public, that is, if he has not keeled over into his pasta fazool like one of those Renaissance dudes, I, as a self-deputized agent of all Protestantdom, do humbly request that the Vicar of Christ on Earth get off the stick and return to us our 240 hours.

Think it over, Your Holiness. The ball is in your papal court.

And if you could sandwich in those extra days around Thanksgiving, I’d really appreciate it.

"Oklahoma Campus Protestors Hate The Term ‘Sooner,’ Because Racism","Campus protestors at the University of Oklahoma are demanding the sexual assault prevention program “One Sooner” be renamed, charging its incorporation of a long-time state description actually references violence against Native Americans.

The program, which is facilitated by the campus Gender + Equality center, aims to re-educate students to “use their influence on campus to prevent sexual assault and misconduct.”

One campus protestor, an OU junior named Micah Stove, said the name wasn’t inclusive enough “for a program that really does need to be very inclusive to be very effective,” the OU Daily reports.

Protestors’ assertion that “Sooner” is offensive to Native Americans is an odd claim, considering the origins of the term. It started as a derogatory term against white settlers who rushed to grab up land claims before the government officially said then-unclaimed territory was available during the 1889 Land Rush.

Objecting students have yet to settle on a new name for the program, but they are sure they want “One Sooner” to be gone — so sure, in fact, they’ve included the name change in a list of demands.

The demands are in response to OU President David Boren’s comments on sexual assault in an article published by the student newspaper earlier this month. In the article, Boren repeatedly acknowledged preventing sexual assault is very important and that students ought to look out for one another and be careful to not put themselves into dangerous situations on campus.

“We try to really train students about (sexual violence), and you try to also say, ‘Don’t get yourself in a situation where you’re incapable of saying no,’” Boren said. “Can we eradicate the problem? Not any more than we can eradicate human nature.”

Students interpreted Boren’s comments to mean that he was blaming victims of sexual assault. Campus protestors are insisting that he issue a public apology beginning with the words “I believe you” and “it’s not your fault,” or resign.

“Boren’s apology must include the phrase ‘I am sorry,’ because this is how apologies work,” the fourth item on the list of demands dictates.

Boren met with the group of disaffected students last week, and issued a statement saying the meeting was “productive” but he has yet to either apologize or resign.

Ironically, the University of Oklahoma’s teams are the Sooners, so changing the name of the sexual assault prevention group can’t erase the term “Sooner” from the school, its athletic teams, or Oklahoma’s history.

"To Protest Racism, UC-Berkeley Students Block White People From Using Campus Entrance","During a protest to advocate for safe spaces for students of color and transgender individuals, University of California-Berkeley attendees blocked white students from using a highly trafficked campus pathway.

Last Friday, protestors carried banners that read “Fight 4 Spaces of Color,” and linked arms to form a human barricade in front of the campus’s Sather Gate. They only allowed non-white students to pass through.

“Whose university? Our university!” they chanted repeatedly.

One protestor complained there were too many white students in classrooms.

“When you walk into a class, what’s the majority in there?” one student angrily asked.

“I’m telling you, man, this is bigger than you,” a protestor told white student who was being blocked from passing by. “This is about ‘whiteness,’ this is not about you.”

Many white and Asian students were forced to take a dirt path through brush in order to skirt the protestors as they chanted: “Go around! Go around!” The protestors then moved to the student store, where they began to chant “Students over profit!” apparently in objection to the fact the store makes money from the items they sell.

One student climbed on top of a ledge to place an “eviction notice” on a second-story window. The notice insists the store must relocate to another part of the campus and give the building to students of color belonging to the LGBTQIIA+ community, according to Heat Street.

The notice ends with a warning: “If you fail to vacate immediately, community action will continue to escalate with the goal of eliminating any revenue generation.”

The loud protestors then took their chants inside a student union building where students were studying.

The protests eventually moved to block a busy intersection in front of the campus.

This isn’t the first time college students have asked for racial segregation on campus. Last year, UCLA students demanded a separate “Afro-house”exclusively for students of color.

You Can Make Your Protest Vote Count. Here’s How,"The Trump campaign has been tanking this October. Donald Trump’s numbers have been looking poor in almost every national poll. States ordinarily assumed to be red (Arizona, Utah, Indiana) are turning into battleground states as Hillary Clinton takes advantage of her far superior war chest and ground game. It’s still October, and we probably have not seen the last surprise—but as of now it looks exceedingly unlikely that Donald Trump will be our next president.

Bringing out voters to save congressional seats and other down-ballot candidates is one major project of the moment. If conservative voters are so demoralized they won’t come to the polls, we could be slaughtered in state-level competitions, giving Clinton a free hand to enact her progressive agenda.

It can be tough to motivate Trump-hating voters to take the trouble, so one way to sweeten the incentives might be to remind people that they can still make an important statement with their presidential vote, which might influence the quality of future candidates.

It’s Time for Optics Voting

When it comes to actually choosing the president, a sizable majority of votes are, in a mathematical sense, wasted. But we live in an information age. All the votes get tabulated—and the analysts, campaign strategists, talking heads, and amateur political wonks will spend years breaking down the numbers and arguing their significance. Citizens can potentially send some reasonably nuanced messages nowadays through their voting patterns. Isn’t that a good enough reason to stand up and be counted?

If you hate the main-party candidates anyway, discover the joys of optics voting. Vote in a way that promotes the sort of platform and candidates you would like to see in the future. Since we live in a narrative-obsessed political culture, think about the kind of narrative your vote will help craft.

David Marcus has recently argued that at least for him (as a resident of New York State), a Trump vote is the most reasonable form of protest vote. He doesn’t like Trump. But he knows his state has no chance of going red, and he doesn’t want Hillary Clinton to run away with a landslide popular vote.

I can appreciate that position. Admittedly, it’s very non-ideal for Clinton to seize bragging rights to a 10-million-vote runaway win. Still, my hunch is that, given broader circumstances, Clinton isn’t going to have a very strong presidential mandate, regardless of the popular vote. She is widely known to be dishonest and wildly corrupt. She seems to have bullied and perhaps cheated her way to the top of the Democratic ticket, and many of her party’s voters feel resentful and trapped. The public understands that her victory will say far more about the odiousness of Trump than about her own charms.

We should also recognize that statistics can be sliced and diced in a lot of ways, and will be. Third party votes can make a real statement. Let me attempt to one-up Marcus by proposing a more multi-layered take on optics voting.

What Happens After Election Day

Often, in a confusing or demoralizing election, the disaffected simply decide to vote straight ticket, effectively signaling their support for the party without delving into the details of the candidates. Those “generic Republican” memes have been very present in this election as well, as desperate Republicans try to deflect attention from their awful candidate by pointing to the platform.

There’s a problem with that argument. Trump is anything but a generic Republican. Far from promoting the traditional platform, he has jettisoned many of its core components. This is of course part of his appeal for wrathful populists, but it means that numbers will matter when the party deliberates the extent to which Trumpian strategies should be repeated moving forward.

From the standpoint of an analyst, it really will not be clear whether a Trump vote represents a desire to support a more conventional conservative platform, or a wish to blow up the conventional platform. Undoubtedly, millions of conservative voters (supporters of free trade, religious liberty, federalism, and other traditionally conservative positions) are still going to vote for Trump, with varying levels of awareness that he really does not share their views on these matters. No reasonable person will make the mistake of thinking that all votes for Trump can be counted as votes for Trumpism.

Still, many people are already wondering how Trump’s numbers will compare to Mitt Romney’s, or John McCain’s. If Trump’s numbers are approximately similar to theirs, that will be read as evidence that Trumpism has at least substantial appeal. If they’re notably lower, even facing the prospects of a Clinton candidacy, that will increase pressure to revitalize those elements of the conventional platform that Trump sought to discard.

It’s true that any Trump vote will still narrow the gap between Hillary Clinton and (presumably) her closest challenger. But third-party votes get counted too, and in a nutty election like this, those numbers won’t necessarily get lost in the wind. Consider how much noise Evan McMullin has made by closing the gap in Utah. It’s a great story: the Mormons’ Hail Mary pass! People will definitely remember, long after this freak show of an election is past, that the Mormons rejected Trump with vim and vigor.

How To Finesse the Protest Vote

Suppose you want to send the message: I support the Republicans, but I reject both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Please don’t serve up such loathsome candidates ever again. This is quite possible in our statistic-obsessed age. Vote third party for president, and straight-ticket the rest of the ballot.

Already people are showing considerable interest in the gap between Trump’s support and levels of support for more conventional down-ticket Republicans. For instance: here in Minnesota, Congressman Erik Paulsen seems to be doing well even though Donald Trump is not. His opponent, Terri Bonhoff, has tried to use Trump as a millstone to sink Paulsen. But it’s not working.

If this carries through to Election Day, the voters’ message will be loud and clear. We still support conservative policies, but please, no more Donald Trumps. (Minnesota was anti-Trump from the start, handing Trump his first third-place primary finish on Super Tuesday. After their experiences with Governor Jesse Ventura, Minnesotans know better than to fall for the celebrity campaign.)

One dream scenario of mine would show Trump commanding a sizable share of conservative votes in swing states, while tanking catastrophically in non-swing states. Suppose voters in California, New York, or Oregon voted third party at unprecedented rates, while Ohioans and Floridians held their noses and voted for Trump. That would send a powerful message, and even allow non-swing conservatives to give cover to their swing-state-dwelling, Trump-hating companions.

If the Oregonians and New Yorkers defected from the party in especially large numbers, we could reasonably surmise that many Floridians would have liked to do the same, but for their painful sense of duty in desperately trying to stop Clinton. Conservatives in very blue states often feel that their vote doesn’t matter. That’s one way to make it matter.

You Don’t Have to Feel Voiceless On November 8

Of course, it could be that by Election Day, the bottom will have come out completely from the Trump campaign. In that case, we could all focus on optics voting. The silver lining on a Clinton presidency, in that instance, could be a less-tarnished conservative brand. If the voters dump Trump, it will be far easier for the politicians to follow suit. The claim, “Our party was hijacked and it wasn’t our fault” will be far more credible if we telegraph that at the ballot box.

This isn’t only important in the political realm. It matters for the culture wars, too. Already I’ve more or less resigned myself to a lifetime of hearing “But Trump!” any time a conservative objects to a Democratic candidate on character grounds. It’s especially excruciating with respect to religious conservatives, for whom virtue and honor are ostensibly important.

Some will protest that they prefer to focus on issues, and separate politics from cultural battles. That might be your preference. But if you think the public carefully separates politics from cultural issues, you’re dreaming. Already a substantial share of the public has mentally affixed Trump’s face over America’s religiously conservative population, and concluded that we all have the integrity of prosperity preachers and the good sense of snake handlers. It’s not fair, but it’s politics.

Fighting our way back from that will be a challenge, but perhaps a bit less difficult if we don’t overwhelmingly vote for Trump on election day.

Yes, we’re all feeling demoralized about this election. That’s all the more reason, though, to make your vote count. Go to the polls, and vote your conscience. The wonks will make sure that your message is heard.

4 Ways To Vote When There's Nobody To Vote For,"How do you vote in an election when there is no lesser of two evils?

We’re used to having to make a tough choice between candidates we don’t like. But what do we do in a year when there is no basis for making that decision? What about a year when it’s a choice between one pathological liar and another, and between one believer in government power and another?

What do we do when there is no acceptable presidential candidate who has a chance of winning?

If, like me, you find yourself in that position, here are four things to keep in mind as you think about going to the polls (or not) on Tuesday.

1) Vote for none of the above.

Some have suggested adding a “none of the above” option on the ballot, and if it gets enough votes, we get a do-over election. The only real problem with this idea is the risk that “none of the above” would win every single time.

But we already have a “none of the above” option. Show up to vote, but leave the presidential ballot blank. Find something else to vote for. If anybody is looking—and they’ll be hashing out the voting statistics of this election for years—then you will be counted as someone who was engaged with politics and showed up to register your views, but who found all the presidential options lacking.

2) Pursue your political values down the ballot.

Executive power is growing out of control, and that’s likely to get worse under both of the major-party candidates on the ballot this year. But we are still far from being a dictatorship, and the presidency is not the only office with any power. If none of the presidential candidates represent your values, then find somebody or something on the ballot that does. Look at congressional, state, and local races and referendums.

I’ll be showing up to vote to re-elect my congressman, Dave Brat, the libertarian college professor who unseated establishment candidate Eric Cantor in the Republican primaries two years ago. I don’t think Brat is at risk of losing, even in a Democratic “wave” year, which this isn’t. But I’m looking forward to being able to vote for something of which I affirmatively approve.

There are no other races on the ballot; there’s no Senate election for Virginia this year, and state and local elections are held on odd-numbered years. But there are a couple of amendments to the state constitution, including one about “right to work” protections which I will probably vote for.

The most likely outcome on Tuesday is that Hillary Clinton will win the presidency, and she and President Obama have been trying to use this election to roll back big Democratic losses in Congress and state legislatures. The best way to restrain the power of a President Clinton and limit the damage from her victory is to keep the state and national legislatures under the control of the opposition party.

3) Choose your protest vote carefully.

You can always choose smaller “third party” candidates as a protest vote. No, it won’t make a difference to the outcome of the election, but it will have the same impact as a “none of the above” vote. It will help deprive the winner of any sense of having a mandate.

I don’t think you should bother with a write-in vote, or at least don’t rely on it as a way of sending a message to anyone but yourself. Write-ins are too diffuse, dividing too small a vote among too many different names. (I doubt more than a handful of people will follow my idea of voting for the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man.) I have never heard of a write-in campaign being noticed in any way.

Third-party candidates are a better option to register a protest, but be wary. Yes, it can serve as a protest vote, but it can also serve as a vote of approval, not just for the specific candidate, but for the fringe party itself, which can have real practical effects.

That is why I won’t be voting for the Libertarian candidate. Whatever the merits and demerits of Gary Johnson, my vote would not help him because he’s not going to win. But it might help the Libertarian Party. If their presidential candidate gets 5 percent of the vote—just above where he is right now in the polls—the party meets the threshold to receive federal funds in the next election cycle. A government-funded Libertarian Party would be deeply ironic, but they’re not ruling it out.

So a vote for Gary Johnson is a vote to give the Libertarian Party millions of dollars to spend on who knows what candidate in the future. Consider the experience of the Reform Party in 2000, after Ross Perot’s performance in 1996 gave them a big pot of federal funds that was up for grabs. Their 2000 primaries were mobbed by opportunists ranging from Pat Buchanan to David Duke to some guy who believed in transcendental meditation—and, you guessed it, Donald Trump.

If there’s one year the Libertarian Party has proven that they don’t deserve that kind of support, this is it. This was their best opportunity in the party’s entire existence, a year in which the public pretty much despises the candidates for both major parties. Yet the Libertarians couldn’t get their act together and come up with a winning candidate or a winning strategy. If the Libertarian Party can’t succeed this year, they will never succeed. Their political experiment is over, and they deserve less money and attention in the future, not more.

The only option left for me is to vote for Evan McMullin, who is on the ballot in Virginia. No, he has no chance of winning anywhere outside Utah, but if I’m going to cast a futile protest vote—and I haven’t decided on that yet—then I might as well do it for someone whose personality and policies I mostly like.

4) Go on strike.

Then again, who says you have to vote at all? You can always stay home, not out of apathy, but as a way of going on strike against dysfunctional political system. Low turnout is a form of protest vote with a long history.

There are those who will insist that it’s your civic duty to vote. But didn’t your fellow citizens have a responsibility in the primaries to pick candidates who aren’t rotten? If you voted in the primaries for somebody better than these two clowns, you have already discharged your responsibilities as a citizen. If everyone else decided back then to run the country into a ditch, you have no obligation to help them decide which side of the road to crash off of.

Ignore the people who tell you the danger of a Hillary Clinton administration means that it is irresponsible to withhold your vote from their favored candidate over some mere personal qualms about your “principles”—which some people on the Right now consider to be irrelevant. This gets the whole idea of the American system backwards. You don’t answer to the candidate or the parties. They answer to you.

You don’t have to explain why you won’t support a candidate. The candidates have to explain why you should support them. It’s up to them to make you want to vote for them, to offer you an important policy goal, evidence of good character, or at the very minimum some kind of compelling personal narrative that makes you trust them just a little bit not to mess everything up.

If they can’t do that—and man alive, what a disaster that has been this year—then you can just stay home. There is nothing more American than deciding that none of the rotten people who are running deserve your vote.

That’s the final answer for what to do when there’s no one to vote for: forget about this year’s election and work hard to help us get better options next time.

"Sorry, Trump Protestors: This Is What Democracy Looks Like","“This is what democracy looks like!” That was my favorite chant during the anti-war protests I participated in my senior year of high school in 2004. Twelve years later, the same folks I marched down Sixth Avenue with protesting outside the Fox News building are back at it, protesting the victory of Donald Trump.

I’ve got some bad news for the thousands of my former comrades marching through the streets: You saw what democracy looks like on Tuesday night. The election of Donald J. Trump was perhaps unfortunate from your perspective (and truthfully, mine), but he is now our president, and there are no do-overs in a democracy.

The night after the 2016 election, we saw the Bush-era protests, which had taken a hiatus for a Democratic president despite foreign interventions during his administration, reborn for the Trump presidency before it has even begun. The signs, flags, banners were standard far-left fare: Palestinian flags were visible in television coverage, a projector with a message of solidarity for Standing Rock reservation. Anderson Cooper reported hearing chants of “Black Lives Matter” and men holding signs about gay rights were present early in the evening in Union Square.

These Protests Mean Nothing But Anarchy

Twelve years ago I was active in anti-war protests against President George W. Bush’s actions in Iraq (sorry about that, sir, that’s my youthful indiscretion). I was driven from the ranks of groups with words like “solidarity” in their names because of rampant anti-Semitism among those I was marching alongside.

I was there for one reason: I was uncomfortable with our military’s actions in Iraq. I soon learned most of the folks I was marching alongside had a much larger agenda: the destruction of Israel as a Jewish state, a $900 per hour minimum wage (that’s only slightly hyperbolic), free college education, etc. Each protest was aimless, with no clear objective in mind besides anarchy. Chants about Palestine and overheard side conversations made me uncomfortable standing among my fellow progressives as a Jew and a budding Zionist, and soon I dropped out of the movement and began a slow shift rightward.

I was driven from the progressive cause because I came to learn that messages about inclusiveness, love, and respect were contingent upon a very specific set of characteristics one had to already possess. We are seeing that same hypocrisy in the present. Remember long ago, earlier this week, when the winning team was duty-bound to respect the outcome of the election and the fate of the republic rested upon a peaceful acceptance of the results?

You’re Helping Trump, People

A generation raised on participation trophies has changed the rules of the game in the tenth inning, deciding only some electoral results would be honored as valid because losing is not an option. Chants of “not my president” are now heard reverberating through urban centers, shouted by the same folks who just a few days ago were warning of civil unrest when Trump was defeated.

By blocking the streets of Manhattan, Chicago, and more, the progressives who staffed Bernie’s army are proving they still don’t understand the first thing about the Trump phenomenon. The hyperbolic clickbait about losing access to contraception and violence against gays is absurd. During his campaign Trump said many ridiculous things, but fear-mongering about birth control and gay rights is standard fare for the Left. Do they even know what they’re protesting? It’s already unclear.

By painting Trump’s agenda with the same brush they’ve used against the rest of the Republican Party while spending the day smearing every single Trump voter as a bigot, racist, sexist, and more, the only thing these city-wide protests are accomplishing is retroactively moving more supporters into Trump’s camp.

Perhaps we should be thanking these protesters for helping bring us all together, as President Obama and Secretary Hillary Clinton implored we should, to stand behind Trump as he prepares to become president of the United States. As we are reminded of how quickly the Left goes from cheerleaders of democracy to hell-bent on anarchy once again, this “Never Trump” Republican is thinking that perhaps Trump’s supporters were onto something when they started to swing towards their preferred candidate when we watched Black Lives Matters protests tear our cities apart in the last year.

Watch This Anti-Trump Protestor Completely Lose His Mind On TV,"Thousands gathered outside of the Trump Tower on Wednesday night in Chicago to protest Donald Trump’s electoral victory — including one protestor who said Hillary Clinton should sue the United States and declare herself president.

https://twitter.com/xmasape/status/796567576218312704

The protestor told an African-American CNN reporter that because Hillary won’t get to occupy the White House again, his vote only counts for “one-third” of a full vote, a reference to the constitutional three-fifths compromise,which initially only counted slaves (who could not vote) as three-fifths of a citizen for purposes of congressional apportionment.

The CNN reporter calmly responded that Trump won the election fair and square — to which the protestor responded that because Hillary won the popular vote, she should have won the presidency.

“Hillary, you’re a lawyer,” the protestor said. “This country needs you to stand up and walk into the Supreme Court and say: ‘One vote equals one vote!’ What is wrong with that? What’s the debate?”

What’s perhaps the most amusing part of his diatribe is that he’s essentially stating his candidate lost because the system — in this case the Electoral College — was rigged. He’s essentially ripping off Trump’s rallying cry about a rigged and unfair political system, which the Left mercilessly mocked and derided, and running away with it to protest against the president-elect.

He’s not the only one feeling the sadz. The night after Election Day, thousands of protestors marched in opposition to a Trump presidency, and the “hateful rhetoric” surrounding his campaign.

This article has been updated to accurately describe the three-fifths compromise.

The Left Thinks They’re The Only Ones Allowed To Riot,"The acquittal of Ammon Bundy and six others involved in the armed takeover of Malheur National Wildlife Refuge caused a surprising reaction on the liberal side of social media and the blogosphere. After years of defending violent protests, the Left was outraged that members of a group that threatened to “kill or be killed” were not convicted.

At the same time, liberal activists rallied around occupiers who lit fires that torched construction equipment working to install oil pipelines. Then, two weeks later, liberals again rose to defend aggressive protests that arose after Donald Trump was elected president. Who would have thought the Left still opposes violence during protests?

Over the past few years, liberals have condemned police presence near riots, criticized the use of tear gas, and defended or excused protesters’ acts of arson and looting. After all, protests such as those against Trump’s election, Laurel Raymond at Vox wrote, “play an important role in America’s democracy.”

“[I]s rioting so wrong? Riots are a necessary part of the evolution of society,” Darlena Cunha wrote at Time. Robert Stephens II, writing “in defense of the Ferguson riots” in The Jacobin, wrote, “The crowd was not irrational and apolitical. They were attempting to use this opportunity to address their broader political needs.” ThinkProgress quoted a rap group as saying, “Riots work.”

We Like Unrest, Except When We Don’t

Some of those same outlets published outraged articles bemoaning the fact that police hadn’t responded sooner to the violent occupation of the nature reserve, which ended up lasting more than a month. ThinkProgress, which had been concerned about the high cost of bail for people charged with smashing police cars, wrote nothing of the fact that Ammon and Ryan Bundy and their cohorts were flatly denied bail, saying the verdict that they were not guilty was a victory for lawlessness.

I agree. If the Bundy family had a problem with federal land policies, they should have protested peacefully. Picking up guns after your side loses a court ruling, as the pro-Bundy militia did in the earlier standoff on the federal land Bundy had been using tax-free, is an affront to rule of law. The environmental protesters who are trying to block a pipeline that has the proper permits are no different in that they also didn’t respect the results of multiple court cases that ruled against them.

Fires and Molotov cocktails can cause serious injury or death. That the authorities ultimately let Bundy’s militia achieve its goal of stifling the enforcement of the law may have caused them to think they could win again and encouraged Bundy to help with the Oregon occupation. I would have liked to have seen the National Guard called earlier to restore order, but I wonder what liberals, who bemoan the “militarization of police,” would have thought of that?

Liberals Excuse Some People But Blame Others

To excuse the riots there earlier this year, ThinkProgress pointed to “the economic devastation fueling the anger in Baltimore.” Ta-Nehisi Coates, if not defending the Baltimore rioters, at least tried to shift blame by also pointing to factors that “explain” the riots.

It’s hard to find a job, the factories left, people are angry, etc. You could write a sympathetic article about the poor white Trump supporters of western Pennsylvania with this kind of worn-out misery peddling. Indeed, the median income of the Seventh Congressional District ($38,885), where Gray lived, is just about the same as that of Pennsylvania’s Tenth ($35,996), whose representative, Tom Marino, was the first congressman to endorse Trump.

Comparing the Oregon occupiers to the pipeline protesters is, of course, an oversimplification. While more than 100 protesters in North Dakota have been arrested, they have not been tried yet. Nor is it true that all of the Oregon gang got off scot-free. Eleven have pled guilty, and more face trial in 2017.

Disappointing as the recent verdict may have been, it is the nature of the criminal justice system that trials do not always go the ways we wish they would. The government has to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and sometimes they don’t do a good job making their case. Without hearing all the evidence and arguments presented, it’s tough to say definitively whether the jury made the right decision, but if they didn’t it wouldn’t be the first time a jury has made an inexplicable decision not to convict. Due process ought to be a right, not a “privilege.”

So, too, with the Baltimore riots have many of the accused gotten dropped charges, been acquitted, or received relatively light sentences. According to an analysis by Tricia Bishop of the Baltimore Sun, about 450 of the 550 people arrested during the riots have been released without significant charges. Half of those initially charged had charges dropped, and “Most sentences were for a few days.”

The Double Standard Is Based on Leftist Victim Categories

Why does ThinkProgress, et. al seem to have a double standard about violent protests depending on certain circumstances? The militia men were just “attempting to use this opportunity to address their broader political needs,” after all. The headline of ThinkProgress’s article on the acquittals makes clear the reason for their double standard: “White armed occupiers were acquitted. Native American activists were tear gassed.” Vox called the ruling an example of “white privilege in action.”

When police used tear gas to disperse rioters at a Keene State College party and a Ohio State championship celebration, liberals didn’t bemoan the use of riot control tactics. Could that be because the thugs rioting at those universities were mostly white?

Liberals like to compare the Ferguson, Baltimore, and Charlotte riots to the sports riots that sometimes break out after a team wins the championship, but what message are they sending with such comparisons? All riots that destroy innocent people’s property are wrong.

Do they want the Baltimore riots to be treated the same as the riots after the Broncos won the SuperBowl in 1999 and 2016, when “police marched in riot gear and tossed tear gas at fans”?

The Problem Is Identity Politics

To be sure, a number of Republicans who expressed sympathy or even support for Cliven Bundy and the militia also display a certain double standard. Some rural white conservatives privilege identity politics over principled application of standards. It is also worth remembering the last time a Democratic administration aggressively enforced the law against insurrectionists bent on not abiding by the law—Republicans investigated Bill Clinton for the deaths that resulted at Waco and Ruby Ridge when anti-government radicals bunkered down against law enforcement.

If Marilyn Mosby can claim to have “heard your call for ‘no justice, no peace’” when she announced charges against the six officers involved in the arrest and transit of Freddie Gray, then Republican politicians have heard the calls from protesters for less government control of land. Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz expressed sympathy for Cliven Bundy at the time. The Republican Party included in its platform this year a proposal to put some federal lands under the control of the states, and representatives Jason Chaffetz and Rob Bishop introduced a bill with that goal. As they say, “Riots work.”

The problem is identity politics. Principled conservatives would welcome liberals who really wanted to get tough on real crimes, rather than championing the cases of suspects like Sylville Smith, who approached officers with a stolen gun in hand. Conservatives, for their part, shouldn’t champion the causes of delinquents just because they happen to share political or cultural traits.

Unfortunately, groups like Black Lives Matter and Trump’s presidential campaign have worked to harden identity politics on both sides.

Sending Menstrual Blood To Mike Pence Is Stupid And Hurts Women,"It’s beyond me why the Left fears that a man who very obviously loves lots of sex with lots of women wants to ban the birth control that makes such profligate seed-sowing possible by neutering it. Nonetheless, NPR and other Left outlets are reporting that as many as six panicked women have hurriedly scheduled IUD implantations and Google searches about birth control are soaring now that Donald Trump will be president.

NPR goes on to explain that overturning Obamacare, which Trump has promised, would require more women to once again pay for their own birth control. Would that ban contraception? No. It would return us to the horrors of the pre-2010 era, when birth control was…not only legal, but plentiful and even widely taxpayer-subsidized.

Repealing federal mandates for insurance companies to make everyone pay for the birth control that only some women avail themselves of would simply tell women that their reproductive choices are their responsibility, not mine. Yet since these women — and outlets — apparently can’t tell the difference between “nobody can buy this” and “you can buy this if you want,” they’re making a run on spermkillers.

The crazy doesn’t end there. Rachel Zarrell of MTV News (previously of BuzzFeed, natch) has yucky news for Trump’s vice president, Mike Pence.

As someone who has to deal with menstrual blood and finds it about as appealing as changing my babies’ diapers, I am somewhat tempted to just encourage Zarrell in her new campaign. Once you get past the huge yuck factor, it’s kind of hilarious to imagine Zarrell painstakingly collecting the discarded lining of her uterus and packaging it oh-so-carefully, with a vindictive, self-satisfied smile. But then I get sad again to imagine the poor SOB White House mailworker having to open and discard it.

I mean, as anyone who can Google knows, the vice president doesn’t open his own mail. It’s all screened. So the only people Zarrell’s crazy little protest are going to hurt are her and the blue-collar mail workers who will be more motivated to vote Trump and Pence back into office in four years. There’s that 2016 schadenfreude again, where social justice warriors who hate Donald Trump compulsively do things that increase his popularity.

Unfortunately, however, this gets worse, and decidedly unfunny. As wild as it may seem, mentruation-based protests are actually a thing for people besides Zarrell. When Pence as governor of Indiana signed a law that required humane disposals of human remains after abortions or miscarriages, the Twitter account @PeriodsforPence began tweeting its owner’s conversations with staffers in the governor’s office and other icky, juvenile comments. Other Twitter users joined in.

https://twitter.com/andimbleeding/status/717364374663524352

The @PeriodsforPence crank preposterously contended the law would somehow have police digging through tampon refuse to see if the blood flow was actually from a miscarriage instead of a period. (Anyone with any knowledge of police work would immediately know this is folly. Local police can hardly keep up with fallout from the sexual revolution’s broken families. They’re not digging in menstrual waste.) So she sarcastically began calling the governor’s office to report on her periods. Her Facebook page shared transcripts.

Them: “Good Morning, Governor Pence’s office”

Me: “Good Morning. I just wanted to inform the Governor that things seem to be drying up today. No babies seem to be up in there. Okay?”

Them: (Sounding strangely horrified and chipper at the same time) “Ma’am, can we have your name?”

Me: “Sure. It’s Sue.”

Them: “And your last name?”

Me: “Magina. That’s M-A-G-I-N-A. It rhymes with — ”

Them: “I’ve got it.”

*Click*

Way to represent women! You put the “excuse my bitching” in “I’m on my period.” All the other ladies trying to keep up the class and reduce the stereotypes on behalf of ourselves and our sex really appreciate your efforts to promote women’s dignity. Zarrell picked up on Pence’s policy in her recent freakout, too:

Let’s be clear here. The law Pence signed required medical facilities, not women at home, to dispense of human remains they are aware of in a dignified way, rather than just chucking them out with the trash or tipping them into the sewer. Yes, both of these have happened, as have instances where hospitals refused to release to parents their miscarried child’s remains for a funeral.

As any woman who has grieved over a miscarriage, or has grieved with a friend over her miscarriage, can tell you, treating their unborn children like waste products can be deeply hurtful. This law gives them the right to process their grief through a funeral service or other formal ceremony. Since humans have existed we have reached closure over a loved one’s death through ceremonial handling of their bodies. It is a deep and long-standing human need that should not be denied people whose dead loved ones happen to be very small. Families who do not choose this can let the hospital handle their small child’s remains as such rather than waste. It’s a very small thing to ask on behalf of suffering people.

These protesters are painting a false equivalence between unknown, very early miscarriages that women often mistake for periods, which Pence’s law has nothing to do with, and a known miscarriage that a woman is recuperating from inside a medical facility. So their protest is not only ignorant, it’s also shockingly rude to fellow women who are suffering, often deeply. Please, ladies. Develop some empathy for people in tragic circumstances. Your ignorance is making women not only look bad, but hurting us, too.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/11/14/sending-menstrual-blood-to-mike-pence-is-a-stupid-protest-that-hurts-women/,2016-11-14
"If Trump Voters Are Racists, Why Do His Protestors Demand Segregation?","Throughout 2016, Americans were told that Donald Trump’s supporters were a bunch of mouth-breathing losers who were mindlessly following an orange-faced xenophobe. It was impossible for Trump to win because the only reason people might vote for him was to Make America Racist Again, so Hillary Clinton would totally win in a landslide, or so we were told.

Then Election Day came, Trump won by a significant electoral margin, and the media melted down. Everyone was shocked — shocked! — by the billionaire’s win because they hadn’t even attempted to understand the forces that compelled 60 million Americans to cast a vote in his favor.

As Federalist editor Mollie Hemingway pointed out on Sunday, this would be a good time for some humility and self-reflection among the media. Instead, many are now doubling down and insisting that Trump’s support can be attributed to nothing more than a “whitelash.” Others go even further and say his supporters don’t deserve to be listened to because they voted for someone icky.

One such example is a piece by Jamelle Bouie, who made an intellectually lazy case for why all of Trump’s supporters are a bunch of racist knuckle-draggers in a piece entitled “There’s No Such Thing As A Good Trump Voter.” He writes:

Donald Trump ran a campaign of racist demagoguery against Muslim Americans, Hispanic immigrants, and black protesters. He indulged the worst instincts of the American psyche and winked to the stream of white nationalists and anti-Semites who backed his bid for the White House. Millions of Americans voted for this campaign, thus elevating white nationalism and white reaction to the Oval Office. [. . . ] To face those facts and then demand empathy for the people who made them a reality—who backed racist demagoguery, whatever their reasons—is to declare Trump’s victims less worthy of attention than his enablers. To insist Trump’s backers are good people is to treat their inner lives with more weight than the actual lives on the line under a Trump administration. At best, it’s myopic and solipsistic. At worst, it’s morally grotesque.

I’m not going to spend much time attacking the premise of his article — that Trump voters should be put into a corner and ignored because they are all bad. As Federalist publisher Ben Domenech pointed out last week, this kind of talk is what caused the media to end up with egg on their face on election night. Their decision to double down on the “America is racist” narrative will only drive a wedge between media elites and citizens who have legitimate concerns about the direction of this country, rendering their predictions and reporting ultimately useless.

I want to draw attention to something I observed while reading Bouie’s piece. I recently wrote about a group of students at the University of Michigan who are joining nationwide campus walk-outs in protest against Trump’s electoral victory by demanding separate campus facilities for students of color. The group hosting the campus-wide class walkout at the University of Michigan describes themselves as “a group of students who organize to target inequities on our campus,” according to their Facebook page, which displays Black Panthers imagery.

Here’s what they have to say about Trump (emphasis added):

Trump is a product of white supremacy. White supremacy is responsible. . . We reject this white supremacist, this rapist, this xenophobic, Islamophobic, classist, misogynistic, queerphobic, and racist system to have authority over our lives. Trump is a symbol for larger structures of oppression that gave birth to him.

I see little, if any, rhetorical difference between what these student protestors are saying and what Bouie is espousing, which can be summed up as: Trump and his supporters are icky racists.

The purpose of the walk-out and subsequent march is to draw attention to the students’ list of demands, which includes separate facilities for black students to keep them safe from all the white, racist Trump supporters. They’re also calling for special security forces to protect only African-American students, because the Trump-endorsing police can’t be trusted.

“The University of Michigan must provide funding and paid staffing positions for a Black space on campus specifically designed as a recreational and safe space for Black people at the University,” their list states. “Resources for protecting Black students cannot be channeled to University police. The police, as a union, has endorsed Trump. Placing us in the police’s care is an act of anti-Black violence.”

So this is where we are now: campus protestors are demanding black students be segregated from white students to protect them from the Trump supporters who lie in their midst. And liberal media elites, who share more blame for Trump’s path to the White House than they would like to admit, are saying that all of his supporters are irredeemable, racist pieces of trash who deserve to be ignored.

If one thing drove Trump supporters to the polls, it’s that they were ignored and slandered by pundits like Bouie. What’s more, the protests and cry-ins taking place on campuses across the country in response to Trump’s victory suggest that Trump’s supporters will continue to be ignored by the next generation of diploma-holding elites.

The divisions between black and white, haves and have-nots, will continue to get worse if we choose to plug our ears and shout at the 60 million “deplorables” who voted for the president-elect. Media types and social justice warriors must be willing to eat a little humble pie, and stop demanding they be separated from the rest of America, or risk becoming even more out-of-touch and irrelevant than they already are.

12 Ways To #CelebrateMen Instead Of Refusing Sex To Protest Trump,"Gender activists are urging women across the nation to protest the election of Donald Trump by refusing to go to work, buy anything for 24 hours, and care for their families. Some, like the ladies of “The View,” say women should “build a wall around their vaginas” and stop having sex with their husbands as punishment for putting Trump in the White House.

Today’s mass protest is supposed to show how much women contribute to society, and how, without their participation in the economy, everything falls apart. The strike is modeled after a nationwide protest in Iceland in 1975 when 95 percent of the women stopped working and caring for their families to push for greater gender equality. While the strike resulted in some reforms, Iceland has maintained a significant pay gap to this day.

Those leading the protests in 20 U.S. cities this week hope to influence the Electoral College against Trump and empower women and “other marginalized groups” in their fight against “toxic masculinity.” They’re angry, some protestors say, and they want the world to know it.

Not all women agree with these sentiments. Many of us voted for Trump for a variety of reasons, celebrate masculinity, and appreciate all that men contribute to our families and society. We see modern feminism as a divisive and corrupting force that actually undermines femininity, champions big government instead of the individual, and sacrifices liberty, civility, and justice on the fantastical altar of “gender equality.”

Therefore, I propose a counter-protest, or to be more exact, a mass celebration, not only of Trump’s defeat of Hillary Clinton, but of the men in our lives. In honor of those who do so much for us and as a demonstration that we don’t mindlessly stand with feminist malcontents, here are some suggestions for women across the nation. Together, let’s counter anger with appreciation, pride with humility, and hatred with love.

Go shopping and spend lots of money if you have it. Fix a home-cooked meal for your family. If you are religious, gather your family together and thank God for one another. Show up at work. When you get there, go above and beyond. Send your boss a thank-you note telling him how grateful you are for your job. Tell your husband, or any man who is significant to you, at least one thing you appreciate about him. Buy a gift for the special man in your life and surprise him with it. Call your husband and ask him to do something for himself today—get a beer after work, hang out with friends, go to the shooting range, go to the gym, or just have some quiet time when he gets home. Hug your children and tell them how special they are. Throughout the day look for ways you can serve others, not how they can serve you. Take a picture of you giving a kiss or a hug to your husband, boyfriend, father, or son—any man in your life—and post it on social media declaring to the world how much you appreciate them. Or, if you don’t want to post a picture, write something that shows your appreciation of the men in your life or men in your community. Whatever you do, include the hashtag #CelebrateMen. Finally, have sex with your husband! Put behind all complaints, power plays, anger, and bitterness, and love him body and soul!

Approach The Middle East Between Interventionism And Isolationism,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — With the election of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States, we need no reminding that he inherits a disastrous situation in the Middle East where active conflicts in countries ranging from Yemen to Syria to Iraq offer few good policy options to bring them to a successful resolution. In light of these many challenges, what should a conservative approach to the Middle East look like in the Trump era?

Under President George W. Bush the conservative approach become synonymous with what is often described as the neoconservative one: that the United States can and should actively promote the spread of democracy, using force when necessary. Following President Obama’s ascension to the presidency, Republicans split into competing camps.

On one side were those who continued to favor the Bush posture and a strong U.S. position backing the Arab Spring protests, thus advocating for U.S. involvement in overthrowing the governments of countries like Libya and Syria. On the other side were those who advocated a much smaller U.S. presence in the Arab world, contending that America’s foreign policy was at the heart of the ills of the region.

A conservative approach toward the Middle East today should not be a choice between these two extremes: removing ourselves entirely from events in the region, or involving ourselves in every conflict regardless of circumstances so as to not appear “weak.”

Promoting Democracy

The Middle East today presents a frustrating dilemma: the lack of democracy, or more precisely the lack of responsive government that addresses its citizens’ needs, has led to widespread discontent with the political systems in place. At the same time, the violent overthrow of political regimes in a number of countries, often in direct response to that discontent, has led to a power vacuum fueling chaos, sectarianism, Islamic extremism, and humanitarian catastrophe.

Much of the debate about how to address these issues revolves around the concept of democracy. Many in the realist and libertarian camps of the Right have come to view the spread of democracy in the Middle East with skepticism, seeing efforts to promote democracy such as the Iraq War and the uprising to overthrow Bashar al-Assad in Syria as primary causes in the chaos currently enveloping the region. The neoconservative wing of the Right, on the other hand, has maintained that promoting democratic movements serves our interest in the long term, and that Obama’s abandonment of these initiatives as contributing to the dismal situation in the region.

Deep division on the right side of the foreign policy spectrum into competing camps is not new, and defined the transitions within the Republican Party in the 1970s and 1980s. While there is not space here to revisit the debates between those favoring and opposing détente with the Soviet Union then, we Republicans who grew up after the end of the Cold War can look back and see clearly that the Reagan position, not the Kissinger one, was right, and history has shown that quite clearly. This foreign policy drew clear moral lines between Western democracy and the Evil Empire, drew many Democrats over to the Right, at least for a decade, and more importantly freed millions of people from the inhumane tyranny of communism.

However, while some would draw a direct line between the firm position Reagan took against the Soviet Union and, say, intervening in the Syria conflict in an attempt to promote democracy as a solution to the region’s problems, it is important to remember that hardline anti-Communists did not always assume the spread of democracy would be in the United States’ interests. In the late 1950s William F. Buckley, Jr., criticized the left in his book “Up from Liberalism” for mistaking democracy for good governance. Democracy is the means to an end, he argued, not the end in itself.

Subsequently, Jeane Kirkpatrick wrote in her seminal essay “Dictatorships and Double Standards” about the dangers of pushing pro-American dictators to democratize too quickly. Her article has since been read mistakenly as being anti-democracy, but her point was not that a move toward democracy is an unworthy goal. Instead, Kirkpatrick argued that you cannot push a country to hold elections when the conditions in that country will not likely lead to a better political regime.

This is not a commentary on “cultural readiness” for democracy and the like, but rather a question of who specifically is organized enough in the country to benefit from an election. Kirkpatrick warned against pushing for elections in countries where the only organized opposition was Marxist, as they would invariably benefit, and would not be more likely to push for inclusive governance once in power. Instead, to take hold democracy needs the right conditions, and Kirkpatrick astutely predicted that rightwing dictatorships like Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and South Korea would eventually democratize, whereas leftwing dictatorships like North Korea and Cuba would be less likely to transition to democracy.

The neoconservative, and conservative, right slowly transitioned, during the 1980s, from skepticism of democracy to seeing democracy promotion as an effective tool of U.S. foreign policy. James Mann aptly chronicles this transition in his book “The Rise of the Vulcans,” and attributes the success of forcing Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos from power in 1986, despite being a U.S. ally, as a turning point in the Republican approach to the issue.

So when Francis Fukuyama wrote “The End of History?” in 1989 (later expanded into a book), he had a more sympathetic audience to his argument that mankind had finally chosen liberal democracy as the only credible form of government.

President George W. Bush’s “freedom agenda” was the logical continuation of this worldview, and his support of democrats throughout the Middle East and beyond testified of his rejection of the notion that some peoples are simply not ready for democracy. Unfortunately, however, the Iraq War was a misguided attempt to impose this agenda by force, and led to many opponents of the war to abandon the cause of democracy altogether.

We would do well, however, to return to Kirkpatrick’s notion that the conditions for democracy must be right before we push for regime change in countries run by dictators. The conundrum in the Middle East today is that the countries with the most brutal dictators are the least likely to successfully transition to democracy, or so the experience of the last several years suggests. The most brutal of dictatorships, where no opposition or dissent is allowed, generally do not have a viable political alternative at hand to take over the country.

This presents a real moral dilemma, as it is difficult to accept that countries like Syria are not able to immediately transition to democracy, as we watch the Assad regime’s brutality towards its own people which has led him to destroy entire cities rather than give up power. It’s easy to feel that something must be done to help.

Following Kirkpatrick’s logic, it should be no surprise that the Muslim Brotherhood took power in post-revolution elections in Egypt. Tunisia, where the Arab Spring started, is often held up as the success story of that movement, but Tunisia had a lot shorter path to travel from its situation in late 2010 to some semblance of a democracy where power is transferred peacefully and regularly.

Applying This Approach to Syria

Many on the hawkish right have criticized President Obama’s handling of the Syria conflict, specifically arguing he should have intervened early in the conflict on behalf of the opposition Free Syrian Army. This would have, the argument goes, allowed them to overthrow the Assad regime and prevent the rise of extremists amongst the opposition by not allowing for the vacuum that has since formed in large parts of the country.

Can we reasonably expect that the Syrian regime could have been overthrown and subsequently replaced with a more liberal regime?

But can we reasonably expect that the Syrian regime could have been overthrown and subsequently replaced with a more liberal regime that would respect religious minorities and allow for political dissent? More relevantly, would support for the opposition at this time improve the situation?

When the Syrian uprising began in March 2011, it was characterized by peaceful protests against a dictatorial regime, which responded with deadly force against its own people. In the early days of the protests there was cross-sectarian support for the calls for democracy, freedom, and human rights. The regime operated—and continues to operate—like a mafia, favoring party members over normal citizens and using sectarian tension to solidify support among minorities and instill general fear over sectarian violence in the event of its downfall.

The protests and subsequent uprising against the regime is a testament to the level of dissatisfaction in the country prior to 2011, even if that dissatisfaction was not readily apparent to the wide-eyed Western tourist wandering the country’s historical sites (myself included) nor the country’s elite, many of whom still have not understood the underlying discontent that led to the uprising.

Syria’s Sectarian Politics

The Assad regime, under both father and son, has cleverly used sectarian divides to gain support. However, while the regime has exploited and at times exacerbated sectarian divisions in the country, it did not invent them.

Syria is a significantly diverse country, with the Sunni Arab majority living alongside Christians (ethnically Arab, Assyrian, and Armenian), Islamic offshoots like Alawites, Ismailis, and Druze (all ethnically Arab), and ethnic minorities such as Turkmen and Kurds, among others. Fear of a dominant Sunni majority in Syria has often led religious minority communities (Christian, Druze, Ismaili, and, most relevantly Alawite) and many Sunnis into Arab nationalism and its various related theories, emphasizing Arab national solidarity over sectarian division. However, adopting a state ideology of Arab nationalism, as Syria did, was essentially a recognition of the potentiality for sectarian tension. There would be no need to emphasize Arab unity over sectarian solidarity if the masses already largely placed their Arab identity over their sectarian one.

Syrian Protests and Armed Uprising

The peaceful protests that started in March 2011 initially garnered some support from minority communities, particularly among young people, though they were largely dominated by the Sunni Arab majority. After several months, as what became the Free Syrian Army began to take up arms to defend the protesters against the regime, the peaceful protest movement transformed into an armed insurgency against the state.

The opposition slowly shed minority support, and over the course of five years has transformed from a democratic movement looking to overthrow a corrupt regime into a sectarian Sunni movement, albeit with groups ranging from moderate to extremist.

No doubt there are still many opposition members, including among minority communities, supporting secular democracy. However, most of these more secular democrats are operating outside of the country, either in Europe or in Syria’s neighbors. The reality on the ground is that extremist groups like Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra) and Ahrar al-Sham have by far the most power, and many U.S.-backed moderate groups coexist and actively cooperate with them.

Could Support for the Moderate Opposition Have Helped?

A common opinion expressed by hawkish Syria observers and politicians is that had we provided support to the moderate opposition early on, it would have strengthened their hand against both the regime and Islamic extremists. This would have prevented the rise of groups like ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra. It sounds nice, but would this have actually worked?

Many of the opposition, including some of those currently fighting the regime inside Syria today, truly believe in democracy more or less as we understand it. The argument that more support to them would have prevented the current chaos is predicated on a number of assumptions:

that we can reasonably expect to overthrow the state structure of a modern Arab country by force and it result in something better than the status quo;

that the sectarian nature of the conflict as it stands now is the result of Assad’s policies, and not an inherently sectarian streak amongst broad swathes of Syrian society;

and that Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, ISIS, and other groups enjoy limited popular support in the country and the populace would have backed the moderate opposition if they had been seen as being stronger.

The first argument, that it is reasonably possible to overthrow the entire state and replace it with something more amenable, falls apart quickly because there is no precedent for it in the region. This has been tried and failed in Libya and Iraq.

Western proponents of intervention in Syria, particularly those on the Left, are quick to contrast their plan with Iraq, stating that the 2003 invasion was misguided because it was built on faulty intelligence and that we were not intervening in an existing conflict but rather starting a war from scratch. Libya, on the other hand, was done the ‘right’ way by these standards: led by a liberal president, supporting local armed groups instead of putting our own troops on the ground, and intervening in an existing war rather than starting one.

There were significant segments of society ready to back extremist groups, and the conflict has given these elements room to breathe and grow.

The result of these three conflicts (Iraq, Syria, Libya), however, has been largely similar. In Iraq, full-scale invasion was followed by large-scale occupation and state building, and it fell apart quickly after we pulled out. The Libyan regime was overthrown through an air campaign supporting local forces with almost no Western presence in the aftermath, and the country quickly fell into chaos, largely divided between two competing governments and, subsequently, ISIS.

In Syria, small-scale support to rebels has prolonged a conflict and cost innocent lives without providing a decisive blow against the regime. However, there’s little reason to believe that more substantive support—enough to deliver a deadly blow to the regime—would have led to a positive outcome. Much of the reason why lies in the response to the second and third points above.

Regarding sectarianism, certainly the conflict has made many people who were previously very tolerant of their neighbors of other sects take on a more sectarian view of their country. The regime’s brutal and inhumane targeting of civilians in opposition areas has led many to blame the Alawites for the regime’s actions and to turn to extremist groups, who are seen as more effective opponents of the regime. While the regime is largely to blame for this situation, that fact does not undo that it has become a reality. However, sectarianism in Syria is not simply a result of Assad’s policies, but has significant precedence in the country’s history.

Secondly, it’s important to note that before the conflict Syria was inherently a conservative and religious society, particularly in rural Sunni areas outside of the major cities. While it may be more liberal than the Gulf or Afghanistan, the Sunni society in Syria has a very conservative streak in it, and the popular support for Islamist groups ranging from Ahrar al-Sham to Jabhat Fateh al-Sham to ISIS show that many people have long wanted a stricter form of Islamic governance, but have not had an outlet to express that.

That is not to discount the civilian movements against both of these organizations in areas under their influence, but shows that there were significant segments of society ready to back extremist groups, and the conflict has given these elements room to breathe and grow.

Assad’s Support for Terrorists

Another argument used to advocate for the United States removing Assad is his past support for Sunni extremist groups, particularly those that fought against the United States following the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

All of these facts make Assad morally culpable for what’s happened in Syria, but do not necessarily mean that supporting the opposition was a viable policy.

It is certainly true that Assad has supported Sunni extremists, particularly by allowing them to pass through Syria freely on their way to fight the United States in Iraq during our presence there. He also released a number of Sunni extremists from prison at the beginning of the conflict, and has targeted the moderate opposition more heavily than their extremist counterparts, attempting cynically—and thus far successfully—to force people to choose between himself and groups like ISIS and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.

All of these facts make him morally culpable for what’s happened in Syria, but do not necessarily mean that supporting the opposition was a viable policy. His brutal oppression of the secular opposition means that many of the true Syrian democrats were living outside the country, and not necessarily well-placed to gain popular support in the event of his downfall.

Assad’s father took power in a military coup in 1970, after decades of turbulence and frequent transitions of power. He was the first post-independence Syrian leader to firmly establish his rule and stay in power for a significant amount of time. This was not a coincidence or luck, and shows that the Assad regime has long known how to stay in power, and willing to go to any means to do so. This is an unfortunate reality, but one that wishful thinking will not undo.

Support for the Opposition Moving Forward

So while it’s important to look at whether supporting the Syrian opposition from the beginning was a viable policy, it’s perhaps more relevant to look at whether or not increasing support to them moving forward is a good idea. The answer is a simple no: they’ve made their bed with Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, and one that is not easily undone.

There is significant tension between U.S.-backed groups and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham in opposition-held areas in the north, but they are fighting on the same side of the conflict, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Opposition gains generally equate to gains for Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.

It is not fitting of a serious conservative alternative to the Obama foreign policy to continue to blame President Obama for not involving us in Syria earlier. We tried regime change in Iraq and Libya, and it didn’t work. Tunisia and Egypt are not apt comparisons to the situation in Syria, because in each of those cases the president ultimately stepped down from power while leaving the state structure in place. Iraq, Libya, and Syria have been attempts to overthrow the state structure and replace it with something else. What exactly that something else is, however, has never been realistically articulated.

Why Can’t We Just Remove Ourselves From the Region?

We will never know what the region would look like if we had not invaded Iraq in 2003, or hadn’t intervened in Libya in 2011. However, those actions not only had unintended, though probably foreseeable, consequences, but they arguably left us worse off than the status quo ante. Is the answer to remove ourselves entirely from the region, then?

A good starting place is a variation on what has come to be known as the Colin Powell Doctrine: that the use of military power should have clear, tangible, and attainable goals.

The short answer is no. The U.S. withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 was just as disastrous as the original invasion in 2003, and both contributed equally to the rise of ISIS. The point is not that we should have no role in the region, but rather that we should be discerning in using our power, hard and soft, to achieve our objectives in the region.

What a conservative Middle East policy needs moving forward is to strike the balance between involving ourselves in every conflict and removing ourselves entirely from any role in the region. We do not need to reinvent the wheel to do this. A good starting place is a variation on what has come to be known as the Colin Powell Doctrine: that the use of military power should have clear, tangible, and attainable goals. While few would disagree with this statement in theory, in practice our policies have often strayed from this principle.

The First Gulf War is a good example of the wise use of military force. President Bush and his team did not try to achieve the impossible. They instead aimed to remove an occupying force from an ally’s territory and, upon achieving this objective, stopped. It is interesting, then, that many of the advocates of the 2003 invasion of Iraq rightfully foresaw in 1991 the problems that would come with an all-out invasion of Iraq. Paul Wolfowitz, Dick Cheney, and others cautioned against marching to Baghdad. Somehow in the 1990s they lost sight of the dangers of removing Saddam Hussein by force, and the result was disastrous, even if the intentions were sincere.

Additionally, the United States’ ongoing intervention against ISIS is a necessary and just use of force, regardless of one’s views of the causes of the rise of ISIS and our culpability in it. We cannot allow a sophisticated terrorist organization to have such an expansive stronghold.

Our objective must be clear and limited. We are aiming to eliminate ISIS, not to institute a specific post-ISIS regime or right all the region’s wrongs. Many will rightly argue that without the right political regime to replace ISIS the cycle of Sunni discontent will repeat itself and bring us back to where we started. This is true, but the United States is not necessarily best placed to institute that order.

What we can do is pressure our partners to take positive steps to prevent a return to the conditions that contributed to the rise of ISIS. This includes pressuring the Syrian Kurdish PYD, and their allies in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), to be inclusive of political opponents in their areas, including Arabs and opposition Kurdish political parties. This also includes the Iraqi government, who must ensure that the Sunni community feels their government responds to their needs and that they have an active voice in decisions that affect them and their country.

No Solutions, Only Trade-Offs

Thomas Sowell tells us that in politics there are no solutions, only trade-offs. As such, a conservative approach to our Middle East policy, such as the one outlined here, will not bring peace and stability to the Middle East tomorrow, will not eliminate every terrorist seeking to do us harm, and will not instantly make the United States loved by those wishing us ill. Anyone claiming that his or her plan will do so is cynical or delusional.

In short, a conservative Middle East policy in the Trump era should reject the notion that the United States is the cause of all ills in the region and should therefore remove itself entirely from it. Equally as important, it should understand that the United States cannot and should not involve itself militarily in every conflict without a clear and achievable objective.

It is important that we remember that the objective of our foreign policy is not perfection. We are still the undisputed global superpower, but that does not mean that we should be the world’s police force. This view of U.S. power is conservative, and I hope President-elect Trump will move us back in this direction as he works to establish what the Trump doctrine will be in the coming months.

How Political Correctness Hijacked Trump Inauguration Protesters’ Brains,"The goal of the Left’s campaign against the Trump presidency is “mass resistance” to bring the administration down. Likely, that means you’ll be seeing lots of street protests of the 1960s variety, reminiscent of the campaigns to bring down Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon.

I suspect they will not only cause Bill Ayers to relive his glory days as a domestic terrorist, he will also be able to test out the inroads he made after 40 years engaged in radical education reform built entirely on the agitprop known as political correctness. These “reforms”—or mind arson, as Robin Eubanks so perfectly put it in her book “Credentialed to Destroy”— replace a child’s capacity for reason with raw emotional reflexes. The question is: How many will “rise up” and be mobilized like the good little drones political correctness has primed them to be?

Somehow, this all reminds me of a public service ad from 30 years ago that used a metaphor to warn about the harmful effects of drug abuse on the human brain. In it, a man holds up an egg and says “This is your brain.” He then points to a hot skillet and says, “This is drugs.” Finally, he cracks the egg into the skillet and as it loudly sizzles, he remarks: “This is your brain on drugs.”



The narrator prefaced his remarks with barely suppressed irritation that the harmful effects of drugs aren’t obvious to all: “Is there anyone out there who still isn’t clear about what doing drugs does? Okay [sigh] . . . This is your brain…”

Political Correctness Also Fries the Brain

Let me take this one step further and ask: Why can’t people understand that automatic obedience to the demands of political correctness—essentially a tool to incite mob psychology—will change their brains as well? Blind compliance with the propaganda of political correctness undeniably affects the mind. That’s the whole point of it. Your brain on PC is like your brain on drugs.

Consider this: when people fear talking about an idea, it tends to go out of circulation. The alternative view becomes perceived as the only socially accepted view. When most outlets of communication—Hollywood, academia, and the media—collectively push political correctness, social distrust grows and more people believe they are all alone with their “unpopular” opinions. A while back, I “dissected” this phenomenon.

Political correctness is basically mind hacking. It is a form of propaganda that induces self-censorship in order to send politically incorrect ideas into a spiral of silence. After observing the social hostility to your politically incorrect opinion you are supposed to start thinking of yourself as the crazy aunt locked up in the attic. So your only hope for relief is to “come out” and support the PC line. Once you do so (Meryl Streep’s Golden Globe lecture just gave Hollywood another lesson on how to do this) you can pat yourself on the back and simply mimic it.

Voila! You don’t need to do the hard work of thinking anymore. Instead, PC conditions your brain to respond to the good feeling of being praised, and to reject the bad feeling of being socially punished for saying the “wrong” thing. That’s your brain on PC.

Power Elites Use PC to Mobilize Masses

In essence, political correctness is designed to force one view of reality and promote psychological isolation in anyone who adopts a different view. This is the mental state many Americans are now waking up from after a decades-long, force-fed diet of political correctness from so many outlets of communication and the education establishment. Our universities are now accommodating students’ inability to absorb different points of view by giving them “safe spaces” in which they can become even further insulated from real conversations.

You may ask: “Why turn students into such ‘snowflakes?’” Well, for those with power-consolidating agendas, this type of mind hacking short-circuits independent thought, turning the subjects into deployable agents. (This is how cults operate, by the way.) With their brains fried and fearful, unable to accept a different point of view, the recruits can be used as drones and street agitators. They’ve internalized the message that their very survival depends upon obedience to the sorcerers of political correctness.

Enter Agitators, Propagandists, and Street Theater

There are numerous reports that “community organizers” of various stripes are planning “massive” protests against Donald Trump’s inauguration, hoping even for violence and riots. They are passionate about blockading streets in Washington, calling for what they call “clusterf–ks” of roads. Students whose minds have been indoctrinated with political correctness are no doubt expected to serve as warm bodies to prop up the illusion of mass mobilization that might bring down the newly elected administration. If the agitators can’t succeed through messaging, they are likely to pin their hopes on provocations against the police that would then spin stories that accuse the new administration of repression.

Any protesters who hope to march “peacefully” won’t exist as a story, particularly since groups like “DisruptJ20” say they are intent on using any means necessary to prevent the inauguration from happening. The central theme of the inaugural protests is that Trump is a “fascist,” or as stated in the central theme on ANSWER Coalition’s web page : “Donald Trump is a racist, sexist bigot.” This boogeyman approach aims to cultivate paranoia that will cause the protesters to act up. By heightening fear and loathing in the masses, the participants can be primed for maximum exploitation and mobilization by their leaders.

This is right out of Saul Alinsky’s how-to guide on mass manipulation. In “Rules for Radicals” Alinsky explained it is essential to personalize the opposition so that there is a human face to hate. Then the organizers can stoke resentment in their recruits and channel that hatred into a force for mass mobilization. This is similar to the way political correctness works. To consolidate power, twentieth-century totalitarian regimes mobilized masses of people, especially exploiting individuals who were uprooted and alienated.

The ANSWER coalition, by the way, praises murderous dictators and their henchmen, like Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. Such organizations are marshaling the snowflakes who have been cultivated by our media and education establishment to bring about its stated goal: “revolution” of the freedom-hating communist variety.

Another “community organized” group has taken out a full-page ad in The New York Times to recruit protesters to prevent the inauguration. It calls itself “Refuse Fascism” and uses the slogan “NO!” It is led by unabashedly self-avowed communists like Carl Dix and Bob Avakian. So to march with this group is really to march for communism, a totalitarian form of government the legacy of which includes the government-sponsored murders of well more than 100 million innocent people.

How Polarization Is Key to Effective Propaganda

I believe we need to see most protesters as victims of political correctness. Propaganda has many definitions, depending on whom you ask. But the common denominator of this mind-altering propaganda pushed by power mongers is its hostility to free speech, free thought, and free association with other people. It is anti-conversation and anti-friendship.

It marches towards conformity of thought, or “collective belief formation.” It focuses on manipulating human emotions—fear, envy, desire, anger, hate, etc.—rather than the dispassionate examination of reality. That’s because independent thinking always stands in the way of the monolithic conformity necessary to grant power-mongers the raw power and status they crave.

They know that if your exposure to political correctness it is left unchecked, if you are isolated into a bubble of only one viewpoint or way of looking at the world, you’ll be less able to think independently of the propaganda. That ability erodes as you become isolated from alternative viewpoints. Your emotional reflexes—in the case of protesters, their fear and loathing—will tend to overpower the brain’s capacity for reason and logic.

That certainly seems to be the case for celebrities who have shown us that they cannot manage the reality of Trump’s election. From Lena Dunham to Bruce Springsteen, their meltdowns should be instructive. Through repeating politically correct slogans and memes that permeate the media and pop culture, they are transferring an emotional state of despair to the masses—or, as Michelle Obama memed to Oprah Winfrey recently, “What not having hope feels like”—fueling the urge to obstruct Trump’s presidency and to agitate against him. They both reflect and irradiate the inability to think or adapt.

Celebrities as Protesters’ Ventriloquists

In acts of not-so-quiet desperation, wannabe sorcerers of political correctness hope to get Americans with the program by also showing them what “enlightened celebrity thought leaders” think about Trump. They act like ventriloquists who keep repeating themselves in hopes that you will follow suit. They recently put together a video encourage us to direct Congress to obstruct Trump’s presidency.

They throw out all of the usual emotionally-charged epithets—“racist,” “xenophobic,” etc.—in an attempt to round up Americans to block Trump’s cabinet choices. They accuse Trump of intolerance and encouraging violence—and in so doing, arouse the violent and intolerant to “protest” Trump’s inauguration.

Protesters’ Brains on PC: Hardboiled or Scrambled?

So, political correctness can do a lot of things to the brain. Blind obedience to it can hard-boil those neural connections so no other ideas can compute. When confronted with a different point of view, the signals tend to get scrambled in a process now known on college campuses as “triggering.” When that happens, the victim is increasingly led by his PC authorities into a safe space so he is out of the zone of potential conversation and friendship. In this way, he can preserve and maintain his brain’s hard-boiled PC status. (Such students are constantly recruited into mass mobilization efforts, as Dix made clear in looking for protesters to join “RefuseFascism’s” call to arms.)

But seriously, our brains are not static organs. The neural connections within them can constantly change, based on the effects of stimuli to which they are exposed. In fact, our brains are not only responding constantly to our physical senses and what is in the world outside of our bodies, but they also pick up and assess cues from interactions in the more esoteric world of ideas. (That’s the world universities now seem dedicated to protecting their students from.) So if we consider the recent discovery of the brain’s changeability—its neuro-plasticity—we can learn to become more aware of the pitfalls of lazy, shallow thinking.

Let’s not forget that protesters’ emotionally charged behaviors have been in large part conditioned in them through radical education reform and media committed to pushing political correctness. And political correctness is definitely a bad habit for the brain. After watching protesters’ irrational behavior, the lesson for Americans going forward is that we must ignite a vigorous campaign to just say NO! to political correctness.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/01/13/political-correctness-hijacked-trump-inauguration-protesters-brains/,2017-01-13
11 Features Of Mob Psychology To Watch For During The Inauguration,"Political agitators who hope to obstruct Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration will simply be doing what political correctness conditions people to do: connect with a mob, gang, cult, or crowd, then imitate the mentality and behavior of the people inside that bubble. I recently analyzed the process. In this essay I offer a checklist of features to look for if there is media coverage of the protests, especially if they get out of hand.

The activists seem like they could be especially disorderly and disruptive, given direct calls for this by agitators like Michael Moore. Several groups, including some with ties to funding by George Soros, are dedicated to actually stopping the inauguration “by any means necessary.” They include an anarchist group that calls itself “DisruptJ20” that says it plans to blockade roads into Washington through what they call “clusterf**ks.” They seem to have put out a creepy propaganda video “No Peaceful Transition,” complete with robot narration.

Another group has the imprimatur of Princeton University professor Cornel West, the general secretary of the Communist Party USA, Carl Dix, and domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, calling itself “Refuse Fascism.” After the unexpected electoral loss of Hillary Clinton in November, these folks are desperate and ready to act up. Let’s not expect peaceful demonstrations. In this climate, we can expect provocations and should be prepared for what police call “the crazy factor.”

The Crazy Factor

Security for the inauguration is prepared for just about anything, but officials say they are mostly concerned about “the crazy factor.” We get a mild glance at such things when Code Pink or other demonstrators manage to get into earshot of their targets, such as their loud interruptions during the attorney general confirmation hearings for Sen. Jeff Sessions.

Out among mobs of protesters on the streets of Washington, the potential for crazy runs high, especially among those whose brains sizzle on PC. Security officials are particularly concerned about the possibility of confrontations between protesters who hope to bait many of the million or so people expected to attend the inauguration.

The demonstrations can also serve as an object lesson for many American observers. First, they will give us a good picture of the bullet we dodged, the type of PC-induced intolerance that would have been more broadly infused into America had the other candidate won the presidency. Second, we’ll get a really good inspection of what political correctness looks like in its more advanced stage—after it’s morphed literally into mob behavior.

The mainstream media may well decide to give a lot of coverage to the protesters who are trying to shut down the inauguration, especially considering the media’s not-so-great relationship with President-elect Trump.

In that spirit, I offer, in no particular order and not at all exhaustive, a sundry list of some features of political correctness manifested in mob psychology. If you hear protesters’ interviews with the press, as you read their signage, observe their costumes, and watch them chant, shout, and perhaps throw projectiles, see how many of the following features of a PC-cooked mind you can spot.

1. Collective Narcissism

Obviously, not everybody can be a rock star like Bruce Springsteen or a movie star like Meryl Streep or even a famous-for-being-famous star like Miley Cyrus. But an individual can submerge himself into a collective sense of narcissism and what such adulation feels like by doing the bidding of “enlightened celebrity thought leaders” who mass market political correctness.

Because our culture has anointed celebrities as somehow “enlightened,” many take their cues from these cult idols, hoping to get a vicarious fix by doing their bidding. But often any politically correct authority figure will do, such as a leftist college professor or a long-time community organizer, like Ayers. Those indoctrinated in political correctness can feel approval by imitating their words and actions.

2. Us-versus-Them Mentality: Vilification

Political correctness depends upon cultivating a sense of polarization and de-humanizing one’s perceived enemies. Again, the central theme of the protests is the caricature of Trump as a “racist, sexist bigot,” and equating a Trump administration with fascism. So the protesters have been trained to believe with absolute certainty that their PC “in-group” or reference group is morally superior to the “basket of deplorables” who represent Trump voters.

This allows an alienated individual to put forth a social identity and hold other groups in contempt. I agree with Glenn Reynolds that status anxiety is at the root of a lot of this. Expect to see ad nauseam ad infinitum accusations of racism, sexism, and various “phobias” thrown at perceived enemies. The community organizers’ job will be to solidify that groupthink so no one dare even consider the humanity of anyone who deigns to disagree.

3. Polarization

There will be enormous resistance to any sense of unity, particularly unity that exists under the principle of rule of law. Rule of law is the only principle under which any humane unity can exist, but these protesters will be speaking out against it, just as their sponsors such as the ANSWER Coalition and Communist Party USA support murderous tyrants like Che Guevara, whose whole purpose is a totalitarian system that wipes out the rule of law.

4. Extreme Emotion

Emotions run high when people have not honed their reasoning skills. Radical education reform, under such “reformers” as Ayers, have made a point of cultivating raw emotional reflexes at the expense of reason and logic. The curriculum reforms we’ve seen in education are pretty much based on that principle. It’s all very Pavlovian, and you will indeed see a lot of conditioned emotional reflexes in protesters’ behavior.

5. Delusions of Grandeur

By blending into the PC crowd, one can imagine oneself a larger-than-life champion of it all—a hero. In speaking to the “Refuse Fascism” group planning for the protests, Dix told them to “imagine tens of millions of people” flowing into the streets of DC and succeeding in stopping Trump from holding office.

But it’s a good bet that Dix is not the only one who sees himself as a savior. People who feel alienated and isolated are attracted to groups that promote big visions they can feel a part of, especially if staving off a great evil. Consider the heady language of “Refuse Fascism’s” kick off: “In the name of humanity, we refuse to accept a fascist America.” Being part of such a crowd provides some people—especially those alienated from family and true friendships—a sense of purpose, a sense of being bigger than oneself.

6. Cluelessness

Don’t expect to hear any deep insights or clarity about what the average recruited protester is mobilized for. Instead, you’ll get a mélange of slogans and the usual smears, high on emotion and lacking in substance and cohesion.

7. Conformity and Groupthink

We all know about the herd instinct. Human beings imitate crowds, no doubt because checking others’ behavior is part of our survival instinct. If someone sees something you don’t, you’ll want to know what it is. This is a hard-wired instinct that gangs, cults, and gaslighters depend upon to exploit others.

As the crowd chants its slogans, the individual repeats it, submerging himself into it. Political correctness has a natural hostility to non-conformity. There will be utter conformity as well as the reinforcement of slogans. Groupthink, especially in vilification campaigns (such as the one against Trump supporters), is quite literally a weapon against the social order.

8. ‘Deindividuation’

“Deindividuation” is a term that essentially denotes how individuals will lose their sense of self-awareness when acting as part of a collective. In mob-style crowds of angry protesters—those inclined to anger and violence—you get a hive mind. Individuals tend to be insulated from other individuals, but act as one.

Think of how a beehive is constructed: each individual is in a cell—atomized, separated from others, yet existing in a mass collective. This immersion into the body of the crowd gives the persons a sense of equality, a temporary phenomenon described by Elias Canetti in his classic book “Crowds and Power.”

9. Risky Behaviors

While high on PC, the brain is wildly open to suggestions, particularly under the influence of the crowd. All it takes is a cue from the crowd, and you’ll find folks willing to do things around others they’d not dream about doing when alone. Acts of violence, throwing rocks, turning over cars, looting, breaking windows? It all seems so reasonable, or even inevitable, when everybody else is doing it.

10. Diffusion of Responsibility

Seasoned political agitators know crowds will model the behavior of their participants. As emotions run ever higher, riots can build on shouting and a couple of instigators throwing projectiles. Follow the leader is pretty easy once those on either side of you start moving towards a road blockade, or as the group DisruptJ20 calls it, a “clusterf**k.”

As Legba Carrefour, an anarchist with the group DisruptJ20, told U.S. News: “We are planning to shut down the inauguration, that’s the short of it . . . We’re pretty literal about that, we are trying to create citywide paralysis on a level that I don’t think has been seen in D.C. before. We’re trying to shut down pretty much every ingress into the city as well as every checkpoint around the actual inauguration parade route.”

Feeling safety in the anonymity of the crowd will give the individuals cover and a sense of release from personal responsibility. Unchecked vilification campaigns tend to take on a life of their own under such circumstances, when no one feels personally responsible, and they can end up in some pretty bad places.

11. Projection

Tyrants always project their own intentions onto their opponents. So without the idea of rule of law—which is exactly the sort of society a communist-based group like “Refuse Fascism” promotes—you end up with inequality under the law. Whoever has power gets to decide who does what to whom.

Just watch as the protesters accuse their opponents of exactly the sorts of behaviors they are demonstrating—intolerance, irrationality, and even violence. Worse, many of them openly support a form of government that increases these traits. In the case of Carl Dix and “Refuse Fascism,” it’s communism; in the case of #DisruptJ20 it’s anarchy, in which the strong end up lording it over the weak, every time. Projection.

Ultimately It’s About Alienation and Sorrow

Once you cut through the anger, the picture that emerges is of loneliness and aimlessness. When people feel they must agitate out of raw anger and unending grievance, they are expressing a great sense of personal neediness. Those protesting this week have been conditioned to believe that politically correct stances are the only moral stances that exist. They seem not to have been exposed to much in the way of real discourse, or the joys of real conversation.

When people feel they must agitate out of raw anger and unending grievance, they are expressing a great sense of personal neediness.

We must address this lack of self-awareness in our society. It’s making us all miserable, especially those who feel pressured to agitate against our political process.

Thirty years ago, the late Nobel Laureate Doris Lessing warned us that citizens need to study and understand the mechanisms of mob psychology if we are to keep our minds free and retain our freedom. In her book, “Prisons We Choose to Live Inside,” Lessing asked: “How is it that so-called democratic movements don’t make a point of instructing their members in the laws of crowd psychology, group psychology?” The answer, of course, is to allow for propaganda machinery that promotes the power agendas of the elites who exploit their recruits. (Last year, I wrote up a list of resources to help detect mind-hacking.)

As Lessing urged, if we are to remain free, we must teach “flexibility of thought,” the ability to peacefully entertain contradictory ideas. We must learn how the mechanisms of groupthink and propaganda poison our minds. We must re-introduce the serious and disciplined study of history and the classics. Only in this way can we invite freedom and its companion, real friendship, back into our lives.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/01/18/10-features-pc-conditioned-mob-psychology-watch-inauguration/,2017-01-18
Trump Inauguration Protesters Work Hard For His Re-Election,"Protesters against Donald Trump’s inauguration are flooding to DC and putting forth their best effort to ensure that there will be a second Trump inauguration to protest four years from now.

I’m not boasting or gloating about this outcome. I didn’t want there to be a first Trump inauguration, and I probably won’t be too happy about a second one, either. Yes, a lot can and will go wrong with the Trump administration over the next four years, so it’s impossible to predict the next election. But everything in the behavior of Trump’s opponents on the Left tells us they are determined to learn nothing from this past election and to double down on everything that drove voters into Trump’s camp.

Let’s start with the fact that protesting a presidential inauguration is a bad idea. The whole purpose of the inauguration is for the great and good in our nation’s capital to recognize the peaceful transition of power through the electoral process laid down in our hallowed Constitution. So naturally a bunch of Democratic representatives have decided to boycott it, Rep. John Lewis is declaring Trump “illegitimate,” and busloads of leftists have already headed to DC for a week of protests. A week.

Is this because Trump is somehow supremely, exceptionally awful? But this didn’t begin with Trump. It began with George W. Bush’s inauguration in 2001, when leftists refused to accept the election result because of the recount in Florida. Yet even after an indisputable re-election victory in 2004, they protested Bush again. It has become their way of coping, I guess, with the rejection of their favored candidate by the American people.

A lot of them—I asked someone I know who is going—just see it as a way of voicing their opposition to Trump’s agenda. I hope that makes them feel better. But that’s not the way it comes across to everyone else, and the protesters don’t really want to see it from anyone else’s perspective, and that’s their problem.

This doesn’t really come across as a protest against Trump. It doesn’t even come across as a rejection of the American political system or the process of presidential succession, because if they were really serious about that, they would do a whole lot more than a few lame street theater protests. Instead, this comes across as a temper tantrum against the existence of recalcitrant voters who don’t agree with them. It’s like the old Bertolt Brecht poem about the attitude of a previous gang of leftists: the desire “to dissolve the people and elect another.” They are protesting the fact that the rest of the American public isn’t good enough for them.

This all comes across as a statement of contempt for anyone who’s not on board with their political agenda. Or I should say another statement of contempt for their fellow citizens. Because that’s what the Left has been conveying all along, and it’s part of what drove people to Trump, no matter how inadequate and inappropriate a vessel he is for such a protest vote.

The strength of the religious vote for Trump initially mystified me, until I remembered the ferocity of the Left’s assault on religious believers in the past few years—the way they were hounded and vilified for continuing to hold traditional beliefs about marriage that were suddenly deemed backward and unacceptable (at least since 2012, when President Obama stopped pretending to share them). What else do you think drove all those religious voters to support a dissolute heathen?

A lot of Americans have become tired of being called racists and bigots, particularly during the Obama years, when this accusation was trotted out to smack down anyone who opposed the president for any reason. So these voters have taken to completely, reflexively, even obstinately rejecting such accusations, even when they’re valid. That’s a problem, but it’s not going to be solved by shouting louder.

So what are the inauguration protesters doing? Describing Trump voters as a bunch of fascists and backward redneck bigots whose opinions shouldn’t count.

The pressure on entertainers to withdraw from performing at the inauguration under the threat of never working again is indicative of the problem. We can laugh at the Left for living inside a bubble where everyone agrees with them or else. But this increasing ability to rule over miniature one-party states in fields like entertainment and academia is eliminating their capacity to deal with disagreement. That’s the really ominous message of the inauguration protests: that this is all they’ve got, that it’s their only way of communicating with their fellow citizens.

The message of the inauguration protests is that it’s not a bubble any more, it’s a bunker. The Left has dug in deep, and all we’re going to hear from them is shouting. In all likelihood, that will only keep driving voters away.

The Day I Saw Protesters Provoke Police At A Presidential Inauguration,"Every once in a long while, the planets align, the rain falls at the right angle, the wind blows just so, and the drama of our nation is revealed with an allegorical clarity that jumps out like a flat screen TV in a dark room. The inauguration parade for George W. Bush in 2001 was one of those times. Forgive me a little retrospective.

Being a tall man, I was asked to take photographs over the crowds for a reporter friend at the inaugural parade. We set up shop in the press stands across from the Navy Memorial on Pennsylvania. Navy servicemen and women lined the parade route on both sides of the street, facing inward so they might salute the commander-in-chief as he passed by their hallowed monument with its crisp semaphore flags of the fleet flapping in the misty breeze.

With their backs facing the crowd, the young sailors looked strong and stalwart as the rain beaded on the shoulders of their dark pea coats and crisp white caps. They stood poised to share a moment of patriotism before their memorial, with the nation watching, the people gathered, and their new commander and president passing by in full motorcade.

“Not so!” seemed the howl of the protestors gathered in the semicircle that formed the Navy Memorial.

How Protesters Acted at Bush’s Inauguration

Across from us, crammed in the memorial plaza, a pulsing throng of anti-Bush, Gore supporters booed and swayed. On the fringes of the mob of protest signs and black ski masks were a few sour grapes families with young children.

From the start, they had been scooped up into the arms of their parents, who uneasily eyed their strange bedfellows. The signs and chants contained many expletives. The memorial flag poles rose above them, but even these were strewn like gallows, with ski-masked protestors flipping the bird to the Bush supporters in adjoining sections and the press box, which sat directly across from them.

CNN, NBC, CBS. All of them had cameras and all of them took front row footage, but none of them told the story that night on the news of what I saw at the inauguration.

The protestors’ boos increased as the preliminary patriotic floats made their way down Pennsylvania Avenue. Each float and limousine passed through the gauntlet of hisses from the anti-Bush mob. One plump Vietnam Helicopter veteran, hanging out of the cockpit of an old Huey, waving cheerfully at the cameras, would have flinched if he’d seen the glass bottle hurled at the back of his head from deep within the sea of signs and ski-masks. Fortunately, the bottle just missed, shattering the silver-haired veteran’s smile into little shards on the street.

Liberal Protesters Used a Liturgy Of Hatred

Bush supporters along the rails in front of our press seats who’d been trying to laugh at the silly protestors, changed from quiet, half-hearted chuckling, to booming chants of “Sore-Loserman” and “Give it Uh-up.” The liberal protestors would not be outdone, however, and they began what had the markings of a rehearsed liturgy of hatred.

Their sense of drama was explicit. Like an angry Greek chorus, they would wail and shake, and then turn in on themselves like a black, coiling snake that had just been struck. Suddenly, the ferocious motion and the chants of “F— Bush” would cease, and a space would open up in the throng to reveal a lone actor with a burning American flag. In seconds the chanting and churning of the throng would begin again, and its black coils would spirit away the offending protestor.

All the while, the Navy seamen stood at attention, only occasionally shooting a glance behind them when one of the protestors would spit or throw trash at them. An ensign walked down the line. He stopped to talk to some of the seamen, probably telling them to ignore the protestors no matter what. At least I assume they were under orders not to move, for when the protestors began to tear down the flags of the fleet that hung from the memorial, a certain chisel line formed on a number of the seamen’s jaws.

The sailors on my side of the parade route watched as across the street, protestors put the Navy Memorial flags down their pants in (perhaps) mock desecration. More twisting and coiling, and then up went the flags of the revolution: upside down pink triangles, black symbols of entropy and chaos, white flags smeared with brown and red were all hoisted up the memorial flag stands.

Bush supporters began to boo, but their outrage soon turned to clapping. The parade had stopped, and riot police, marching at the quick, came down the parade route. They stopped beside the memorial and began talking with the protestors. Again the mob rocked and tossed; with the memorial flag poles made to look like the double masts of a sea-going vessel, they seemed the perfect ship of fools.

What Happened When Law And Order Appeared

Just so, someone in the throng threw a bottle against the lead riot cop’s helmet. Many things happened at once. The riot police, like a boarding party, tore back the guard rails and ran into the crowd of protestors which fell back in all directions from the onslaught.

Democrat families, feeling the sudden and frightening squeeze of the protestors trying to escape to the wings, began desperately handing their children over the rails to the Bush supporters in the adjacent sections out of fear for their safety in the press and din. Billy clubs rose and fell about a dozen times in a sea of ski-masks and plastic shields. Whistles and shouts of approval from the Bush supporters quickly rose and fell with each swing of the wooden batons. Protestors were dragged from their rooks on the flag poles, and some were dragged out into the parade route, ski-masks removed, and all to the now rising, clapped chant of “Law and Or-der” from the Bush supporters.

After a time, order was restored, and the many protestors that remained contented themselves with coiling and rocking in their ship of discontent. Bush, with rolled up windows, made a speedy pass of the memorial. The seamen stood at attention. The rain poured. And history rolled along unreported.

Anti-Trump Protestors Spat On Gold Star Family Members,"Federalist senior writer Mary Katharine Ham joined Jake Tapper on CNN’s “The Lead” to talk about anti-Trump protestors getting rowdy, attacking, and spitting on Gold Star families attending the American Legion Salute to Heroes Inaugural Gala Friday.

Ryan Manion, who lost her brother in Iraq in 2007 and Amy Looney, whose husband died in Afghanistan in 2010, were spat upon by anti-Trump protestors while walking into and leaving the American Legion’s Salute to American Heroes Inaugural Gala Friday night. According to Manion, whose Facebook post on the incident has been shared almost 2,000 times, they were not black-bloc-style rioters but mostly regular protesters, and many of them were women. Manion is a personal friend of Ham’s, who talked to her about the incident after seeing her Facebook post. Aside from that, there has been almost no media coverage of this incident.

“As we made our way through the crowd, we were spit at and called some of the worst and most vile things I have ever heard come out of a person’s mouth,” Manion wrote on Facebook. “These people had such hatred in their eyes when they screamed at us. After leaving the event we walked outside and was first pushed by a man in a mask hiding his face, then told by 2 women that we ruined this country… As the one woman screamed the other pushed up against me and colored all over my mom’s shawl I was wearing with permanent marker. I am angry and I am scared. My brother and Amy’s husband gave their lives to protect the freedoms that we hold so dear.”

Ham brought up the incident on CNN.

“I think we can all agree that the tone of protesting yesterday was different than today,” Ham said. “This is a nonpartisan organization holding this ball, they work for a non-partisan foundation and are Gold Star families, but when they went in they were surrounded by protesters and they were spit upon and cursed at — on the way in and the way out.”

“They were shaken, but fine — but [it’s] very disappointing,” she added.

“I don’t think this characterizes the march and the movement that we saw out here today,” she said. “I want to be careful about that because I think that that’s something people have unfairly done to conservative movements in the past and to Tea Partiers, where you pick one thing and you go: ‘Look at those awful people out there, their concerns should be dismissed.'”

“But this is part of the story, as is Madonna saying she thinks about blowing up the White House,” she said. “Those are not great things. If it were a conservative movement, we would hear a lot about it. If you don’t think that the left has some prejudices of its own that can lead it very astray like it did last night in that instance, then you’re wrong. And if you think that that’s not part of the reason many turned to Trump, then you’re also wrong.”

Manion wrote an op-ed on the incident for the Philadephia Inquirer today, but there has been no media frenzy to report on this incident.

“Amy and I did not attend the Inaugural Ball as a political statement. We support the current administration exactly like we supported the previous administration and just like we will support every future administration that the American people elect. Amy and I keep our personal politics private; our duty is to the legacy of Travis and Brendan and all those that have served and sacrificed,” Manion wrote.

“I believe this ugly incident involving Amy and me is one of those teachable moments that our entire country can learn from. The character of this country is, at the end of the day, defined by our differences. I have friends who I love dearly on both sides of the political aisle. Let’s celebrate the differences that not only define us, but define what makes the United States of America the greatest country in the world.”

"If You Want To Fight Trump, You Can’t Be Worse Than Trump","We’re less than two weeks into the presidency of Donald Trump but it’s already clear that his opponents are digging in for a long fight. We’ve had pussy protests and airport protests, both drenched in mainstream media coverage and amplification.

From the tenor of these protests and much attendant news coverage, you’d think the country was in constitutional chaos, and that the people were rising up in unity from sea to shining sea to fight the orange scourge.

There’s a structural bias in the news that is fairly obvious: journalists favor covering flashy exciting things while not covering people going about their day normally. So it might have been something of a surprise, given the media coverage of widespread anxiety on the Left in the first 10 days, to see a new poll showing that Donald Trump isn’t underwater on favorability. (It would have been less of a surprise, of course, if media outlets had attempted to rectify their echo chamber problem that was so undeniable with Trump’s election.)

According to Politico, 49 percent of voters approve of how Trump is handling his job, while 41 percent disapprove. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 49 percent of Americans agreed with his executive order instituting a pause on entry to the United States from seven troubled countries while 41 percent disagreed!

But from the mean streets of Facebook to the fabled Terminal 4 of JFK airport to the airwaves and pixels of the media outlets, the mood is extremely different. It’s like a whole other country.

These rioters and social media activists are trying to make the same case they tried to make throughout 2016, only louder and with more signs featuring uterine walls and calling for the abolition of borders. They say Trump is a unique threat to humanity, a fascist whose rhetorical style is intolerable. Okay, do what you feel the need to do. But here are some tips if they want to be more effective at taking on the current administration.

1) Don’t Be Worse On Free Speech Than He Is

Even though he was running against a woman who wanted to overturn the First Amendment-protecting Citizens United ruling, many people were particularly concerned about Trump’s rhetoric against the media. Once elected, he went to the CIA, announced he was in a war with the media, and spent much of the next few days at his battle station.

He argues the media have acted more like a hyper-partisan propaganda machine than a free press interested in doing their jobs fairly from one administration to the next. But when it’s the president saying such harsh things about the media, it’s reasonable for people to be concerned. So if the argument is that Trump poses a unique threat to civil liberties and the culture of free speech, don’t do stuff like this.

That’s where the Free Speech movement began, y’all.

It’s really hard to argue that someone telling you you’re really bad at your job is worse than a nationwide culture of shutting down your speaking engagement unless you toe a narrow liberal line, even if that person who is being mean is the president.

2) Don’t Follow Procedures Less than Trump Does

On Friday, the Trump administration issued an executive order that pauses the admission of some refugees and immigrants, then caps the number of refugee admissions at 50,000 per year. The order was issued without much warning to or input from the agencies tasked with implementing it. Public protest was fierce, as concerned citizens went to airports to demand entry for citizens of the listed countries.

The best argument to make against the order, apart from reasonable policy differences about how to protect citizens of the United States from the threat of Islamist terrorism, was the manner in which it was executed. The rollout was arbitrary and capricious, and therefore a threat to the rule of law. The best way to restrain people who engage in such behavior is by insisting on the rule of law, not turning lawless yourself.

Instead, the acting Attorney General Sally Yates loudly protested that she would refuse to do her job, but failed to give a good reason for that. What’s more, she forbade her employees from doing their jobs. That creates a kind of fourth branch of government, one completely outside the constitutional separation of powers, that could in fact lead to constitutional chaos.

As a smart liberal attorney friend of mine put it on Facebook:

I’m seeing a lot of misunderstanding about Yates in my feed. I’m as against the immigration EO as any of you, but Yates’ action was totally inappropriate. DOJ is not independent from the president, and its political appointees serve at his pleasure. DOJ officials do have an independent duty to uphold the constitution and laws of the United States, which can be justification for defying the president when he orders you to violate them. But on its face (not arguing the merits here), Yates’ letter did not justify an order to her subordinates not to defend the EO. She acknowledged that the EO had been reviewed by OLC, which had concluded the EO was lawful on its face. She did not say that the EO violates the constitution or any particular statute, or that DOJ attorneys would not be able to offer good faith arguments to defend the EO in court. Instead, she said she personally felt that the EO is not ‘wise or just.’ In such a situation the appropriate action is to resign. You don’t order your subordinates to defy the president based on your policy preferences. It puts your attorneys in an impossible situation and you should be fired.

Gah. No. And cheering on federal bureaucrats who use social media accounts or other means to join the “resistance,” as more and more are putting it, is also not a great approach to convey concern about proper procedures. A “resistance” against a democratically elected leader of the republic is a resistance against the people. Openly lawless resistance should be used if it is morally required. And tweeting about crowd size is not a moral requirement. Such posturing will only push the idea among Trump supporters that they are disdained by a cultural elite and therefore will backfire against the opposition’s goals, and strengthen the executive’s power. Don’t do it.

Also, if you want to make the case that Trump is flouting tradition and all rules and norms, consider what it looks like when you take the unprecedented action of boycotting committee hearings to keep nominees from being passed out of committee. You can do it — and Republicans can easily change the rules so it doesn’t matter if you do it — but is it the best way to make the case that Trump is reckless?

3) Don’t Be Worse With the Facts Than He Is

Another great argument to deploy against Trump is that he plays fast and loose with the facts. This is an easy argument to make because not only does everyone know this, they’ve known it for decades. There are hundreds of examples of his imprecision, from claiming without evidence millions of fraudulent votes cast to a larger crowd size at his inauguration, to give two recent examples. He’s an excellent, if underrated, communicator but his relationship with facts is casual at best.

This drives the media wild, and not just because we’re a words-based industry. But to make the case that he is dangerously playing fast and loose with the facts, we need a media establishment that isn’t messing up its bed day after day after day after day. I know, I know, and I guess it’s important to make sure you say this or they get really upset: there are good reporters. But industry-wide we have a credibility problem, and it’s not improved by the daily litany of stories that turn out not to be true in whole or part.

To take just one recent example, the general media framing of the Trump executive order regarding the seven troubled countries was continuously hostile. One story published by a Fox affiliate in Detroit and spread throughout social media by reporters was perfect for the narrative. A green card holder had died and Trump had something to do with it. Here’s a New York Times reporter spreading this story:

The Fox affiliate made a major update to the story early the next afternoon: “Man who claimed mom died in Iraq after Trump’s ban lied, Imam confirms.”

Oh. That’s a bit of a change. How did the story get published without verifying the claim that was made to begin with? At least reporters are trying to rectify the damage they did by spreading bad information, right? Well, people spent hours asking Liam Stack to pull his tweets on the matter and issue a correction. He hadn’t done so after hours of such requests. He also spread false information about Trump trying to invade Mexico. The White House denied it.

I gave four other recent examples of why people have trouble believing media coverage of Trump. There are multiple incidences of fake information being spread by the media each day. In big newspapers, small newspapers, online sites, and TV stations, it’s an epidemic and one that we can’t afford in an era of already historic lows on media credibility.

Put simply, if you want to go after Trump for playing fast and loose with his information, stop playing fast and loose with your information 24-7 on social media and in your published reports. Capisce?

4) Don’t Be More Vulgar than He Is

One of the better arguments against Trump during the 2016 election was that he was vulgar. It worked because it’s true. By the time the hot mic recording of him talking in a sexually aggressive and objectifying manner leaked, things were bad. Of course, anyone who listened to the decades of interviews on Howard Stern were completely unsurprised by his rhetoric.

Listen, you can think that the nasty signs, as Slate puts it, are awesome. But the coarse rhetoric and reduction of women to violently empty reproductive organs isn’t a great way to argue against Trump’s vulgarity.

You Don’t Make Someone Look Crazy by Being Crazier

The unhinged rhetoric, violent anti-speech street protests, and hysteria currently on display don’t make Trump look like he’s a unique threat. They make him look like a reasonable alternative. The goal in the fight against Trump shouldn’t be to strengthen him.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/02/02/if-you-want-to-fight-trump-you-cant-be-worse-than-trump/,2017-02-02
"Watch CA Students Start Fires, Smash ATMs To Protest Trump Speaker","Students at the University of California-Berkeley were not happy that Donald Trump supporter Milo Yiannopolous was scheduled to speak at their campus, so they smashed ATM machines and started fires.

According to UC-Berkeley’s Daily Californian, students gathered to protest near the building Yiannopolous was to speak at. Some chanted “shut it down” and carried signs.

These protests took an ugly turn, which prompted the campus to cancel the event. Police later escorted Yiannopolous off campus to ensure his safety. Campus officials reportedly told students to clear the area as the protest became a riot and police allegedly fired rubber bullets and tear gas at unruly students, according to eyewitnesses.

Liberals Should Stop Pretending Their Protest Culture Doesn’t Hurt People,"This week, protests turned to riots around the campus of UC-Berkeley in response to the appearance of pro-Trump provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos. Rioters smashed bank windows and ATMs, graffitied buildings, and maced at least one female Trump supporter. The event was canceled and Yiannopoulos had to be escorted off campus under protection. The total damage is still being tallied, but the idea that Berkeley was the birthplace of the “Free Speech” movement is dead as a doornail.

The Mayor of Berkeley responded by first admonishing Yiannopoulos’ speech, and then, oops, adding as an afterthought that violence is pretty bad, too.

Media responded by denouncing President Trump’s tweet about the school, which included a Trumpian threat to withhold federal funds from those who riot in the face of political speech they don’t like. A New York Times headline mentioned the canceling of the speech and denounced Trump’s tweet, but never mentioned the violence that triggered both.

The Media Ignores Violent Protest Among Their Ranks

On the eve of Donald Trump’s Inauguration, two Gold Star family members—Ryan Manion lost her brother in Iraq and Amy Looney lost her husband in Afghanistan—were accosted and spit on for attending the Inaugural military ball of the American Legion, honoring war heroes and Medal of Honor recipients. Manion described the attackers not as masked anarchist forces, but as mostly women who looked like normal protesters. The incident didn’t characterize the anti-Trump protests that flooded the Mall that weekend, but it was part of the story.

When confronted with this story on-air, a member of the Women’s March decided the right approach was not to denounce this violence, but to defend a Madonna quote about her fantasies of blowing up the White House. Okay. To his credit, Van Jones denounced and lamented the attack, adding protesters can’t behave worse than Trump if they want to beat him.

Other than my mention, the incident got almost no press coverage. Manion wrote an op-ed about it for the Philadelphia Inquirer.

We Can’t Ignore the Victims of Civil Disobedience

In the wake of President Trump’s Executive Order Friday, which put a moratorium on immigration from seven countries and resulted in refugees being detained for many hours, peaceful protesters blocked the roadway at one of America’s busiest airports. These protests, admirably, involved civil disobedience but not violence. Unlike the above examples, they were well within accepted bounds of protest in this country. But there were still people on the downside of this action.

Many travelers sat in their cars unable to move, or walked long distances lugging their bags, fighting the crowds and missing flights along the way.

ESPN commentator Sage Steele was among those who traversed the airport on foot, and committed the sin of empathizing with her fellow travelers.

“So THIS is why thousands of us dragged luggage nearly 2 miles to get to LAX, but still missed our flights,” Steele wrote on an Instagram post of the protest crowds at LAX. “Fortunately, a 7 hour wait for the next flight to Houston won’t affect me that much, but my heart sank for the elderly and parents with small children who did their best to walk all that way but had no chance of making their flights.”

“I love witnessing people exercise their right to protest,” she went on. “But it saddened me to see the joy on their faces knowing that they were successful in disrupting so many people’s travel plans. Yes, immigrants were affected by this as well. Brilliant. ”

Steele, who is black, was treated to a barrage of accusations of race treason. Why, she’d tell Rosa Parks she disrupted her bus commute, don’tcha know.

This Is What Fallacious Internet Messaging Looks Like

This is what disproportionate social media response looks like. The Internet’s message seems to be how dare she see an elderly woman dragging a suitcase in the sun for an hour and have one iota of concern for her. What an absurd assertion of privilege to see a mom traveling with tired kids and wonder how this might affect her. Are their plights as dire as those who are detained? Except in extreme cases, obviously not. We also don’t know the stories of those travelers and shouldn’t automatically discount them.

It’s hard to keep track of the privilege hierarchy, but does a jubilant hipster-bro doing some bongo-banging on break from his screenplay-writing at Starbucks take precedence over, say, Launita Walker?

Another driver, Launita Walker, 51, of Lancaster, said she also supported the protesters’ message but desperately needed to get to the home of her sick mother in the San Fernando Valley. “I’m on their side all the way around but I need to get out of here,” said a visibly exasperated Walker.

It’s a fact of life that protest—particularly civil disobedience such as blocking roads and bridges—has its victims. Even if one deems the protest dire and necessary, and the collateral damage insignificant by comparison, it still exists. Our society rightly prizes free speech and assembly, Berkeley notwithstanding, and affords a lot of latitude to those who wish to engage in it. But it should be a fact of activism that one tempers the affect on the Launita Walkers of the world, if for no other reason than it makes them more likely to side with you on the issue you’re protesting.

I get that sometimes a protest’s purpose is to jar people from their privileged lives to see the travesty in front of their faces. I’m saying blocking a bunch of people, including the vulnerable and low-income, from getting where they need to go might not be the most just and effective way to do it. On the more extreme end, burning businesses and spitting on war widows certainly isn’t, but far too many either ignore, or in the case of Berkeley, outright cheer these actions as necessary and righteous.

Would a Conservative Protest Be Treated Like This?

It’s a helpful thought exercise to ask oneself if one would be as, ahem, tolerant of such acts of civil disobedience (obviously rioting and violence should be out of bounds) were they done by someone on the right. Of course not. At best, they’d be viewed as gratuitous inconsideration and, at worst, as violent threat. Many would rightly be concerned for those caught up in the chaos. Acts of violence would be met with lots of negative press coverage, inducing fellow protesters to quell the worse angels of their companions, lest their cause be rejected by everyone outside the protest. Press coverage would not carefully excise the vulgar and the violent from its coverage of protesters.

That’s how the peaceful Tea Party townhalls of August 2009, peppered with yelling and precious little violence to speak of, came to be portrayed as a dangerous mob on the verge of plunging the Republic into madness, and the good, eccentric folks of Occupy were, well, the good, eccentric folks of Occupy notwithstanding their damage of public lands, violence, and defecating on cop cars. The electoral results suggest the difference in standards doesn’t ultimately serve the Left.

Liberal protesters (even ironically, violent ones) often ostentatiously advertise their own kindness and love at such events. Such signage is a hallmark of these gatherings. Empathy sometimes requires looking outside your protest culture and figuring out how to reach those not already standing with you. Telling them and anyone who notices them to suck it up and walk a mile in the sun with their baggage, because privilege, will not help.

"If College Students Will Protest Mike Huckabee, They’ll Protest Anybody","A few days ago, a group of students at John Brown University protested former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee’s chapel talk on civic engagement. By all accounts, everything went fine. Protesters stood along the wall of the school’s Cathedral of the Ozarks wearing bright white T-shirts with slogans such as “minority rights are human rights.”

Afterward, there was a Q&A session where I understand Huckabee acquitted himself well, which is what you would expect given his vast experience in politics and the media.

But the question that nags at me is this: Is Mike Huckabee really protest-worthy? I want to be clear that I am not arguing to shut down protests or inhibit disagreement, but I do want to challenge the students and those who may have encouraged them. Does Huckabee really live up to the ugly billing he received from protesters?

Let’s Ask a Few Basic Questions

In justification of their protest, students associated their state’s former governor and two-time presidential candidate with racism, sexual violence against women, police brutality, and various other unacceptable positions. So I thought about Huckabee and asked myself a few questions.

Does he argue for the supremacy of a particular race, for the inferiority of a particular race, or for giving different rights to different races?

Does he argue that women should suffer sexual violence at the hands of men, or commit such violence himself?

Does he argue that police brutality is a good thing? Does he try to do away with investigative processes established to determine fault in the area of police brutality? Does he think there should be no accountability for police officers?

Now, let’s consider whether these questions have answers. It seems to me that Huckabee would say he does not endorse racism, embraces an ethic of sexuality that would preclude violence, and believes that police power can be abused because human beings are sinful. What you will really find, then, is that something more like the following is happening.

He explicitly argues against racial supremacy and discrimination, but disagrees with various legal remedies proposed to address racial inequality (such as affirmative action). The way the game is played, Huckabee is now a racist.

He does not argue for sexual violence against women and is not known to commit such acts. However, he supported Donald Trump’s presidential candidacy. If that choice establishes him as a supporter of sexual violence against women, then I suppose people who supported President Clinton were proponents of intern seduction. (See, the logic gets a little funny.) The reality is that we live in a largely binary system, and a person may have voted for Trump because she did not support Hillary Clinton.

Huckabee does not embrace police brutality. Most likely, he has looked at an incident where police brutality was charged and came to a different conclusion than others regarding the guilt of the officer involved.

You will notice that the examples here are all instances of left-wing political sensibilities being used to make someone (in this case Huckabee) radioactive (a racist!) when in fact they simply disagree with proposed solutions for addressing a particular issue. However, I would be wrong not to admit that the same thing happens in the opposite direction. Here is an example:

Assertion: “Left-wing politician X is an anti-Semite.”

Question: “Why is politician X an anti-Semite?”

Response: “He believes the Palestinians should have more rights to territory occupied by Israel than I do.”

What can we conclude? Politician X may be an anti-Semite (who knows but God, who sees hearts?), but not because of his position on this particular policy. His chosen policy simply indicates that he believes the Palestinians have a stronger claim than do those who favor the government of Israel.

Use Your Freedoms Well, Not Stupidly

After taking the time to explain this unhappy political phenomenon of bootstrapping disagreement with a right- or left-wing agenda into RACISM, SEXISM, ANTI-SEMITISM, etc., what we should do about it? If we choose to protest with as light a provocation as someone such as Huckabee provides (students pointed to his Twitter feed), then life will become miserably dominated by ideology.

Let me give an example. A few years ago, my school (Union University), which is Christian and leans conservative, invited Paul Begala to campus for a talk. Begala was an advisor to candidate and President Bill Clinton, and has been a longtime liberal media presence.

Now, many of us at Union highly oppose abortion. I have written against abortion many times over the years. One path would have been for me to encourage my students to make signs and T-shirts and march around the speaking venue denouncing Begala and his pro-choice ways. We could have stood around the edges of the room casting a pall over his talk with our attention-getting signs and shirts.

But we didn’t. Instead, Begala gave his talk in a winsome fashion, and it was well-received. Many in the audience surely disagreed with a variety of Begala’s positions, but the event was a positive part of university life. In large part, it succeeded because of the civility of the people involved: administration, professors, Begala, and students.

I don’t want to be heard arguing against the value of protest. Protest is an important part of life together in a free country, but freedom also requires virtue. Two of those virtues are civility and hospitality. Protest should be a live option. But it should also be one that is probably used with more provocation than Mike Huckabee’s Twitter feed, lest it become smothering in frequency and trivial in nature.

4 Reasons The Anti-Trump Resistance Won’t Win Like The Tea Party Did,"In the wake of the 2008 election, Democrats had won the presidency. They held 59 Senate seats and a 76-person majority in congress. There was talk of a permanent Democratic majority, and the GOP appeared to be in complete, powerless disarray. In response, a grassroots protest movement emerged. Considered more or less a joke at first, the Tea Party would change the face of American politics. And just eight years later, it would help restore Republican political power.

Now, as Democrats face the dark political wilderness, they too have launched a protest movement, loosely referred to as “The Resistance.” It is tempting to compare these historical moments. Many on the Left have begun to not only compare the Resistance to the Tea Party, but to use it as a model. This means more than protesting and attending town halls—it also means organizing and promoting candidates who will challenge Trump.

But for all the similarities of situation and tactics, there are several specific reasons why the Resistance is unlikely to succeed as the Tea Party did. Becoming the new “party of no” may be the best option progressives have to fight the president—but progressivism has baked into it aspects that make it very different from the Tea Party they seek to emulate.

1. Progressives Have Embraced Intersectionality

For those unfamiliar with the term, intersectionality refers to the ways in which marginalized people overlap in the hierarchy of oppression. So being gay and black makes you oppressed, but if you are cis (not transgender), your gender privilege intersects with your oppression. If that idea gives you a headache, it should. It also helps to explain why progressives so often wind up at each other’s throats.

This phenomenon was on display at the Women’s March on Washington. Originally organized by two white people, calls came almost instantly to diversify its leadership. The problem with this is that it leads to ever more radical positions—when the lesbian, Eskimo, midget, left-handed, ninja albinos demand inclusion of their cause in the platform. This was one of the things that led to the failure of Occupy Wall Street, as more moderate voices were pushed to the side.

The Resistance believes that diversity is its strength. But diversity can also be a profound weakness, one that has haunted many progressive movements. The Tea Party faced almost no similar divisions, and more or less avoided such internecine struggles.

2. They Have No Unifying Issue To Rally Around

Related to the problem of intersectionality is the Resistance’s lack of a unifying issue. The Tea Party was laser-focused on government spending, both regarding the bailouts and eventually the Affordable Care Act. Protests in general are more successful when they oppose something concrete—like a war or a specific law. We saw evidence of this in the airport protests over the president’s immigration executive order. Politicians, the courts, and the media followed their lead. In some measure, they were able to claim victory.

But the Resistance is about much more than immigration: it is opposed to Trump, not any one or two of his policies. This will make the movement a mile wide and an inch deep. The public will not be able to process all their complaints at once, and politicians will not be able to concentrate their fire.

3. Progressives’ Bubble Won’t Help Them

The Resistance likes to point out that Hillary Clinton received more votes than Trump. And it is an important point: Clinton came much closer to winning the 2016 election than John McCain did in 2008. But the disparity between the popular vote and the Electoral College reveals a telling weakness for Democrats in national elections. Progressive voters are densely packed into small geographic areas where they dominate.

It may well be that the Resistance has greater overall participation than the Tea Party did. But it will be focused in progressive cities and on college campuses. This will not give the Resistance the kind of reach that the Tea Party had. Even if it succeeds in motivating voters, it will only enhance already overwhelming advantages in places where Democrats already win.

4. The Resistance’s Use Of Violence Is Counterproductive

As we saw during the recent Berkeley riots and the assault on Richard Spencer caught on video, there is an element of the Resistance that is willing to use violence to achieve its political ends. Progressives will argue that this is a small percentage, just as the Tea Party did when confronted with allegations of racism. But thus far, too many progressives have been apologists for such violence. Somehow they are engaged in a debate as to whether punching political opponents is okay.

This is an old story on the Left. It’s how William Ayers, a convicted political terrorist and member of the Weather Underground, can be friends with former President Obama. Rather than say “there is no place for this here,” as the Tea Party did with racism, progressives see their violent elements as having similar aims and different methods.

Any protest organizer will tell you that seeing grandmothers and toddlers is much better messaging than seeing masked thugs setting things on fire. But if the Resistance cannot firmly and totally reject such methods, they deserve the stain that comes with them. And the American people will associate them with that kind of madness.

There Are Some Caveats Worth Considering

For the reasons listed above, it is unlikely that the Resistance can duplicate the Tea Party’s success. After all, the political turnaround it achieved in eight years may be unprecedented in modern American history. But the good news for the Resistance is that they don’t have to. Democrats are not in nearly as deep of a hole as the GOP was in 2009. Democrats trail Republicans by only 47 votes in the House and two in the Senate.

This is why some Democrats—including moderate congressman Tim Ryan, whose attempt to be minority leader fizzled—want a very different approach from the Resistance. Rather than protest and yell, the few moderates left see a calmer path: one that requires not a political sea change, but winning back a few frustrated voters who were swayed by Trump.

At the moment, it does not appear that the moderates are winning the day. Just as the Tea Party stuck it to the GOP establishment, the Resistance seems eager for a similar fight, even with vaguely moderate Democrats. Most Republicans say such a choice will turn Trump into a two-term President. But there are reasons to temper such optimism.

The Resistance Will Be Formidable, Even If It Isn’t Successful

The first reason is Trump himself. Just as Obama launched unpopular policies that fueled the Tea Party, Trump could do or say things that keep the Resistance energized and relevant. He hasn’t been president long, but thus far the size and sustained nature of protests have been impressive. The progressive protest networks, which certainly do have their professional elements, are succeeding in bringing many regular people into the street.

A second reason is that in politics, offense is better than defense. As Obama found out, popular change is easier to promise than it is to deliver. The party out of power can focus on pie-in-the-sky schemes that haven’t been tested. The party in power has to slog through reality and build a case that they are better than a hypothetical alternative.

Short of some unforeseeable détente between the president and his progressive detractors, the Resistance is likely to have legs. It may even succeed in becoming an effective political organization, as the Tea Party did.

But the Resistance faces structural disadvantages that the Tea Party did not. If it can be a broad based movement, tolerant of differing philosophies of progressivism, it has a chance to sway opinions and move votes. But if moderate, or as progressives would say, privileged voices are pushed to the side; it will double down on recent failures. The Resistance is not the Tea Party and it can’t win the way Tea Party did. But for now anyway, it looks like that is exactly what is it going to try to do.

"Radical Tactics Against Walker Backfired, And Will Fail Against Trump","Left-wing organizers are trying to generate their own Tea Party in hope of stopping Trump’s agenda. Their efforts will ultimately fail. If you want to know why, look at their failed efforts to derail Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s agenda. There, they rallied thousands, but the overflow of their anger backfired. As you know, Walker was not recalled, his union reforms were implemented and are working, and Trump even won Wisconsin in November.

Progressive Caucus Member Rep. Mark Pocan went on Progressive Talk Radio earlier in February and mentioned he thinks the Left can learn from the protests in Madison, Wisconsin. He suggested the Left can carry forward some of the tactics used in Wisconsin to create a nationwide movement opposing Trump.

So let’s circle back to remember what the Left did in Wisconsin and why it was such a big loss.

Walker Acts Like a Republican, Left Goes Nuts

Walker was elected in 2010 and quickly announced plans to reform collective bargaining reform, cut taxes, defund Planned Parenthood, bring tort reform, and a host of other conservative reforms. The Left organized massive protests, primarily against the union changes. They shipped in protesters from Chicago and across the country. These extremists were able to gather enough petition signatures to initiate a recall of Walker and his allies.

One the main reasons they failed is they used extreme tactics that backfired on their movement. Feeling justified in whatever they did, they even protested Special Olympics ceremonies where Walker was speaking, had doctors give out free sick notes to whoever skipped work for whatever reason (such as engaging in political protests), protested outside legislators’ houses, sent death threats to elected officials, and more.

Attempts at “peaceful protests” couldn’t curtail protesters’ vitriol. During the protests, the Left held anger management workshops to make sure their protesters didn’t get violent. Yet their anger was real and resulted in some violence.

One video in particular of protesters circling state Sen. Glenn Grothman (now a congressman from WI-6) shows them seething while chanting “Peaceful” as a way to calm themselves down. But these “peaceful” workshops and mechanisms didn’t work for everyone. When Fox reporter Mike Tobin was doing a live shot from the crowd, one of the protesters hit him.

I helped organize a counter-rally in February 2011 (the “I Stand with Walker” Rally) and saw the hate firsthand as union protesters surrounded and circled our peaceful demonstrators. When Wisconsin voters saw this ugliness, they ultimately re-elected Walker in the June 2012 recall election by a larger margin than he had been originally elected.

Going Crazy Alienates People

The Wisconsin tactics fell flat because Independents and moderates were disgusted with the extreme and ugly tactics. In the June 2012 recall election, Walker won independents 54-45 percent over his opponent, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, and nearly three-quarters of voters thought recalls (an extreme tactic) should never or only be used for “official misconduct.” Voters saw how the protesters treated those with whom they disagreed and that pushed more folks to Walker.

Today, we can still see this propensity for violence, as the nation saw with the Berkeley riots and post-inauguration unrest in the nation’s capitol. There were no anger management workshops for the Tea Party in 2009, because they didn’t need to be told to behave. In fact, the Tea Party cleaned up the garbage that the union protesters in Madison left behind.

Progressives are now trying to copy the Wisconsin tactics that failed them. If the Wisconsin results are any indication, these measures will only make Trump stronger as they did for Walker. Some on the Left will undoubtedly overreach and harm their movement. The liberal base will get frustrated as they fail to stop the Trump agenda, and it will make them angrier. At the end of the day, the Left will only have themselves to blame.

D.C. Suburb Cancels School So Teachers Can Protest Trump,"A Washington D.C. suburb that overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton in the November 2016 election is preemptively cancelling classes on Wednesday so its teachers can protest Donald Trump.

The same organizers behind the Women’s March, which attracted hundreds of thousands of women in opposition to President Donald Trump the day after his inauguration, are encouraging women to stay home from work on March 8 to show that they aren’t happy about the current president.

Alexandria City Public Schools said that because 300 employees asked for time off on Wednesday, there were not enough teachers to oversee its classrooms.

“The decision is based solely on our ability to provide sufficient staff to cover all our classrooms, and the impact of high staff absenteeism on student safety and delivery of instruction,” the ACPS statement reads. “It is not based on a political stance or position.”

ACPS does not plan to schedule a make up day, which means kids will lose a day of education because their teachers have decided it’s more important to protest Trump than do their jobs.

The Federalist has reached out to ACPS, but the district refused to say if teachers will be paid for the day off.

Alexandria isn’t the only school district to cancel classes: Chapel Hill-Carrboro City School District in North Carolina won’t have school on Wednesday either. What’s perhaps the most ironic part about the protest is that it effectively forces women to stay home from work so others can participate. It also forces many parents to miss a day of work if they cannot find another form of childcare within two days.

11 Problems With Teachers Shutting Down Schools For Women's Strike,"Last week a North Carolina district canceled school for March 8 because so many public employees were joining a feminist protest they didn’t have enough staff to even just babysit their students.

“While Chapel Hill-Carroboro City Schools values and supports its female employees, the decision to close schools is not a political statement,” interim Superintenent Jim Causby wrote to parents. “It is entirely about the safety of students and the district’s inability to operate with a high number of staff absences.”

The story really picked up traction, as they often do, after it hit close to DC: Monday, Alexandria public schools announced it was doing the same, “and apologized to families that now must find childcare options.” More than 300 Alexandria school employees filed leave for Wednesday. Chapel Hill-Carrboro spokesman Jeffrey Nash told me his district expected about 400 employees to be missing Wednesday after principals estimated absences.

Atop this, a blog and Twitter handle claiming to be run by a group of New York City teens are promoting another way to protest: “A Classroom Without Girls.” These apparent young ladies are encouraging girls to follow their example: “go to school that day, but will not participate. We will not raise our hands or answer questions in class. We will be ‘seen, but not heard.'” My feminist problematic buzzer just went nuts. I know, it’s always doing that, but this time the alarms are extra-loud. Let’s talk about a few things that are weird about these situations.

1. The Schools Have Enough Employees to Stay Open

Now, Alexandria has 2,260 full-time employees, making an approximately 13 percent absence rate Wednesday. It seems reasonable that schools could function for one day at 87 percent of employees working. In other words, there are grounds to question whether Alexandria really did need to send the parents of their 14,000 students scrambling for childcare two days out.

Yet Nash noted that on normal days the average absentee rate is 5 percent, so that brings Alexandria’s number closer to 80 percent of staff still showing up, an absence rate similar to Chapel Hill’s expected absence number divided by its 2,006 employees. Chapel Hill schools have similar student enrollment (although taxpayers there apend $10,000 per student per year versus $18,000 in Alexandria).

There are more grounds to question, however, if you look at teacher-student ratios in both districts: Chapel Hill has 1 teacher for every 13 students, Alexandria has 1 teacher for every 12. Like most U.S. public schools, both employ approximately one non-teaching person for every teacher. So even with everyone missing the staff to student ratio in Alexandria would be 1:7 and in Chapel Hill 1:7.5. Assuming the same proportion of teachers will be missing as other staff (Nash says lots of bus drivers will be out, so it seems a fair assumption), the teacher-student ratios with everyone missing come out to 1:16 in Chapel Hill and 1:14 in Alexandria — i.e., very little difference compared to non-strike days.

Now, I grant you can’t just in a few days redistribute bus driver absences over all the other routes, or every teacher’s class over all the remaining teachers. My point here is that, even if it made sense to close schools as they are configured now, they seem to have more than enough employees to function with a 20 percent haircut. Not only does this undercut the women’s strike argument that we can’t function without their tribe, angry local taxpayers may take that into consideration the next time a schools tax hike shows up on their ballots. Self-serving demonstrations like this make that outcome more likely.

2. Why Aren’t Other Districts Closing?

There appear so far to be no other whole-system school closures for strike day, even though not only are three-quarters of K-12 teachers female, they typically lean Left, making them double-crossed in the likely strikers’ Venn diagram. So while these two districts’ closures are making national news, perhaps the dog that didn’t bark is more newsworthy. Don’t expect to hear much about elsewhere, though.

The Huffington Post has to count all the Alexandria schools singly along with a New York preschool and college to get its breathless “dozens” of schools shutting down for the strike. Uh-huh. This nation has 13,000 school districts and nearly 100,000 K-12 public schools. A measly two district closures is really — pardon the pun — striking.

3. Striking Harms Innocent Bystanders

Teachers strikes have always been politically touchy because, well, besides the mundane inconveniences for family routines, striking does hurt kids. Missing class or having a substitute even for one day measurably hurts student learning. So not just the closed districts but in all classrooms where teachers are on strike Wednesday, it’s hurting kids. Is that really a good way to win at politics? I guess it makes education politics more transparent (everyone is not in it for the kids), but still, awkward.

In just one study about this, “Columbia researchers Mariesa Herrmann and Jonah Rockoff concluded that the effect on learning of using a substitute for even a day is greater than the effect of replacing an average teacher with a terrible one.” Further, public-school teachers are already typically more frequently absent than private-sector workers, even though they get much more vacation time, not including summer vacation. In fact, Alexandria schools were closed Friday for a teacher work day, stretching parents even more thin this week. Skipping more is not a good look for public education in a time when unions insist it is under attack.

4. Taxpayers Pay Extra for Teacher Absences

The vast majority of K-12 teachers are public employees. So when they take an unnecessary day off to make a political point, they are forced their employers — the public — to subsidize political speech we all do not agree with. This is a violation of the public trust placed in teachers, and it erodes confidence in them and their institutions. See no. 3 for why this is probably harmful to their self-interest.

This is not just because teachers are public employees, but because when they are gone districts have to call in substitutes, who must also be paid atop the missing teacher’s salary. Costs and quantity of teacher absences seem to be rising, according to recent research: “School districts spent nearly $335 million on substitute teachers during the 2012-2013 school year, with 115 districts reporting. In 2014-2015, with 118 districts reporting, they spent nearly $356 million, a 6 percent increase in three years.”

5. Entrenches First World Privilege

This woman puts things in perspective for us:

https://twitter.com/catmayer/status/838840104609267712

Every American girl and boy has access to a publicly funded school. That is something at least 70 million children in the world cannot say, and “Girls are far less likely to attend school than boys in many of the world’s poorest countries.” Strikers “for women’s rights” whose protests have little girls learning less are hypocrites who should truly check their privilege.

6. Entrenches Rich Privilege and Punishes the Marginalized

So #daywithoutawoman -Teachers ask for off. School closes. Kids at home. Women now at home watching kids. Oh. Ok. TOTALLY GET IT NOW. https://t.co/UVicMj2VB8 — Brielle Ann (@brielleann) March 6, 2017

When some women take off work to spend a day on themselves, many mothers of the children they’ve left behind will be forced to cover, especially among those who are less economically secure. This is therefore not a protest that encompasses women, but only those whose lives are comfortable enough that they won’t be missed it they kick off for a day, or those who are callous enough to leave the needs of people who rely on them unmet. As a commenter on an article about the closures noted:

I have mixed feelings about this protest because I understand that actions often have to be disruptive to be effective. However, and unfortunately, this ultimately looks like yet another time when a group of people with privilege — the privilege to take a day off without real financial consequence, without worrying about getting fired, without having to worry where their kids will be while they’re at work, or how they’ll get them to the place where they had a reliable breakfast and lunch and now don’t — so another time when a group of privileged people think they’re making a point or taking a stand but it is counterproductive and hurts the most vulnerable in the process.

7. Does Not Respect the Voice or Consent of Non-Strikers

While strikers are out congratulating themselves for all they’re doing for women by not doing anything, other women (and men) in their workplaces and homes will have to shoulder their own workloads plus those of the strikers. Forcing people to fulfill your responsibilities is not exactly a way to win their hearts. It’s more likely a way of amplifying resentment.

Even many women who agree with strikers’ political ideas think a strike is not the most effective way to make those goals materialize, as the quotes above show. Instead of allowing these women — and ones with even more divergent views — to have their say, strikers’ methods abort possibilities for negotiation so that all people have a voice in and chance to consent to the public policies governing us all.

8. Lopsided Employer Bargaining Power

Last week affiliates of the women’s strike coordinated an “immigrants’ strike,” after which dozens, if not hundreds, of people who refused to come into work on a work day were warned, then summarily fired. This is how it works in many private-sector jobs, because employees are not the only people with rights and needs. Employers are, too. They have the right to define what they will pay for what work will be done, how, and when.

Employees have the freedom to accept the terms offered, negotiate better ones, or refuse them. It’s an arrangement both parties enter for mutual benefit. When one side starts to think they’re not getting their money or labor’s worth, they should be free to take their offer elsewhere.

Private employers are less willing to let 20 percent of their workforce take a coordinated, unnecessary personal day that would shut down the entire business and disrupt operations for tens of thousands of customers who rely on their services daily. It is common for private employees to have to coordinate days off to keep the lights burning. Those who don’t support this common good (after all, no business means no job) are fired. That’s the kind of deal lots of working folks have, and we’re glad to have it, because it keeps food on the table and gas in the car.

So we often feel ripped off when people we taxpayers pay ignore rules we have to live by to ease the prpotests of a loud minority that has access to perks most people don’t get, like the ability to pop off a day of work, inconvenience tens of thousands of people who are paying for that work to be provided as scheduled, and still keep their jobs while also-publicly-paid PR people apologize.

9. Takes the Mask Off Public Education Partisanship

Our reg school day transformed into a full day of activism. Pre-K class is raising money and getting signatures! #DayWithoutAWoman. https://t.co/HYn0Rwmm3y — s gargus (@shgargamelly) March 4, 2017

We taxpayers and parents are often told that public education is nonpartisan, apolitical, nothing to see here. But we can’t figure out why, if that’s the case, the education ratchet always seems to go Left. Kids will learn all about global warming in science class but hardly a thing about college-prep physics, chemistry, or engineering. Or:

If you’re a teacher, and want to engage with and teach students about A Day Without Women, according to the Women’s March on Washington, a group of teachers have created an amazing lesson plan and presentation to engage students in teaching them about A Day Without Women.

This is publicly funded partisan politicking. That used to be off-limits because both sides didn’t want the other doing it, so we called a truce. But the truce has long been a lie for public funding only for Leftist causes. This strike is yet another example of that reality, and therefore a reason to end the charade and let families direct their tax dollars to schools that fit their values.

10. What Does This Teach Girls About Being a Woman?

So we want women to have successful careers, but we’re not going to show up to teach them in schools. https://t.co/xJDBIRIMQJ — Kelsey Bolar (Harkness) (@kelseybolar) March 6, 2017

We hear from the Left all the time about how little girls need to be given role models for career success. What kind of career trajectory will they have if their models show that the way to win is not with a kick-ass resume, but by whining, playing the victim, and special pleading? We do girls no favor by teaching them that fitting the social stereotype of shrinking-violet female is their path to success. Corporate is cutthroat. If we want our girls to win we should be teaching them to be the ones to show up on the job when other people won’t.

This is where the “Classroom Without Girls” comes in. It just plays to stereotype for girls to sit down and shut up while the boys and teacher run class. Counterproductive. As is this protest altogether.

11. Counterproductive Movement Branding and Financing

Shutting down public services is a great way to annoy the public. That’s counterproductive not just in public relations, but also in long-term effects that could reduce the ability of women’s strike types to do their thing in the future. Why? Because if you aggravate the people paying your salary enough, they will eventually decide to stop paying it. Biting the hand, and all that.

How Middlebury College Enabled The Riot During Charles Murray's Visit,"The fracas at Middlebury College on March 2 has been widely reported. Both the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal covered it, though perhaps no report improved on the local Addison County Independent: “Middlebury College professor injured by protesters as she escorted controversial speaker.” Web coverage and commentary has also been ample. The American Interest was among the first to post.

This is an ongoing story with important details to come. The links above provide concise versions. What follows is a zoomed-in look at the events that preceded the apparent effort by a protester to inflict serious harm on a Middlebury professor, a professor who herself played an ambiguous part in the disturbance.

The Middlebury Students Who Invited Charles Murray

A Middlebury College student group, the American Enterprise Institute Club, invited Charles Murray to speak on campus. Murray, a well-known social scientist of generally libertarian views, is the W.H. Brady Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. He has been demonized by many on the left since the publication of his book, “The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life,” in 1994, co-authored with Richard J. Herrnstein.

“The Bell Curve” has very little to say about race. But it argues that a considerable portion of intelligence—40 to 80 percent—is heritable; and it also argues that intelligence tests are generally reliable. Those ideas irritate people who have a deep investment in three beliefs: extreme human plasticity; the social origins of inequality; and the possibility of engineering our institutions to create complete social justice.

Murray’s 1994 argument that intelligence is mostly fixed at birth runs afoul of the hope or the belief that children who have significant intellectual deficits can overcome them with the right kinds of teaching.

Murray’s argument can be interpreted to mean that social and economic inequality are rooted mostly in biological inheritance—though Murray never says this, and to the contrary has often argued for social changes that have nothing to do with biological inheritance.

Murray is broadly on the side of pragmatic steps to ameliorate social ills and is skeptical of utopian proposals.

Why Many On The Left Have Dismissed Murray

Murray has written many books since “The Bell Curve,” but for many on the left, it is still 1994 and they still have not read the original book, let alone Murray’s more recent work, including his 2013 best-seller “Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010.” Any familiarity with that book—a sustained lament for “The Selective Collapse of American Community,” as he titles one chapter—would render it impossible to sustain the cartoon image of Murray as a racist bigot who wants to keep in place the inequities of American life. Murray has ably answered these kinds of attacks before, not that any of his opponents actually care about the accuracy of their accusations.

It testifies to the shallowness of elite liberal arts education today—and not just Middlebury—that significant numbers of students and faculty members can repeat the old slurs against Murray. And not just repeat them, but intoxicate themselves with hatred towards a man whose ideas they know only third- or fourth-hand through individuals who have a strong ideological motive to distort them.

But when the AEI Club at Middlebury invited Murray to speak, they knew that he is regarded by the campus left as the embodiment of a certain kind of evil. And they may also have anticipated that, in the wake of campus protests in the last few years culminating in the Berkeley riot of February 1, Middlebury’s own campus leftists would probably seize the occasion to act up.

What Happened Before Murray’s Intended Speech

Middlebury’s administration, including President Laurie Patton, also knew that. And the college had plenty of opportunity to consider how best to handle Murray’s public lecture. President Patton’s preparations were, to say the least, ineffective.

By the time Wilson Hall in the McCullough Student Center had filled up with students for the Murray lecture, it was abundantly clear that the audience was primed for a boisterous and disruptive protest. Well before Murray took the stage, students were screaming, waving vulgar signs, and shouting at the preliminary speakers who were trying to introduce the event. We know this not just through eye-witnesses but because, of course, some present filmed it with their cellphones.

This YouTube video commences when one of the Middlebury officials, Vice President for Communications and Chief Marketing Officer Bill Burger, has gone to the podium and in good-humor (“You’re going to love this part”) attempts to instruct the audience on respecting the right of a speaker to speak. As audience members scream over Burger, he dutifully responds “I get the point,” and then reads a prepared statement: “If an event is disrupted by a group or individual, a representative of the college may request the action to stop or ask the person or group to leave the event.”

Burger is momentarily drowned out by the audience, then he resumes, “Individuals or groups who disrupt an event or who fail to leave when asked are in violation of college policy. Violations of college policy may result in college discipline up to and including suspension.”

Middlebury Was Not Prepared To Control Students

Burger’s prepared statement, which was surely something that President Patton approved, exemplified the under-preparation of the college. The students were plainly ready to take their protest to the limit, or perhaps a little beyond the limit, of what Middlebury would tolerate. But what would that limit be?

What the students received was a pro forma reminder of the rules delivered in a tone that suggested those rules would not be upheld. While we cannot know exactly what Burger was thinking, his public tone was amused resignation.

And the rules themselves amounted to nothing more than a warning that a college official may ask you to stop, and if you don’t stop, you may face college discipline. In fact, we now know from Charles Murray himself that the college officials, anticipating a crowd that would ignore the rules, planned to let the protest unfold without interruption in the hope that the crowd would eventually settle down. There was no plan at all to enforce decorum.

Burger’s lines were excerpted from Middlebury’s official statement on “Demonstrations and Protests,” but curiously omitted a few key points including this: “Disruption may also result in arrest and criminal charges such as disorderly conduct or trespass.”

No one in that audience took the warning as presented seriously because Middlebury gave the participants no reason to. Just the opposite: those who were planning to disrupt Murray had just been handed a permission slip, a smiling indulgence from the college administration.

The Speech President Patton Gave To Students

If there were any uncertainty about that, President Patton soon put it to rest. At seven minutes into the video, she took the stage and spoke for six and a half minutes. Let’s put this in present tense. Patton speaks in a somber tone, and is at pains to get across her own extreme reluctance to have Charles Murray on campus. Her points are:

Inclusiveness. “Thank you all—every single one of you— for being here.” Several times over the course of the next six minutes, Patton repeats a pledge of allegiance to diversity: “Middlebury is committed to unlocking the potential and brilliance of every student no matter their race, their class, their sexual orientation, their religious orientation, their disabled status, or any other demographic marker.”

“Thank you for being here.” Several times over the course of the next six minutes, Patton repeats a pledge of allegiance to diversity: “Middlebury is committed to unlocking the potential and brilliance of every student no matter their race, their class, their sexual orientation, their religious orientation, their disabled status, or any other demographic marker.” Regret. “I’m here because if my schedule is free I always respond to the student requests.” Patton allows that college policy permits students and faculty freedom “to examine and discuss all questions of interest to them.” She sounds not one bit enthusiastic about this policy.

“I’m here because if my schedule is free I always respond to the student requests.” Patton allows that college policy permits students and faculty freedom “to examine and discuss all questions of interest to them.” She sounds not one bit enthusiastic about this policy. Repugnance. “I would regret it terribly if my presence here today, which is an expression of support I give to all students who are genuinely seeking to engage in a very tough public sphere, is read to be something which it is not: an endorsement of Mr. Murray’s research and writings. I will state here that I profoundly disagree with many of Mr. Murray’s views.”

Is every Middlebury student a repository of brilliance waiting to be unlocked? Presumably the Charles Murray of “The Bell Curve” would have doubts about that, as would anyone who takes the trouble to watch the 44-minute video, which serves as a pretty good illustration of what not-very-intelligent people look like when they succumb to a mob mentality. Patton’s list of the “demographic markers” she is eager to defend does not include political orientation. Indeed, she began her remarks by declaring, “Allow me to state the obvious. We are a left-leaning campus…”

Patton Didn’t Defend Free Expression—She Took Sides

Nowhere in her remarks was there any defense of the ideal of free expression on campus. She acknowledged that “college policy” left the door open to the American Enterprise Institute Club to invite Charles Murray, but Patton had nothing to say about why it was a good idea to let Murray or others not on the left speak.

Nowhere in her remarks was there any defense of the ideal of free expression on campus.

Patton’s explicit and emphatic avowals of her disagreement with Murray were gratuitous. She cited none of his views and gave no reasons why she disagreed with those views. She merely took sides: siding with the protesters in their uninformed distaste for Murray, though not in their willingness to deny him a platform.

The underlying message to the students who showed up to protest was that President Patton felt the justice of their cause, but was determined to stick with college policy allowing controversial speakers to speak. Patton positioned herself almost identically to how Chancellor Nicholas Dirks at UC Berkeley had positioned himself prior to the Milo Yiannopoulos event. Dirks had likewise empathized his extreme dislike of the speaker’s views and his temperate allegiance to free speech.

But perhaps the most striking precedent for what happened at Middlebury is the May 2013 takeover of a Swarthmore College board meeting by a mob of student activists. The president of Swarthmore at the time, Rebecca Chopp, sat in the audience and did nothing, even after students who were not part of the protest appealed to her to restore order. That event too was caught on video, and Chopp persisted afterwards in defending her inaction in the face of tactics of intimidation and lawlessness.

Ultimately, Loudness Won At Middlebury

Following President Patton’s remarks, a student, AEI Co-President Alexander Khan, adroitly introduced Murray, working for six minutes though a bustle of jeers. But when Murray at last reaches the podium (19:03 on the YouTube video), the audience kicks into what the protest organizers had planned all along. They stand up and turn their backs. Somewhere a woman’s voice begins to recite a manifesto; other voices join in. The content is mostly unintelligible, but it is loud enough to prevent Murray from saying anything. (Murray later reported that the manifesto was supposedly a James Baldwin text.) The choral reading continues for three and a half minutes, with most of the students—those without the written script—standing silent. After that begins more than 20 minutes of uninterrupted chanting of slogans:

22:29 “Who is the Enemy? White Supremacy.” 24:10 “Racist, sexist, anti-gay, Charles Murray go away.” 24:48, 33:03 “Your message is hatred. We cannot tol-er-ate it.” 25:59 “Middlebury says no way. Charles Murray go away.” 29:08 “Hey hey, ho, ho, Charles Murray has got to go.” 33:14 “Black Lives Matter.”

All the while, signs are waving, including peculiar sexual prescriptions such as “Fuck Rhetorical Resilience.” Presumably some Middlebury students have encountered the idea that hearing views contrary to their own is not all that much of calamity—and they firmly reject that recommended “resilience.”

As far as one can tell from the video, Middlebury officials made no effort at all to regain control of the event. They let the student protesters continue uninterrupted for more than 20 minutes, and then simply announced that Charles Murray and the faculty member who would question him would move to a different room with no audience and that his talk would be live-streamed from there. The protesters had won. Many of them lingered in the auditorium to jeer at the screen as Murray spoke. Some, however, attempted to follow Murray and to further disrupt the event by pulling fire alarms.

As for Middlebury’s official statement on “Demonstrations and Protests,” that was a dead letter, as were the milder strictures of the good-humored Middlebury official at the beginning, and President Patton’s faintly-stated hope that the event would illustrate the college’s openness to expressions of unpopular views.

Stranger Things Happened After The Protest

The Middlebury fracas would have been plenty bad enough if it ended there. But what made headlines came later. When Murray was being escorted to his car, the group he was with was assaulted by students, and Professor Allison Stanger was injured after someone pulled her hair and twisted her neck. She had to go to an emergency room and was fitted with a neck brace.

For those who don’t speak yoga, ‘Namaste’ literally means ‘I bow to you.’

Stanger had played a key role in the event before this. She was supposed to be a moderator and someone who would ask Murray questions. At the tail-end of the video (41:20-42:05) she addressed the audience, beginning, “Please listen for one minute.” Like President Patton, Stanger is eager to tell the protesters that she is no fan of Murray. She claims the ability, however, to ask the penetrating questions that need to be asked. The students are unimpressed and continue their chants. And Stanger ends, “Brothers and sisters, Namaste.”

For those who don’t speak yoga, “Namaste” (NAM-as-tay) literally means “I bow to you,” and is the closing prayer-like declaration at the tail-end of a yoga class. The idea is that the divine spark in the soul of each participant reaches out to all the other little sparks. What exactly Stanger meant by it, of course, is a mystery. The word functions something like “Peace, man,” did among hippies in the 1960s, as a kind of in-group identifier. Stanger was more or less saying to the crowd, “I’m one of you.”

Apparently not everyone in the crowd believed it.

Stanger Participated in the Protest

But there are deeper layers of irony here. If you examine the video carefully, Stanger makes several appearances before she goes on stage. At one point (29:08), Stanger is to be found grinning at the chant, “Hey hey, ho, ho, Charles Murray has got to go.” At another (30:05) Stanger is broadly smiling as the crowd chants, “Racist, sexist, anti-gay, Charles Murray go away.” Still later, as the crowd chants, “Black Lives Matter,” Stanger raises her hands above her head (33:20) and claps along. Soon after, the camera pans across her again (33:34) and she is chanting the slogan as well as clapping.

In other words, Stanger was not just present at the protest, but participated in it.

That his assigned interlocutor would publicly participate in an effort to prevent him from speaking at all is, I guess, part of the postmodern academy.

That his assigned interlocutor would publicly participate in an effort to prevent him from speaking at all is, I guess, part of the postmodern academy. Murray tweeted after the event, “Allison Stanger. She’s on the left. And fearless, funny, smart as can be, and as devoted to academic freedom as anyone I’ve ever met.”

Stanger is the Russell J. Leng ’60 Professor of International Politics and Economics at Middlebury, and a figure to be reckoned with: Harvard Ph.D., a graduate diploma in economics from London School of Economics, author of some important scholarly works, including “One Nation Under Contract: The Outsourcing of American Power and the Future of Foreign Policy” (Yale University Press).

To this, we can add outpatient at Porter Hospital and martyr to President Patton’s commitment to non-interference in the right of Middlebury students to enforce their prohibition on free speech in their own creative way.

President Patton, however, was “deeply disappointed by the events that [she] witnessed.” She issued a letter to the community expressing her displeasure.

Murray Looks Back On The Events

Charles Murray has told his own story about the event. Vice President Burger had warned Murray a day in advance that “the size and potential ferocity of the planned protests had escalated.” The agreed plan was to let the protesters have their noisy protest for a “reasonable period,” and if they persisted beyond that, to adjourn to a different room “to live-stream the lecture and take questions via Twitter.”

‘Absent an adequate disciplinary response, I fear that the Middlebury episode could become an inflection point.’

Murray says that, when he heard the uproar, he was willing to wait it out until midnight if necessary. But he acceded to Burger’s prompting to move the event to the studio. By the end of the evening, Murray had bonded with Stanger and Bulger (“I saw them as dear friends and still do”). Murray has no rancor towards the college authorities, despite the manhandling his little group received at the hands of the mob that injured Stanger when they were trying to leave campus. Murray sympathizes with “President Patton’s task” in dealing with so many violations committed by so many students. “Absent an adequate disciplinary response, I fear that the Middlebury episode could become an inflection point.”

A similar worry is expressed in an important statement from Middlebury professor of Political Science Matthew Dickinson, “Murray and Middlebury: What Happened, and What Should Be Done?” Dickinson writes, “The student riot has left an ugly stain on Middlebury’s reputation, although it is too early to say how indelible it might be.” He see the college’s “central mission” as “in danger of slipping away.” But like Murray, Dickinson does not blame President Patton for taking too soft an approach: “For understandable reasons the administration decided beforehand not to respond to the student protest with a heavy show of force, for fear of escalating the violence.”

Roger Kimball seconds Murray’s idea that the event might be an inflection point in the history of liberal arts education in the U.S., but he shares none of Murray’s or Dickinson’s confidence in President Patton’s good will and commitment to free expression. Kimball refers to Patton’s opening remarks as “an emetic specimen of self-congratulatory virtue signaling” that did nothing to protect Murray’s right to speak.

Students No Longer Believe In Intellectual Discussion

The student protesters have taken to heart an idea that has floated around in radical left circles for decades and that has recently gained traction on American campuses: the idea that some ideas are so illegitimate, it is right and proper to prevent their expression.

It is useful to see such views spelled out since they are, in effect, a no-trespassing sign erected on the border of simple-minded ignorance.

According to this conceit, permitting the expression of such pernicious ideas lends them credibility, and even mounting arguments against the validity of such ideas elevates them to a status they do not deserve. The sustainability movement began to use this tactic to bar the expression of dissent from its favored postulates, and the tactic has spread to others on the radical left.

A Middlebury student named Nic Valenti provided a near-perfect example of this twisted logic in a letter published in the Middlebury student newspaper, “Why I’m Declining AEI’s ‘Invitation to Argue.’” Murray’s ideas, in Valenti’s judgment, are “dangerous.” Debating those ideas suggests “false equivalence” with better ideas. Allowing those ideas to be expressed on campus is “grossly disrespectful,” “a waste of time,” and an insult to “young people with the perceptiveness of realizing that this whole situation is fucking bullshit and the integrity to be enraged by it.”

Valenti’s words are our best glimpse into the heads of college students who reject the principles of academic and intellectual freedom. It is useful to see such views spelled out since they are, in effect, a no-trespassing sign erected on the border of simple-minded ignorance. No ideas contrary to those approved by leftist groupthink are permitted beyond that border.

How Students Are Trying To Excuse Their Actions

Similar views are on display in a statement posted anonymously by some Middlebury students after the protest and assault. They manage to blame the attack on unnamed outsiders, as well as on Vice President Burger and security personnel who “without warning began pushing and pulling protesters out of the way.” They also explain:

A student reports that Professor Stanger’s hair was not intentionally pulled but was inadvertently caught in the chaos that Public Safety incited. It is irresponsible to imply that a protester aggressively and intentionally pulled her hair.

The statement also fixes the blame for the whole affair on the Middlebury administration: These students “condemn the administration and Public Safety’s actions on Thursday night and since then — especially their attempts to discredit the protesters inside and outside McCullough.”

This actually sounds as if the protesters, having disgraced themselves in the public eye, now would like some kind of debate over what happened. Not really, of course. But they are eager to escape any responsibility for their actions.

Middlebury Is In Trouble—But It’s Not Alone

Some things go without saying, but should be said anyway. Middlebury is in trouble. It is not alone. Many colleges and universities are in similar trouble. They have lost the key to open intellectual debate. They can no longer distinguish between tolerating dissent that respects open discourse, and licensing mob action aimed at preventing the free exchange of ideas. They respond with timidity and cowardice at the first mention of racial sensitivities, and flee in panic from their public responsibility to free speech when leftist bullies unleash their projectile accusations.

Middlebury is in trouble. It is not alone.

Race in America is a fraught topic. But allowing the epithet “racist” to silence any and every view not currently in vogue with Black Lives Matter is cringing. What kind of progress can we make as a nation if our college presidents, entrusted with the integrity of higher education, respond to such demagoguery with abject submission? The same more or less applies to such epithets as “sexist” and “anti-gay,” as well as other imputations that anyone who disagrees with a progressive formulation of who is oppressing whom is therefore a bigot.

Murray doesn’t fit the jacket that the Middlebury protesters tried to hang on him. Anyone who has read his books knows that. Shame on President Patton and others in the Middlebury community who could have spoken up and didn’t. But shame on a hundred other college presidents—at least a hundred—who have similarly taken the easy path of capitulation to know-nothing name-callers over the last year or two.

College boards of trustees, are you listening? Why do you appoint people whose only talent is to appease bullies? Why do you sit back and let them do what President Patton just did? Do you think Middlebury just purchased “peace in our time”? I think Middlebury purchased a long lasting scar on its reputation. It will be known as a place more concerned about political posturing than education.

Colleges Need To Foster ‘Rhetorical Resilience’

I assume the students who physically assaulted Stanger will be met with some kind of punishment, though it is hard to see that anything other than permanent expulsion would convey the right message. Be that as it may, the problem remains with the hundreds of students who gleefully ignored the college’s strictures on demonstrations and protests. The number is so large as to make the imposition of significant sanctions impossible. The better course is probably to impose that sanction on the administrator or administrators who allowed the situation to veer out of control. The next time a Middlebury president is faced with such a situation, he or she might have greater presence of mind.

But, again, Middlebury is only one of many colleges and universities caught in this situation. Higher education today recruits college presidents in part by ascertaining their willingness not to get in the way of whatever progressive causes are currently fashionable. We hire college presidents who are all-in on diversity, sustainability, world-citizenship, and so on. Boards of trustees, charged with making these decisions, generally recline into accepting the advice of “stakeholder” committees in which each ideological faction wields a veto. We then wind up with college presidents whose superpower is appeasement.

Professor, the students are not your friends. They are your students.

And that devolves, in due time, to the situation at hand. We have a generation of college students who reframe any idea they disagree with as “hate,” and declare that “Your message is hatred. We cannot tol-er-ate it.”

They need, let’s say, some “rhetorical resilience.” And they need some teachers who are willing to challenge this pernicious form of self-indulgence. Arguments must be listened to. If they are unconvincing, they must be met with better arguments and good evidence. Silencing one’s opponents is what we do in the boxing ring, not the college lecture hall.

Professor, the students are not your friends. They are your students. You owe them your intellectual and moral authority, not your eagerness to win approval.

Administrator, students deserve a college that exemplifies the ideals of an intellectual community—not the dynamics of a political rally.

Is that clear? Namaste.

Murray’s title at AEI has been corrected.

UPDATE: Burger, the university’s top communications official, claims Patton did not approve his statement and that he generally performs his duties without detailed oversight. To date, Burger’s statement has neither been retracted nor contradicted by the university’s president.

‘Day Without Women’ Was A Bit Of A Bust. Here Were Its Worst Misfires,"Yesterday, as part of the socialist-inspired holiday called International Women’s Day, feminists were encouraged to participate in an event called Day Without A Woman. According to Fortune:

Those taking part are encouraged to take the day off from paid or unpaid labor, avoid shopping for one day (though they may make an exception for small, women or minority-owned businesses), and wear red—which, according to Tamika Mallory, a co-chair of the Women’s March on Washington, was chosen because ‘it signifies love and sacrifice, and is the color of energy and action.’

Despite the tremendous amount of free marketing for the day provided by media outlets, and the major funds devoted to the effort, the day was a bit of a bust. A “day without women” turned out to mostly be like every other day, with a few notable exceptions.

Let’s look at a few of the mis-steps organizers and other activists took.

Striking from Smiling

The Washington Post reported:

While not every one plans to skip work, many who want to show solidarity with the growing feminist movement said they plan to strike from unpaid work that women disproportionately do, including cooking, cleaning and, some said, smiling.

Apart from the misguidedness of trying to fight the wisdom of specialism and division of labor — a tool for increased satisfaction and economic gain — the fight against female smiling is just, well, sad. Some of the women mentioned in the piece said they were specifically going to avoid “fake smiling” but the fact is that the world doesn’t have too much smiling, but too little.

Feminism seems too often to take female traits that separate us from men and make us feel bad for them. Yes, women tend to be better at nurturing the ties that bind and focusing on relationship health. This is not something to be ashamed of, but something to cherish and celebrate.

Turning off smiles for a day also reinforces the stereotype that feminists are humorless scolds.

Math Is Hard

Speaking of stereotypes, check out how the official Women’s March account tweeted about the day:

I have so many questions. Mostly I wonder who is birthing the other half of the population. Also, a stated goal of yesterday’s activism was to highlight the sexism of the pay gap. This is about how women are paid less than men.

Of course, nearly all of this gap is explained by the choices women and men make, not just in terms of what general careers they choose, but about how much risk they’re willing to accept, how much time they spend in their jobs, time they take off, and other factors. When it comes to career choices, one way to close the gap is to pick STEM careers — science, technology, engineering, and math. Not knowing how babies are birthed or how percentages work is not a great sign that the gap will be closed any time soon.

Hurting the Poor

While very few women skipped out of work yesterday, among those who did were unionized teachers. My local school district shuttered for the day after deciding to grant everyone who requested the day off the day off. This was great for the teachers who wanted a no-risk, no-cost way to demonstrate their political feelings or go to the beach.

It was not such a great moment for single working mothers of young children, who scrambled on local email lists for childcare options or had to lose out on a day’s wages so wealthier women could protest for something or the other — it was never made quite clear what the goals of the protest action were.

Yesterday, National Review‘s Jim Geraghty wrote, “Protests that block traffic on the morning commute don’t win over those being inconvenienced, either.” This angered the Washington Post‘s Wesley Lowery, who said, “For the millionth time, protests aren’t about winning you over.” Well, at least that explains the failures of the modern protest movement, which seems to think very little about achieving goals as opposed to signaling feelings about things.

But even taking Lowery’s critique of the notion that effective protest movements seek to persuade those who encounter them, traffic blockades and other aggressive actions that limit movement disproportionately affect poor people. A CEO who has to conduct business in his car while he waits for the road to be cleared is going to be fine. The waitress who is going to be fired if she’s late to work again is not. Perhaps all this can be justified as necessary for the cause, but at the very least it should be for a cause that people understand. Few understood the specific goals or complaints of the protesters yesterday, apart from skipping out of work.

Bookstore Stunt

Jillian Melchior wrote at Heat Street about an Ohio bookstore’s approach to Women’s History Month:

The feminist bookstore put up a sign explaining, “Illustrating the fiction gender gap on view through 3/14. We’ve silenced male authors, leaving works of women in view.”

On the bright side, they didn’t burn the books authored by men. But why are they selling them at all, if it’s such a problem?

Wearing a Common Color

In the announcement above, women were told to wear red because “it signifies love and sacrifice, and is the color of energy and action.” Now, the holiday is socialist. In fact, as Joe Carter wrote, a celebration of the day in Russia in 1917 started the Russian revolution. That’s why the day was celebrated primarily in socialist and communist countries for most of its history. So we can go ahead and admit that’s why the color red was chosen.

But the whole action reminded me of something my husband told me about protest days at the University of Oregon. Some leftist group organized a day where to show solidarity, you wore jeans. Crafty, eh? Everyone showed solidarity! That’s what the “wear red” action reminded me of. Red is such a common clothing color that I was surprised not to see more of it in Washington DC today.

Both Shopping and Not Shopping

Organizers suggested that activists avoid shopping yesterday. But then they said they could go shopping, so long as they shopped at stores owned by women and minorities. In my liberal neighborhood, women passed around lists of stores owned by women and discussed shopping parties.

You can’t make both shopping and not shopping be goals for people and expect a coherent message to come through.

Sexes of the World, Unite!

Nearly everyone tells pollsters they believe in the equality of the sexes, while small minorities — 18 percent last year — say they’re feminist. In most media outlets, that percentage seemingly skyrockets.

Despite the heavy amount of coverage feminist activism receives, it remains a fringe factor in much of society.

Still, women and men should remember that women who are angry or otherwise moved to political action frequently have had negative experiences with men. In the same way, some men who are angry about the relationship between the sexes have had negative experiences with women. The best antidote to grievance marches is for men and women to treat each other well.

Now, even if you haven’t been treated well by the opposite sex, you should not lose hope. But women who have been treated well by men don’t tend to riot over the treatment of women. Men who have been treated well by women tend not to wreak havoc in others’ lives.

Now get out there and treat your fellow man and fellow woman well, learning the joys that come from cooperation rather than competition between the sexes.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/03/09/day-without-womens-worst-misfires/,2017-03-09
Environmentalist Protest Destroys The Environment At Standing Rock,"After half a year, hundreds of arrests, and thousands of headlines, the protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline has drawn to an end at the Standing Rock site. On February 22, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum forced an evacuation of the protestors’ camps. The government needed time to clean the environmental mess the environmentalists left behind.

That paradoxical reality underscores many of the problems with efforts that claim to solve potential problems. In the end, this lengthy “protest” accomplished none of its stated goals, cost millions to those on both sides, and left the area in crisis thanks to the very sorts who claimed to be there as a form of protection.

Instigated by resistance and lawsuits brought forth by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, protesters descended on the flats of the Cannonball River plain and encamped to resist the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The tribe has been in court battling the Army Corps of Engineers over the pipeline. Tribal elders resisted despite the dubious merit of complaints this construction would violate sacred tribal lands and threaten their water supply, even though numerous other pipelines already run through these lands.

We Just Want to Take a Toll

The tribe may have been actually just haggling over compensation. The Washington Examiner reported that during talks with the group representing the pipeline construction—Energy Transfer Partners—the tribe had been given a number of offers. Addressing the concerns cited, ETP pledged water monitoring systems and pipeline emergency support.

These offers were not accepted: “time and again the tribe rebuffed or ignored the company’s offers demanding, instead, a toll on the crude that passed through the pipeline, an ultimatum that showed the tribe’s true desire — easy money.”

With that protesters from across the country, emboldened by numerous celebrity supporters, poured into the South Dakota region. The new encampment held thousands of protesters. These were well-funded, long-term activists given the dwellings they constructed and supplies shipped in to the squatters.

Earth First—Or Second, Or At Least In the Top Ten

As the media played along with the spokespersons, relaying the message of “peaceful” protesters,” protesters clashed numerous times with authorities. Access roads to the camp were blocked with machinery and environmentally friendly tire fires. Many of these led to numerous arrests. North Dakota tabulated the cost for its taxpayers to monitor, control, and babysit these protesters since they began arriving on August 10, 2016: $33 million.

South Dakota also recorded more than 700 arrests in the course of those six months, and 92 percent of those arrested were from outside the state. Over one-third of those were people with prior criminal records, totaling 1,400 charges. These cannot be dismissed as solely charges from prior protests, for the majority were arrested over thefts or violence.

In a separate lawsuit brought against the government in court, representatives of the protesters claimed they were victims of brutality during the conflicts. The law enforcement defendants submitted lengthy paperwork displaying the voluminous amount of threats of violence from the protesters on social media and other outlets.

An early sign of hope was President Obama declaring an end to the construction project. Invoking environmental concerns, on November 6 he signed an order halting the construction. Donald Trump’s election a few days later led to a quick reversal in a new executive order on January 24.

We Love the Earth So Much We’ll Destroy It

As the protest stretched into December no end to the conflict appeared in sight. A particularly brutal snowstorm changed things drastically. As drifts of snow blew in overnight, the crowds plummeted from thousands to just a few hundred die-hards. Most of those fled instantly, abandoning the items they had trucked in. This exposed a monumental environmental threat at the location, created entirely by environmentalists.

The main camp was located at the Cannonball-Missouri confluence that was declared a significant historic Indian trading post. The protesters desecrated that sacred land with garbage. Garbage, building materials, and months of untreated human waste from thousands of squatters now threatens the very water they claimed to be protecting.

The governor forced the evacuation so crews could begin the cleanup. Hundreds of large-capacity waste removal trucks have already carted out more than 1,000 tons of waste. Another environmental hazard is underreported: authorities have counted several hundred abandoned vehicles. The camp sat on a natural floodplain, and the work now is round-the-clock to clear out waste and debris before the spring thaw.

At spring melt the Cannonball River current is strong enough to carry these left-behind vehicles, along with fuel, oil, and other polluting agents, into the Missouri River. Thus, in the desire to prevent a pipeline disaster that could pollute the Missouri someday, these globe-lovers have threatened that same river with an environmental crisis that is more likely to happen tomorrow.

A Tribe Called ‘Debt’

For its efforts to protect the region, the Sioux tribe has incurred significant losses. The land they wanted to keep pristine has been befouled by the very people who undertook their cause. The tribe has also reported $6 million in losses at its nearby casino, largely because the squatters shut down the bridge that channels gamblers to its resort. Following a number of fires protesters set on the causeway to keep out the authorities, the bridge was declared unsafe.

The tribe has collected money for the cleanup efforts, but the state of North Dakota is absorbing most of the costs. Most of the effort to clear the hazardous waste is conducted not by the tribe, but the Army Corps of Engineers.

Let’s process this: As the Sioux tribe took the Army Corps of Engineers to court to ostensibly protect lands, their resulting protest created an environmental crisis on those lands. The very same Army Corps is cleaning up the mess to prevent pollution in the very same water the tribe fears could become polluted. It doesn’t take a shaman to see this has become a self-fulfilled prophecy.

Years of writing for various outlets has taught Brad Slager an important lesson: Specializing in unique subjects can be a point of pride, until an editor lets it be known no one else was willing to cover said subjects.

Why The Left Can't Stop Campus Riots Like Middlebury's,"The Middlebury College protest on March 2 that silenced an invited speaker and hospitalized a popular professor has continued to garner attention.

More than 100 Middlebury professors—included the one injured in the encounter—have signed a statement of principles, Free Inquiry on Campus, upholding the classic virtues of “free, reasoned, and civil speech.” The document implicitly repudiates the actions of some other Middlebury professors who instigated the effort to deny Dr. Charles Murray the opportunity to speak on campus.

The American Political Science Association, representing 13,000 professors and students, issued its own statement condemning “Violence at Middlebury College.” The APSA statement says, in part, “The violence surrounding the talk undermined the ability of faculty and students to engage in the free exchange of ideas and debate, thereby impeding academic freedom on the Middlebury campus.”

How Liberals Are Responding To Middlebury’s Protest

Harry Boyte, founder of the Public Achievement movement, has written in The Huffington Post to condemn Middlebury students’ intolerant, violent actions. Boyte pointedly evoked his memories of the 1960s: “the student actions recalled the mob violence across the South which I often saw as a young man in the civil rights movement working for Martin Luther King’s organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).” Boyte also underlined the essential point: “Free speech is a crucial value for education.”

The liberal commentator Frank Bruni devoted his Sunday New York Times column, “The Dangerous Safety of College,” to lamenting “the recent melee at Middlebury.” Bruni’s point is that “somewhere along the way,” the Middlebury protesters “got the idea that they should be able to purge their world of perspectives offensive to them.” Instead of using the occasion “to hone the most eloquent” arguments against Dr. Murray, “they swarmed and swore.” Indeed they did worse than that, but Bruni provides a nice round-up of comments from liberals who firmly reject the tactics of the Middlebury protesters, if not their message.

One notable figure Bruni failed to cite is Bill McKibben, the radical environmentalist who may well be Middlebury’s best-known professor. In the same vein as Bruni, McKibben took to the pages of The Guardian to chastise his fellow activists for choosing the wrong tactic to express their disdain for Dr. Murray. McKibben explains that by preventing Murray from speaking, they conferred on him a “new standing” and made him “a martyr to the cause of free speech.” It would have been better to have “taken all the available seats, and then got up and peacefully left.”

Many other Middlebury students, alumni, and faculty members have been writing and posting about the events as well, and because I published one of the longest and most detailed accounts of what happened, I received many private communications as well as pointers to other items of interest.

Interest in the story seems to be growing because it has implications well beyond the one small college in Vermont where the events took place. In that light, I think it useful to summarize the discussion so far, starting with the microcosm of Middlebury itself.

Yes, The Protest Really Became A Riot

I heard from quite a few people at Middlebury who praised my account of what happened during Dr. Murray’s visit to campus and who upheld its accuracy. But I also heard from two who disagreed. One appeared to be an undergraduate student who was incensed at the word “riot” in the title of my essay, “How Middlebury College Enabled the Student Riot During Charles Murray’s Visit.” That title, assigned by The Federalist, was accurate.

As riots go, the protest against Dr. Murray was not in the same league as the February 1 protest against Milo Yiannopoulos at the University of California Berkeley. That caused more than half a million dollars of property damage, as well as criminal assaults on individuals. Yet the Middlebury protest took the form of a series of lawless acts carried out by a mob, i.e. a riot.

This student’s objection to the word shines a light on what the Middlebury protesters thought they were doing. Some at least continue to imagine they stand on high moral ground. They protested; they didn’t riot. The distinction, I suspect, is that their actions were executed according to plan rather than helter-skelter. But while riots may turn helter-skelter, they are almost always in their initial phases staged.

The Middlebury riot, we now know, was planned days in advance. The college administration thought it had worked out a deal with the organizers. The arrangement was that the protesters would turn their backs and walk out. Some of the students who stood up still thought that was the plan and were caught by surprise when the leaders kept them locked in place and turned the protest into sustained chanting and clapping, in defiance of the college’s rules.

The Proper Balance Between Emotion And Restraint

The college officials believed the protesters would let off some steam and then let Dr. Murray proceed with his speech. What they got instead was a mob in which the disdain for Dr. Murray intensified by the minute.

This presents a good question for social psychologists. When does a protest moderate emotional intensity, and when does it heighten it? All the vitriolic accusations against Murray (e.g. “Racist, sexist, anti-gay, Charles Murray go away”) repeated loudly over and over in unison surely did nothing to relieve tensions, but only to exacerbate the crowd’s feeling of righteous indignation.

There was also at play a tension between the euphoria achieved by seizing control of the room, on one hand, and the protesters’ underlying sense of powerlessness, since they could not through sheer declaration make Dr. Murray disappear. Feeling powerful and powerless at the same moment is a dangerous combination. The events that followed—fire alarms, rampaging in the hallways, and ultimately the physical assault on Professor Stanger—testify to that combustibility.

How Vice President Burger Responded

I heard from Middlebury’s Vice President for Communications and Chief Marketing Officer, Bill Burger, who had made a brief appearance in my article for his anemic warning to the crowd before the event got underway. I wrote that his soft warning was “surely something” that the college president had approved in advance. Burger asked me to correct that inference, saying, “You should know that President Patton did not see or review the statement in advance, so any critique should be directed at me alone.” I informed the editor at The Federalist, who promptly added an update to the end of the article.

But what was Mr. Burger’s request really about? My guess is that Middlebury officials scrutinized my article for errors, and this is what they came up with. He also tried to persuade me that President Patton’s remarks were really a “clear defense of the ideal of free speech on campus.” But this was mere spin on the vice president’s part. I replied:

I stand by what I said. President Patton referred to the principle of free speech and mentioned some of its possible contexts, but she came nowhere close to offering any reason why free speech matters. The ideals of free speech, so masterfully presented in “Free Inquiry on Campus,” the document currently garnering signatures among Middlebury faculty, are utterly absent in President Patton’s six and a half minute talk. She had time to repeat verbatim other things, such as her “no matter their race…” declaration, but no time at all to tell those students who had already declared their hostility to Dr. Murray’s free speech that there are profound principles of justice and intellectual integrity at stake in permitting someone with whom they disagreed to have his say.

Patton gave a superficial nod to the ideal of free inquiry but didn’t invest it with any particular urgency. She spent more time assuring the students that she hated Murray’s ideas as much as they did. This maneuver was also adopted by Professor Stanger and many of the liberal writers who have subsequently condemned the tactics of the protesters. Generally they repeat the conceit that Murray is a racist bigot, but argue that those views need to be refuted rather than silenced. Of course, to refute Murray’s views would require reading his books and mastering his arguments—a step that very few appear to have taken.

The Mystery of Professor Stanger

Allison Stanger, the faculty member who was injured by protesters when she and Dr. Murray were attempting to leave campus, posted an account of the evening on Facebook, March 4. It is a helpful explanation of the prelude to the protest. Professor Stanger said she agreed to participate with Dr. Murray “because while my students may know I am a Democrat, all of my courses are nonpartisan, and this was a chance to demonstrate publicly my commitment to a free and fair exchange of views in my classroom.”

Her account of the protest itself, however, veers away from the evidence of the YouTube video. In the video, Professor Stanger is repeatedly seen smiling and apparently having a good time during the protest, which she eventually joins by clapping and chanting along with the other protesters. But in her Facebook post, she wrote,

I want you to know what it feels like to look out at a sea of students yelling obscenities at other members of my beloved community. There were students and faculty who wanted to hear the exchange, but were unable to do so, either because of the screaming and chanting and chair-pounding in the room, or because their seats were occupied by those who refused to listen, and they were stranded outside the doors. I saw some of my faculty colleagues who had publicly acknowledged that they had not read anything Dr. Murray had written join the effort to shut down the lecture. All of this was deeply unsettling to me. What alarmed me most, however, was what I saw in student eyes from up on that stage. Those who wanted the event to take place made eye contact with me. Those intent on disrupting it steadfastly refused to do so. It was clear to me that they had effectively dehumanized me. They couldn’t look me in the eye, because if they had, they would have seen another human being. There is a lot to be angry about in America today, but nothing good ever comes from demonizing our brothers and sisters.

These words are wildly discrepant with the video. Professor Stanger on tape does not look the least bit “unsettled” or like someone who feels “dehumanized” or “demonized.”

Did Stanger Really Condemn The Protest?

Apparently nobody noticed her appearance on the video until I drew attention to it, at which point Professor Stanger had already been anointed a hero for her brave actions in defense of free speech.

As a consequence, I heard from several Middlebury faculty members and alumni who valiantly tried to explain away her actions recorded on the video. One faculty member, for example, wrote:

All I can say about Allison is that you’ve misread it. She was the ONLY member of the faculty who publicly and repeatedly defended Murray before during and after the even as a serious social scientists. She was totally courageous. Clapping was clearly part of her saying, “I’m really sincerely with you on Black Lives Matter.” I’m still in awe of your putative ability to interpret the meaning of a broad smile. And you are just factually wrong in your claim that she said nothing to stop the protest. Watch it again. She took the podium and told the students she had really tough questions and they should let the event proceed so she could answer them.

I’m inclined to say one picture is worth a thousand words, and we have more than one picture. Professor Stanger’s smile may be as inexplicable as the Mona Lisa’s, but it is plainly not the affect of someone in distress. Clapping and chanting in a room with hundreds of others doing the same thing cannot plausibly be construed as a way to win over the mob. That Stanger was saying, “I’m really sincerely with you,” seems right. Being “sincerely with” a mob that has just spent the previous 20 minutes silencing a speaker is a message very much at odds with decorum and common sense.

Stanger is very well liked at Middlebury, and I give her full credit for being willing to defend Murray’s right to speak when so many others sought to silence him. That she was the victim of a violent assault stemming from her willingness to defend free speech does testify to her courage. But people are complex and their motives are often mixed. Courage at one moment doesn’t preclude clouded judgment at another.

Middlebury Tries To Regain Its Reputation The Wrong Way

Middlebury faculty and administrators are worried about the damage the Murray shout-down and assault on Stanger may do to the college’s reputation. One step towards damage control is a three-page document, “Useful Information Regarding Charles Murray’s Middlebury Visit”: sent by the dean of admissions, Greg Buckles, and the special programs coordinator, Joanne Leggett, to alumni. The document advises alumni how to talk to prospective students about what happened. First and foremost, Buckles and Leggett want those prospective students to know that Middlebury College didn’t invite Murray. It was a student group that did it, and the College in no way endorses Murray’s views.

This is astonishing. Even after the national attention Middlebury has received for suppressing free speech, the dean of admissions is at pains to put as much distance as possible between the college and the speaker.

No one in the outside world assumes that the presence of a speaker on campus represents an endorsement of that speaker’s views. To go to such lengths to disclaim any endorsement of a speaker is, in effect, to endorse the views of those who dislike or disparage him. That’s an especially troublesome position to take when, as in Dr. Murray’s case, his views have been grossly paraphrased and misrepresented by opponents who are more interested in using him as a bogeyman than in considering what he actually has to say.

Buckles and Leggett also provide a summary of the actions that Middlebury has taken, including Patton’s letter saying that she is focused on “both accountability for the protesters’ behavior as well as community-building to help repair a large campus divide highlighted by these events.” We are also informed that the Middlebury Police Department is investigating. But matters of social justice will not be forgotten: “We will recognize critical matters of race, inclusion, class, sexual and gender identity, and other factors that too often divide us.”

How To Address Disruptive Conduct On Campus?

By coincidence, just days after the Middlebury incident, the University of Chicago released a new Faculty Report on University Discipline for Disruptive Conduct. It is a welcome step for all of American higher education. Mostly it restores to the campus authorities charged with maintaining order the tools they need to do their jobs. For shorthand, let’s call it the DDC report.

DDC is the other shoe dropping after Chicago’s well received but incomplete 2015 Report of the Committee on Freedom of Expression, now called the Stone Report (for its author, Professor Geoffrey Stone). The Stone Report provided an eloquent reaffirmation of the importance of free speech in higher education but said nothing about how the university should respond to those who violate others’ rights to free expression.

DDC fills that gap by calling for a centralized disciplinary system; improvements in event management including authorizing the “dean-on-call” to take action when faced with disruptive conduct; including outside visitors to campus under the rules; making sure students understand their responsibilities; and amending the university’s old procedures (“Statute 21”) to take account of the new tactics often employed by disruptors.

A key change is the recognition that disruption these days is seldom the act of a lone individual but rather a coordinated act by a group of individuals. Each member of the group may stop short of committing an act of major disruption, but by concerting their actions, the members of the group can create havoc.

How To Persuade And Control College Students?

If Steve Hayward is right, the Chicago statements are too little, too late. In “Free Speech Is Not Enough,” he argues that the protesters are immune to appeals for the importance of free expression because that is an ideal they have discarded. In its place they have embraced the idea that America is so profoundly corrupt in so many ways that free speech is nothing more than another “tool of oppression.” In its place, they have put their peculiar idea of “social justice,” to be obtained by collective use of force.

Those who embrace this doctrine, formulated by the sixties Marxist Herbert Marcuse, cannot be persuaded or shamed to allow their opponents to speak. They mean to get their way by main force, or as they sometimes put it, “by any means necessary.” Hayward cites Stephen Carter’s essay, “The Ideology Behind Intolerant College Students,” as a fuller tracing of Marcuse’s influence.

The Marcusian ideology has been present in American higher education and on the leftist political fringe at a low dosage for decades. Angela Davis was a student of Marcuse. But Marcusian conceits are wrapped into the rationales of many violent leftist radicals who never sat in the philosophy professor’s classroom. Judith Clark, the getaway driver in the in the 1981 Brink’s armored car robbery in Rockland County, New York, in which a guard and two state troopers were murdered, went to prison unrepentant and convinced of the justice of her cause.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently commuted Clark’s 75-year sentence, making her eligible for parole. She may soon be on college campuses lecturing like her fellow Weather Underground terrorist and partner in the Brink’s robbery, Kathy Boudin, paroled in 2003 and now a professor at Columbia University.

The Marcusian Movement Has Led Us Here

The Marcusian movement has plenty of innocent blood on its hands. Bryan Burrough’s recent book, “Days of Rage,” which traces in detail the bombings and other attacks orchestrated by the Weather Underground and other such groups in the 1970s, is a helpful reminder of what happens when fully radicalized students carry their premises to their logical conclusions. What happens is lawless violence.

It isn’t just Marcuse’s ideas that are responsible for the close-mindedness of today’s student rioters. Harry Boyte points out that a generation of political organizing has accustomed students to hatred of opponents. Boyte says that millions of young people in the last two generations have been organized by groups such as Citizens for a Better Environment and the Public Interest Research Group to canvass—“paid staff going door to door on an issue, raising money, and collecting signatures.” The canvass trained them to hate their opponents:

Today’s generation has learned a Manichean formula for making change: find an enemy to demonize, use a script that defines the issue and portrays those on the other side in good-versus-evil terms, inflames emotion, and shuts down critical thought, and convey the idea that those championing the victims will come to the rescue. … the Manichean model of the canvass polarizes civic life and erodes our common citizenship, communicating politics as warfare.

PIRG and its cohorts provided the basic training; now their army is going to war.

In that sense, perhaps Stanger got off lightly. It is doubtful that the Middlebury thugs have thought through where their nihilistic doctrine will eventually take them. They are still thug-lets, enjoying the sensation of power that participation in a successful mob action has given them. For many of them, that sensation will wear off. But perhaps a few will continue down the path that leads to what Stanger says she saw in their eyes: dehumanization.

Perhaps Trustees Can Help Protect Free Speech

There are clearly many liberals, as well as others further to the political left, who see the dangers posed by a radical movement that rejects the principles of intellectual freedom and freedom of expression. One danger, in their eyes, is that the left’s near monopoly in higher education could be jeopardized if state legislatures started to take seriously the need the need to maintain fair-minded exchange of ideas on college campuses.

That movement has already begun in the form of model legislation put forward by Stanley Kurtz, James Manley, and Jonathan Butcher in connection with the Goldwater Institute. I’ve included some similar proposals to amend the Higher Education Act in the National Association of Scholar’s Freedom to Learn Amendments.

But liberals seem to be even more exercised by the direct danger to themselves and to all of higher education by a movement that avidly attacks the very basis of intellectual inquiry. The worry is sincere and, in many cases, eloquently expressed. But it is also a loose sail, flapping in the wind. Few of the worriers have proposed any practical solution. The University of Chicago Faculty Report on University Discipline for Disruptive Conduct comes closest. It at least provides a plan of action when protesters disrupt an event. It is, however, silent on the origins of those disruptions in an ideology that legitimizes the effort to silence opposing views.

Appointing a Wyatt Earp as campus president is unlikely to solve the problem. The faculty members who promote the Marcusian line and its variants are often tenured and will not change their ways.

What then? The best approach I’ve seen is Thomas Klingenstein’s idea of trustees creating their own committee on free expression to keep a closer eye on these developments. The trustees of a college have the power, should they choose to exercise it, to change the character of a campus culture. They seldom exercise that power, but Middlebury provides an exemplary case of why they should.

"If Tim Kaine's Son’s Protest Was ‘Peaceful,’ What Would Be Violent?","Much talk of late has centered on how the Trump presidency is upending historically recognized norms. Recently, a Hill headline blared “Presidential code smashed under Trump.” Few would disagree that President Trump is indeed changing the way we view the presidency. Some of the changes are positive, while others may require immediate and significant reassessment (which may or may not involve the use of 140-character expressions).

However, the fixation on Trump and his effects on Washington DC and the historically recognized machinations of government miss the truly transformational change in norms taking placing nationwide. Those opposing the president and known as the “resistance” are fundamentally and potentially irrevocably altering the norms of civil discourse rooted in the First Amendment.

Last weekend, the frightening obliteration of respect for the free speech rights of political opponents was brought into focus when anti-Trump rioters at the Minnesota state capitol maligned supporters of President Trump. Throughout our nation’s history, it has been an accepted political norm that, aside from a few limited exceptions, while one almost always has the right to express a political opinion, that right does not include the freedom to stifle another citizen’s right to express a countervailing viewpoint.

With the rise of the “resistance,” this norm now seems like a relic. Gone are the days when political opponents permit one another to express political viewpoints. Instead, resistors appear willing to use any available tool to drown out political opponents’ First Amendment rights.

Resisting Arrest Is ‘Peaceful,’ Right?

The actual tactics of the Minnesota resistors were not what made the events of last weekend so frightening. To be sure, they were by no means peaceful or respectful of Trump supporters’ rights to express their views. It’s that the extreme tactics are no longer relegated to the fringes of the Left’s resistance movement.

None other than Sen. Tim Kaine, the man who came within less than 100,000 votes of the vice presidency (77,744, to be precise), provided a glowing endorsement of the actions of his son “Woody,” who was among six individuals arrested for disrupting the pro-Trump rally in Minnesota. He responded to his son’s arrest by noting “[w]e love that our three children have their own views and concerns about current political issues. They fully understand the responsibility to express those concerns peacefully.”

I hate to break it to the good senator from Virginia, but I’m not so sure Woody does in fact understand his responsibility to express his political concerns civilly. What is more, if the senator considers his son’s activities “peaceful,” I’d hate to see what he considers violent protests.

Kaine was part of a group of 50 individuals that descended on the Trump supporters at the Minnesota capitol. After setting off fireworks and smoke bombs inside the capitol, one of which allegedly struck a Trump supporter in the head, the six “peaceful” protestors fled the scene. According to local reports, “Kaine was approached by a St. Paul officer but attempted to run away.” Eventually, “an officer caught him and took him to the ground where he continued to resist arrest. The officer used a chemical irritant and used a knee strike to subdue Kaine.” Needless to say, according to police, Kaine “was not cooperative.”

This Behavior Is Increasingly The Norm

The Minnesota example is but one in a long line of disruptions that have occurred since the Trump presidency began. Over the weekend Trump press secretary Sean Spicer was harassed at an Apple store. Two weeks ago, respected author and commentator Charles Murray was shouted down by millennial agitators at Middlebury College. The disruptions were so extreme that Murray was unable to deliver any remarks and was rushed off the campus, with a professor getting assaulted along the way for good measure.

In February, rioters set fire to the Berkeley campus in response to the anticipated talk from Milo Yiannopoulos. In a sign of what was to come, rioters destroyed businesses and assaulted police officers in Washington DC following the inauguration of President Trump. Since then, more than 200 rioters have since been federally indicted.

My home state of Wisconsin has not been immune from the “resistance.” Also in February, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro provided his perspective to interested students at Marquette University, but not before Marquette staff members were caught red-handed attempting to secure seats to prevent interested students from attending. In November, Shapiro was forced to shout over protestors at the University of Wisconsin who had commandeered the stage.

Kaine and his like-minded agitators may consider the above tactics part of the new norm of political resistance. Some may shrug their shoulders and wonder what the Left, apparently so maligned by the president and all that he stands for, is supposed to do.

Such a sentiment misidentifies the techniques the Left is currently using and, more importantly, tramples on the real political norm of peaceful political resistance enshrined in the First Amendment. The techniques used by the likes of Kaine’s son are nothing to be proud of. Kaine is free to be proud of his son’s passion for political activism and his purported independent political thought process, but he should be ashamed of his son’s desire to physically prevent political opponents from peaceably expressing their views.

Violent Protest Is Un-American

Such a norm has long be enshrined in the political norms of this nation. Some of the most transformational political movements in America’s history reveal principles that are the antithesis of what Kaine now endorses.

Susan B. Anthony, who continued the work of abolitionists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, fought for women’s suffrage and the ultimate passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. When fined for voting in the November 1872 election, Anthony boldly told the judge, “[m]ay it please your honour, I will never pay a dollar of your unjust penalty … And I shall earnestly and persistently continue to urge all women to the practical recognition of the old Revolutionary maxim, ‘Resistance to tyranny is obedience to God.’”

The resistance Anthony urged was anything but the resistance we see today. In fact, women supporting suffrage boldly stood in the face of such violent resistance in 1913 when counter-protestors attacked participants in a DC suffrage parade, injuring hundreds of women.

Writing from a Birmingham jail in 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. declared, “I have consistently preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use be as pure as the ends we seek.” Remember the context in which the letter was written. King was in Birmingham to lead a public protest and boycott, specifically in response to white city leader’s pleas to quietly use the courts and not the streets to secure civil rights. King therefore responded not by advocating violent rioting in response to the white leaders, but “nonviolence … pure as the ends we seek,” albeit in public view.

For somebody that came within a few extra campaign stops of the vice presidency to endorse the type of violent protests that have become the norm in the Trump era is an affront to the largely peaceful leaders and movements that have preceded the current unrest.

Kaine should explain to the American people how the plight of today’s millennial snowflakes, who appear to make up the majority of today’s most violent resistors, justify today’s protests when millions of women and African-Americans, who unlike these millennials had been systemically prevented from enjoying basic civil rights, somehow found a way to largely peacefully protests their injustices. The norm of peaceful political discourse rooted in the First Amendment is something we should all be able to fight for—peacefully and civilly.

How Not To Think About Vladimir Putin,"On Sunday, tens of thousands of Russians poured into the streets of Moscow to protest corruption and the government of President Vladimir Putin. In response, the Russian police arrested nearly a thousand people, including opposition leader Aleksei Navalny.

The Moscow protest was one of more than 90 rallies that took place Sunday across the country, from Vladivostok in Siberia to Kaliningrad in the Baltics. Police cracked down on those demonstrations, too, all of which the government deemed illegal. They were the largest coordinated anti-Kremlin protests since the massive pro-democracy demonstrations of 2011-12 following national elections protesters claim were tainted by fraud.

The protests and police crackdown are a reminder of what the Putin regime really is, and why it’s dangerous for conservatives to delude themselves into thinking Putin is anything more than a drearily familiar twentieth-century-style autocrat and gangster. But that’s exactly what a growing number of conservatives are doing. It’s no secret the alt-right lionizes Putin as a defender of traditional values and ethnic nationalism. Nor is it a secret that President Trump finds much to admire in the Russian leader.

But it’s not just Trump or the alt-right. For a growing number of Christians concerned about the erosion of traditional values and issues like abortion and same-sex marriage, Putin’s cultural conservatism has a certain appeal as a bulwark against the moral relativism of progressivism. Christian leaders like Franklin Graham have praised Putin for “protecting traditional Christianity,” while Pat Buchanan has said Putin is America’s ally against ISIS.

No, Putin Is Not Atatürk

This benign view of Putin has begun to creep into mainstream conservatism, not just because of Russia’s supposed defense of traditional marriage and family values, but because of Putin’s seeming commitment to national sovereignty—an issue that resonates with Republican voters. Back in December, a poll conducted by the Economist and YouGov found 37 percent of Republicans held a favorable view of Putin, up from 24 percent in September 2016 and just 10 percent in July 2014.

Now, eminent conservative writers like The Weekly Standard’s Christopher Caldwell have taken up the cause of explaining Putin’s appeal to fellow conservatives. In a recent speech published by Hillsdale College’s Imprimis, Caldwell—a writer and thinker of great talent and subtlety, and usually of excellent judgment—argues that by traditional standards, Putin is not, in fact, a common kleptocrat and murderer but a great leader who has saved his country from ruin. Putin, writes, Caldwell,

did what Kemal Atatürk had done in Turkey in the 1920s. Out of a crumbling empire, he rescued a nation-state, and gave it coherence and purpose. He disciplined his country’s plutocrats. He restored its military strength. And he refused, with ever blunter rhetoric, to accept for Russia a subservient role in an American-run world system drawn up by foreign politicians and business leaders. His voters credit him with having saved his country.

With all due respect to Caldwell, this is wishful thinking that borders on the delusional. For one thing, Putin didn’t “discipline” Russia’s plutocrats and billionaires, he co-opted them. A raft of books have examined how Putin and his erstwhile KGB associates, together with Russian crime syndicates, orchestrated a massive looting of their country’s wealth and secured a new regime in Moscow.

One such book, Karen Dawisha’s Putin’s Kleptocracy (2014), ties many previous works together to chronicle in detail how this effort began long before Putin came to power in 2000. In her introduction, Dawisha writes that, “from the beginning Putin and his circle sought to create an authoritarian regime ruled by a close-knit cabal…who used democracy for decoration rather than direction.”

Caldwell claims Putin inherited a kleptocracy from Boris Yeltsin after democracy failed to take root in deeply corrupt post-Soviet Russia. In fact, Putin helped orchestrate the failure of democracy in Russia in the 1990s, in part by doing what Caldwell accuses Yeltsin’s former communist cronies of doing: turning state assets and cash into private fortunes. Thanks to Putin and a determined group of revanchist KGB officers intent on reinstituting Soviet-style control, in collusion with organized crime, Russian democracy never really had a chance.

Moscow Doesn’t Care What The Russian People Think

All of this is well-trod ground, and no one familiar with post-Soviet Russian history should dispute it. What Caldwell and other conservatives, like Hugh Hewitt, often point to in their assessments of Putin is how well he has served his country’s “national interests.” From the invasion and annexation of Crimea to Russia’s purported intervention against ISIS in Syria’s civil war, Putin has put Russia’s national interests first, they say, and done so in the face of global opposition.

That’s one way to look at it. But what Putin and his fellow oligarchs consider Russia’s national interests are probably not what ordinary Russians think they are. For all its military might, Russia is a very poor country with huge demographic problems. A year ago, nearly 20 million Russians (13.4 percent of the population) were reportedly living in poverty, on less than $139 a month. Last year saw a spike in labor protests, mostly related to unpaid wages. Some 82 percent of Russians say they can feel the effects of their country’s economic decline, up from 61 percent in 2014.

In this context, do ordinary Russians think that propping up the Assad regime in Syria, or preventing Ukraine from joining NATO, or meddling in other countries’ elections, are core national interests? Probably not, although we’ll never know because Putin’s Russia, like any run-of-the-mill autocratic regime, isn’t all that interested in what ordinary people think.

That gets to the heart of the problem. Caldwell says Putin has become “a symbol of national sovereignty in its battle with globalism.” But national sovereignty doesn’t mean much if the government doesn’t derive its powers from the consent of the governed. Conservatives, who are supposed to care about things like free speech and civil rights, shouldn’t need the spectacle of mass protests and police brutality to remind them that the Russian people are not sovereign in Putin’s empire.

That they do need such a reminder should tell us more about the state of our political discourse than it does about Russia’s.

Why Public Schools Will Always Include Religious Indoctrination,"Religious indoctrination is an important function of American public education. The main reason most Americans don’t know this is that the religion of the public schools reflects the religion of the wider American culture. It has been this way from the beginning.

In the decades leading up to the Civil War, the mainstream of American culture was actively and devoutly Protestant—much more so than it had been at the time of the founding. The eighteenth-century Enlightenment had somewhat tamed American colonial devotion to Christianity with an emphasis on reasonableness.

Then the revivals of the early nineteenth-century Second Great Awakening placed piety front and center again in American religious life. The faith preached from the pulpit became woven with the American spirit.

Public Schools Were Created to Reinforce Protestantism

During that time, numerous American cities began supporting “common schools,” another name for public schools. One of the goals of the movement was to counter the budding influence of Catholic schools formed to educate the growing populace of Catholic immigrants from Europe.

American Protestants saw Catholicism as anti-freedom and anti-American. Catholics were not trusted, and neither were their “sectarian” schools. So the common school movement received eager support in part to maintain Protestantism’s dominance.

Common schools included “nonsectarian” religious exercises, which essentially meant Protestant exercises. These included Bible readings (which Catholicism then taught should not take place without the interpretation of a priest) from the King James Bible (a Protestant translation). Protestant exercises were nonsectarian only in the eyes of a culture dominated by Protestantism.

The American Religion Becomes Secular Atheism

The religious tenor of the country shifted in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Secular beliefs, such as naturalism and especially progressivism, gradually penetrated the culture. At the same time, Protestant exercises in public schools slowly began to be removed because they were seen, rightly, as sectarian. We may see this as a victory for religious freedom, but it was mainly just a reflection of cultural change.

After World War II, as secular progressivism became dominant among the elite in our halls of justice and education, secular beliefs were labeled “neutral.” Of course, those beliefs were neutral only in the eyes of secular culture, in the same way that Protestantism had been seen as nonsectarian by Protestant culture a century before.

The Supreme Court even held so in 1961, because it noted that secularist atheism teaches certain things about the ultimate purpose of man and existence of God, which are religious beliefs that can never be proven by science or any other mechanistic means of knowing. Such religious beliefs directly contradict other religious beliefs, and affect teaching methods, curricula, and school policies. Schools simply cannot function without teaching some sort of cohesive set of belief, since this provides the context and direction for every human life and every child’s maturity.

If You Don’t Share Public Schools’ Religion, Do Something

That trajectory has continued to today. Secular progressivism has metastasized into an absolutist worldview with a religious fervor that brooks no compromise. Gay history, transgender locker rooms, social justice crammed into every aspect of the curriculum, great thinkers from Aristotle to Madison despised as nothing more than dead white males—all of this comes courtesy of progressivism. It is the dominant worldview of the most dominant institutions in our culture. Our public school children are, quite simply, the objects of a mass movement of progressive worldview indoctrination. That is, religious indoctrination.

American conservatives simply cannot afford to let this happen to our children. America’s future is truly at stake. When choosing a school for our children, we must take into account not only the quality of the education our children will receive, but the worldview in which they will be immersed.

Private schools and homeschooling can be great alternatives, but they’re costly and aren’t necessarily for everyone. Charter schools and vouchers for private schooling can help. There are also short courses and books designed to expose progressivism for what it is. By whatever means we can afford, we must protect our children’s minds from the religious indoctrination of our nation’s public schools.

Protest Shuts Up War Hero For Opposing Women In Combat 40 Years Ago,"Just weeks after protesters at Middlebury College in Vermont violently shut down a presentation by the distinguished author Charles Murry for publishing ideas they didn’t like, the thought police have struck again.

Decorated war hero and lifelong public servant Jim Webb has been forced to decline the Distinguished Graduate Award from the Naval Academy Alumni Association due to what he described as a “small but vociferous group of women graduates” who oppose him.

Webb graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1968, served as a U.S. Marine in a rifle platoon, was a company commander during the Vietnam War, received the Navy Cross for “extraordinary heroism,” the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, and two Purple Hearts, was secretary of the Navy (1987-1988), and served as a U.S. senator (2006-2013).

He also gave one of the most impressive answers of the 2016 presidential election when, during one of the Democratic debates, in response to the question “Which enemy that you made during your political career are you most proud of?” he replied it was the enemy soldier who threw a grenade at him, but “he’s not around anymore.”

The Naval Academy’s Distinguished Graduate Award is given to alumni whose ”character, service and stature draw wholesome comparison to the qualities that the U.S. Naval Academy strives for in keeping with its ideals of duty, honor, loyalty and integrity,” of which Webb is clearly worthy.

Webb wrote in a statement explaining his decision to decline the award, “I am being told that my presence at the ceremony would likely mar the otherwise celebratory nature of that special day, and as a consequence I find it necessary to decline to accept the award.” In other words, there would be protesters to shut down the ceremony.

Jim Webb’s Unpardonable Sin: Crimethought

So, what, per this vociferous group of women graduates, is the unpardonable sin that trumps Webb’s phenomenal record of service? In 1979 Webb wrote a lengthy essay in the Washingtonian called “Women Can’t Fight.” Pointing out the physical differences between men and women that lead to demonstrably different warfighting capabilities is blasphemy against progressive doctrine.

It isn’t enough that he was (presumably, still is) willing to die for our country, or that he chose a life of public service. Nor is it enough that when he was secretary of the Navy he expanded the number of opportunities for women to serve in the Navy. Webb tried to defend himself by pointing to his record and the statements of many women who know him, but the protesters would not be reasoned with. That’s a characteristic of the hard Left. They reject reasoned discourse, differences of opinion, and any good faith show of compromise.

In addition to the offense some women still take from Webb’s thoughts on a narrow topic, women Academy graduates also claim Webb’s thoughts made a hostile environment at the Academy worse for women. In 2006 ret. Cmdr. Jennifer Brooks said at an anti-Webb news conference, “Jim Webb didn’t create harassment against women at the academy, but I truly believe he increased its intensity.”

While refusing to apologize for the arguments he made in the essay or accepting the claim that his words made an aggressive military environment more…aggressive, he did say “to the extent that my writing subjected women at the academy or the active armed forces to undue hardship, I remain profoundly sorry.” He has also apologized for some of the ways he illustrated his points, blaming his youth.

Jim Webb Is Being Punished for Telling the Truth

So, aside from the provocative headline to the essay, what are these dangerous and unacceptable thoughts for which Webb must be punished, not merely for expressing one time decades ago, but for thinking them at all and possibly even still thinking them?

It is that men and women are naturally different and that those differences, at war, are especially meaningful. According to Webb (and nature), not only are men better suited for combat, but women affect men such that mixing the sexes in combat is not conducive for making the most effective lethal force, and that the combat environment is not good for women. In other words, he expressed obvious truths of which most honest people recognize, and are considered sexist bigotry by the Left. Moreover, he did it in a powerfully compelling way, which really got him into trouble.

Webb began by illustrating some of the horrors of war in details from his own memory that are not easily forgotten by those who read them.

When we needed to make a call of nature we squatted off a trail or straddled a slit trench that had been dug between fighting holes, always by necessity in public view. We slept in makeshift hooches made out of ponchos, or simply wrapped up in a poncho, sometimes so exhausted that we did not feel the rain fall on our own faces. Most of us caught hookworm, dysentery, malaria, or yaws, and some of us had all of them. We became vicious and aggressive and debased, and reveled in it, because combat is all of those things and we were surviving. I once woke up in the middle of the night to the sounds of one of my machinegunners stabbing an already-dead enemy soldier, emptying his fear and frustrations into the corpse’s chest.

He went on to explain some differences between the sexes, even using the politically explosive term “sexual roles.” His descriptions were unvarnished and impolite, to be sure, but false?

Men are more aggressive than women, observes Webb, and war entails brutal aggression. In his words, “The function of combat is not merely to perpetrate violence, but to perpetrate violence on command, instantaneously and reflexively. The function of the service academies is to prepare men for leadership positions where they may someday exercise that command.”

If You Can’t Take Contrary Ideas, You Can’t Take Combat

Realizing even then as he wrote that some might understand him, Webb clarified that he thought the military held non-combat roles suitable for women, that he was glad to see women advancing in other civilian careers, and that he could envision a woman president one day.

But combat? No. Women, are not only different than men by nature, they also naturally have an effect on men that weakens the lethality of the force. They, according to Webb, have a refining effect on men, precisely what was not needed when men are training to be effective warfighters.

Those thin-skinned women only prove themselves unfit for any kind of opposition, let alone combat.

Towards the end of the essay, Webb laments the damage to women of the military training necessary for combat missions, and says he admires such women “more for who they are than for what they are doing.” I can just see the women Academy graduates who oppose Webb and their modern feminist cohorts seething at the notion that a manly warrior cares about their wellbeing and has a natural desire to protect them from harm.

Those thin-skinned women only prove themselves unfit for any kind of opposition, let alone combat. Whoever is unable to grapple with another’s ideas without taking great personal offense, especially if those ideas come from an American hero who happens to believe women are worthy of esteem and worth defending and keeping out of the misery of war, it’s safe to assume isn’t going to fare well against barbaric jihadists.

Webb includes in his essay a statement about how individuals could not freely state what he was willing to without fear of retribution, and although his words certainly applied then, they seem especially apropos now: “Courage comes in many forms. And today at the Naval Academy, courage sometimes means simply stating your opinion when it varies from prescribed policy… It is as if one statement of dissent left unrepudiated might beget a tidal wave of agreement.”

Webb is an American patriot, a war hero, a keen observer of human nature, and a courageous defender of free speech. May many more men follow his example, because now more than ever, the country needs them.

Pepsi's Kendall Jenner Ad Is Everything That's Wrong With Millennials,"Pepsi just dropped a new ad starring Kendall Jenner. Although she is my favorite member of the Kardashian/Jenner clan, the ad is TERRIBLE.

Allow me to break it down scene by scene for you.

In the beginning, there’s a man playing a cello on top of a roof, for reasons that aren’t made clear.

Followed by a vaguely purposed protest.

A girl in a hijab who is a photographer.

Aaaaaand Kendall Jenner in a blonde wig posing for a photoshoot.

Cello dude and hijab girl then join the protest, which we still don’t know the purpose of, and eventually coax Jenner into joining them as they pass by her on the street.

She dramatically rips off her wig and joins the protest. We are still kept in the dark about the purpose of the demonstration.

She then grabs a can of Pepsi and hands it to one of the cops, who are all standing in a line facing the protestors in a menacing way.

The officer takes the soda and drinks it, then shrugs to one of his police officer friends like: “What’s a guy to do?”

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Then everyone cheers.

Then we see Kendall walking away with her new friends.

“Live bolder, live louder, live for now,” the ad concludes.

Questions abound: What are these people protesting? Why are the cops there? Are they going to arrest everyone? Are they there to protect them? What convinced Jenner to join the protest? Also, what were the cops planning to do before they were offered a can of soda?

The annoying part about this ad is that Pepsi knows they don’t need to answer any of these questions, because the point of vague protests filled with demonstrators wearing hijabs and ripped jeans is already clear to all. Millennials have Selma envy, and yucky soda companies know it. They threw in a Kardashian for good measure.

What makes it all perhaps a little bit worse is that Pepsi didn’t use some out-of-touch Madison Ave. company to come up with this lame quasi-version of “I’d like to buy the world a Coke.” They did it themselves. Pepsi is going all in and embracing these vague, social justice-y values in an effort to be cool. It’s sad.

I miss the good old days, when Pepsi was transparent about their brand’s values and had Britney Spears star in their commercials.

Ah, some honesty. How refreshing!

What I Saw In Union Square At My First Syria Strikes Protest,"This was my first time. I was kind of expecting to be disappointed—you hear a lot of things about your first time out. All the excitement, the pictures, the tweets from people who’ve been there, done that. I’m talking about going to a protest, obviously.

Suspecting there’d be antifa black bloc types there, I wanted to blend in, so I donned my new chucks, real leather jacket, and a nice grey sweater, since it was cold. Looking like an extra from a wintertime version of “Grease,” off I went to Union Square to observe my first protest.

These guys did not allow their chess game to be interrupted. True pros.

There were lots of speakers, and they didn’t exactly lay out their bona fides prior to taking the mic. One was still very upset about Agent Orange use in Vietnam. They liked to chant stuff like “U.S. imperalist is number one terrorist.” The speakers paused after what they thought were applause lines, but I think this was the crowd’s first time too, because the pauses between applause break and applause were at least eight months pregnant.

There was a guy with a boom box who said he was from Brazil. Based on his jump suit and boom box he could have said “from the ’80s” and I would have believed him. I’m not sure what his deal was, but he was starting scuffles.

The antifa’s were there, scarves and all. Very scary! (Not really). Like pubescent kids trying to look serious. If I didn’t love my own cooking (and I’ve been on a real pasta kick lately) I could have fit right in.

There was all kinds of literature! Everyone wanted to hand me papers. It was really nice, but perhaps harmful to the environment. Lots of trees were killed for these. I didn’t read them, but I think their design work could use some help—think they’re hiring?

There were also pins. I didn’t get a pin, though, because they were less generous than the flyers people.

I only saw one costume, but I thought he worked pretty hard on it. Unfortunately, his sign wasn’t as creative as his Statue of Liberty skull mask.

The message seemed to be that all American interference is terrorism and Donnie is a very bad man for not letting those refugees in. One speaker did mention Libya as a thing that happened and was bad. Although she didn’t mention President Obama by name, I assume she must have meant to implicate him. I don’t entirely disagree with their stance, but some of the connect-the-dots theories people were floating—such as that Israel did 9/11 to kill Islam—were a bit too hottake for me.

The media had formed a perimeter and made the protest seem like a BIG DEAL. It really wasn’t, though, since the attendees counted maybe a hundred. If they weren’t college-aged kids (some looked like high schoolers) they looked homeless. It was part little social event for the kids to chant and feel like they matter and are super duper informed and part old folks with their flyers, zines, and pins thinking the ‘60s never ended.

They did seem to think that gassing children is bad, although it seems they just wanted the United States to just relocate them all, and let Assad keep the place.

Here’s What Ronald Reagan Did When Kids Went Ape At UC-Berkeley,"The University of California at Berkeley, the cradle of the free speech movement, just last week cancelled yet another conservative speaker. The college’s Young Republicans had invited Ann Coulter to speak on April 27. Campus officials cited “security concerns” as their reason for cancelling Coulter’s speech, but Coulter says it was all they had left after “imposing ridiculous demands” that hadn’t scared her away.

They demanded she speak off-campus; she acceded. They demanded she speak during the day when students are in class; she acceded. How mad are Berkeley officials that even though they cancelled her, she plans to speak on April 27 at Berkeley anyway? It’s almost like she has courage and a backbone.

Clearly, UC-Berkeley officials have neither, and this is not news. When the Young Republicans invited former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulis to speak in February, campus officials cancelled his speech a few hours before it was to start, also due to “security concerns.” They then hid behind their oak-paneled desks while violent protesters tore down metal barriers, broke windows, set fires, hurled rocks at police, attacked bystanders, and damaged a construction site.

Police were reportedly told to stand down and take no action against the violence. An attorney for the union representing UC-Berkeley police said, “When these rioters saw that there was no action taken against them, it emboldened them into acting more aggressively.” Indeed. When protesters were done demolishing the campus—to the tune of $100,000—they moved on to smash windows of local businesses.

What a Real Leader Does When Facing Petty Thugs

Where is Ronald Reagan when we need him? He would have put a stop to it all right quick. Reagan had made campus unrest at Berkeley one of his major campaign issues when he announced his candidacy for California governor in 1964:

[D]o we no longer think it necessary to teach self-respect, self-discipline, and respect for law and order? Will we allow a great university to be brought to its knees by a noisy dissident minority? Will we meet their neurotic vulgarities with vacillation and weakness? Or will we tell those entrusted with administering the university we expect them to enforce a code based on decency, common sense, and dedication to the high and noble purpose of that university?

Not unlike another wildly popular, yet wildly unpopular politician, Reagan was elected partly to restore law and order. A group of protestors put the governor to the test in 1969.

They had been using a vacant plot of land for protests against the Vietnam War and decided to block the university from developing it. The day in May 1969 when the university attempted to erect a fence around the plot of land is called “Bloody Thursday.” A rally called to protest the action drew thousands and soon turned into a riot. Reagan ordered the Berkeley police and California Highway Patrol to shut it down.

A campus publication tells what happened next: “[T]hree students suffered punctured lungs, another a shattered leg, 13 people were hospitalized with shotgun wounds, and one police officer was stabbed. James Rector, who was watching the riot from a rooftop, was shot by police gunfire; he died four days later.”

Then Reagan Doubled Down

In an extremely controversial move, for which he never apologized, Reagan declared a state of emergency and sent in 2,200 National Guard troops. He enacted a curfew and banned public assembly for two weeks. The National Guard patrolled the streets of Berkeley, dispersing any crowd of four or more. It wasn’t pretty, but they restored order.

There is a classic, should-be-in-the-Smithsonian clip of Reagan at a press conference after the fact with university administrators. He says: “Those people told you for days in advance that if the university sought to go ahead with that construction, they were going to physically destroy the university.”

Someone in the crowd shouts that Reagan should have negotiated with the students. Reagan, with the incredulity of someone who understands that youth don’t run the world for a reason, says: “Negotiate? What is to negotiate? All of it began the first time some of you who know better and are old enough to know better let young people think that they have the right to choose the laws they would obey as long as they were doing it in the name of social protest.”

To underscore the point, Reagan got up and walked out of the room. They don’t make ‘em like that anymore.

The university eventually caved to the People’s Park protesters, long after Reagan was out of office. They caved to the Yiannopoulis protesters in February. Now they’ve caved to the Coulter protesters. Cave, cave, cave, cave, cave. Every time they cave, they put another nail in the coffin of self-discipline, decency, common sense, and respect for law and order.

Watch These Protestors Storm The Heritage Foundation,"A group of protestors stormed the Heritage Foundation, a conservative nonprofit, in Washington DC on Tuesday to complain about Donald Trump’s federal budget proposals.

The protest started at the White House, then organizers shuttled demonstrators to the Heritage Foundation, which is near Capitol Hill. A group of approximately 200 protestors stood inside the lobby of the private organization’s headquarters for about 25 minutes. Some carried signs.

A Twitter account belonging to a group called People’s Action tweeted out photos of how the protestors spent their day. People’s Action planned a convention featuring Bernie Sanders and Van Jones as speakers on Monday, followed by an organized protest on Tuesday beginning at the White House, according to their website.

Many of the protestors in the videos are wearing “Rise Up” shirts, which is also the name of the People’s Action convention. The convention agenda includes a planned protest beginning at 8:45 a.m. on Tuesday in front of the White House.

“Water! Not Walls!” the protestors chanted.

“Shut it down! Shut it down!” they chanted in unison.

In an interview with The Daily Signal, Phillip Stuckey, a reporter for The Daily Caller News Foundation, talked about the time he spent with the protestors — traveling with them on the bus to the Heritage Foundation.

“We’re going to be bussing you to an undisclosed location,” organizers said.

The captain of the bus told protestors that President Trump wasn’t smart enough to come up with his own budget, so people at Heritage wrote one for him. If protestors had any issues with Trump’s budget proposals, they should take it up with Heritage, an organizer said, according to Stuckey.

This explanation is a reference to the Heritage Foundation’s budget blueprint, which they release every year.

Stuckey asked a bus driver whether he was being paid to drive protestors from the White House to the Heritage Foundation. The driver responded that he doesn’t “do nothing for free.” When Stuckey asked who was paying him, several event leaders, who called themselves “marshals,” told him to stop asking questions and tried to bar him from streaming the protest on Facebook Live.

All protestors were barred from tweeting, texting, or Facebook Live-ing their location until after the day of protest was over.

“‘If you’re approached by a member of the media, don’t say anything,'” organizers told protestors, according to Stuckey. After their demonstration at the Heritage Foundation, the protestors met with Rep. Keith Ellison, a deputy chair for the Democratic National Committee, for a town hall.

Middlebury Takes ‘Disciplinary Action’ On Students Over Murray Fiasco,"Middlebury College in Vermont announced that it has disciplined more than 30 students for their actions during a campus riot on March 2 against libertarian social scientist Charles Murray. The school said it had identified “more than 70 individuals” who may have violated student handbook policies.

“We are almost halfway through with the investigation and disciplinary process and we hope to bring it to a close by the end of the academic year in mid-May,” the announcement says. The school said it would not comment on what disciplinary action it has taken until the disciplinary process is complete, so the public won’t know for months whether students have been given slaps on the wrist or stronger sanctions.

The school also said it found “no unambiguous evidence that any member of the Middlebury College faculty violated faculty policies in regard to their actions on March 2.”

On that day, Murray was scheduled to speak. Protesters arrived ahead of time, angry that he wrote a book in 1994 (before most of the protesters were born) that deals with human intelligence, including noting statistical differences in average intelligence among various races. Murray has attempted on multiple occasions to explain this part of the book, and has publicly welcomed questions on this topic to dispute claims that he is racist.

Guilty With No Chance to Demonstrate Innocence

At Middlebury, however, many students weren’t interested in arguing with Murray; they simply wanted to shut him down. A Democrat professor, Allison Stanger, agreed to moderate a debate with Murray, and prepared to ask him tough questions. But students stood up in the audience and chanted “Racist, sexist, anti-gay: Charles Murray, go away!” and other things that made it impossible for Murray to speak.

Stanger asked students to quiet down, but they wouldn’t. She and Murray had to move to another room to broadcast their discussion by video. Some protesters discovered the new location and started banging on the windows and setting off fire alarms. The two were surrounded by a mob when they tried to leave. In the course of protecting Murray from angry students, Stanger was injured to the point where she needed a neck brace.

In the course of protecting Murray from angry students, Stanger was injured to the point where she needed a neck brace.

Protesting a speaker is within students’ First Amendment rights, but when they actively prevent a speaker from giving a speech, or place that speaker and other students and faculty in physical danger, that’s a problem. At that point, the way they are exercising their rights to free speech and assembly is directly preventing others from exercising those same rights.

The University of California-Berkeley and Auburn University have had similar problems recently, with students becoming violent in response to speakers with whom they disagree. At Auburn, that speaker was self-identified white nationalist Richard Spencer. His speech is abhorrent, but students and protesters who resorted to violence ended up making him a martyr for his cause, which is counterproductive for those wanting to counter his ideas.

So far, it appears Middlebury is the only school of late willing to communicate that violence is not an appropriate response to speech. Berkeley police, for example, were commanded to stand down during campus riots this spring that included vandalism. These illiberal liberal students need to learn that one counters ideas with better ideas—and physical violence and temper tantrums are not better ideas.

Middlebury may have only slightly punished the students. They could have been “disciplined” with being required to write an essay or hear a stern lecture from an administrator. Until more details surface, we won’t know whether Middlebury is truly taking a stand against violent and disruptive protesters or just trying to save face.

"NYT Parrots Democratic Spin On Death Threats, Scuffle In Texas Legis","The New York Times ran a story on Monday with the explosive headline, “Texas Lawmaker Threatens to Shoot Colleague After Reporting Protesters to ICE.”

Reporter Matthew Haag’s story began, “A Texas state representative, referring to protesters at the State Capitol on Monday, said he reported ‘several illegal immigrants’ to federal immigration authorities and then threatened to shoot a fellow lawmaker who objected.” A tweet had the same spin.

These are an inaccurate and incomplete reporting of what the lawmakers involved say happened. The story also lacks sufficient context to the point it borders on propaganda.

A reporter sent the article to me with the note, “If you actually click the Facebook post of the Republican lawmaker who supposedly threatened to shoot the Democrat, it was after the Democrat threatened him. But the NYT makes it sound like the Republican was the sole instigator and was randomly threatening to shoot a fellow lawmaker.” Indeed, The New York Times did make it sound like that.

The Republican lawmaker, Matt Rinaldi, had this to say about what transpired:

Without being present at the scene, it’s impossible to know precisely what happened or who said what. However, there is actual video of Democratic lawmaker Poncho Nevárez putting his hands on Rinaldi and seemingly initiating the scuffle.

Video of the scuffle on the TxHouse floor. Pretty clear who was physically instigating here; NOT @MattRinaldiTX.pic.twitter.com/Dmr5bTtNp5 — Michael Openshaw (@mopenshaw) May 29, 2017

Further, in multiple interviews Nevárez admitted he had assaulted the Republican lawmaker. So why would deference be given to the Democratic lawmaker’s version of events?

This paragraph from the Times, for example, is Pravda-like in its one-sided description of what happened:

The exchange led to a confrontation among lawmakers, with some pushing and pointing at one another. Some legislators had to be restrained. Mr. Rinaldi got into a face-to-face argument with Representative Poncho Nevárez, a Democrat, and threatened to shoot him.

In general, comments about self-defense are received differently than purely aggressive comments. If someone threatens a person with imminent harm, comments in response are different than if they come out of nowhere and a purely aggressive posture.

Did CNN Help Stage A Fake Protest In London On Sunday?,"In the wake of the terrorist attack in London that killed seven people and injured at least 48 others, some are accusing CNN of staging a protest against Islamist violence.

On Sunday, the day following the attack, Daily Mail‘s Katie Hopkins tweeted video footage of CNN’s Becky Anderson standing in front of a street corner waiting for protestors to fill in before filming and narrating the shot.

https://twitter.com/KTHopkins/status/871487298721992705

The protestors, many of whom are women wearing headscarves, are holding signs condemning the terrorist attack and violence. Several people seem to be standing behind the cameras waving at the protestors to tell them where to stand to get on camera, but it’s not clear if they are reporters, demonstrators, or bystanders.

Hopkins also tweeted that BBC News aired footage of the protest, covering it as “real news.”

Obviously, news outlets like CNN and BBC are supposed to document the news and protests as they happen — not arrange them to look more compelling. If it is true that reporters were helping the protestors or arranging them, that would breach journalism ethics.

CNN’s Brian Stelter tweeted in response that police allowed protestors to head towards the cameras, which were already set up. He said the network did not encourage or arrange the protestors in front of its cameras or to fill in the space — although Anderson and her crew clearly waited to film until the demonstraters had arranged themselves behind her in a more appealing shot.

Police allowed demonstrators thru cordon ""so they could show their signs"" to media, @CNNPR says. CNN, BBC, AP ""simply filmed them doing so."" — Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) June 5, 2017

Because no footage has surfaced of the moments leading up the video in question, it’s so far unclear if either narrative is true.

Photos From The Portland Clash Between Pro- And Anti-Trump Protesters,"Police arrested at least 14 people Sunday at a free-speech rally in Portland, Oregon organized by President Trump supporters that attracted an anti-Trump “antifa” protest, resulting in violence. Antifa is a loose coalition of self-described “antifascists” known for using violence and vandalism against their political opponents, including at the U.S. capital during President Trump’s inauguration in January.

Photographer Chelly Bouferrache attended the Portland rally and took the following photographs, including the eyewitness descriptions below. Warning: obscene language depicted and quoted.

We were walking up to the Trump Free Speech Rally and had to walk through protesters (many who were Antifa and anarchists) in order to get there. The person with the red kerchief was screaming at the police, “Fuck you, pig. I hope you motherfuckers die!”

Antifa protestors wore black, covered their faces, wore some kind of glasses and helmets.

Protestors across the street from the Trump rally in Chapman Square. The rally was surrounded by protests on three sides. The fourth side is a building that wouldn’t have room for a protest. So to get in or out of the rally the majority of people had to walk a gauntlet of protestors. They weren’t nice. ​

Police in riot gear walking into Chapman Square, just before they closed Chapman Park.

Three journalists. Two were outfitted in a lot of gear. Helmets and such. The woman in hijab was also a journalist I believe. She was approached by one of the III% United Patriots (a militia group). He talked to her and made sure she was okay, told her he wanted to make sure she felt comfortable and that if she needed anything or had a problem to find any of the people providing security and they would help her. I overheard this myself and talked to the man immediately after.

Police had started to clear protestors from Chapman Park using tear gas and flashbangs. ​​

Police in riot gear giving me the peace sign as they drove by. At this point we were trailing the protestors, who had decided to march the streets of Portland once they were kicked out of the parks. The police were coming in from several directions all at once.

Protestor and police square off. The march had been stopped at this point and the protestors were boxed in to one single block on a city street.

Policeman stopped people from leaving that area (in preparation to arrest some for disorderly conduct). Guy who wasn’t allowed to leave filming the officer.

Looking down on the protestors who were being detained by police. They had been boxed in to that single block.

Inside the Trump rally. Head gear and eye gear and protective vests were not quite the norm, but close. I asked a few wearing it why and the response was protestors like to throw projectiles. Bricks, rocks, soda cans, human feces, etc.

Some of the men from the group called the “Proud Boys.” I was informed they were anti-feminist, revere the traditional housewife, and think women belong in the home. Later I got a longer and much more nuanced explanation from the guy in the gray Proud Boys T-shirt. The one with the red beard I had talked to first and he seemed to be defensive. I believe he thought I was either a journalist or anti-Trump. I was just curious about the group and wanted to know what they stood for. That was kind of jarring.

The lady in the middle with the white shirt told me she was a great-grandmother. She also said that President Trump was going to make America great again.

The guy in the grey sweatshirt is Internet famous. I was introduced to him as “Based Stickman.” He was holding court — taking pictures with people and signing things and talking with people.

Trump rally during the speeches. Sure looked to be more than the 200 people Willamette Week reported.

Protesters of the Antifa variety running down the street with a Mercury newspaper bin. I don’t know what the Mercury ever did to them, but it must have been bad.

I told the guy I liked his mask and asked if I could take his picture. Also asked what he was planning doing with the bottle of red stuff. He said it was paint and he was going to spray Trump people with it. I don’t know if he did or not because I left right after. This is self-explanatory. Antifa on the march, after being kicked out of the park, before they got boxed in. This guy was with the fellow who was telling the police he wanted them to die (in the much earlier picture). I went up to him while his friend was screaming, introduced myself, and asked him why the uniform and the helmets. His explanation was they wanted to hide their identities because Trump supporters had gone after them in the past. The helmets were to protect themselves from violent Trump people and the police. I asked if they really wanted the police to die, pointing to his friend, who was still screaming obscenities at the police. He said “Oh no. We are just mad with how the police are treating our friends. We don’t really want them to die.” I asked if I could take his picture and he said yes. Asked his name and he gave me a pseudonym. What struck me was how soft-spoken and polite he was to me. Antifa burning the flag. I was amazed no one caught on fire. Some Parting Eyewitness Thoughts At one point I stood with a different photojournalist taking pictures of Antifa from the Trump side. I asked him some questions about the protestors. He explained that at some point Antifa would more than likely start throwing stuff and the police would then kick them out of the park. They had already thrown bloody tampons (I saw these) and feces (I smelled it and heard about it). While we were standing there the person with him noticed a woman holding what looked like a Molotov cocktail. Looking through the lenses it sure looked like it. They told the police and a few minutes later dozens more police arrived and announced the closure of the park. I have no idea if those two things were connected but one happened right after the other. Flashbangs and tear gas happened soon after. I was taking pictures of Antifa in the street and one of them, a woman, told me to stop taking pictures. I said “No,” and continued to take pictures. She took her backpack off and unzipped it, at which time my friend told me to watch it, that I was probably going to get maced. She pulled out an Antifascist flag and held it up to block my view. She continued to follow me around until I left the area. We followed another photographer friend as Antifa marched through the city until they were boxed in. Police then used tear gas (not exactly sure why). Some of them were trying to escape up into the parking structure and they threw tear gas into the stairwell. As I was bent over retching, wheezing, snotting, and sneezing, one of the protestors walked over to me and asked if I was okay. I explained I have asthma. She whipped out an inhaler and stuck it in my hand (I had left mine in the car) and insisted I keep it. She waited until I caught my breath and quit coughing, then pulled out a little plastic packet of Kleenex and insisted I take that. I asked if I could take her picture and she said yes. I asked why she was there. She said she was LBGTQ and really afraid of what was going to happen under Trump. Her name was Nika. I would have been done for the day and had a hard time getting back to my car if it wasn’t for her. Just a nice moment at an ugly time. This is her looking for the pack of Kleenex. The police I saw were absolute professionals. Amazing how they handled everything. Their job must seem, at times, so thankless.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/06/06/photos-from-the-portland-clash-between-pro-and-anti-trump-protesters/,2017-06-06
The Only Kind Of Protest That Works,"Yesterday I wrote on the definition of globalism and the danger of the increasing power of centralized, gigantic businesses in the modern technology-driven economy. Some readers expressed skepticism about my thesis, not as to the prevalence of gigantism so much as to the power of these businesses to impact the way we live. This didn’t seem to me a point in need of proof in an era in which ten percent of the world’s public companies generate eighty percent of all profits, in which we’ve seen the number of publicly listed companies halve since 1997, and the number of startups is lower than we’ve seen in nearly forty years. But an easy way to understand the level these increasingly centralized institutions can alter the course of the country is to examine the kinds of protests that currently work in 21st Century America, and the kind that fail.

There has been a long history of protest on the American left, animated not just by their ability to organize via unions and other social organizations, but by a tendency toward protest not shared by the voters of the right. That’s one of the factors that made the Tea Party such a historical oddity. But it’s fairly clear that when it comes to modern acts of protest, these movements are largely weak representations of demonstrative signaling rather than organizational efforts or movements likely to have any impact. Other than giving reporters something to cover, the marches for women, for science, and for every other effort in the past six months have achieved little. The protests outside Trump tower achieved nothing at all except additional costs to the taxpayers. Public demonstration is just not where it’s at any more.

What’s so hot right now, on the other hand, is boycotts and corporate-focused protest. It has been a factor from the right and the left in a very public way. The advertiser rollback from Fox News has had a major impact, one that’s visible if you turn on the channel. The success of the campaign pushed out Bill O’Reilly and damaged Sean Hannity. We saw similar backlash this past week to Megyn Kelly’s NBC interview with Alex Jones, which prompted McDonald’s, Bank of America, Kia, and JP Morgan Chase to pull their ads on her program. We saw similar pressure brought to bear on the corporate sponsors of the Public Theater – though there are limits to this (it seems notable that while Delta and Bank of America pulled their support, Time Warner never did publicly).

This isn’t just organic work. The group Sleeping Giants has been targeting advertisers on right wing websites generally, particularly focused on the most loyal defenders of Trump at Breitbart, who have seen their ads plummet after an organized campaign to target corporations. They’ve partnered with other lefty groups and sympathetic online brands to promote and fund their corporate-targeted effort, designed to defund those on the right who share the president’s views, and even those who don’t. Since they view the media of the right generally as racist and bigoted, don’t expect them to stop there.

This has an impact, and not just on media, and certainly not just on the right: according to a new Ipsos survey, 25% of Americans say they have stopped buying a product because of perceived political leanings of the brand in question. A portion of those have to be referring to Target, considering that the boycott over its stance on Trans bathroom policy had an outsized and unexpected impact on their sales, which have dropped every quarter since the policy was announced (in a blog post their CEO never saw or approved).

Now, boycotts are not new. They have been around since the days of no taxation without representation, and they can be quite effective. But these boycotts gain an outsized impact when the concentration of access to the digital infrastructure of ad networks is so centralized. Consider that Google and Facebook alone are expected to capture 85% of new advertising and 60% of digital spending in 2017. There is no presumption of access to these networks, and media organizations deemed as dealing in racist or bigoted speech – perhaps even anti-science speech – could very easily end up seeing their revenues squeezed or cut off entirely. Yesterday, Tim Cook, Eric Schmidt, Jeff Bezos all emerged from the White House technology council meeting with praise for the president. That’s where they’re at for now – but the forces that want their companies to become virtue signalers are not content with that. Sleeping Giants has referred to Amazon in particular as their “white whale”, and they’re now targeting Amazon’s advertising on Breitbart with new mobile billboard rolling around on a truck in Seattle, demanding the company “stop funding bigotry”. This will not stop anytime soon.

In an environment in which everything’s political, the ability of corporate brands to skirt these types of pressures becomes nearly impossible. And the impact that such boycotts could have on media is enormous. The only way to blow past them is to have a product that generates such loyalty and consumer buy-in as to be immune to the steady attacks from those in political disagreement. You may just have to have a product so good, people will buy it even if they feel a little ashamed about it and don’t tell their friends. You may just have to have a sandwich as good as Chick-fil-A’s.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/06/20/the-only-kind-of-protest-that-works/,2017-06-20
"Hey, Planned Parenthood, Learn To Make Better Handmaiden Costumes","On Tuesday, Planned Parenthood protestors gathered outside the nation’s capitol dressed as handmaidens from the Hulu series “The Handmaid’s Tale,” based on a dystopian novel of the same name by Margaret Atwood.

If passed as-is, the bill would defund the nation’s largest abortion provider for one year, about which Planned Parenthood is not happy . Last year, the federal government gave the abortion giant $528 million, making taxpayers their largest source of funding. So they’ve sent protestors dressed as handmaidens — who in the show are forced to bear children for oppressive leaders who govern the fictional Republic of Gilead — to send a message.

Nearly all U.S. babies aborted are conceived during consensual sex, making the comparison to fertility slavery ludicrous, especially given that the bill doesn’t restrict abortion one iota, but merely provide that taxpayers won’t pay for it. That’s a proposition majorities of voters across political lines support.

Not only is the reasoning behind the costumes totally absurd, they don’t even look convincing.

https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/879762656432992256

Watch this video of the protestors walking in a single-file line. Notice how the breeze is blowing around the corners of their red Snuggies, exposing bare legs and tennis shoes.

And can we please talk about those head coverings? It looks like they’re wearing white pieces of paper folded in half. You can do better than that, ladies!

Protestors did the same thing in Ohio a few weeks ago, and it looked like they stole toilet seat covers and taped them to their heads.

Here’s what the costumes are SUPPOSED to look like.

Whoever was in charge of making and coordinating these costumes should be fired.

Women’s March Treks 18 Miles To Protest National Rifle Association,"Several hundred demonstrators spent June 14 walking through heat and humidity to protest the National Rifle Association, gun violence, and racism. The Women’s March organized the 18-mile trek from the NRA headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia to the Department of Justice in downtown DC. Protestors spent the night in the city before returning to the Department of Justice the next morning to continue the rally.

The #NRA2DOJ march was sparked last month when Women’s March Inc. Co-President Tamika Mallory wrote an open letter in response to a viral NRA ad. The ad features NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch and denounces violence from the Left. Mallory called the video a “direct attack on people of color” and demanded the NRA take down the video, apologize, and issue a statement defending Philando Castile, a lawful gun owner shot by a Minnesota police man.

“It is clear that your organization does not value the legal rights nor the human rights of any of us,” the letter read. “Unless the NRA takes immediate action, the Women’s March will exercise our First Amendment right by calling for a mass mobilization.”

The NRA instead released a second video directly addressing Mallory. The march began at the NRA headquarters, where a counter-protest joined them. Along the route, protestors shouted chants like “Hands up, don’t shoot,” “This is what democracy looks like,” and “Hey hey, ho ho, the NRA has got to go.” Many in the crowd also showed support for Black Lives Matter.

“I would like them to eliminate assault weapons,” said one woman with the march. “I don’t think they need to go away completely, but they certainly need to be better regulated.”

An armed police escort traveled with the group. The protest marched past the White House, where they paused to shout “Shame! Shame!” One woman displayed her middle finger as she walked past. The group disbanded upon arrival at the Department of Justice, and some boarded a bus to the shared housing for the night.

When the protest returned Saturday morning, they met a small counter-protest carrying signs and a Gadsden flag.

“There’s been an attack on the freedom of speech,” said Dan Weber, who was part of the counter-protest. “There’s been an attack on our Second Amendment rights. And nationally, an attack on our Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights.”

Saturday’s rally at the Department of Justice opened with a song with the lyrics, “Went down to the White House to take back what they stole from me/and I took back my dignity/and I took back my humanity/and it’s under my feet.” Protestors also heard from a variety of activists, including leftist American Muslim Linda Sarsour and Mallory herself.

“You should be outraged that the NRA refuses to directly address the injustice in Philando Castile’s death,” shouted Women’s March Inc. Co-President Bob Bland, directing her speech toward the counter-protest across the street. “He was a licensed gun owner just like you.”",https://thefederalist.com/2017/07/18/womens-march-treks-18-miles-protest-national-rifle-association/,2017-07-18
Why The Left Wants To Keep A White Woman From Painting A Black Man,"Back in March, protests erupted over a painting displayed at the New York City Whitney Museum’s biennial. Some activists stood in front of the picture, trying to block others from viewing it. Others called for it to be taken down, and some even called for the work to be destroyed. But it wasn’t Jesse Helms, Rudy Giuliani, or any other conservative upset about offensive art. It was progressives who were offended. The offense? Cultural appropriation.

The painting in question was “Open Casket,” a portrait of Emmett Till. Till, an African-American boy, was brutally murdered in 1955 for allegedly flirting with a white woman. His somber legacy still haunts an America struggling to come to terms with racial division. The controversy over the painting was not about its content, however, but its creator. Artist Dana Schutz is a white woman, and for some that makes her a person who should not paint a picture of Till.

This week in Boston, tempers over Schutz’s work flared again as a solo show of hers went up at the Institute for Contemporary Art (ICA). The painting of Till, her most famous work, was not included in the exhibition, but that didn’t stop progressive activists from protesting the platform given to a woman who had given such grave offense.

As the Daily Beast reported, a group of artists and activists sent a letter to ICA which said, “Please pull the show. This is not about censorship. This is about institutional accountability, as the institutions working with the artist are even now not acknowledging that this nation is not an even playing field… [“Open Casket’s”] absence from the exhibition does not excuse the institution from engaging with the harm caused by the work by holding Dana Schutz accountable.”

Dana Schutz’s Offense Is Being White

While it is easy and correct to call this censorious letter a hodgepodge of dangerous and silly hokum, we must understand why such calls to ban art are increasingly emerging. In this case, the casus belli is the fact that a white woman painted an image of Till. According to Schutz’s detractors, since a white woman’s lies about Till’s actions half a century ago led to his death, no white woman should treat the incident in this way.

It is a struggle to understand how people arrive at these determinations about who is allowed to create art about a given subject. In this case Schutz clearly meant her painting to call attention to the dangers of racism, yet for this is called racist. Importantly, it is not the art that is deemed offensive, but the artist. This is why protesting one painting is not enough; Schutz must be denied any platform.

These protests are attacking the very concepts of empathy and understanding. Till’s murder shook and still shakes the nation precisely because people of all ethnicities shudder at its horror. It is right and just that any artists meditate on Till and share their works he has inspired. If the piece makes one uncomfortable, maybe it should. If it makes people want to ban it, they should think again.

A strong hint that somebody is about to advocate for censorship is when he or she begins a statement by saying, “This is not about censorship.” They will often say that only government can censor art, and when individuals get together to stop art from being displayed it is simply an example of the marketplace of ideas. But this attitude suggests that nothing is real unless the government does it. While it is true that individuals calling for an art ban does not violate the First Amendment, it doesn’t mean they aren’t intolerant and censorious.

Calling on institutions to punish artists by refusing to show their work is in itself an act of censorship. If one has a justification for such censorship, by all means he should say so, but he shouldn’t hide from the true nature of his actions. If you want to censor art, own it and tell us why your beliefs should determine what art other people get to see.

White Women Are The Worst

Perhaps the most amazing thing about these protests is how utterly sexist they are. Central to the claim that Schutz is a racist who needs to be held accountable is the fact that it was a white woman who lied about Till. What shocking misogyny it is to force Schutz, like a modern Eve, to bear the sins of all women on her back. Quite frankly, had a white man painted the very same picture, we would very likely not be having this conversation, at the very least not in the same way.

Schutz is a white woman, a precarious thing these days. White women, we are told, are responsible for electing Donald Trump, notwithstanding the almost 30 percent of the Hispanic vote that he received. White women, it seems, should have known better, because they are women, or something. White women are bad feminists who need to do less talking and more listening to marginalized voices. White women just don’t know their place.

But all of us only live once. We have one stretch of precious time where our minds explore reality. Nobody should pay the slightest bit of heed to calls for limiting our expression based on our race or sex. The idea that Schutz shouldn’t paint an image that is meaningful, respectful, and striking merely because of her skin color is abhorrent.

There are two main concerns to an artist: beauty and truth. As Keats put it: “‘Beauty is Truth, truth beauty,’- that is all / Ye know on earth, and all you need to know.”

Truth and beauty are often hard to marry. When the truth being explored is the brutal murder of a child, beauty seems quite remote. Yet this is the meaningful struggle of existing in a world that can crush us with its horrors and inhumanities. Artists can’t be like my grandmother, who whispered when she said the word “cancer,” for fear saying it too loudly might make her get it.

Discovering truth and beauty requires delving deeply into our minds and souls, searches that make artists different from those who do not practice art. That exploration cannot be encumbered by the assertion that some phenomena are off limits because of what you look like.

A cynic might say that this controversy is good for Schutz for spreading her fame. Perhaps. But I suspect that is little consolation for her. She has been accused of doing harm to people by painting a picture of Till. Nobody wants her legacy to be, “Was she a racist or not?”

These protests need to stop. Schutz did nothing wrong. Every artist, and indeed all of us, needs to stand firm and tell those who would engage in censorship that we will not have it.

"Watch These Liberals Protest Outside Of A Congressman’s Home Where His Wife, Daughters Live","Members of a leftist group backed by deep-pocketed unions loudly protested outside of Republican Congressman Jason Lewis’s home in Woodbury, Minnesota on Wednesday, spurring frightened neighbors to call the police.

The group, Take Action Minnesota, which is funded by SEUI and other unions and progressive groups, chanted and protested outside of Lewis’s home, where his wife and two daughters live, over proposed cuts to Medicaid and other entitlement programs that are driving the United States deeper into debt.

After attempting to deliver a letter to Lewis in person at his home, Take Action protestors then stood on his porch and his driveway as two elderly women explained how they rely on Medicaid for about five minutes. They then began to chant and yell rallying cries as they waved signs.

“When care givers are under attack, what do we do?” The young woman prompted. “Stand up! Fight back!” the other protestors responded.

As they walked away, protestors yelled: “We’ll be back!”

The group streamed their protest via Facebook Live.

In a statement posted on his Facebook page, Lewis said the demonstration prompted his neighbor to call the police.

Appalled to find out my home and private property were invaded today by protestors while I was working in my congressional district. Suffice it to say it is more than a bit disturbing to get a call from your neighbor saying his daughters were afraid and called him to contact the police.

In a statement, Take Action said they showed up at his home because Lewis hasn’t done a town hall event to talk about the proposed cuts.

“For months, constituents have asked for a town hall,” Take Action said in a statement. “His constituents would rather have a conversation at a town hall, than deliver a letter to his door.”

Town hall events featuring Republican congressman have become increasingly dangerous. In May, police escorted two attendees at a North Dakota town hall event after they got physical with a Republican congressman.

Earlier this year, the Utah Republican Party issued a statement urging GOP Congressmen to delay town hall meetings after numerous violent actions took place at previous events.

“This isn’t just immature anymore; this is a dangerous ramping up of rhetoric that already has one of my House colleagues in rehab from a vicious attack,” Lewis said, referring to Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), who nearly died from a gunshot wound inflicted by a crazed Bernie Sanders supporter. “Beyond increasing security measures, we are investigating what action to take. But this dangerous targeting of people, staffs, associates and now families must stop. And stop now.”

"After Charlottesville, Protestors Gather Outside White House","Protestors gathered outside of the White House Sunday evening to denounce the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia, the day before and demand that a statue memorializing a Confederate general be torn down.

The event, which was billed as a candlelight vigil to honor the victims, was a rally featuring remarks against white supremacists, fascists, Donald Trump, and several other Republicans, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Rep. Steve Scalise — who is still recovering from a gunshot wound he sustained from a crazed Bernie Sanders supporter in June. The protestors then marched to Judiciary Square to demand a statue of Albert Pike, a Confederate general, be removed.

https://twitter.com/Bre_payton/status/896875978101727232

Over the weekend, white supremacists from across the country gathered in Charlottesville to protest the city’s decision to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park, formerly known as Lee Park. Among counter-protestors who marched in opposition to white supremacists was 32-year old Heather Heyer, who was killed when a car plowed into a crowd of counter-protestors. Nineteen others were injured and two Virginia state troopers, Pilot Lt. H. Jay Cullen and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates, died in a helicopter crash en route to the violent scene. President Trump released a statement denouncing the violence “on both sides,” which spurred anger for targeting both anti-fascist counter-demonstrators and neo-Nazis.

In Washington DC, protestors gathered in solidarity with the victims, opposition to Trump, and to demand a statue memorializing a figure of the Confederacy be removed.

Eugene Puryear of Stop Police Terror Project DC spoke into a bullhorn denouncing the Department of Justice’s decision to open a civil rights investigation into the car-ramming incident, saying it should be investigated as terrorism. He also called out Sessions and Scalise, alleging they have ties to white supremacists.

Puryear initially stumbled over Heather Heyer’s name, calling her “Hayley” then asking the crowd what her name was. He said they shouldn’t let her death be in vain, citing her Facebook post against white supremacists shortly before she was struck and killed by a car, which eyewitnesses say plowed into the crowd intentionally.

Protestors then marched to the Albert Pike Memorial across from Judiciary Square. Along the way they shouted for Trump to “go” and took a moment to boo at the Trump Hotel.

After the crowd gathered in front of the Albert Pike memorial, protestors chanted “Tear it down! Tear it down!”

A moment of silence for the Charlottesville victims in front of the statue was held, where some lit candles.

After the moment was up, Puryear rallied the crowd against the statue.

"After Charlottesville, We Must Pursue MLK's 'Beloved Community'","Under the pretense of protesting the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue, white nationalists gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia on Friday night. Richard Spencer, a white nationalist thought leader, organized the “Unite the Right” rally.

By Saturday afternoon, three people were dead and many others were injured. Spencer insists that the protest was peaceful and that counter protesters and inactive police were responsible for the violence.

Spencer’s coy “Who me?” act should convince nobody. The man led a group of white nationalists with lit torches through a southern city at night. He glowed with pride on Saturday after being maced by police. Spencer and his flunkies got exactly what they hoped for: a media circus and the chance to play the helpless victim.

Americans of all parties can agree that this is an assault not just on American values but also on human dignity. But in our zealousness to fight evil, we are at a high risk of succumbing to another evil ourselves.

‘There’s No Place For You Here’

A phrase that’s been repeated throughout the last few days is that there’s “no place for” racism, hate, bigotry, et cetera in our country. In a statement Saturday, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said to the alt-right protesters, “There is no place for you here, there is no place for you in America.” What he really means is that America should have a zero-tolerance policy towards racism. But his words point to a larger phenomenon: the social alienation of many of America’s young men.

Our world is experiencing an epidemic of unanchored masculinity. Rudderless young men—from jihadis to school shooters to white supremacists—are increasingly finding antisocial ways to lash out at a world where they feel irrelevant. Tom Nichols aptly refers to them as “the lost boys” in this excellent piece.

Widespread fatherlessness, a struggling economy, polarizing media, irresponsible political rhetoric, and an overall lack of purpose should all be recognized as partial culprits for this disease. While many accusations against Donald Trump are hyperbole, he has tacitly given white supremacists a wink and a nod by playing dumb and failing to instinctively disavow them at every turn.

It can be tempting to dismiss these men as “losers” or uneducated, but that’s not necessarily true. David Duke—former Grand Wizard of the Klu Klux Klan—is college educated. Richard Spencer has a master’s degree. We have to acknowledge the complex factors that have created this problem, but we also can’t dismiss these men as foolish hicks. They know what they’re doing.

But exclusively sociological or economic terms will fail to describe the events of Charlottesville. We must acknowledge the ideology of Richard Spencer, David Duke, and their followers for what it is: evil.

The Gated Community of the Alt-Right

At its core, the group assembled in Charlottesville on Saturday bears the ethos of a “Gated Community.” They huddle in the echo chambers of the like-minded and reject all those who disagree. All their logic boils down to “us vs. them”—and there can be no peaceful coexistence in between. Their sin is ultimately one of pride: others are inferior because they are not “like me.”

The Gated Community allows no dissent and, therefore, is always threatened. It is founded on the premise that the world would be a better place without “them.” And “them” can be whoever poses a threat to the truth of the community’s worldview: Jews, Blacks, capitalists, aristocrats, immigrants, Christians et al. The group uses censorship, the gulag, the guillotine, and the lynch mob to perpetuate itself. It uses inhumane treatment to dehumanize its enemies.

But this is where we must be careful. The behavior of “Antifa,” or anti-fascist counterprotesters, did not look all too different from that of the white nationalists. I wholly agree with them that the beliefs and actions of people like Spencer are repugnant and a scourge upon the earth. But I also suspect that, as a believer in traditional marriage, gender distinctions, and protection of the unborn, many Antifa protesters would find me morally repugnant, as well. Their ideal world probably does not include people like me.

Social media woefully shows not just Antifa activists, but everyday Americans celebrating the battering of fellow human beings. It’s easy to take moral satisfaction in seeing racist protesters experience the violence they incited. The problem is that we’re equally eager to brand others as irredeemable and degrade them as sub-human. We find white supremacists revolting because they hate traditionally marginalized members of society. We’re able to rationalize our hatred of them only because they’re perceived as the majority.

If it seems wrong to equate us with them, just ask yourself: does it really take greater hate to run over someone with a car than it does to bash them in the head with a stick? If so, the difference is only in degree, not in kind.

Martin Luther King Jr.’s Beloved Community

The “us vs. them” dichotomy is the foundation of white supremacy movements. Its members make no pretenses about their disdain for universal human dignity. But if our reaction is just to hate the hateful, we’re opposite sides of the same coin.

The counterbalance to The Gated Communities of the extreme Right and the extreme Left is a society that reinforces the worth of every human being—regardless of race, religion or ideology. This is the aspiration that Dr. Martin Luther King called “The Beloved Community.”

Where the Gated Community rejects, the Beloved Community welcomes. In the Gated Community, there is room only for the powerful, but in the Beloved Community, even the weak have inherent worth. The Beloved Community seeks reconciliation with those who are different—not their destruction.

We know that a perfect Beloved Community will never exist here on earth, but that should never stop us from trying. After all, our country was not founded as a “perfect union,” but a “more perfect union.” The struggle for a more just America must be characterized by discipline, not tit-for-tat malice.

In “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” Dr. Martin Luther King confidently declared that justice would prevail, “…because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands.”

We must condemn racial hatred in all its forms—not because we think racists are losers who should be eliminated, but because we believe in justice. Our words and behavior must underline the righteousness of our cause.

Donald Trump Needs To Not Be President Yesterday,"We’re done with the “Well, maybe it won’t be so bad and we should take what we can get” phase of this administration. It’s time for the “He’s a disaster and needs to go” phase. For everybody’s good, Donald Trump needs to not be president, and he needs to not be president yesterday.

I say “yesterday,” not just as an exaggerated form of “as soon as possible,” but referring literally to his disastrous press Q&A yesterday, in which he whitewashed (no pun intended) the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville by claiming that it included some “very fine” people who were just protesting the removal of a statue.

No, really. He repeated that point at length. Here is what he said.

But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch. Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue, Robert E. Lee. So—excuse me—and you take a look at some of the groups and you see and you would know it if you were honest reporters, which in many cases, you are not. But, many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee…. But they were there to protest—excuse me—you take a look, the night before, they were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.

And:

But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group—excuse me, excuse me—I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down, of to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name…. You had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists. OK? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.

And since the hole wasn’t deep enough yet, he had to keep digging:

There were people in that rally. I looked the night before. If you look, they were people protesting very quietly the taking down the statue of Robert E. Lee. I am sure in that group there were some bad ones. The following day, it looked like they had some rough, bad people, neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them. But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest and very legally protest.

The important thing about this is that there is not a scrap of evidence that any of it is true. In fact, there is a great deal of evidence to the contrary. The rally in Charlottesville was called “Unite the Right,” which despite its name made no real attempt to bring together any recognizable strains from the mainstream American political right. Instead, it drew from a spectrum ranging from the neo-Confederates to the neo-Nazis to the white nationalists to the white supremacists—various ideological shades so indistinguishable from each other that you don’t need a special dispensation from Mike Godwin to just call them all Nazis.

If you’re in any doubt about this, here’s the poster for the event.

Aside from the blatant Nazi style of the imagery, it includes a roster of headliners chosen from various white nationalist groups. So this was a Nazi march from the beginning, planned by Nazis, for Nazis. As to whether any hapless moderates strolled in there thinking this was just about the statue—well, I live in this area and used to be active in the local Tea Party group. I know people who are not white nationalists who oppose the removal of the statues based on high-minded ideas about preserving history. None of them were there, and if they had been, they would have bolted the moment they saw a bunch of guys with torches chanting “Blood and soil.”

What’s truly shocking is that Trump refers twice to “the night before,” that is, to the rally Friday night, before the deadly clash on Saturday, as evidence that some of the protesters weren’t white nationalists. But Friday night was the notorious Citronellanacht, the march with all those tiki-torch-wielding marchers yelling “Blood and soil” and “Jews will not replace us.”

It looked like this:

Who told Donald Trump these weren’t Nazis?

No, seriously, who told him? Before leaping to the defense of all of the “fine people” marching shoulder to shoulder with Nazis, Trump made a big production over the fact that he had waited to speak until he had painstakingly gathered the facts. He used the word “facts” about 15 times in the minute prior to this statement. So from what reliable report, or from which of his advisors, did he get the talking point about how these were just ordinary, upstanding citizens concerned about a statue? What was his source for this “fact”?

The only people I’ve heard trying to make that claim are—you guessed it—the white nationalists who organized the rally. We’ve had inklings before that Trump picks up fake news and conspiracy theories from the Internet and retweets rumors in his Twitter feed, and also that he and his people pick up memes that come through the pipeline of the racist alt-right. (Remember the “sheriff’s star”?) It looks like that’s happening again, while he is president, and in response to a case in which he is specifically called upon to show that this odious faction does not have his ear.

So we can only conclude that they do have his ear.

Trump did say a few things that were true in his Q&A—that “antifa” counter-protesters came spoiling for a fight and share responsibility for the violent brawls (as described by multiple reporters and witnesses), or that there is a serious logical question about where you draw the line in tearing down monuments to historical figures. But that just makes it worse. By mixing genuine truths with an odious lie, Trump merely works to discredit the truth.

He is also working to destroy and discredit the American Right, pitting us against one another in vicious internecine arguments. Right now there are otherwise good people who, out of partisan habits or long-borne outrage at biased media, are trying to concoct excuses for why Trump’s Q&A wasn’t so bad and all the criticisms of it are just fake news.

It’s time for that to stop. It’s time to stop looking at the latest Trump statement in relation to how bad you think the alternative is on the Left, or how biased the media is, and instead to compare it to what we should actually expect from a president. In a country where 99 percent of the population is opposed to Nazis, it should be the easiest thing in the world for an American president to unite the country by appealing to our shared values. Only Trump could take one of the most uncontroversial ideas in American politics, the Indiana Jones Rule, and turn it into a wrenching national argument.

I don’t believe in the supernatural, but if there were a devil, he would be laughing his head off right now as we all whip ourselves into a murderous frenzy against each other.

No, I don’t think Trump is going to resign any time soon. If he were capable of setting aside his personal vanity to do the right thing, we wouldn’t be in this situation. But he needs to be left hanging out there all on his own without support from anyone in his party (or from anyone in the right-leaning media). He is a vortex of destruction, and the only way to survive is to get everything we love as far away from him as possible.

What Happens When Police Stand By During Vandalism And Violence,"Let’s start with a review of the basics. Racists, and others with repugnant views, have a right to be repugnant and express those views in public in this country. We protect their right to free speech because if we fail to, we could very quickly endanger less repugnant views. As the American Civil Liberties Union tweeted this weekend, “The same laws used to silence bigots can be used to silence you.”

Counter-protesters, including Antifa, which has a history of violent tendencies, also have a right to protest gatherings of people with whom they disagree. Both sides are protected in this country, regardless of the content of their message. Things that aren’t legal and protected: assault, murder, vandalism, and all-out street battles between these two groups. Charlottesville wasn’t the first time they clashed, and it won’t be the last. So, how to keep one from becoming the other?

Charlottesville’s police force was criticized for letting protests devolve over a day and a half with little intervention. There will no doubt be better information about how exactly that happened after the city investigates the events that led up to the murder of 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injury of 20 others at the hands of a white nationalist who plowed his car into a group of protesters. Let’s leave the most complex and controversial model of policing from this week aside until we have the “extensive review” ordered by Gov. Terry McAuliffe.

But a similar meeting of protest and counter-protest happened in Seattle, and a gathering of protesters in Durham, North Carolina devolved into mob action that brought down a statue on public property. These two events were policed in very different ways.

Police forces are absolutely vital to protecting the outer limit of freedom for political speech while preventing a breakdown into brawling. This is a really, really hard job in an ever-changing environment sometimes animated by two sides with significant elements that desperately want to fight, and police often do it while being called a bunch of names or threatened.

In Durham, a crowd gathered around 6 p.m. Monday and grew from 50 to more than 100 over two hours. It started with protesters sharing stories of personal experiences with racism, carrying signs, and chanting “No cops, no KKK, no facist USA.” This was all well within bounds of free speech and protest, the most egregious offense being some seriously Orwellian use of the English language: “We are going to find fighting avenues to be on the right side of history,” said the march’s organizer and emcee. “We are going to love like we mean it.”

Okay.

Then it moves into vandalism:

A ladder was brought out, and placed in the back of the pedestal. A protester climbed the ladder and slipped a yellow, bungie-like cord around the soldier’s head and arm. A group of people pulled the long yellow cord. Within seconds the soldier fell, the metal collapsing as the statute did a somersault against the stone pedestal. Protestors cheered and started to kick the crumpled mass.

Here’s how law enforcement reacted:

As the crowd moved toward the statue, members of the Durham County Sheriff’s Office videotaped the rally… The line of protesters walked back to the old courthouse. Some took photographs with the fallen statute. Sheriff’s officials continued to take video.

No arrests were made that night. What message was Durham sending? That the speech rights of this group of people extend to damaging public property in front of law enforcement with impunity? Which other laws would this group have been allowed to break? Which other groups might get such lenience?

How long before someone tests that boundary? We shouldn’t allow “righteous” protesters of Confederate monuments to lawlessly trash them with impunity because someone else who thinks they’re righteous could come along and use their righteousness as a reason to trash pretty much anything. Days later, after criticism of the department for inaction, the Durham sheriff’s office arrested one protester.

On the other hand, we have Seattle—a place, it must be stipulated, with a rich and troubled history of navigating the line between free speech and rioting, police protection and police overreach. In Seattle’s case, there was a gathering of Patriot Prayer, a pro-Trump group, and a gathering a counter-protesters and Antifa forces.

The two gatherings were planned before the violence in Charlottesville, and were held blocks apart, but police did not allow counter-protesters to march all the way to the pro-Trump gathering because they worried about “a small group within the larger march that were clearly, in my experience, clearly there for violence,” said Assistant Seattle Police Chief Steve Wilske.

“If I would have allowed that entire march to go there, there is no way I’m going to keep those people from fighting,” Wilske said. “And once that fight starts, you’re going to have, potentially have, Charlottesville. You’re going to have what happened in Portland in June. And I can’t.”

One Seattle city councilmember is questioning the decision, but Wilske was undeterred: “If I have to do that to keep people from getting hurt, then that’s my responsibility.”

At the end of the day, both groups had marched, with no property damage or injuries reported. Local press reported the “Solidarity Against Hate” marchers challenged the police line, a few threw fireworks at officers, and the police pepper-sprayed part of the crowd. Police made three arrests and confiscated several makeshift weapons.

Were both groups given pretty decent leeway to express themselves? Yes, although I understand the counter-protesters’ desire to get close to the other gathering to make their presence known. Local coverage and pictures of the pro-Trump event suggests plenty of counter-protesters made it to the park in which they were gathered, just not en masse, as an organized march.

But Seattle sent the message that law enforcement will take pretty reasonable measures to ensure that tense situations don’t explode into violent situations. That’s important to citizens attending the protest, and all those who call the city home. It’s a better message than Durham sent, where freedom of speech was protected, but the rule of law and protections against criminal action weren’t.

This Charlottesville Map Indicates Police Allowed Violence,"The availability of credible information has made it difficult to know what went wrong with the police response that failed to prevent rioting and murder in Charlottesville last weekend. We all know that the mainstream media is biased. One way to combat that bias is to check twice as many sources to tease out facts that the various sides inadvertently agree upon.

That begins to build a picture of what actually happened. Information coming out of Charlottesville is compromised. If you can’t trust the data going in, the data coming out is worthless. So I don’t know what happened and I don’t expect to find a credible answer soon.

Both sides came looking for a fight and got one. The police were judged marginally effective. However, partisans on both sides will blame the police to avoid taking responsibility for their own actions. The police will bow to their political masters, take their licks, and hope the price of their silence was worth it.

What the Permit Should Tell Us

Best I can tell, the Klu Klux Klan (KKK) had a permit to demonstrate at Charlottesville’s Lee Park for a specific period. Another crowd showed up to oppose the demonstration. The issuance of a permit represents a leg up for the police. They get to make rules, or they don’t issue the permit.

We don’t know what rules were made or what information the police had, but I would expect the following:

The number of KKK members expected to participate.

An estimate of the number of supporters.

An agreement from the organizers for a parking area far removed from the protest site. Arrangements would be made to transport KKK protesters and supporters to and from the site.

A limitation on acceptable and unacceptable items allowed at the protest site: no baseball bats, no poles on protest signs thicker than one-half inch, no pointed or metal-tipped poles. No chains, slingshots, prohibited knives, or weapons.

Police would provide an escort to enter and exit the site to minimize the chances of confrontation.

This is all long-established protocol for how to manage a demonstration. Law enforcement will typically assign assembly points and routes to the event. They try to make sure that the points are sufficiently removed from one another so the groups won’t reach critical mass and explode. The police line the routes to maintain peace along the way. There will always be rabble-rousers who try to disrupt the process.

The left-wing opposition group Antifa, and associated groups such as Black Lives Matter, did not have a permit. This means the police had no prior agreement with and very little control of left-wing protesters. Given prior examples of Antifa protests, law enforcement would have been justified in setting up a controlled area and an exclusionary zone. The exclusionary zone apparently was the curb line of E. Market Street, shared with the Lee Park. Since the only entrances to the park were along E. Market Street, then, confrontations were guaranteed.

What the Police Should Have Done

The police missed an opportunity by not setting an exclusionary zone for a one-block radius around the park. By exclusionary zone, I mean a no man’s land occupied by the police and cleared individuals, the press, and people whose intent is to join the rally. No hanging around outside, they are going in or leaving.

The purpose of the control area is to give law enforcement the opportunity to relieve the participants of baseball bats, two by fours, one and two-inch dowel rods affixed to signs, and slingshots, plus any garden-variety prohibited weapons. They can keep the sign. People armed in such a manner give up these implements, leave the area, or, depending on the nature of the item, face arrest.

Each group winds up at its assigned demonstration point, and they do their thing without interacting with one another. Protestors have a right to free speech, but that doesn’t mean that police have to provide the audience. The ultimate irony, of course, is Antifa complaining that their right to free speech was infringed while they engaged in a protest to deny another group the right to free speech.

Declaring civil disobedience is an admission that the protestor is going against established norms and may violate the law in doing so. It is an admission that the violator may be arrested and is willing to take that risk. It is not civil disobedience to beat somebody whose views you oppose about the head and shoulders while refraining from calling the person a “motherf-cker.” That activity is called aggravated assault and is a felony.

What the Crowd Is Comprised Of

Police and protestors know that estimates of crowd size are meaningless. I am not sure what the press knows. A protest crowd has four components without regard to the issue: The leader organizers, a relatively small cadre. They are committed to the cause. Then, more and more there are hired guns committed to whoever hires them, and they are geared towards violence.

Then there are the supporters, and they come in two flavors. There are the true believers, and the “I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine” types. There are just so many causes and not enough time, what with soccer practice and the dog needing to visit the vet, so what’s an activist to do? Bundle. The “Save the Whales” folks agree to show up at the “Stop Autism in Dogs Demonstration” if the Stop the Autism in Dogs group can make the Save the Whales protest. Neither group has the least interest in a cause outside their interests, but numbers are numbers.

The vast majority of people who show up at demonstrations are the Me Toos. They don’t know what the cause happens to be and don’t care. They have been told, “Dude, there’s gonna be a killer band,” “Chicks dig guys who protest, maybe we can get laid.” They are curious and looking for entertainment. For most, assault is not entertaining.

One final component of the crowd are the opportunists. Mostly criminal in inclination, they go where large bodies of people are because you never know.

Now for the Critical Question

Question: How many protesters will stand and fight if not given an outlet to escape?

Answer: All of them.

Given the opportunity, at the first sign of trouble, most of the crowd will leave. This means an estimated crowd size of 4,000 dwindles to 400. Among the first to leave are the planners and organizers, leaving the mob without direction.

One of the key considerations in handling confrontations at protests is what to do when the party is over. The police may time the rallies so they end at different times and they can move the crowds out. With good prior planning, police move opposing sides off in different directions. Officers try to channel opposing groups away from each other. It is one thing to walk the gauntlet with 50 of your buds, but it’s something else entirely to do it alone.

Look at the picture above again. The police could have moved the KKK and supporters to the back of the park and loaded them on buses. Even without the buses, the KKK folks would have had a block-long head start. Instead, the Klan was pushed out onto E. Market Street, where Antifa was waiting. There seems to be some debate as to whether the rally was shut down early with an immediate order to vacate the premises. I don’t know. It seems at this point the cops just stood back and didn’t escort either group or attempt to direct their movement. And that is when everything went to hell.

What the Operations Order Would Reveal

Given the number of police agencies and officers involved, I would be interested in seeing the operations order. There are probably several hundred copies floating around. The operations order would lay out the chain of command and lines of communication. It would describe the overall operation, its goals, and contingency plans. It would define the area of operations. It would probably describe various triggering events. If this, then that, and so forth.

Another item of interest would be the recording and log of activities and events maintained in the command post. With information from those two sources, it would be possible to see how the actual events varied from the plan and who gave the order to deviate from the plan.

If what happened at Charlottesville was just bad luck and poor communication, then I would expect that some law enforcement elements would have stuck with the original plan while other elements implemented the new plan and charted a different course. But that didn’t happen.

Round up the usual suspects. While doing so, ask yourself: has there ever been a state police agency that would roll over so completely for a small-town mayor? (The answer is no.)

"Trump Spoke Truth About ‘Both Sides’ In Charlottesville, And Media Lost It","Our media have a problem: they are essentially incapable of covering Donald Trump with anything less than full-on deranged hysteria.

I do not say this as an excess of rhetoric or op-ed theatrics. It is a very real, very pressing problem, only getting worse, and it poses a significant danger to the social fabric of the United States. Twenty-first century American media has the ability to shape our discourse and shift our public consciousness, and it is abusing that power in the worst ways possible. This is likely a bigger problem than any of us realizes.

The last 48 hours provided a crystal-clear example of the genuinely dangerous course upon which the media have set themselves. At Trump Tower on Tuesday, President Trump held a press conference that was initially supposed to be about infrastructure but quickly went off-script and became about the Charlottesville neo-Nazi madness.

By itself this is nothing new: Trump regularly goes off-script, if it can even be said that he has a script. But the media behavior in the wake of this conference was arguably something new, a sort of grotesque watermark of the media’s coverage of the Trump administration thus far.

The furor surrounding the press conference stemmed largely from one particular line Trump delivered. When one reporter asked about his claim that there had been “hatred [and] violence on both sides,” Trump replied: “Well I do think there’s blame. Yes, I think there is blame on both sides. You look at both sides. I think there is blame on both sides.”

Media Immediately Jets Into Astral Orbit

With that unremarkable assertion, the media were off. “HE STILL BLAMES BOTH SIDES,” CNN blared in enormous font on its front page. In a headline, The New York Times blared that Trump “again blames ‘both sides.” So did the Chicago Tribune. So did NBC News. So did U.S. News and World Report (calling it “an insane press conference” to boot).

So did NPR. So did CBS News. So did the Washington Post. So did the Wall Street Journal. So did Time. So did MSNBC. So did USA Today. NBC News later wondered: “Has Trump Lost His Moral Authority for Good?” CNN continued with the massive headlines, calling Trump’s press conference “a meltdown for the ages,” and declaring: “Trump is who we feared he was.” Vox claimed Trump “is offering comfort to racists and extremists.”

The unambiguous implication of this media firestorm is obvious: we are supposed to see it as outrageous at best and morally abhorrent at worst that Trump would claim that “there is blame on both sides.” The thing is, Trump was telling the truth. There is blame on both sides. And we have eyewitness descriptions and photograph evidence to back it up.

Truth Is Truth, People

Trump appears to separate the generalized violence of that Saturday afternoon from the vehicular homicide a white nationalist perpetrated on Charlottesville’s mall near the end of the whole affair. In the press conference, Trump stated in no uncertain terms: “The driver of the car is a murderer. What he did was a horrible, inexcusable thing.”

It is, rather, the periodic violence that occurred throughout Charlottesville’s downtown area to which Trump was apparently referring. And he’s right: both sides committed violence on that day.

We know this because people there saw it happen and have confirmed Trump’s characterization publicly. New York Times reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg, for one, attested: “The hard left seemed as hate-filled as alt-right,” she tweeted. “I saw club-wielding ‘antifa’ beating white nationalists being led out of the park.” If there were any doubt as to whether the Left were committing violence that day, Stolberg later clarified: “[I] should have said violent, not hate-filled.”

I did not notice any wall-to-wall coverage of Stolberg’s unambiguous eyewitness testimony. Did you?

Another eyewitness report comes from Isabella Ciambotti, a creative writing major from the University of Virginia. Speaking to The New York Times, Ciambotti testified that at one point “a counterprotestor ripped a newspaper stand off the sidewalk and threw it at alt-right protesters.” Photographic evidence confirms Ciambotti’s account.

Raw footage of the moment the counterprotestor threw the box is inconclusive but strongly suggests the counterprotester was unprovoked at the time. Further raw footage shows counterprotesters hurling objects at white supremacists and neo-Nazis while the latter simply stand there a good distance apart from the crowd.

Ciambotti also claims to have witnessed “another man from the white supremacist crowd being chased and beaten.” Additionally she saw “a much older man, also with the alt-right group, [who] got pushed to the ground in the commotion. Someone raised a stick over his head and beat the man with it.” Ciambotti claims to have intervened before the beating could continue further.

Ciambotti further asserts:

There were absolutely groups of peaceful protesters in Charlottesville this past weekend, many making a mature show of resistance. But what I saw on Market Street didn’t feel like resistance. It felt like every single person letting out his or her own well of fear and frustration on the crowd.

These People Don’t Have Strong Motivations to Lie

Both Stolberg and Ciambotti can fairly be seen as credible witnesses. Ciambotti, in particular, affirms she was a part of the counter-protest, yet she directly attests to the violent nature of the liberals who gathered in Charlottesville that day.

Additionally, Charlottesville police chief Al S. Thomas Jr. has affirmed that the protest saw “mutually combative” individuals on both sides. If the police chief who oversaw the mayhem is affirming Trump’s basic premise, might we assume that Trump is onto something?

It is not unreasonable to blame “both sides” of protesters that day. Yes, the neo-Nazis and white supremacists showed up preaching vicious hate, ugliness, and stupidity. Many were armed to the teeth while doing it.

But liberal protesters showed up armed, as well, and we have unequivocal testimony and footage proving that they committed unprovoked violence that day. This was not a gentle counter-protest of “passive resistance;” the Left did not show up to downtown Charlottesville to practice civil rights-style non-violent activism. They had fighting on their mind. And they fought.

There Was Plenty to Legitimately Criticize Here

The fact that our media dedicated an entire news cycle to Trump’s truthful statement on the matter is staggering. This was not necessary. There were plenty of things the media could have criticize in Trump’s press conference. He asserts, for instance, that “very fine people” marched with the white supremacists and Nazis, people “that were there to protest the taking down, of to them, a very, very important statue.”

We have newsmakers whose only professional function these days seems to be whipping tens of millions of people into angry, irrational frenzies.

Maybe this is true, but there is no evidence that the statue protest was made up of anything other than paranoid racists. Trump should not have made this statement unless he was willing to provide proof to back it up.

Yet he also told the press: “I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally.” This, according to Vox, constitutes Trump “offering comfort to racists and extremists.”

Trump makes a lot of mistakes. Some are minor, some major. In that, he is like every president who has ever held the position. Sometimes he gets things right, too—-as he did blaming the Charlottesville street violence on “both sides.”

The media’s responsibility, if it even cares anymore, is to learn how to tell the difference between the things he does right, the small mistakes he makes, and the big blunders he commits. Currently the media are apparently incapable of telling the difference between all three: it’s one and the same to them, no matter what he does, no matter what he says.

This is a dismal situation for Americans to be in. We have newsmakers whose only professional function these days seems to be whipping tens of millions of people into angry, irrational frenzies. They do not seem to care about the truth. They do not seem to care about honesty, integrity, or accuracy. We are lurching from one shrieking, insane media episode to the next. And it is wearing on all of us, and weakening the bonds of fellowship and friendship between common Americans.

As I write this, the top headline on CNN’s website is: “This is a moral crisis. And it’s self-inflicted.” That’s true. So what is the media going to do about it?

CNN described the rally as “mostly peaceful,” and celebrated the so-called counter-protesters. Every anchor and guest for six straight hours praised the counter-protesters as people who are just there to oppose hate, bigotry, and violence.

CNN anchor Fredricka Whitfield literally described the Left’s presence as being about “Peace and love.” Yes. Really. See for yourself. It’s teed up here.

What was once simple bias from media personalities like Jake Tapper and Chuck Todd has become explicitly dangerous. Rather than report on now-normalized leftist violence, the media inspire more of it by insisting President Trump and the Right in general are racists and fascists. Rather than expose Democrats for manufacturing racism and disparity by using identity politics as a political weapon, the media helps manufacture more by falsely blaming the Right for both.

Everything the Democrats and media say they’re fighting to end — disparity, violence, racism, hate — they are making worse. Even more appalling, several establishment Republicans are helping them.

Our Post-Charlottesville Narrative Is A National Embarrassment,"Pundits, journalists, politicians, clergy, law enforcement, sociologists—all may agree or disagree to varying degrees about what the Charlottesville mayhem of August 12 means for our country. Any number of interpretations could be useful and instructive. But above all Charlottesville has shown just how profoundly broken and destructively useless our media industry and political establishment really are. It is a genuine national embarrassment.

I do not say that lightly. I love this country; I love its rich history, its political traditions, its culture, its people. I love its religious backbone. I do not love the historical flaws of our country, but I love the ways we have righted them, and the great gifts we have given the world along the way: our priceless treasure trove of abolitionist literature, the Gettysburg Address, Letter From a Birmingham Jail, our brilliant Supreme Court decisions on any number of civil rights.

I love the United States. But I am deeply embarrassed for it, and I want it to do better than it has over the past few weeks.

It is not unsurprising that the events of Charlottesville—an awful combination of hatred, racism, toxic politics, paranoid factionalism, and political ineptitude—would stir our emotions and cause some people to do crazy things. But the responses from the media, politicians, countless individuals, and institutions has been nothing short of shamefully disastrous. However painful it may be, we should analyze what has been going on in the days since that terrible afternoon to learn from it and commit ourselves to doing better if and when, God forbid, this happens again.

The ‘Both Sides’ Hysteria

Last week I wrote about the media meltdown surrounding Trump’s claim that “there is blame on both sides [for Charlottesville].” That was entirely true: eyewitness testimony, from sources including a New York Times reporter and a student counterprotester, affirm as much. There is simply no question that both white nationalists and leftist “Antifa” protesters both engaged in unjustifiable violence that day.

Yet here’s a small sampling of the responses to Trump’s accurate statement. Mitt Romney responded by tweeting: “No, not the same. One side is racist, bigoted, Nazi. The other opposes racism and bigotry. Morally different universes.” Nancy Pelosi, the Democrat minority leader of the House of Representatives, issued a statement asserting Trump’s “both sides” claim “ignores the abhorrent evil of white supremacism.”

At The New York Times, Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman claimed that Trump “gave white supremacists an unequivocal boost” by “equating activists protesting racism with the neo-Nazis and white supremacists.” Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine declared on Facebook: “This was not ‘both sides.’ White supremacists descended on Charlottesville to promote hate and intimidate this Virginia community.”

But it was both sides. That is a fact. Yet these leaders seem willing to excuse political violence simply because it was directed at neo-Nazis. These politicians and journalists appear to be saying violence is okay when it’s committed against people we don’t like. All you have to do is say “There were Nazis!” to justify it.

This is shameful and humiliating for America: elected officials and members of our press are apparently tacitly advocating mob rule and vicious, primitive might-makes-right public discourse. The world should look at us and laugh for such crude and shocking behavior coming from the nominally elite and educated members of our political and media classes.

Further Justifying Violence

The justifications for the violent behavior we saw in Charlottesville did not just stop at such sly, underhanded approvals. Some public figures openly endorsed political violence against their opponents.

The biggest meme related to this phenomenon rocketed around Twitter like wildfire: people began comparing the violent progressive activists in Charlottesville with the soldiers who stormed the French beaches as part of the Normandy invasion during World War II. CNN contributor and former Hillary Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon, CNN anchor Christopher Cuomo, Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell, author David Simon, actor Joshua Malina, and countless others compared the Charlottesville vigilantes to D-Day soldiers.

It is astonishing that one even has to explain the difference between the two phenomena, but here we go: the Nazis of the Third Reich were part of a brutal war machine that had burned across Western Europe, was threatening the free world, and was fighting for a government that had declared war on the United States. The Charlottesville Nazis, meanwhile—loathsome as they were—were exercising a well-established and perfectly legal constitutional right.

Might there be a little difference between the two? Might “violence” (i.e. legally authorized military action) be justified against the Nazi war machine, while mob violence from unauthorized citizens might not be so justified against American citizens engaging in constitutionally protected free speech? Might there also be any difference between soldiers acting under legal orders as part of a legally declared war and lawless mobs attacking rally attendees without any grant from any legal authority?

More generally, people openly advocated that American citizens assault other American citizens: comedian Patton Oswalt, for one, favorably compared the violent activists to movie hero Indiana Jones punching a Nazi, while CNN reporter Jake Tapper wordlessly endorsed violence against neo-Nazi protesters.

Politicians, journalists, actors, writers, and other media figures openly and gleefully encouraged their fellow citizens to harm each other. This is the stuff of violent hellholes, not the United States of America. Shame on these people for advocating such violence, and shame on everyone who shared such disgusting sentiment.

Anti-Free-Speechism

America has the greatest free speech regime on the planet. Still, plenty of people in this country would like to see your free speech rights greatly attenuated. In the wake of Charlottesville, many of them spoke out in favor of censorship.

As CNN reported, the American Civil Liberties Union—a longtime defender of every American’s right to say anything—“took heat” for supporting the free speech rights of the neo-Nazi protesters. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe blamed the ACLU for suing Charlottesville over its handling of the neo-Nazi rally. At The New York Times, a Berkeley instructor, K-Sue Park, claimed that “the ACLU needs to rethink free speech.” In a viral tweet, Virginia ACLU board member Waldo Jaquith resigned in protest over the ACLU defending Nazis’ free speech rights.

It is astonishing to witness American citizens seizing on the hysteria of a moment to condemn precious American freedoms.

A protester in Charlottesville, meanwhile, punched a neo-Nazi in the face during a press conference then told The New York Times: “Free speech does not protect hate speech.” So far as I know, that person received no condemnation from anyone for punching a man who was simply speaking at a podium.

At HuffPO, ACLU member Burce Hartford came out in favor of criminalizing “hate speech,” claiming it has to be “fought and suppressed.” On CNN, attorney and former DC Democratic Party chairman A. Scott Bolden declared “Hate speech is not free speech,” and nobody in the room—not the host, Ana Cabrera, or former South Carolina lieutenant governor Andre Bauer, or presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, or Washington Post journalist David Fahrenthold—pushed back against this destructive and illiterate concept.

Similarly, Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors claimed on MSNBC that “hate speech…is not protected under First Amendment rights.” Skidmore professor Jennifer Delton argued in favor of restricting free speech in the Washington Post, claiming that since we once did it to American communists, we can do it to the alt-right today (seriously).

It is, frankly, astonishing to witness American citizens seizing on the hysteria of a moment to condemn precious American freedoms. It is a political mercy that we have decades of Supreme Court precedent to stand as a bulwark against these authoritarian impulses. Just the same, who’s to say that these censorious sentiments will not eventually spread even further?

Generalized Hysteria

The general atmosphere of hysteria during the post-Charlottesville fallout has been jaw-dropping. Above are excellent examples. Yet what happened last week in Boston is even more so—a case study in the growing delirium taking ahold of American politics, especially progressive politics.

Activists in Boston organized a free-speech rally to advocate First Amendment rights. It was an event concerned with freedom of expression, nothing more. Indeed, one of the rally’s speakers, Gavin McInnes, affirmed that “The rally on Saturday in Boston couldn’t be farther from the rally [in Charlottesville]…We are socially liberal, fiscal conservatives who think America has a lot to be proud of. . . . We are pro-gay, multicultural, pro-Israel, pro-family and anti-Nazi.”

One young man follows the Trump supporter around screaming bizarre threats at him:’“I hope you liked having a job. Everyone you have ever known is going to see you.’

Another organizer of the rally, Louis Sender, said that the purpose of [the rally is] just to do free speech…That’s all it’s ever been.” The organizers even planned to begin the rally with a moment of silence to Heather Heyer, the victim of Charlottesville’s white nationalist terror attack.

No matter. Boston turned out thousands upon thousands of protesters. Fifteen thousand protesters showed up to rail against the free speech organizers—15,000, in comparison to a few dozen rally attendees. Fearing for their safety, the rally organizers eventually fled Boston Common with a police escort. In a genuinely eerie display of threatening intent, the protesters began to chant: “Make them walk! Make them walk!”

During the brief rally itself, attendees were subject to vicious verbal and physical abuse. One astonishing video shows a “Trump supporter” walking through Boston Common wrapped in an American flag while the crowd is screaming at him. “Get the f-ck out of our f-ckin’ town!” yells one guy. “F-CKING RACIST!” screams another.

One young man follows the Trump supporter around screaming bizarre threats at him: “I hope you liked having a job. Everyone you have ever known is going to see you…I will have your identity, and in your name I will be donating to everything you stand against! Thanks for the great picture! Your employers and family are gonna love these shots!”

When asked, “Why are you here?” the Trump supporter responds: “I want to show that people shouldn’t be afraid to voice their [views] and voice their opinions. You shouldn’t be afraid to go outside and say you’re conservative. It’s pretty sad that things like this happen.” For this, he was slandered, threatened, and harassed.

All approached the idea of free speech as if it were an alien concept written in an extraterrestrial language.

Another video shows an older woman holding up an American flag as protesters walk by. Suddenly, a protester grabs the woman’s flag and attempts to pull it out of her hands. The woman does not let go, so the protester drags her and the flag until the woman trips and falls. Later, a few dozen protesters were arrested after violent clashes with police.

More shameful still was the media’s approach to covering the rally. The organizers of the rally explicitly affirmed that it was an event in support of free speech. Yet major media outlets treated this explanation as if it were a smokescreen, couching the term “free speech” in “scare quotes:” CBS News, NPR, the Washington Post, Slate, the Boston Globe, Reuters, CNBC, USA Today, Politico, Yahoo, the Daily Beast, the New York Daily News, countless others—all approached the idea of free speech as if it were an alien concept written in an extraterrestrial language.

Some outlets took it to an even more desperately shameful level: the New York Daily News, for instance, claimed that the protesters “chase[d] away white nationalists” without mentioning the rally organizers and speakers who explicitly disavowed white nationalism, while the Chicago Tribune heavily implied that the rally was a white nationalist gathering, with an enormous headline screaming: “Massive counterprotest against white nationalism upstages ‘free speech rally’ in Boston.” What a disgraceful abuse of media power.

Why Is This Happening, America?

Why have the tragic events of Charlottesville transformed so many people into irresponsible, violent, censorious, and hysterical lunatics? There are any number of explanations: shallow political opportunism, Selma envy, outrage addiction, low-grade despotic impulses.

We could easily meet these challenges with calmness, dignity, grace, and careful thought.

We are a strong country. We have survived much worse than half-bright basement-dwelling Schutzstaffel wannabes and violent leftist activists. We could easily meet these challenges with calmness, dignity, grace, and careful thought. We are simply choosing not to, reaching instead for public lunacy and unhinged mob mentality and widespread intellectual dishonesty.

We should not do this. We are better than this. We can move forward from Charlottesville without destroying this country’s precious ideals and customs, and without turning on each other with vitriol, hatred, and specious nonsense.

The politicians, journalists, and media outlets above are betting on you responding to the Charlottesville crisis with anger, irrationality, and unthinking acceptance of the narrative. Do not fall into this trap. You can help reverse this tide before it gets any worse—or you can contribute to it, and by doing so further erode the well-being of this incredible country to which you are heir. Please, for the love of God, make the right choice.

Are White Nationalists Just Sexually Frustrated Lost Boys?,"In the wake of resurgent white nationalism and the events in Charlottesville, tiny pockets of the Internet have wondered aloud: can the violent, antisocial behavior of young men be blamed on sexual frustration?

This question isn’t new. Many have asked it about jihadis or school shooters like Eric Harris at Columbine. With each new instance of masculinity gone awry, we break out our doctorates in dime store psychology and attempt to diagnose the new patient.

Unfortunately, we amateur psychologists may be ignoring an inconvenient truth: that we are afflicted with the same disorder. Our symptoms just aren’t as severe. As our society increasingly shuns any social contracts associated with sex and sexuality, we risk increasing dysfunction as individuals and as a whole.

Many Agree: Neo-Nazis Are Sexual Failures

Following the events in Charlottesville, one of the quickest conclusions onlookers of all stripes drew was that the Unite the Right protesters were losers. They most likely still lived in their parents’ basements and couldn’t get a girl if they tried.

The most notable and immediate was that of actor and comedian Michael Rapaport. In a colorful sidewalk rant, he mocked the men, calling them “Revenge of the Nerds” protesters and taunting them, “It’s Friday night, try to get to second base with a girl, you [expletive] loser.” Paul Bois, writer at The Daily Wire, points out the amusing link between the Polynesian origin of tiki torches and the protesters’ “lack of sexual prowess.”

In a bold piece whose title I can’t repeat here, author Dana Schwartz responds to alt-right protesters’ claims that their actions in Charlottesville made them more sexually desirable to women. Pulling no punches, she proclaims, “If you’re a 20-year-old pretending to be a Nazi, you’re not a bad boy; you’re a racist virgin so humiliated by his own sexual inadequacy and terrified at rejection that you’ll blame your feelings of weakness on some unseen Liberal Agenda.”

She goes as far as to say, “First and foremost, the neo-Nazi alt-right movement is about racism. Second, it’s about sexual insecurity.” Although they go about it in different ways, all parties seem to agree on one thing: these alt-right protesters are sexual failures. Many believe no self-respecting woman would sleep with these men—and this rejection is part of the reason they’re lashing out.

In noting these protesters’ sexual undesirability is a tacit admission that sexual acceptance is a measure of a man’s worth. A man who can gain women’s attention has no need to rebel against society because he’s achieved a certain level of success. In this way, being able to get sexual attention is a symbol of social legitimacy. Those who can’t must have something wrong with them.

This is where our illness and theirs intersects. To blame racism and anti-social behavior on “lack of sex” is a stark indictment of how we’ve reduced an awe-inspiring element of our humanity to a meaningless consumer good.

‘Your Primary Sexual Relationship Is With Yourself’

For most of human history in most societies, sex was not a uniquely personal act. Obligations like marriage, children, family, and societal expectations accompanied it. The effects of cheating on your spouse, having sex before marriage, or siring an illegitimate child were understood to have ripple effects beyond the individual. In other words, sex bore social and practical consequences. That is still true for millions around the world today.

However, in the West, we are still reaping the fruit of the sexual revolution. With contraception, pornography, and our normalization of divorce and extramarital sex, sexuality has been unhinged from obligation. Sex is not selfless, committed intimacy with another person—it’s just another tool that we use to express ourselves. As one sex therapist puts it, “Your primary sexual relationship is with yourself.”

So when we are tempted to tease these men as pathetic virgins, we do so in part because we live in a culture where sexual fulfillment is essential to self-realization. We believe that without sex, these men lack real understanding of the world or themselves.

Does Recreational Sex Hinder Self-Awareness?

The problem with this perspective is that we’ve conflated sex with meaningful human relationships, particularly for men. We want socially immature young men to become more self-aware and be less antisocial. Our culture thinks having sex is key to this outcome.

But sex has too long been removed from the social and relational obligations that actually make it a transformative experience. Stripped of its intimacy and emotional complexity, sex has just become recreational—and therefore lost much of its humanizing power.

Theologian Harvey Cox explains this phenomenon beautifully his 1961 essay, “Playboy’s Doctrine of Male.” He details how the rise of Playboy and pornography have promoted a lifestyle where uncommitted sex is like enjoying fine wine or knowing how to choose the right suit—it’s a consumer product. Through this mentality, “They dilute and dissipate authentic sexuality by reducing it to an accessory, by keeping it at a safe distance.”

Both sexual relationships and healthy social relationships are a give and take; they require vulnerability and exposure. But, as Cox puts it, “The story of man’s refusal to be so exposed goes back to the story of Eden and is expressed by man’s desire to control the other rather than to be with the other. It is basically the fear to be one’s self, a lack of the ‘courage to be.’”

White nationalists—and many other young men—want social approval and sexual fulfillment, but not the responsibility these require. They lack the emotional tools to coexist with people they don’t understand. Then when they sense rejection, they lash out even more. Their problem is not unrealized sexuality, but unrealized humanity. The bottom line is that these men—and our world writ large—have lost sight of what it means to be men. The conflation of sexual success with male identity does nothing to bring it into focus.

As Cox so eloquently observes, “this futile attempt to reduce the mysterium tremendum of the sexual fails to solve the problem of being a man. For sexuality is the basic form of all human relationships, and therein lies its terror and its power.”

Stunted emotional growth does not excuse the evil ideology the alt-right spouts. However, their failure to build meaningful emotional relationships with women adds to the isolation and rejection they already feel. With no healthy expectations for their masculinity, they’ll continue to harness their efforts on violence against those that reject them. And what is violence against the weak but a terrible misuse of man’s God-given responsibility and strength?

Big Abortion Strikes Out In Protests Against Pregnancy Help Centers,"For all the bluster about “choice,” “access,” and “reproductive health,” the abortion industry and its assorted fans in Hollywood, politics, and the media have a remarkable tendency to swing for the fences and come up empty. That fact is becoming clearer to see every day.

Take, for instance, the recently failed “Expose Fake Clinics” campaign, starring Comedy Central and leftist icon Lizz Winstead and her abortion-extremist group, “Lady Parts Justice League.” Seeking to “expose” pregnancy centers that offer women the help they need to make an informed choice during an unexpected pregnancy, all Lady Parts Justice League exposed was its own ignorance of the facts.

That and the Left’s steely opposition to anything that could possibly dent abortion’s cultural and financial stronghold. Cash flow and cultural currency—not “choice,” “access” or “reproductive health”—are at stake, and abortion profiteers know it.

The Left’s Science Deniers

Perhaps that’s why, in addition to organizing a spate of protests at life-affirming pregnancy centers this summer, abortion absolutists have upped the ante (or is it “anti”?) in their fight against “Abortion Pill Reversal (APR),” a medical intervention that can halt a chemical abortion after a woman has taken the first of two pills involved in the RU-486 regimen.

Even though the APR network now includes more than 350 physicians who credit it with having saved the lives of 300 babies in the past 10 years, pro-abortion outlets like Rewire.com and DAME magazine, as well as mainstream outlets like The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times, continue to refer to it as “junk science.”

While the research on APR is still in its initial stages—APR researchers expect to release a major paper in the coming months—the abortion lobby’s knee-jerk resistance to the process says plenty about where “reproductive health” and “choice” rank on their hierarchy of values. Actually, the abortion industry’s decision to couch its lethal agenda as “reproductive health” breaks down far more easily than that: “Abortion is neither ‘reproductive’ nor ‘healthy.’” Discuss.

Where Abortion and Access Collide

Meanwhile, when they’re not busy smearing the pro-life movement as closet racists or rapists, abortion-mongers like those at NARAL Pro-Choice America—an ironic name if ever there was one—are doing everything in their power to keep women headed for abortuaries from even interacting with a pro-lifer on the street.

In Chicago, pro-life advocates are continuing to fight for the right to speak with women outside of abortion mills, a fight that has gone on since 2009. Under a current city ordinance known as a “bubble zone,” no pro-life citizen can come within eight feet of any woman heading to an abortion clinic once she comes within 50 feet of the front door.

The ordinance, introduced under the “pro-choice” guise, effectively strips a woman of choice by trampling on her right to make the most informed decision possible about her own pregnancy. This strikes at the very heart of the “choice” and “access” abortion devotees claim to hold so dear.

In an August 21 donor appeal, NARAL president Ilyse Hogue bemoaned the fact that Kentucky’s last remaining abortion mill, EMW Women’s Surgical Center in Louisville, may be on its way out of business. Painting a rather drastic picture of a “mob of dozens of anti-choice fanatics trying to block the entrance” to the abortion business, Hogue later bewailed the fact that women could access a pro-life pregnancy center right next door instead of ending their children’s lives through abortion at EMW Women’s Surgical Center.

In the fantasy world Hogue portrays, where peaceful protests and sidewalk counseling are depicted as a bread riot in the Soviet Union, reality holds no value. Neither do “choice” or “access”—to anything other than abortion, that is.

Pro-Choice? Not So Much

Because they couldn’t find anything productive to do with 10 days out of their summer, Winstead and Co. scoured the country to dig up as much dirt as they could on life-affirming pregnancy centers, which serve women with free ultrasounds, pregnancy tests, post-abortive counseling, peer counseling, parenting classes, and material aid like diapers and car seats.

What we might call the “anti-anti-choice” crusade targeted locally funded pregnancy help centers and ultrasound-equipped medical clinics across the country with online and on-site demonstrations, all focused on demonizing anyone with the gumption to offer an alternative to abortion. Although the campaign—which one Cincinnati pregnancy center director called “underwhelming” after a handful of abortion fans picketed her center—identified more than 4,000 centers on their hit list, only 40 locations were actually subjected to any sort of pro-abortion presence as part of the effort.

The crusade was doomed from the start. At its initial rally, a man and his toddler walked up on Lady Parts Justice League’s protest outside the very place where his son’s life had been rescued from abortion. Confronting Winstead’s un-funny fiction, the man insisted that pro-abortion protesters look at his toddler and reckon with the fact that he was standing there because of the center’s work.

He wasn’t the only former pregnancy center client to speak up on behalf of the ministries under fire from “Expose Fake Clinics.” One mother, who chose life with the help of a Minnesota pregnancy center, actually thought the whole campaign was a joke before realizing that Winstead and her troupe actually meant business.

Running on Fumes

Another telling moment came as the campaign made a stop in Columbus, Ohio, at a pregnancy help clinic serving women just across a side street from a Planned Parenthood that aborts babies in a minority-heavy, low-income area. When one pro-lifer, a pastor in Columbus, approached protesters and calmly asked why they were there and what they were hoping to accomplish, he met the same deluge of accusations against pregnancy centers that have poured forth from pro-abortion groups like NARAL for the past decade.

Rather than argue point-for-point, his response cut right to the heart of the issue. Far better to be accused of dishonesty than to be unashamedly committed to monetized killing.

“On one hand, you have someone supposedly lying and one hand you have someone killing,” he said. “If I had to [pick between] the two, I’d go with the lying.”

Winstead’s campaign was followed by another planned protest at a pregnancy center, this time in Atlanta, where 150 abortion absolutists showed up August 12 to register their disdain for Cura Women’s Health Clinic, an ultrasound-equipped medical clinic that has saved 180 babies from abortion thus far in 2017.

Although 150 protesters may sound like quite the crowd, it’s really not all that impressive when you realize its organizers—including Lady Parts Justice League, Reproaction, and SisterSong—were pulling from a Google and Facebook-backed “Netroots Nation” conference that gathered 3,000 leftists at a downtown hotel less than a mile away from the pregnancy center.

Coming just minutes after Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren urged the same crowd to stand unapologetically for abortion, the paltry Atlanta protest may be the best indicator yet of just how much ground abortion fanatics like Warren are losing even among their own constituency. The old euphemisms just aren’t holding up, and there’s no candid way to defend an idea as ugly as abortion.

5 Problems With The NFL’s National Anthem Protest,"At a Friday rally in Alabama, President Donald Trump criticized football players who protest during the national anthem:

Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a b-tch off the field right now. Out. He’s fired. He’s fired!’ You know, some owner is going to do that. He’s going to say, ‘That guy that disrespects our flag, he’s fired.’ And that owner, they don’t know it. They don’t know it. They’ll be the most popular person, for a week. They’ll be the most popular person in this country. Because that’s a total disrespect of our heritage, a total disrespect of everything we stand for. I know we have freedoms and we have freedom of choice, but it’s still disrespectful.

He went on to say that ratings are down because the game itself has gotten boring, but also because “When people like yourselves turn on television and you see those people taking the knee when they are playing our great national anthem.” He suggested that fans simply leave the stadium when this happens.

In response, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell issued a statement that said, “Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities.”

Then in a move that should have surprised no one, Sunday became a national anthem protest day around the league. Many players took a knee during the anthem, some stood with raised fists. Entire teams remained in their locker rooms during the national anthem. And Bills running back LeSean McCoy, who was on my fantasy football team years ago when I still cared about the NFL, took the opportunity to stretch out during the national anthem.

Here are five reasons the NFL anthem protests are not going as well as the media would like to think.

1. Vague And Unclear Protest Goals

One of the keys to a good protest is to have a clear goal. If the discussions on Sunday were any indication, nobody is entirely clear what is being protested when athletes kneel during the national anthem. CNN said yesterday’s display was about opposition to Trump:

The opening paragraph in the Los Angeles Times story on the protests said they were about “the relentless vortex of controversy that surrounds President Trump, as players from London to New England to Carson knelt or linked arms Sunday while others stayed in the locker room during the national anthem.” Later the story said the protests during the national anthem were meant to “draw attention to racism and social injustice.”

The national anthem protests began last year, before Donald Trump was elected the first time, when then-professional quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee for a variety of reasons.

Kaepernick, who has sat and knelt during the anthem, has said he refused to honor a song or ‘show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.’ He also referenced the shootings of black men by police as one of reasons for his stance.

As for the latter claim, Mary Katharine Ham noted on CNN yesterday, disapproval of Black Lives Matter has gone up from 20 percent in 2016 to nearly 60 percent in the August Harvard-Harris poll.

Even in Kaepernick’s lengthy press conference last year, it was a bit unclear what the goals of the protest action are, or what it would take to declare victory and cease protesting. At that press conference, Kaepernick unfortunately wore a T-shirt of photos commemorating Malcolm X meeting Fidel Castro. As the better half wrote last year:

The biggest problem here is that Kaepernick is seemingly unaware of Castro’s legacy. Aside from Castro dragooning and executing Christians and gays, Castro’s record on racial justice is decidedly not ‘woke’, as the Internet likes to say. While Cuba’s legacy of racism predates Castro, it’s safe to say overt racism against individuals of African ancestry there remains far more pronounced than it is in the United States. In fact, racism is kind of an unstated official policy.

In other Kaepernick fashion news, he also wore socks with pictures of pigs dressed like police officers. In any case, if the goal was an end to police brutality against black men, the movement seems to have gone off the rails a bit. Surely lack of awareness is not the problem regarding police officers and the killing of unarmed black men. What is the protest movement accomplishing other than increasing opposition to Black Lives Matter and bothering fans?

2. The NFL’s Utter Inconsistency

Goodell and NFL owners were adamant this weekend that players had the right to express themselves without fear of any retaliation. This even though there are rules that the NFL could apply to stop protests of the national anthem. Yet, as David Marcus wrote last year:

After the tragic murders of five Dallas police officers in July, the Dallas Cowboys asked the NFL if players could wear a decal on their helmets commemorating the officers’ sacrifice. In this case, the NFL did not support its players when they wanted to see change in society. When the Cowboys wanted to send the message that police officers should not be hunted and assassinated, the NFL gave a clear answer: no.

There were rules the NFL chose to apply to stop the wearing of decals to commemorate the murder of five Dallas police officers working to protect the people at an organized protest of police brutality.

The NFL fines players for dancing in the end zone. It threatens fines for 9/11 tributes. It shows leniency for other issues, such as domestic violence, but it needs to show more consistency about on-field behavior.

3. The Terms of Debate Couldn’t Be Worse For the NFL

The media were thrilled by the protests on Sunday, which they perceived to be against Trump. But the way many Americans viewed these protests was not nearly so favorable as it was to people in New York and DC newsrooms.

Some of the national anthem protesters took their knees before a game in London, on foreign soil. The players followed that by standing for “God Save The Queen.” If you don’t know what’s problematic with that show of respect for a foreign country’s anthem while protesting your own on foreign soil, I doubt it could be explained to you.

For many people, in part because of the vagueness of the protest goals, these national anthem knees simply come off like people being jerks about the national anthem because they don’t like Trump. Which, it turns out, is not a great way to get the public on one’s side.

As president-elect, Trump proposed jail for flag-burners. We barely remember the outrage cycle that ensued on the part of the media, because in fact punishment for flag burning is far more popular than people in newsrooms realize. In his rally, Trump positioned himself, and his supporters, on the side of the flag and patriotism. This wasn’t difficult for him to do, because many Americans have been viewing these as protests against a country they love.

For the NFL owners to take the bait and up the ante was not the wisest response to Trump’s rhetoric on Friday.

4. The NFL Can’t Afford the Struggle

The NFL is facing a ratings slide, with much less fan engagement than they’d like. While many of the league’s problems have nothing to do with politics, the anthem protests are causing some problems, according to a July CBS Sports story:

According to a recent survey from J.D. Power, national anthem protests that originated with Colin Kaepernick led a list of reasons people tuned out of NFL games last season. The poll consisted of 9,200 people who attended a football, basketball or hockey game, and asked them if they tuned into fewer games and why. Per the poll, 26 percent of viewers cited the protests as the reason. Coming in second, 24 percent said that it was because of the league’s off-field image issues, such as domestic abuse, and general game delays, such as penalties. Twenty percent said that it was because of excessive commercials…

The league also faces problems with the high levels of brain injury players face:

Frontline reported on numbers from the Department of Veterans Affairs and Boston University, where researchers studied the brains of 165 people who played football at the high school, college, or professional level. They found evidence of CTE in 131 of them—79 percent. Of the brains studied, 91 of them belonged to former NFL players, and 87 of those 91 (96 percent) had signs of CTE.

5. The Media Fan Flames, Stupidly

Another problem for the NFL is that a fight between celebrity football players and a celebrity president is ratings gold. So expect nonstop coverage that inflames the issue in a way that benefits the activist extremes and the president, but few other people.

Journalists went to their favorite Trump line of attack:

Yes, because if there is one thing that we know about Trump, it’s that he never criticizes any white people. He is not known for insulting Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, Ted Cruz, John McCain, Hillary Clinton, or Megyn Kelly. Nosiree.

There are so many legitimate lines of critique against President Trump, including that he sure seems to pick culture war battles when he’s failing politically. Or that it’s untoward for a president to weigh in on employment and speech issues, though recently we seem to have presidents who do just that. Even on that score, the media tend to be ignorant of any problem associated with the immediate past president, as some of these exchanges indicated:

Imagine a very religious group of Catholic nuns called the Little Sisters of the Poor had to engage in a costly seven-year legal battle to keep the Obama administration from forcing them to pay for abortions against their conscience or pay fines that would end their work. Imagine that. It shouldn’t be difficult to imagine since they’re still waging this battle on account of onerous regulatory mandates from the Obama administration. Of course, this violation of First Amendment freedoms didn’t include a cuss word, so I guess it’s less newsworthy.

The president is exploiting fan disappointment with the NFL and a general public dissatisfaction with divisive protests that lack clear goals. Despite the fame and wealth of players and owners, the NFL is not as well positioned here as its media defenders seem to think.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/09/25/5-problems-with-the-nfls-national-anthem-protest/,2017-09-25
NFL Protests Are The Dead End Of ‘Resistance’ Culture,"At a rally on Friday, President Trump said that the NFL should fire any players who copy Colin Kaepernick by going down on one knee when our national anthem is played. So this Sunday, dozens of NFL players dutifully responded by going down on one knee to show their “resistance” to Trump.

That’s where we are with the stupid politics of the “Resistance.” All that is necessary to decide the right thing to do is to check on what Donald Trump says and do the opposite.

One NFL player very conspicuously didn’t go down on one knee. While the rest of the Pittsburgh Steelers stayed inside the locker room during the anthem—management’s attempt to dodge the controversial issue—Alejandro Villanueva insisted on going out and standing, hand over heart as we were all taught to do. Why? Villaneuva is a former Army Ranger who graduated from West Point and did three tours of duty in Afghanistan, fighting terrorists so the rest of us can be safe.

I would say that Trump outsmarted the Resistance, but that doesn’t seem to take much work. The Resistance has framed the issue so cleverly that they are on one side and Trump is on the other—along with the national anthem, the flag, and military veterans.

The whole idea of “taking the knee” began, from what I can gather, as a way for a mid-grade quarterback to sulk about being benched. Then it turned, supposedly, into a symbolic protest against the injustice of police gunning down innocent black men. This was originally in response to the “hands up don’t shoot” narrative about the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri—a narrative that was comprehensively debunked by the Department of Justice civil-rights task force the Obama administration sent to Ferguson.

But we all know that the narrative takes on a life of its own, never mind the facts. So going down one knee during the anthem was taken up as a symbol of protest against supposed police racism. It was an ill-conceived form of protest, bound to backfire. The symbolism is all wrong. By its very nature, it does not come across to most Americans as a protest against excessive use of force by the police. It comes across as a protest against the national anthem. And since the national anthem is, well, our national anthem, it comes across as a protest against America.

The message is supposed to be “I’m protesting injustice,” but it turns into “I’m protesting injustice, which I equate with America itself.” It is the petulant demand that everyone else fall in line with the protesters’ exact political preferences and their vague political program—I haven’t found anybody who can tell me what concrete measures would convince the knee-takers to stand up again—or else they will refuse to love their own country.

For a fairly large core of those on the Left, this message is deliberate. They have long sought to use racism as their excuse to indict the entire American system as irredeemably evil, in order to justify tearing it down. When I started pushing people on Twitter to tell me what the protests are all about, I got a lot of this back: about how the national anthem is “nationalistic and bombastic,” America has not merely been indicted but “convicted beyond a reasonable doubt,” and we all need to be deprived of the pleasure of “guilt-free sports.”

This is how they have turned the protests into an attack on the game of football, the one area we’re all supposed to be able to put aside our disagreements on politics and instead disagree about which team we should be rooting for. This protest is perfectly designed to break the fans of every football team into warring camps. Even worse, it divides the fans (and players) along racial lines. It takes a social institution that usually unites Americans of all races and creeds and turns it into an engine of racial conflict—in the name of progress!

If anybody thinks this is going to hurt Trump with the people who voted him into office, then this is going to be a long eight years.

If you want an idea of how this is going over, observe fans booing the Patriots players who kneeled for the anthem. Or observe that NASCAR immediately announced it would fire any driver or crew member who kneels for the anthem. They know that for their audience patriotism is non-negotiable, and it would be death for their sport to let faddish protests start up there.

Why does the Left always augur in this kind of self-destructive protest? It begins with how they defined themselves as the “Resistance,” which caused them to stop asking whether something is right and only to ask whether Trump is for or against it. So if he comes out in favor of God and country and the anthem and the flag and football and mom and apple pie, then the Resistance has to be against all of those things.

What if you don’t go along with them? Well, if you’re not in the Resistance than you’re a collaborator and you must be the racist enemy, too. That’s how we go from a disgruntled quarterback taking the knee, to dozens of players taking the knee, to an inquisition in which every player will be required to take the knee. That’s what’s coming next. People are already demanding that all other players join the kneelers. #TakeTheKnee ends up sounding a whole lot like #BendTheKnee, a demand for obedience to the Left’s anti-American pageantry.

To give you an idea of how far the Resistance has disappeared up its own backside, several prominent left-leaning figures are now suggesting that “The kneel will now become a sign of opposition to Trump.” But kneeling, of course, is an ancient sign of submission, not resistance. So you get suggestions like this, and I honestly can’t tell whether it was meant ironically or not.

That’s what happens when blind, unthinking opposition become more important to you than actual principles and good sense. You end up resisting Trump so much that people kneel before him wherever he goes.

The tragedy is that these protests actually undermine the possibility of anything being done about the very issue they are supposedly drawing our attention to. The problem of police shootings and excessive use of force has been overhyped, but it is real. (Think Philando Castile, not Michael Brown.) But it’s a problem where people on both sides have been sold simplistic solutions. A real, detailed debate on how to maintain law and order and keep crime low while also reducing the risk of wrongful police shootings would be dull but profitable. Letting the issue be dominated by a partisan protest culture virtually ensures that nothing of value will be done.

So congratulations, Resistance fighters. You’re going to get Trump re-elected, while preventing progress on the big issue you claim to care about. But, hey, at least you got to show us how woke your eight-year-old is.

What The NFL Could Learn From MLK And The Civil Rights Protests,"At this point, it seems there is one obvious rule for opponents of President Trump: Don’t take the bait. Somehow the president is able to create (or insert himself in) controversies the media stokes that outrage the Left.

This has two important practical effects. One, it forces ordinary citizens to choose sides against the left-leaning cultural and political establishments that are Trump’s bête noire. Two, it changes the discussion so we’re not talking about Trump’s substantive failures. (How’s health-care reform coming? North Korea?)

Sure enough, after Trump remarks this weekend about how players who won’t stand for the national anthem should be fired, all anyone wants to talk about is the National Football League. Naturally, a large number of NFL players reacted negatively and made a big show of protesting the national anthem Sunday. NFL ratings, which were already sliding over previous years, fared even worse this weekend as a result.

Even better, Trump’s favorite punching bag—the media—once again showed how they don’t understand that, for better and for worse, using the national anthem as a focal point for political protest is not an issue that goes over well with much of America.

Lemme guess: Hillary carried your current home county by more than Obama did? https://t.co/jbjGDGCgMw — Brad Todd (@BradOnMessage) September 24, 2017

Further, the media didn’t exactly go on offense when the last president embraced the same divisive tactics in calling out his political enemies. Sure, Obama wasn’t so crass as to call them a “son of a b—ch” on national TV, but maybe passing legislation forcing nuns to pay for birth control or claiming there was not a “smidgen of corruption” when the Internal Revenue Service actively admitted to targeting conservative groups was substantively worse.

https://twitter.com/davidharsanyi/status/912104574974140416

Nonetheless, there are some important lessons here, about the value of political protest and how it should be conducted, being lost in the culture war. These could not only make what NFL players are doing (and related protests against racial injustice) more effective, but help the country come together. They would also hamstring Trump’s ability to distract from more substantive problems. All it requires is learning the lessons from the last era of successful protest.

Before the counterculture of the late 1960s turned American political protests into a contradictory spectacle of unchecked individualism and radical leftism, the civil rights protests led by Martin Luther King Jr. were a case study in disciplined political campaigning. While systemic racism obviously remains a serious problem, the protests of the ’50s and early to mid-’60s were wildly successful in achieving tangible progress. I regret to say that what’s going on in the NFL is destined to agitate rather than accomplish, because no one seems to have learned the lessons of civil rights protests.

1. Have a Clear Message and Goal

The civil rights movement worked hard on messaging. In 1963, they brought in broad coalitions and had negotiations for what goals they wanted to push for. By the time the March on Washington occurred that year, anyone following the event could clearly discern two messages that were intentionally chosen: Better jobs for African-Americans, and laws codifying civil rights protections. The landmark Civil Rights Act was passed into law less than a year later.

Can someone tell me what NFL players are trying to achieve here? Some sort of generalized awareness of ongoing racism? What are ordinary Americans supposed to do in response to this display? Are they offering a goal we can all agree on or debate the merits of? No one has any idea. So this protest, in the absence of a clearly defined point, looks like millionaire athletes throwing a tantrum, no matter how incredibly important the issue animating them is.

2. Embrace Patriotism, American Ideals, and Inclusivity

From the beginning of King’s “I have a dream” speech, we see it is a call to live up to American ideals. “When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir,” MLK said. “This note was a promise that all men – yes, black men as well as white men – would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”

Rhetorically, King was appealing to patriotism. He is clearly saying if you believe in the principles laid out in the Declaration and the Constitution, you can’t tolerate racial injustice—a message as true today as it was then. One of the lessons of the civil rights movement is that appealing to patriotism and American values is an effective route to moving public opinion.

Further, while it was obvious that the focal point was justice for black Americans, the message was that addressing racism was an issue of coming together: “When we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, ‘Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!’”

Now, taking a knee can be seen as a respectful gesture, nor is it necessarily announcing you reject American values. But it’s also doing literally the opposite of what you are supposed to do during the national anthem—stand. People unavoidably see it as disrespectful. Drawing attention to yourself and your cause at the one time we come together to collectively express our patriotism and shared American values is going to be unavoidably be seen as unpatriotic. That actively repels people instead of appealing to commonly held political values.

3. Optics and Unity Matter

Even though there were 150,000 people at the March on Washington, it was an incredibly staged event. You couldn’t just show up. People were told where to stand. They were dressed in their Sunday best. Any signs were pre-made or had pre-approved messages.

An interview with Lucy Barber, author of “Marching on Washington,” in The Believer described the effect of the March on Washington this way:

The imagery of that march was also carefully planned. It showed demonstrators how to use the press. It’s mostly forgotten, Barber says, that Martin Luther King delivered his famous speech on a weekday. Pointedly, a work day. Though the speech had the tone of a sermon, specifically of Moses, it did not come on a Sunday. It interrupted business. Prior protests had often been parades, with spectators. But in the face of the march, government employees were sent home. The resulting symbolism everyone now knows from high school textbooks. It surpasses what even the wiliest Carvilles and Roves might conjure today: a Southern Baptist preacher giving a sermon to a crowd in a white marble city, with Abraham Lincoln behind him and the capitol in front of him.

Contrast that with what happened this weekend in the NFL. The Pittsburgh Steelers tried to enforce total unity by keeping the entire team off the sidelines. That’s a lot to ask, given the charged nature of this protest. Instead, Alejandro Villanueva stepped out as the lone Steelers player to place his hand over his heart and say the national anthem, resulting in easily the most iconic image of the weekend. It turns out Villanueva is a West Point grad and an Army Ranger captain who did three tours in Afghanistan and won a bronze star.

By the way, Steelers coach Mike Tomlin has since criticized Villanueva for not refusing sing the national anthem. Good luck criticizing an American hero for singing the national Anthem, Mike.

4. Have an Unimpeachable Movement Leader

Scolds and racists often point to MLK Jr.’s personal failings, but there’s a reason we have a national holiday in the man’s honor. He was motivated by honoring his Christian convictions and driven by a belief in a better America. He dedicated his entire life to the cause of civil rights. And he advocated nonviolence even as Southern police were turning dogs and firehoses on him and fellow civil rights advocates.

That the NFL protests were started by Kaepernick means having to defend Kaepernick’s vision of America, which so far amounts to taking a second look at communism and denigrating cops.

Somehow all of these NFL protests got started by a mediocre quarterback who wasn’t terribly articulate about what role something as comparatively frivolous as professional football had in rectifying racial injustice, all bound up in an inextricable discussion of whether this social justice posturing was helping or hurting Colin Kaepernick’s career.

Then Kaepernick showed up at a press conference to discuss all this wearing a T-shirt depicting the famous photo of Malcom X meeting Fidel Castro. (Cuba, by the way, is all but officially racist and is in no position to be lecturing America on race relations.) Kaepernick got grilled by a reporter from the Miami Herald over the shirt last fall. It didn’t go well. This wasn’t long after Kaepernick was seen at practice wearing socks depicting cops as pigs.

Now I think most Americans are willing to entertain the idea that bad cops are a source of racial injustice, but it’s also true that bad cops are putting their life on the line to protect us every day. Also, recall that the NFL refused to allow the Cowboys to honor the five cops who were slain at a Black Lives Matter protest last year.

Inevitably, the fact the NFL protests were started by Kaepernick means having to defend Kaepernick’s vision of America, which so far, amounts to taking a second look at communism and denigrating cops. No wonder Villanueva was quick to distance himself from Kaepernick when asked about him last year:

I agree that America is not perfect. I agree that there are a lot of issues with minorities in this country. And I agree that we should do something about it. But I don’t know if the most effective way is to sit down when the National Anthem of a country that has provided you freedom and is providing you $60 million a year is the best way to do it, when there are black minorities that are dying in Iraq and Afghanistan that are protecting our freedom for less than $20,000 a year. So, it’s his decision. Obviously he has brought up the issue in a great way, but I think if he encourages other players or other people in the stands to sit down, it’s going to send the wrong message. And I think he has to be a little more careful and look at the big picture of the things that he is doing, because as a service member, I have to understand it. …

“I will stand very proudly, and I will sing every single line in the National Anthem every single time I hear it,” said Villanueva. “I will stop whatever I am doing, because I recognize that I have to be very thankful to be in this country… I tell my teammates all the time, especially when they talk about contracts, I am one of the cheapest left tackles in the NFL. I always tell everybody, just by being an American, I’ve won three lotteries.”

Now take a guess which football player has the number-one selling jersey in America after last weekend? Hint: It’s not Colin Kaepernick.

5. Partisanship Is a Trap to Avoid

In the early 1960s, it would have been really easy to take a look at what Southern Democrats were doing to enforce racist policies and decide to declare war on the Democratic Party writ large for not repudiating the part of their coalition enabling racism. But since civil rights advocates viewed political progress as an important goal, they didn’t do that. “The big sticking point for that march was jobs. What is a good job? The other was: Are the Democrats our friend?,” notes Barber.

For this or any other real progress to happen, you’d need an organized civil rights movement with clear goals that respects American values.

Instead, a Democratic president, Lyndon Johnson, would sign the Civil Rights Act into law and later pass his Great Society legislation ostensibly to address racial injustice. Within a decade, the Democratic Party would start to realign and renounce racism.

Now there’s no question that much of the NFL protests Sunday were specifically in response to Donald Trump. Whatever you think of Trump’s racial rhetoric, both in tone and substance, there’s a good argument to be made that it has been unnecessarily divisive.

But I don’t believe MLK and the canny civil rights leaders of yore would have thought Trump a lost cause politically, even if they found him personally offensive. Trump has shown he’s willing to deal with people at opposite ends of the political spectrum, especially when it gets him good press. If Trump could burnish his legacy and reputation with new measures on civil rights—and there’s actual room for bipartisan consensus here on issues such as education reform, economic initiatives for black communities, and federal oversight of police shootings—aren’t the odds pretty good he’d jump at the chance?

But for this or any other real progress to happen, you’d need an organized civil rights movement with clear goals that respects American values. Instead, what we have is NFL players on the literal and metaphorical sidelines. In the face of such ineffective opposition, it sure looks like President Trump won a clear cultural and political victory attacking the NFL this weekend.

When multiple people floated this idea on Twitter a few days ago, I thought at first it must be some kind of sardonic joke. But the Left is actually following through on it. They’re going to show their defiance of Trump by kneeling before his officials as if they’re the viceroys of an absolute monarch. This has got to be the worst “Resistance” ever.

For years, Democrats have written books and attended conferences where they tell each other that they can win every issue by “framing” it properly, setting up just the right symbolism and hitting just the right emotional chords to herd people over to their positions. Yet they are now demonstrating no ability to frame anything properly. Consider the past week.

They wanted to protest “police brutality” and chose an approach immediately interpreted by more than half of the intended audience as a show of disrespect for the national anthem. That interpretation wasn’t just pulled out of a hat. Anyone who thought about it for five minutes would have grasped the danger of this ill-conceived symbolism—or anyone who listened to what Colin Kaepernick actually said when he started the kneeling craze: “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.”

As I put it recently, these geniuses of symbolism have “framed the issue so cleverly that they are on one side and Trump is on the other—along with the national anthem, the flag, and military veterans.” Now they want to show their “Resistance” to Trump by choosing a symbol universally associated with submission and fealty. That’s not just as a historical matter. In recent popular culture, kneeling or bending the knee has been used in precisely this way. In “Game of Thrones“:

In “Superman”:

In “The Avengers”:

I hereby declare this political opposition to be mentally incompetent and unable to manage its own affairs. I’m not just concern trolling here. I opposed Trump from the beginning and still criticize him very harshly. You can look it up. Yet his main political opposition keeps acting as if they want him to be president for life.

The problem is that they are so devoted to the dogmas of their own ideological in-group that they cannot bring themselves to even check on what anybody else thinks or take it seriously when somebody tells them how their latest brave protest is going over with the public. For example, the latest cover of Sports Illustrated proclaims that the kneeling protests have “united” the field of sports.

THIS WEEK’S COVER: In a nation divided, the sports world is coming together https://t.co/aONQ0a141s pic.twitter.com/rvuXVmiHq7 — Sports Illustrated (@SInow) September 26, 2017

They got what they were asking for with that, because they were immediately criticized for leaving Kaepernick, the one who started this protest, out of their lineup of united athletes. But they also left out Alejandro Villanueva and all the other players who chose to stand for the anthem. And they definitely left out NFL fans. Lifelong fans and stadium workers are walking away over this.

When actually asked, 64 percent of NFL fans say they want players to stand for the anthem. What about NASCAR, which has announced its intention to fire anyone who takes a knee? Is NASCAR not a sport? I’m open to that argument, but Sports Illustrated has frequently covered racing as a sport. Yet they apparently didn’t bother to include NASCAR and its fans in their delusion about the “uniting” of sports.

What makes them think everyone is so united? Because the people in the Sports Illustrated office back in Manhattan are all united on the issue, and they don’t really want to hear from anyone else.

I figured this out when I did a video interview for a Sports Illustrated special with the very nuanced and carefully neutral title, “Trump Versus Sports.” What struck me about the discussion before my segment is how everyone in that office—way up on the 60th floor somewhere, with Manhattan spread out below them—really seemed to think that we’re all having a really great conversation about race and policing because of this. But it’s a conversation they’re having with themselves. They somehow forgot that a conversation is supposed to have two sides and that maybe they should listen to the other one.

The thing that struck me after my segment is how resistant they all were to anyone bearing the message that people outside of their bubble are not having the same conversation and don’t see the protests the same way. There are big, obvious reasons normal people would view refusing to stand for the anthem as a sign of disrespect for the country. Anyone paying attention to the reaction of viewers and fans would decide to rethink this form of protest and find some other way to make his point. But for years, the Left has trained itself in the habit of assuming that the only reason anyone disagrees with them is because of racism. As a consequence, those who live in this bubble tend to reflexively dismiss anyone who brings them a contrary message from the outside world.

Their ideology and the groupthink of their closed-in peer groups insists that they show contempt for the very country and the very people they’re supposed to be winning to their side. That’s how they can use basic symbols with such apparent incompetence and be out of step with at least half the country and still convince themselves that they’ve reached a consensus. The result is that this political opposition is failing, badly, and we’re going to need another one.

"No, Sports Illustrated, National Anthem Protests Are Not A Sign Of Unity","The latest Sports Illustrated cover is about athletes’ national anthem protests, and it reads: “In a nation divided, the sports world is coming together.”

Sorry, SI. The only thing that came together in the sports world was the Internet’s disapproval of the magazine’s cover—from its artwork to unrealistic message of cohesion—among fans who followed NFL games on Sunday. In an attempt to defend the cover, executive editor Steve Cannella explained the reasoning behind it.

“What we wanted to capture with this cover, yes the news of the weekend,” Cannella said. “Yes, this was a weekend of division in many ways…but we thought the enduring message of what we saw, especially in the NFL, was this enduring message of unity.”

The cover doesn’t even come close to adequately reflecting that. For starters, it photoshopped together athletes from several different leagues, diffusing any specific focus on the NFL. Furthermore, many of the pictured athletes have zero real-life connections.

Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett headline the back row of the photo. Scan to the next row of athletes, and you’ll find two coaches: Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan next to Steve Kerr. Completing the randomness of the photo, a WNBA and MLB player are also thrown side by side.

The most prominent line of stars includes LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers, Steph Curry of the Golden State Warriors and…Roger Goodell. Yes, the commissioner of the National Football League is seen locking arms with Curry, former MVP of the National Basketball League. Um, what.

We’re Unified against Half of America?

First, let’s consider the ethics. Curry and Goodell have nothing to do with each other. If we’re going to define “unity” as taking personal offense to President Trump’s tweets, than allow Rosie O’Donnell to serve as a welcoming committee for the multi-millionaire club so out of touch with everyday Americans.

Sure, LeBron, arguably the most famous basketball player on the planet, took a swipe at Trump on Twitter calling him a “bum.” It’s newsworthy, particularly to a sports publication such as Sports Illustrated. But what does that have to do with the NFL?

Short answer: nothing. It’s a conflation of athletes and coaches in a unified anti-Trump message the magazine appears to endorse. If that’s their position, fine. Media pandering isn’t a new revelation. In a business reliant on social media traffic (doesn’t matter if it’s good or bad), ratings, and clickbait, outlets favoring either side of the political aisle have been known to amplify what helps their interests.

However, the real story of the week as it pertained to sports involved more nuanced details about Trump, the NFL, and anthem protests. At one point during the weekend, the president had tweeted about the NFL 18 times in comparison to North Korea, which received only two presidential tweets. This is what the cover of arguably the most pre-eminent sports magazine needed to convey, while addressing the fact that the NFL world was anything but unified.

We’re So Unified We’ll Suppress Dissent

Former Army Ranger and current Steeler offensive tackle Alejandro Villanueva broke from his team’s plan of standing hidden in the stadium tunnel, away from the field, during the national anthem. Overnight, his became the top-selling jersey in the NFL.

Yet after the game, head coach Mike Tomlin threw subtle shade at Villaneuva, telling the media he was looking for “100 percent participation.” Teammate James Harrison was quoted as saying, “We thought we were all in attention with the same agreement, obviously…but, I guess we weren’t.”

Either by his own volition or from internal pressure from the team, Villanueva addressed reporters the following day and said, “I made coach (Mike) Tomlin look bad, and that is my fault and my fault only.”

Sadly, this is where the PC culture has taken us. A former Army Ranger who’s served three tours in Afghanistan to protect this country had to apologize because he stood for the national anthem separate from his boycotting team. The only apology owed should be to Villaneuva, and the only knees taken should be in prayer and gratitude that brave, selfless men like Villaneuva serve our country.

How did the sports world possibly come together when the same thing that turned Villanueva into a viral sensation and heroic icon for the majority of consumers of the NFL is the same thing—whether players admit it or not—that caused Villaneuva to express public regret the next day? It’s the very antithesis of coming together.

What We Really Need Unified Is the NFL’s Policies

Another example of the supposed unity in sports is Denver Broncos defensive end Derek Wolfe. He posted a picture on Instagram of himself standing for Sunday’s anthem alongside teammates who were kneeling. The caption read, “Tough loss today. Even tougher when you are being labeled a racist for loving our country and paying tribute to the fallen.”

Then there are the everyday Americans, many reading this article, which chose not to watch the games on Sunday. Count this writer as one.

After 15 years of watching and reporting on the NFL, I did not watch Sunday’s games. Not as a boycott, but as an individual expression, like the dissenting players, to not give my viewership. It’s an immeasurable drop in the bucket to total ratings. But when 64 percent of the country agrees with Trump’s stance on standing for the anthem, according to a recent poll by the Remington Research Group, you have to wonder if that drop becomes a draining well for the league.

We all have our First Amendment rights as Americans, but the majority of us can’t just start a protest at work. That usually ends in one way: the unemployment line. The NFL needs to come up with a uniform policy about protests and freedom of expression, or else stop fining players for celebrating touchdowns. Otherwise, it’s just political.

People can claim NFL protests aren’t about the American flag and use verbal gymnastics to hammer that point. But when the flag is used in a protest, there’s no avoiding its significance to the people who hold that symbol in a different esteem. The sports world was anything but cohesive. Suggesting it was only distorts the truth and further magnifies division among the American people.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/09/27/sports-illustrated-wrong-national-anthem-protests-not-sign-unity/,2017-09-27
Dale Earnhardt Jr. Is Wrong To Call Protests On Company Time A ‘Right’,"Racing giant Dale Earnhardt Jr. jumped into the political fray this week by posting a tweet opposing NASCAR owners who said they’d fire any employees who kneel during the national anthem.

All Americans R granted rights 2 peaceful protests

Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable-JFK — Dale Earnhardt Jr. (@DaleJr) September 25, 2017

Hundreds of thousands liked his tweet, praising him for pushing back against NASCAR’s “racism” and defying owners who echoed Donald Trump’s call for the National Football League to fire players who disrespect the flag. One of those owners was racing hall of famer Richard Childress, who has been an Earnhardt car owner for years. He said any protest will “get you a ride on a Greyhound bus.”

“Anybody that works for me should respect the country we live in,” he told the Associated Press. “So many people gave their lives for it. This is America.” Owner and fellow Hall of Fame driver Richard Petty agreed, saying any protester who works for him will be fired.

Here’s the problem: Earnhardt’s tweet, and the love-fest that followed, encapsulates everything that’s wrong with these protests. No one has the “right” to protest on his company’s time. The people who are protesting aren’t victims of anything, and many aren’t doing anything to actually help those who have legitimate complaints.

You Got It All Wrong, Dale

Their protest, which focuses on the United States as represented by the flag and the national anthem, dishonors every American, especially if they’re white. These protests should outrage all law-abiding Americans because it collectively—and individually—makes them guilty for something they have not done. Finally, there’s no “revolution” because there’s no “oppression.”

Earnhardt’s quotation of John F. Kennedy is so inappropriate within this context, it’s laughable. Kennedy said this during an economic speech in 1962 directed at Latin America—countries that did not value the principles of freedom and liberty that the United States of America represents, however imperfectly. The president was challenging all “American” nations in the Western Hemisphere to join with the United States to establish democracies that can flourish and influence the world for liberty and equality. The presupposition to Kennedy’s speech was one of American pride and the United States as the shining example other nations should follow.

The quote also speaks to the rights of people to protest without being bullied, intimidated, or stopped by the government. This quote has nothing to do with employers telling employees what they can and cannot do on company time. When Earnhardt or anyone else protests during a national anthem at an athletic event, he is stealing time from his employer. That time is not his own. He is being paid to do a job, not to protest. The same is true for all other athletes who want to protest when they should be abiding by the dictates of their employers.

Here’s a lesson for those too immature or narcissistic to grasp it on their own: When you are at work, you don’t have the right to do, say, or wear anything you want. You have contracted your time to another person or to a group, and it is your responsibility to do what they have required of you. It is perfectly within their rights as employers to say that they will fire anyone who does something they forbid on their time.

Yes, This Protest Is Against The United States

As for the protests themselves, the popular liberal talking point is that they’re not protesting the flag or disrespecting the nation. But this doesn’t make any sense. If they’re not kneeling in opposition to America as a nation, why are they choosing to protest during a time that honors the USA?

If they are really protesting abuses by cops, then they should go on their own time to particular police departments that have transgressed in this way and protest there. Find those who have been specifically victimized and help them directly, instead of engaging in a collectivist agitation campaign to make all black people in America victims and all whites perpetrators.

The fact is, these protestors don’t want to deal with individual issues. They want the collectivist frame because it perpetuates their grievances, creates division between people who are neither victims nor perpetrators, and advances their leftist ideology rather than dealing with real problems. If they were really concerned about police violations, they would deal with each individually and leave it at that.

The reason they don’t is if they actually looked at this individualistically instead of collectively they would have to admit that United States’ “racism” is not systemic. Collective responsibility, action, victimization, and guilt would go out the window. A few departments that have civil rights violations don’t compare to the thousands that don’t. The few police officers who have wrongly shot black people compared to the hundreds of thousands who haven’t does not translate into a racist criminal justice system. Old racist Joe down the street doesn’t mean all of America is racist.

Let’s Unite, Not Divide, Around Real Solutions

If these very wealthy athletes really believe there are injustices on the streets of America, they should empower real victims with real solutions. Maybe set up a legal fund for any poor black person who thinks his or her civil rights have been violated so he or she can take it to the courts. We do have actual laws in this country that protect everyone’s rights, you know—and, yes, they’re enforced. This is something nations that are truly racist don’t have. Maybe these self-indulgent athletes should visit those nations for some much-needed perspective.

The nearly 400,000 people or bots who liked Earnhardt’s tweet and those who praise football players for hiding in locker rooms or kneeling during our nation’s anthem should be ashamed of themselves, of their ignorance, their divisiveness, and their hate. They are praising the disruption of employee-employer relations, the disruption of individual Americans finding solutions for the betterment of all, and the disruption of entertainment that should be bringing us together rather than tearing us apart.

Instead of giving into groupthink and labeling fellow Americans racists at the drop of the hat, let’s honor our nation for the beacon of freedom it is. Instead of protesting faux mass abuses created in the minds of community agitators, root out the real ones and deal with them one by one—not as a blind collective.

Only then will we have peace. I can assure you of one thing: while it’s true that we can prevent violence by making peaceful revolutions possible, allowing—and encouraging—“revolutions” rooted in lies, slander, and scapegoating will incite violence.

Why Quietly Listening May Be Wiser Than Raucous Protest,"The Catholic Church provides a three-year rotation for Sunday scripture readings. The rotation allows the faithful to hear the same readings at regular intervals, applying the lessons from familiar biblical passages to the changing times and seasons.

So it happened that, one weekend last month, I went to church and heard a reading from the first book of Kings, one in which the Lord instructs Elijah to go outside on Mount Horeb and await God’s passage. The reading resonated with me for its relevance in our current climate—one dominated by noise and shouting rather than deliberation and contemplation.

For instance, compare and contrast just a few recent incidents with the biblical passage from Kings. At Howard University last week, a group of protestors shouted throughout a speech given former FBI Director James Comey, despite pleas from other attendees and administrators to allow Comey to speak uninterrupted.

A strong and heavy wind was rending the mountains

and crushing rocks before the LORD—

but the LORD was not in the wind.

NFL games across the country became the scene of protests and booing, as players’ reactions to the national anthem and President Trump’s related comments almost eclipsed on-the-field activities.

After the wind there was an earthquake—

but the LORD was not in the earthquake.

At my alma mater, The American University, an incident where individuals hung Confederate flag posters around campus on the same night as a speech on racial equality prompted a statement from the student government referencing the nation’s “history of white supremacy,” as if recalling the sins of past generations—too numerous to count—would cause boorish and offensively provocative behavior to cease.

After the earthquake there was fire—

but the LORD was not in the fire.

So many of our current culture wars center around symbols—flags, anthems, ceremonies. But almost by definition, symbols carry different meanings to different people. A Confederate flag that symbolizes ancestral heritage to some symbolizes a system of racial oppression and exploitation to others.

The repeated, and seemingly intensifying, conflicts over these symbols stem not just from disparate definitions of what they mean, but a growing sense of disempowerment, disillusionment, and even alienation, numerous groups feel—from each other, and from the country as a whole. From Black Lives Matter to the white working class, the burgeoning protest movements and last November’s “primal scream” election illustrate how alienated segments of society believe amplifying their tone will allow them to regain power taken from them.

But as the reading from Kings reminds us, wisdom does not always lie with the loudest and strongest. It requires us to listen to discern its voice:

After the fire there was a tiny whispering sound.

When he heard this,

Elijah hid his face in his cloak

and went and stood at the entrance of the cave.

Lost in last weekend’s debate about football protests lies a simple question: If NFL players, faced with the prospect of suspensions or other costly sanctions, all suddenly decide to stand at attention for the national anthem, what exactly have critics of the anthem protests achieved? Would those players have suddenly changed their opinions of the police, the military, or the judicial system? Likewise, if the gay rights movement wins court rulings requiring bakers to make cakes for same-sex weddings, would such a move ensure the entire country “approves” of gay marriage?

Groups’ sense of alienation might prompt them to seek the imprimatur of a sanctioning body—whether NFL owners or a court of law—to demonstrate theirs as the “official” or “correct” position. But while sanctioning bodies might be able, given enough force, to impact behavior, no sanctioning body can ultimately change one’s beliefs.

That’s where the lesson from Kings comes in. Changing others’ beliefs involves listening for the whisper amidst the wind, the earthquakes, and the fire—the modern noise that has coarsened our debate. It requires understanding the sense of concern, or even disillusionment, that may have prompted the protests in the first place. It involves seeing others as they are, not as we wish they would be.

Listening isn’t always easy, but it is worthwhile. I won’t claim perfection on this front—far from it. But over the past week, I’ve run into some more diverse perspectives on the health-care debate, which is my professional specialty. In several cases, they’ve imparted factual knowledge, and while they haven’t necessarily changed my beliefs, they have modified my perspective and allowed me to see things from a different light.

At times, the cacophony of voices on Twitter, cable news, and in myriad other cultural venues might prompt us to wonder if anyone can make sense of it all, and maintain that inner peace. The story of Elijah on Horeb reminds us that wisdom and understanding remain always present in our lives—if only we search hard enough to find them.

"America, Your Campuses Are Madhouses. Why Are We Paying For This?","Several recent demonstrations at various colleges across the country illustrate nicely the incoherent temper-tantrum style of politics that currently dominates campus life.

At the University of Oregon, the school’s president was delivering his yearly State of the University address when student protesters stormed the stage babbling about “neo-Nazis” and “fascism.” They chanted things like “shame.” One student announced: “Expect resistance to anyone who opposes us.” The protestors needn’t have worried about any opposition: the school cancelled the president’s speech and beat a hasty retreat.

At Virginia Tech late last month, protesters showed up at that president’s State of the University address as well, accusing him of employing a “white supremacist,” chanting “Nazis get off our campus” and “No Nazis! No KKK! No Fascist USA!” When the president attempted to keep speaking, protesters “shouted over him and threw tiny white pieces of paper containing information on the [alleged white supremacist] employee.”

At the University of California at Berkeley, a group of students disrupted a professor’s class and read a manifesto of grievances, demanding that the professor offer a take-home exam instead of the in-class one. “Our well-beings are being put on the line because of our emotional, mental and physical stress,” one student announced. The protestors harangued the class, dismissing one student as a “white boy with privilege” and interrupting the professor as he tried to reason with them. When the professor asked that the students let him finish, they fired back: “We’ve let you finish forever, from day one.”

These Are Our ‘Top’ Universities, Folks

At Columbia, students interrupted the class of a professor, claiming Columbia is “endangered” by the instructor, who is also a Title IX sexual harassment administrator. The students accused the professor of “making Columbia inaccessible to survivors of violence,” claiming she was responsible for “Columbia’s culture of sexual harassment.” A video of the event shows the professor attempting to engage the students, informing them she would speak to them after the class was over; the students ignored her.

At the College of William and Mary, Black Lives Matter protestors interrupted a talk being given by an American Civil Liberties Union representative. The talk, ironically enough, was about free speech. The students stormed the stage and drowned out the speaker. School officials quickly handed the protesters a microphone; the group read a prepared statement and subsequently prevented anyone from speaking to the ACLU representative. The school promptly cancelled the event.

At Southern Texas University, a state representative was giving a speech to the campus chapter of the Federalist Society when Black Lives Matter protesters stormed the event, protested it with chants and accusations of racism, and accusing the representative of being a member of the Ku Klux Klan.

At Michigan State University, a speech by political scientist Charles Murray was hijacked by protesters who accused him of white supremacy and sexism. One agitator mounted the stage to hold an informal debate with Murray. Another protester told Murray: “You are killing us!” A student group attempted to shut the event down, though they were ultimately unsuccessful.

Two Common Threads Throughout

All of these protests and disruptions have two things in common. The first is a student body that is increasingly fanatical, irrational, unhinged, and dynamic in the worst way possible. Just a few short years ago, even the most militant and zealous student-activists needed some sort of catalyst to muster the energy to protest. Today’s protester students—bored, underworked, overly stimulated by progressive media, and convinced they are living in a social carbon-copy of Montgomery, Alabama, circa 1962—cannot be bothered with all that waiting. If they can’t find something real to protest, they’ll make it up.

The second common feature to these protests is no less pervasive but far more frightening: college administrations who, through their own obsequious cowardice, have become utterly powerless against the activists running amok on their campuses.

This is not a problem of mere optics. On the more active and tumultuous campuses, presidents, chancellors, and professors are seemingly determined to fold before student protesters. At Evergreen State College earlier this year, the president of that school kowtowed to the demands of perhaps the most viciously ignorant and anti-rational student mob of the last few years. At the University of California at Santa Cruz, the administration acquiesced to every demand made by the university’s African/Black Student Alliance (the A/BSA subsequently made more demands and implied they’d hold more aggressive protests if the additional demands weren’t met).

In the spring, American University granted student demands to bar white students from a campus cafe. Meanwhile, the list of speakers whom colleges have cancelled because students were afraid of feeling “unsafe” is too numerous to count.

Cowardice Encourages Violence and Madness

It cannot be an easy job, working at a college in an age of shrieking college hysterics. One must always be prepared for a new histrionic outburst from one’s student body: in particular, presidents and chancellors are doubtlessly worried that their offices will be subject to “sit-ins” and other throwback protests, all because their university doesn’t have enough deputy vice administrators of Super-Duper LGBTQIXIT Diversity Outreach.

But college officials are not supposed to be cowards. They are supposed to be above the kind of babbling insanity that has gripped campuses nationwide. College administrators should be responsive to their students’ needs and desires, but that kind of responsiveness does not naturally extend to the fawning subservience we see on so many campuses today.

There are a great many college students who have a whole lot of growing up to do. There are also a great many college administrators who have to stop ingratiating themselves to insane, sometimes violent student mobs. The former are unlikely to change if the latter continue treating them like inviolable gods on campus.

Here is a gentle tip for the nominal adults nominally in charge of American campuses: if your students disrupt a scheduled event, or storm the stage of a school function, or take a classroom hostage (particularly on an exam day!), do not give in to them. Instead, have security escort them out immediately. If they resist, arrest them. If they persist, expel them.

Putting one’s foot down will not be easy or pleasant. But it is necessary—unless you wish to surrender your campuses and careers to mindless, fanatical zealots.

"With NFL Protests, Trump And Pence Prove The Right Can Win The Culture Wars","The left wanted to mix politics with sports right up until last Sunday, when Vice President Mike Pence left an Indianapolis Colts game at the sight of the kneeling players on both sides (the San Francisco 49ers are the most kneel-happy team in the league).

For years, sports media has enjoyed injecting politics into sports, but they didn’t seem to like Pence doing the same. Which suggests that their priority was never about covering the intersection of sports and politics, as they claimed, but rather the intersection of their politics and sports.

Sports fans, in large number, think of sports as solely entertainment and largely unifying. Sure, you may be a Clemson grad who hates all things Gamecocks, but for the most part, sports are what brings communities together for high school football, colleges together during NCAA Tournament runs, and diverse cities and entire regions together for pro sports success.

Everyone enjoys an inspiring story, and sports are chock-full of them. It can be the most uplifting part of your newspaper.

What disrupts our enjoyment of sports is divisiveness, but sports media has had no time for that complaint in recent years. This was another realm of culture to claim, so they’ve made things and more political, even against its better interests.

Sports Media Have Disdained Their Audience

In 2013, the National Journal studied 200,000 interviews and charted what sports fans liked, how they leaned politically, how many fans liked a certain sport, and how likely those fans were to vote.

The sports that skewed left were the WNBA, pro tennis, the NBA, soccer, pro wrestling, horse racing, UFC, and extreme sports. Only the NBA ranks among America’s most-watched sports.

Two were right on the line of bipartisanship: motocross and grand-am road racing (I don’t know what that is, and don’t care to look it up).

All other sports skewed right: the NFL, the MLB (the closest to the bipartisan line all these), college football, college basketball, NASCAR, rodeo, bull riding, drag racing, pro golf, IndyCary, high school sports, and the Olympics.

It would be wise to take this information into consideration, right? Maybe not preach liberal politics to right-leaning sports fans, particularly at a time when we’re more divided than ever? Sadly, many in sports media have done the exact opposite.

They’ve roundly mocked their own audience when asked to “stick to sports.” They reference Jackie Robinson and Muhammad Ali as shining examples of the good that happens when athletes don’t stick to sports (isn’t it odd they rarely offer examples from the last 35 years?).

Seth Davis allegedly covers college basketball for The Athletic. Last March, college basketball’s most important month, his Twitter timeline was full of anti-Trump tweets and his profile picture was an image of Obama.

I followed him for a few weeks, ready for daily updates on all the bubble teams. But he was busy scolding his followers. His account now proudly declares he “doesn’t stick to sports.”

Why Sports Writers Are Drawn To Politics

You go to work and follow sports on the side, but sports media has it reversed, naturally: sports is work. So following politics becomes many writer’s most enjoyable side hobby.

Any chance to weave the two together is a win for sports media. It’s a ticket to more clicks, more airtime, more front pages, and more relevance.

If your local NFL team wins Sunday, that story be on the front page of the sports section. If they kneel, that same writer might get a story on A1. TV is much the same. Sports is the first thing cut on local TV when the weatherman goes over time.

There’s also more money to be made with politics: Keith Olbermann was a popular SportsCenter host, but made more money talking politics. Jemele Hill’s recent controversy and suspension all but guarantees her next gig will be at MSNBC or CNN, and she’ll get a nice pay raise with that.

Many sports journalists got into the business hoping to cover their own Ali, but those don’t come every decade. For years, they kept wanting to pull the star athletes into the political realm, but were refused (most notably by Michael Jordan’s “Republicans buy sneakers too” quip).

As things got more polarized in the latter years of George W. Bush’s presidency, efforts to find a star athlete who fit the leftist media’s cause were scrapped. If you started with the cause, you could find another vessel to weave sports and leftist politics together.

Here’s a few examples:

Gun control: When Kansas City Chiefs player Jovan Belcher killed his girlfriend and then himself, NBC’s Bob Costas dedicated his halftime monologue for a Sunday Night NFL game to gun control (and not domestic violence, which is something both left and right have rallied against in pro sports).

LGBT causes: Sports fans may not care if their sports figures are gay or straight, but the media has been trying to make them care. When former NBA player John Amaechi came out as gay, the search was on for an active gay player. Jason Collins was that guy, and later Michael Sam, and perhaps both were newsworthy—an organic intersection of sports and politics.But now our U.S. Women’s Soccer Team are wearing rainbow jerseys for gay pride, the NCAA is pulling events out of states that dare challenge the unpopular transgender agenda, and a sports blog dedicated to LGBT causes, called OutSports, wonders whether Tim Tebow is gay. And who could forget ESPN naming Caitlyn Jenner its sportsperson of the year, ahead of a college basketball player who played with terminal cancer?

Black Lives Matter: Colin Kaepernick sat for the National Anthem, then kneeled, and sports media did the rest, plunging headfirst into #KneelingAnthemChallenge wall-to-wall coverage. CBSsports.com has an entire section of its website titled “Anthem Protests.”

It was overkill. And now it seems to have backfired.

Through Trump, the Right Is Striking Back

As much as right-leaning sports fans begged the sports media to stop, they were mostly powerless, and sports media knew it.

“You’ll still watch,” they said, smugly. They were right, but only for a while.

Sports media erred in two ways: one, they didn’t see the long game. Two, they thought that the right would never get involved and try to promote its own brand of sports and politics.

ESPN has learned the hard way. They’ve lost many subscribers due to cord-cutting, and many sports fans have grown to dislike the first channel that was made for just them. The Ringer’s Bryan Curtis has a good article on the falling out of ESPN’s popularity.

NFL ratings went up the week Donald Trump attacked anthem protests; perhaps people were tuning in to see how the NFL would respond. When a record number of players sat, knelt, stretched or stayed in the locker room for the anthem, fans tuned out. The next two weeks of ratings show it.

NFL Sunday Ticket cancellations were so plentiful, DirecTV offered full refunds (a smart long-term play to get those fans to pay next year, should the NFL succeed in quashing the anthem protests).

Trump and Pence’s willingness to join the fray is unprecedented. At first, I was against it. After all, I don’t like politics in my sports. I was being consistent.

But now that the NFL is backing down, and sports media are freaking out about Pence getting involved, I have to sit back and look at this differently. Pence and Trump didn’t start this battle. But they may have won the biggest current-day culture war in sports, and it only took a few months of their first football season in office.

If sports and politics are going to be joined at the hip, there might as well be some of my politics in there as well.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/10/13/nfl-protests-prove-the-right-can-win-culture-wars-after-all/,2017-10-13
"Colin Kaepernick’s Worst Enemy Isn’t NFL Owners Or Trump, It’s Himself","Colin Kaepernick is arguably the most talked-about quarterback in the NFL despite being removed from it since last season. Now that the free agent has filed a collective bargaining grievance against the NFL, arguing team owners colluded among themselves and with President Trump to keep him unemployed, Kaepernick’s relevance to the game won’t fade any time soon.

Kaepernick became a household name outside of football when, as a San Francisco 49er, he began kneeling for the national anthem in August 2016. When first asked about it, Kaepernick said, “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.”

Other players quickly followed in Kaepernick’s footsteps, and the gesture has since polarized the country in both sports and politics. Leftist activists galvanized support behind Kaepernick, while conservative fans continue to view the protest as disrespect to the flag and U.S. armed services.

Yes, It’s About the Flag. Kaepernick Even Said So

No matter how much Kaepernick supporters argue their protest has nothing to do with the flag, Kaepernick explicitly said otherwise. You can’t use the flag in a demonstration, speak negatively about the flag, then expect people to accept the flag has nothing to do with your protest. Furthermore, the NFL can’t truly honor the military in November with their Salute to Service campaign while its players kneel for a flag our service members wear on their uniforms and fight to protect.

These points of dissention, among others, reached such a fever pitch that even President Trump responded to the controversy, demanding NFL owners force their players to stand. Kaepernick’s grievance filing referenced Trump’s comments, asserting “NFL and NFL Team Owners have colluded to deprive Mr. Kaepernick of employment rights in retaliation for Mr. Kaepernick’s leadership and advocacy for equality and social justice and his bringing awareness to peculiar institutions still undermining racial equality in the United States…and in response to coercion and calculated coordination from the Executive Branch of the United States government.”

On Sunday night Kaepernick’s attorney Mark Geragos posted a statement on Twitter.

“If the NFL (as well as all professional sports leagues) is to remain a meritocracy, then principled and peaceful political protest — which the owners themselves made great theater imitating weeks ago — should not be punished,” Geragos wrote. “Athletes should not be denied employment based on partisan political provocation by the executive branch of our government. Such a precedent threatens all patriotic Americans and harkens back to our darkest days as a nation.”

The NFL players’ union said it would support the grievance, which was filed through the arbitration system that’s part of the league’s collective bargaining agreement.

Collusion Wasn’t Needed to Decide Not to Hire Kaepernick

First it’s important to understand what collusion means. In sports, collusion occurs when multiple teams, or at least one team and the league, collaborate in depriving a player of a contractually earned right. This right is stated in the collective bargaining agreement, specifically in Article 17, signed by both the players’ association and the league. Essentially, a group of teams cannot hinder a free agent’s right for negotiation in a conspiracy to deny that player an opportunity to sign somewhere.

As former Major League Baseball slugger Barry Bonds figured out, collusion is extremely difficult to prove since it relies on—go figure—proof. In 2009, Bonds, still a capable hitter, tried unsuccessfully to sign with a team for the league minimum. Bonds also struggled defensively and at the time faced felony charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. It took six years, but an arbitrator finally ruled that even if Bonds’ theory was correct, he lacked sufficient evidence to support his claim.

Kaepernick’s case includes specific examples of teams in need of a quarterback that had reasons to avoid him separate from anthem protests. When Miami’s starting quarterback went down, the team signed Jay Cutler . Besides the fact that Cutler and Dolphins head coach Adam Gase had worked together in the past, there was one other thing: Kaepernick’s blatant ignorance about former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.

In a press conference last year, Kaepernick wore a shirt depicting conversations between Castro and Malcolm X. He defended the shirt because of Malcom X’s “open mind to be willing to hear different aspects of people’s views.” Here’s a view, Kaepernick. It’s hypocritical to launch a protest arguing systemic oppression as you make a lifelong systemic oppressor a fashion statement. Oh, and by the way, Miami has the largest Cuban-American population of all U.S. metropolitan areas. It’s entirely within an owner’s right to not want to offend a large demographic of his fans.

Here’s another example of Kaepernick keeping himself out of the league and not owners: An inflammatory meme Kaepernick’s girlfriend, Nessa Diab, posted about Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti. When Ravens QB Joe Flacco dealt with injury earlier in the season, talk circulated that perhaps the Ravens might give Kaepernick a shot. At one point in the preseason, Bisciotti said they were “keeping the door open” to the possibility of Kaepernick.

Yet in Article 1, Section 14 of Kaepernick’s grievance, his attorney wrote, “NFL General Managers and team leaders have referred to directives from NFL owners to not let Mr. Kaepernick so much as practice with a team.” That’s blatantly not true, according to Bisciotti’s public comments, and again winning a collusion suit requires proof.

Furthermore, Diab, a nationally syndicated radio personality who has dated Kaepernick for about two years, pretty much sabotaged his possibility with the Ravens. She posted an image of former Raven Ray Lewis embracing Bisciotti over a screen grab of a scene in “Django Unchained” where a house slave played by Samuel L. Jackson hugs his racist master, played by Leonardo DiCaprio.

It seems very plausible that an NFL owner would not enjoy slave owner comparisons. It’s bad for business and a personal offense—hardly the best tactic for someone wanting another job.

Trump Doesn’t Have to Collude to Persuade

Everything with Kaepernick’s case for collusion relies on evidence, and simply pointing a finger at President Trump’s remarks, as the grievance does several times, won’t cut it either. The grievance makes big claims without providing evidence about collusion between Trump and owners, such as these: “The owners of Respondent NFL Teams have been quoted describing their communications with President Trump, who has been an organizing force in the collusion among team owners in their conduct towards Mr. Kaepernick and other NFL players. Owners have described the Trump Administration as causing paradigm shifts in their views toward NFL players.”

Let’s consider for a moment whether Trump’s remarks instilled apprehension in some owners. Even if so, that hardly proves teams gathered in conspiracy against Kaepernick. Let the absurdity of this sink in: Kaepernick is arguing the president of the United States is colluding against him, using comments made at a senator’s campaign rally as justification. The only accusation missing from Kaepernick’s filing is that Vladimir Putin was responsible for Kaepernick’s decision to opt out of a guaranteed contract with the 49ers worth $14.5 million.

Moreover, Kaepernick chose to take a political stand both in his protest at work and in commentary on his social media platforms. He planted himself firmly in political commentary, yet somehow questions why those in politics have discussed him. If a team believes political divisiveness may harm a locker room or bring unwanted attention (which signing Kaepernick inevitably would do), then why invite that mess over another quarterback?

Kaepernick Isn’t a Top-Shelf Quarterback, Either

In the grievance under factual background, Kaepernick’s lawyer claims, “Mr. Kaepernick continued to perform as a top tier quarterback while playing for the 49ers.” The grievance also asserts “Based on his consistently exceptional career performance, his age, and all other objective metrics, Mr. Kaepernick was an ideal candidate—and, in fact, the best-qualified candidate—to fill the vacant starting quarterback positions on many NFL teams, or at the very least, the numerous vacant backup positions…It is no longer a statistical anomaly but instead a statistical impossibility that Mr. Kaepernick has not been employed or permitted to try out for any NFL team since the initiation of his free agency period.”

It’s entirely within an owner’s prerogative to choose a player without baggage, a player who won’t detract from their starting QB and team cohesiveness.

This simply is not true. Kaepernick’s completion percentage in the last two seasons was ranked 32nd in the league, his total quarterback rating (QBR) 31st. He lost his starting job to Blaine Gabbert, a current backup quarterback for the Arizona Cardinals. At 29 years old and with statistics last season that were average at best, Kaepernick simply isn’t good enough to warrant media distraction.

Sure, the NFL has signed plenty of players with questionable pasts and moral indiscretions. But if the reward outweighs the risk on the football field, owners and general managers tend to take that gamble. In Kaepernick’s case, his mediocre numbers and struggles as a traditional pocket-passer quarterback simply haven’t been worth it.

Various teams did sign quarterbacks without any legal or moral issues but with less than impressive resumes, most as backups. Kaepernick’s grievance tries to argue this is proof of collusion: “NFL teams who ran offensive systems favorable to Mr. Kaepernick’s style of play instead employed retired quarterbacks or quarterbacks who had not played in a regular season game in years, and signed them to significant contracts while prohibiting Mr. Kaepernick from even trying out or interviewing for those jobs.”

That’s because teams in search of a backup are looking for someone to simply plug in behind their star quarterback, a.k.a. someone without a media circus in tow. It’s entirely within an owner’s prerogative to choose a player without baggage, a player who won’t detract from their starting QB and team cohesiveness. Even Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy publicly told reporters that, in his opinion, Kaepernick wasn’t “good enough” for the attention. So is a fellow NFL player now a part of owner collusion too? No, and therein lies another obstacle in this grievance.

Here’s the best part about the Kaepernick saga. News of his grievance filing broke the same day Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers went down with a broken collarbone. If Kaepernick had kept his primary focus on football rather than keeping himself in the public eye, perhaps his agent would have received a phone call from Green Bay. Instead, Kaepernick faces a difficult case to win and an even harder uphill battle if it goes to federal court.

How Catholics Can Get Protestants Back To Their Reformation Roots,"The central theological battle of the Reformation was the doctrine of justification. The question was basic: How are we saved? For the reformers, justification was an objective event: the sinner is declared righteous on account of Christ’s work and stands righteous before God through Christ. The only subjective contribution is passive, receptive faith.

Christ’s incarnation drives this extra nos (external, objective, “outside of us”) aspect of justification. Just as flesh avails God to us extra nos in the person of Christ—such that a leper who needed healing went to something outside himself contoured by a flesh and blood body (Christ)—so also in Christ’s mystical body, the church, is salvation contoured in those extra nos gifts founding the church: the sacraments and preached word.

Grace in this context is sheer gift. The incarnation guides this aspect of grace as well. If Christ is extra nos, contoured by a body distinct from me, I know where Christ ends and I begin. He alone is holy; I am a sinner needing mercy. He gives; I receive. Whatever Christ has, I possess by sheer gift. My posture is passive, like Mary responding to Gabriel’s promise, “Let it be to me according to your word.”

The Roman Catholic position, argued the Protestants, ratified monasticism’s optimism about what man could do to cooperate with God in his salvation. The issue goes back to Augustine’s battle with Alexandrian theology and its heirs in the monastic movement, typified by Augustine’s nemesis, fourth-century British monk Pelagius. Monasticism tends toward mysticism and extreme asceticism, both of which suggest optimism about what man can contribute toward his salvation. The protestors accused Rome of semi-Pelagianism.

The “semi” is because Roman Catholic theology also centers on grace, but sees grace as a substance working renewal in the justified person. If Reformation doctrine emphasizes Christ as an extra nos savior saving the incapacitated sinner by sheer gift, the Roman Catholic position emphasizes Christ as an example to follow, guiding the grace-infused sinner so he can contribute to salvation by “faith working through love.”

The irony is, in worship the Roman Catholic Church lives out what is described above as the Reformation position. Meanwhile, many of the heirs of the Reformation could not worship more out of line with the Reformation doctrine of justification. Let’s flesh this out.

How Liturgical Worship Arises from Justification

The Roman Catholic Church will never dispense with the Mass. It can’t. Mass is the historical liturgical service centered in the Eucharist. Confirmed that Christ is bodily present in holy communion, no Roman Catholic goes through a week without invitation to that mystery of the incarnation. Christ is present in church not as some spiritual energy possessing the souls of individuals through the shamanistic skills of a good preacher, but in his flesh and blood presence in the sacrament. He’s a gift external to the suppliant. Christ and suppliant are distinct, and the Mass works communion between the two.

Christ’s bodily presence in worship compels particular elements of the liturgy. If Christ sits at the right hand of the Father but is bodily present at the altar, then the right hand of the Father is at the altar. Heaven is on earth. A cloud of saints and angels mystically gathers at the altar.

So, if these angels celebrate the return of sinners to Christ (Luke 15:10), then a truly biblical worship would partake in whatever the angels are singing in heaven. We get two examples of what they’re eternally singing in the Bible, the “Holy, Holy, Holy” (Sanctus) and the “Gloria in Excelsis,” both of which appear in the liturgy. These elements testify that we stand righteous before God in heaven. Or consider the Kyrie (the “Lord, have mercy”). If we are in Christ’s bodily presence like a leper in Jesus’ day, we can’t do better than to utter the prayer Jesus declared to be “great faith,” which had a happy ending every time it was uttered.

Finally, consider how incense testifies to the real presence of a resurrected body buried in spices. As the smell of spices would announce the bodily presence of him who spent three days immersed in them, so does that same smell announce the presence of that same body in church today. Couple this with the idea that our prayers ascend like incense to the Father through the one that smells like spices, and you get a thousand diamond refractions’ worth of beautiful theology going on as the incense embraces the congregation.

We could go on and on with all the elements of the liturgy, but here’s the point: this liturgical picture exactly portrays the Reformation doctrine of justification. Sinners are brought into the presence of God, beseech his mercy, and by declaration (absolution) and imputation of Christ’s righteousness in the sacraments, they stand righteous before the throne of God, evidenced by the heavenly banquet they enjoy in his presence with all the angels. It’s all quite literal and objective, because the formal elements of the historic liturgy testify to literal and objective things, namely, our justification before God in Christ.

Formal Worship from a Formal Savior

There’s something else to consider going back to that extra nos nature of Christ’s gifts. Liturgical worship is formal worship. It’s formal because Christ himself is a “formal” savior, having taken “the form of a servant,” and being formally present in the church. He’s not some abstracted psychic energy or archetype, as the Gnostics taught.

The formal elements of worship, rooted as they are in the gospel, remind us that the faith of the church is really the faith of Christ established extra nos. The faith of the church is distinct from me, yet it calls me to partake. Again, there’s no fuzzy line where Christ ends and I begin. Christ’s faith is put on my lips extra nos, from a formal and external worship. It’s not conjured up by my faculties of emotion, intelligence, or will, although it certainly triggers reactions in these human faculties.

The “Our Father” is illustrative. It powerfully states the Christian faith. We can only pray “Our Father” through the only-begotten Son who became man, for only this man has reclaimed that holy status in the image of God lost by Adam. Christ alone is holy, says the liturgy itself, and only through him are we worthy to stand in God’s presence and call him “Father.”

Christ has wrapped us in his humanity, imputing his righteousness to us through baptism and communion as a gift of our justification. Crying out “Abba Father” or “Our Father” is a true working of the Holy Spirit, working in us Christ’s status as God’s only-begotten Son, so that what he has by nature, we have by the grace of adoption.

The point is, we don’t do the “Our Father.” The “Our Father” does us! The Holy Spirit is working Christ’s faithful obedience as God’s Son in us. We ourselves may be tuning in and out of the prayer, going through the typical ups and downs of faith, but Christ is forever lodged at God’s right hand in perfect righteousness and holiness, grounding our own faith in his perfect faith. This is the glory of externalizing, and therefore formalizing, the elements of the liturgy. They don’t count on my human faculties to make them effective, but refer the operation of my faith to Christ and the Holy Spirit.

The seed analogy is helpful. A seed is external and distinct from the soil it’s planted in, but its entire mission is to, along with water, draw from inert soil and work it into living material. The soil contributes nothing, but is purely acted upon. There’s a reason Jesus uses the seed analogy more than any other to show how the kingdom of God works. Christ is the seed working through the liturgy. The water is baptism. We are the soil being shaped into the new man in a purely passive process.

The liturgy is like the bed the four men used to carry the lame man to Jesus. Jesus saw “their” faith and absolved the lame man. Similarly, through the liturgy of the church, my lameness is often carried through to Jesus by the church’s prayer, and on account of “their faith,” I am brought to a place where I too am absolved. This, by the way, is why infant baptism is easy to understand in liturgical churches and ultimately why it’s a non-negotiable for any non-Gnostic understanding of Christ and faith.

How Things Got Off Track

The Lutheran reformers declared, “the Mass is retained among us, and celebrated with the highest reverence.” They repeatedly affirmed their desire to continue the catholic traditions of worship, minus elements they believed corrupted it. Other Reformation churches followed suit to varying degrees. But several decades ago, it became fashionable in Protestant churches to gut the liturgy or dump it altogether.

In informal worship, the impulse is from inspiring music and rhetorical manipulation toward moral action, therapeutic frisson, or political activism.

Typically the first things to go were the angelic canticles. Congregations decided—through majority vote? Because the pastor felt God told him to? Because the worship team heard a cooler song on K-Love?—to veil the reality of our justification before God, that we stand before God surrounded by angels and their eternal song.

One by one, all the elements of the historic liturgy got dumped or replaced by cheesy substitutes, all of them snuffing out the existential reality of salvation, that we stand before God in the righteousness of Christ. This undermined the Reformation doctrine of justification. Protestant churches will claim a doctrinally correct view of justification—you can find it on their “What we believe” page at their website—but what the doctrine means has no bearing on their worship practices.

Unwittingly, Reformation churches were adopting the worship practices of the Radical Reformation, a millenarian movement predating the Reformation but piggybacking on it. The millenarians believed history was moving beyond the “Age of the Son” with its extra nos focus on church, ministry, and sacraments into a new “Age of the Spirit.” In this new age, the Spirit of God works not through a church, but more organically, in cooperation with man, resulting in purity, works of love, and establishing the kingdom of God on earth.

This move from the external and formal to the internal and informal has implications for worship. In formal worship, the impulse is away from my incapacitated self toward biblically framed formal elements defining communion with Christ. In informal worship, the impulse is from inspiring music and rhetorical manipulation toward moral action, therapeutic frisson, or political activism. Completely disconnected from any formal qualities, worship becomes purposely—philosophically, even—informal, testifying to the “outside of the box” ways in which the Spirit may work on any given individual. Again, as the millenarians taught us, we’ve moved to a freer age of the Spirit, a “spiritual but not religious” age.

This ‘whatever it takes’ segues nicely into that art of human manipulation: marketing.

Say what you want about this sort of worship, it’s popular and effective for the ends it seeks, precisely because it allows for whatever it takes to move people to action. This “whatever it takes” segues nicely into that art of human manipulation: marketing. Marketing is crafty enough to realize you have to rarefy social trends and reconstitute them in the products you sell. Such alchemy will guarantee the widest market and appeal at a gut level.

Protestant churches gobbled up the esoteric wisdom of marketing gurus in the 1980s, convinced their “church growth” business principles were precisely the “paradigm shift” needed to divert losses in the church. The problem was, that “paradigm shift” was a distinct move away from the historic understanding of the incarnation and justification. Meanwhile it embraced Gnostic spirituality, a spirituality rooted more in images and phantasms of a personalized Christ, constituted from the deconstructed fragments of my yearning, consuming self, shaped in the recesses of my inner self through the manipulations of emotive music and crafty dramaturgy.

This has resulted in several crises in Protestantism: loss of membership, odd upstart movements like the Emergent Church movement, and a loss of identity vis a vis politics (if your program is to establish the kingdom of God in America, you rapidly become a political progressive).

Why Non-liturgical Worship Leads to Progressive Politics

Moving from formal to informal worship has political implications. Paul Kleppnor’s book, “The Cross of Culture” (1970) provides a crucial data piece explaining how Pietism, Puritanism, and Hegelianism led to modern American progressivism. Surprisingly, he argues, it all boiled down to two worship orientations in the crucible of nineteenth-century American politics: a ritualistic one and a pietistic one (his words). The latter laid the foundation for the rise of American progressivism.

I’ll believe God’s using me to establish his kingdom on earth. These are the theological roots undergirding the political religion that is modern leftism.

On the ritualistic side were German and Irish immigrants—Lutherans and Catholics—who tended toward the Democratic Party, in part because it left them alone to practice their religion as they wanted. On the pietistic side were native-born Republicans, more aligned to millenarian, revivalistic theology, who believed it their Christian calling to impose holiness laws and their vision of Americanism—the new Israel, the kingdom of God on earth—on the ritualistic immigrants. (This is why to this day parochial schools tend to be Lutheran or Catholic; U.S. public schools were at first tools of Puritans and revivalists to impose their millenarian agenda. Some things never change.)

Why would divergent worship practices—formal versus informal—lead to divergent attitudes toward political involvement? It all goes back to the Reformation doctrine of justification. If Christ is extra nos, as he is in the liturgy, then he’s imputed on me as a gift from the outside. There’s no expectation I’ll be transformed into the likeness of God. I can’t. This is Christ’s show, and I remain distinct from him.

Also, recognizing my own incapacitation, I’ll never think humanity can be mustered to the cause of positive governance. If anything, government needs negative checks, as does human nature. No establishment of the kingdom of God on earth for a ritualist!

However, if God “leaks” out of Christ and the sacramental life of the church into me, I can imagine myself as the sacrament, as God’s incarnated presence effecting change in the world through my cooperation with God’s Spirit. I’ll believe God’s using me to establish his kingdom on earth. These are the theological roots undergirding the political religion that is modern leftism.

Where to Go from Here

The solution is to restore the Reformation doctrine of justification and live out the implications of that doctrine in worship. This means reestablishing the historical liturgical forms. Non-liturgical worship, like Radical Reformation theology, puts a demand on the self that is, quite frankly, exhausting. Liturgical worship, because it surrenders faith from self to something outside of me, is a break from the exhaustion.

Perry Miller brilliantly remarked that Puritanism took people off the treadmill of indulgences but put them on the iron couch of introspection. The historic doctrine of justification was not only the antidote to indulgences, but can also be an antidote to the tyranny of self today in the American culture begot by Puritanism and later by Hegelian Pietism, whose heirs in the modern leftist religion have been dealing with the frustrating paradoxes of their own idolization of self. A proper embrace of historic worship, which so beautifully acts out the doctrine of justification, is where the healing begins. Why? Because Christ is where the healing begins.

If Protestantism is to retain its central defining doctrinal characteristic, the justification of the believer, they will need to learn something from the Roman Catholics, and reestablish the Mass in its rightful spot along with all the other historic Christian confessions. Otherwise, its 500th anniversary this October 31, I fear, will be a one and done.

"Luther Didn’t Nail Up His 95 Theses, And Curious Reformation Day Facts","Millions are celebrating one young Augustinian monk’s consequential actions on this year’s 500th anniversary of the Reformation. Even those with no interest in the history of Christianity often know the story of the great Martin Luther and his revolutionary doings on October 31, 1517. Luther’s great protestant hammer detonated a bomb as it drove a nail into the rugged wooden door of Wittenberg’s main cathedral.

It was as if he were driving a spike right into the heart of a terribly corrupt religious system. Second only to the cross of Christ, this action divides Western history into before and after.

The results of this theology professor’s world-changing action are beyond dispute. What actually happened on what is celebrated as Reformation Day, however, is highly questionable. Simply put, it’s unlikely the door episode ever happened. It certainly didn’t happen as portrayed in popular history and classic paintings.

A serious new history, published this anniversary year by Richard Rex, professor of reformation history at Cambridge University, explains that “Bizarrely, there is almost no reliable evidence for this well-known story. There is no credible evidence that Luther actually went and nailed them to the church door that day, and every reason to believe he did not.”

In case one think Rex’s take is simply a revisionist version by a troublesome secularist, evangelical Eric Metaxas parallels Rex’s take precisely in his important new book on Luther. Nearly all serious Luther historians agree on this. The only posting Luther did that day was of two private letters to two bishops under whose authority he stood. Both were dated October 31, 1517. He went to bed that night never having taken up a hammer nor approached any church door with a document and nail.

What Was Inside Those Envelopes

These two envelopes contained his 95 theses and a very personal cover letter, warning the bishops of the abuse of indulgences by the perversely extravagant proto-television evangelist Johann Tetzel. Luther tells us how all this shook out, nicely relayed in a 2015 article in the journal Lutheran Quarterly.

Prior to that All Saint’s Day Eve, Luther told his readers, “I began to dissuade the people, urging that they not listen to the clamors of the indulgence hawkers and that they had better things to do.” Elsewhere he explained, “I began to preach very gently that one could probably do something better and more reliable than purchasing indulgences.” He was not full of thunder but simply being a dutiful pastor to the flock.

“Soon afterwards,” Luther recalled, “I wrote two letters, one to Albrecht the archbishop of Mainz … the other to … Jerome [Scultetus] the Bishop of Brandenburg.” Elsewhere he relayed, “I wrote a letter with the Theses to the bishop of Magdeburg [Albrecht], admonishing him to stop Tetzel and prevent this stupid thing from being preached, lest it might give rise to some unpleasantness.” He had every belief they would put an end to the problem.

Luther was merely following the chain of command over him with his concerns about Tetzel’s antics. In the parlance of today, he saw something and said something. Most importantly, he did so, not with a shred of boldness or indignation, but a jumbo helping of timidity. His letter to Albrecht was riddled with lap-dog praises, greeting Albrecht as my “most reverend Father … worthy of reverence, fear, and most gracious,” and Luther’s “Most Illustrious Prince.”

Luther contrasts himself mightily as “I, the dregs of humanity.” He meekly asks to be spared for having “so much boldness that I have dared to think of a letter to the height of your Sublimity,” and that the good archbishop might “deign to cast an eye upon one speck of dust, and for the sake of your pontifical clemency to heed my prayer.” Metaxas describes the letter as nothing less than “a model of cringing sycophancy.” This evidence shows the October 31 Luther as a purring kitten, while legend has him a roaring lion.

Attempts to Shush Him Up Later Awoke that Roaring Lion

His reformation spirit arose sometime later, and not in one historical incidence. It evolved over the coming weeks. Luther’s warning of Tetzel’s abuses was of no use. The scheme was greater than he had imagined, with Albrecht on the take, splitting the proceeds with the pope after giving Tetzel his hawker’s fee. Thus, Luther’s letters went unanswered, but Jerome did advise him to not rock the boat.

If his theses were ever posted publicly, it was likely due to being dissed by his authorities, which would have happened sometime later. It was never his original intention to make them public, but later he figured that was the logical next step. By Luther’s own telling, he was not an angry revolutionary, but merely trying to be a good son of the Catholic Church. No serious Luther scholars support the angry young hammer-wielding Reformation Day prophet scenario. It is pure myth. No single reforming action took place on October 31, 1517. He did not become a “protestant” on that day, although that certainly came later.

Nearly none of the infamous details of this mythical Wittenberg door tale are true, either. The document? If it happened at all, the posting would simply have been proposal for a theological debate among his peers on indulgences. It was certainly not calling for a revolution. Such invitations for debate were everyday business for professors and nothing worth noting in themselves. To use imagery from basketball, this would have merely been his call for an intramural pick-up game. The debate never happened. No one responded to the invite. This speaks to either the never-posted angle or that it didn’t cause any quake at the time if it had been posted. Curious indeed.

There Are Other Discrepancies with the Story

The famous door? This was not an instance of publicly speaking truth to power by taking his case directly to the main church in town for all to see. Various notices of general interest to the townspeople were posted on a church’s front door. That door served as the community bulletin board, as everyone passed them at least weekly.

These academic invitations also would not have been posted to only one door, the great Cathedral of Wittenberg. It was university policy that such invitations be posted on the doors of every church in the town of Wittenberg, which boasted at least six or more. The posting was not an event, but a mere administrative task.

What about the hammer and nail? The person posting the document was most likely armed with a brush and pot of glue, or a modest tack at best.

Who posted? This task was unlikely performed by an eminent professor, but likely the church or university custodian. Perhaps one of Luther’s students, but certainly not the good doctor himself.

Luther’s theses did indeed bring great thunder to the world, launching nothing short of a civilization-changing movement. No one disputes this, and it is well worth taking note of this 500th anniversary. However, it was not the sound of a hammer upon a door but the clackity-clacking of a new contraption called a printing press that was the detonation point.

A Mechanical Invention Breeds a Theological Revolution

Luther’s theses were printed and sold, without his knowledge or consent, by enterprising printers, their pamphlets spreading “throughout the whole of Germany inside two weeks” as Luther tells us. His work went totally viral before viral was cool, and Luther had little to do with it. The effects surprised him as much as it does any author today whose work blows up the Internet. Luther himself credited the opportunistic printing and distribution of his theses as “the first, real and fundamental beginnings of the ‘Lutheran uproar.’” Before this point, things were pretty quiet.

Although Luther never mentioned any posting on a door in Wittenberg, his faithful friend Melanchthon is credited with launching this famous scene. He explains that, with theses and hammer in hand, Luther “publically posted them at the Church which is next Wittenberg Castle on the eve of the feast of All Saints in the year 1517.” Melanchthon made this claim some years after Luther’s death, was not an eye-witness to the event, and his telling contrasts with Luther’s own.

What about the content of the 95 theses themselves? Where they an omnibus tour de force against the major theological and ecclesiastical problems with the Catholic Church and a call for salvations by grace alone? Not quite. At this point, his concern was solely with indulgences and the nature of true contrition, although the Lutheran agenda would certainly grow with time. (The theses are well worth reading for all interested in cultural literacy, an easy 95 sentence-long collection of statements.)

Luther Wasn’t a Lutheran, But a Catholic Reformer

Luther’s concerns at this stage did not seem to be so much with the use of indulgences themselves (see theses 28, 41, 44, and 49), but with them being sold in such a carnival-like and manipulative way. They were much more Catholic than most assume and many Reformed believers would be comfortable with. Luther scholar Timothy J. Wengert explains in his analysis of the theses how one contemporary reader complained that they “don’t sound very Lutheran at all.”

Indeed. This is because, at this stage in the game, young Luther didn’t consider himself anything more than a “reformist Catholic,” as one scholar put it in a recent Lutheran Quarterly essay. Most readers are also surprised to find the great protestant clearly accepts purgatory and the authority of the pope in his theses. This all changed soon enough. Luther’s boldness grew later the following year, starting his metamorphosis from friendly reformer to a prophetic protester. He certainly didn’t become a “Protestant,” much less a “Lutheran,” on All Saints Eve of 1517. If anything, that day was actually Moving-Toward-Reformation Day.

Why make a point of all this? Of course, none of the popular myths concerning Luther take anything away from the singular influence the man, not only on Christian faith and practice, but on nearly every other sphere of human culture: politics, economics and industry, education, distribution of the printed word, art, the status of women, and the nature and significance of marriage and the family, just to name a few. It’s simply impossible to construct a definitive list of his work’s total influence upon the world.

But the Reformation’s 500th anniversary is more faithfully honored when we replace the myths surrounding it with the facts told by the man himself.

3 Reasons Baseball Will Lose Big If National Anthem Protests Catch On,"Oakland As catcher Bruce Maxwell was arrested this weekend for aggravated assault after allegedly brandishing a gun at a food delivery woman who came to his house in Arizona. This comes during media attention he brought to himself last week when he claimed a restaurant in Alabama had refused to serve him: “He was like, ‘You’re the guy who took the knee? I voted for Trump and I stand for everything he stands for,’” Maxwell told TMZ.

His story didn’t ring true to a number of journalists, who researched the incident after his claims. Fox News reporters determined Maxwell dined with a prominent local Democratic politician, and other eyewitness testimony cast doubt on his story of discrimination.

“He’s outright lying,” waiter Matt Henry said, according to Fox News. Henry explained he was carding Maxwell’s companion, who wanted to order a beer but didn’t have a valid I.D. He told the man he was sorry, but Alabama law requires an I.D. to serve alcohol, and he couldn’t risk his job or criminal charges by serving the alcohol without seeing an I.D.

The restaurant manager confirmed his employee’s story, but Maxwell hasn’t backed down, reopening the discussion of his “take a knee” debacle this season. Maxwell is the only Major League Baseball player to refuse to stand for the national anthem from September 23 until the end of the season this year. His reasoning for kneeling diluted National Football League player Colin Kaepernick’s original message for disrespecting the national anthem, stating his gesture was for “just complete inequality of any man or woman that wants to stand for Their [sic] rights!” A quick glance at his Twitter timeline shows a strong disdain for President Trump and conservatives, further muddying any message he’s trying to convey with angry politics.

A Kaepernick Retread in MLB

Like Kaepernick, Maxwell’s statistics have not been impressive over the last season, with a batting average of only .237 and three home runs in what many are calling “The Year Of The Home Run” due to a change in ball composition, making them fly farther. As a consequence, it appears Maxwell has much more to gain in job security from kneeling than he has to lose.

The liberal sports media, especially in the San Francisco Bay area, gushed over his kneeling, and treated it as a heroic action. The Oakland As official statement said merely, “We support all our players’ constitutional rights and freedom of expression.”

So far, the As’ statement has been the stance of the MLB as well, though a claim of supporting free speech rings false to fans since Mariners’ catcher Steve Clevenger was suspended last season for criticizing Black Lives Matter, not on the field, but on his Twitter account. Some speech appears more equal than others, and it’s leading to trouble for the league, especially as Maxwell’s off-field behavior becomes increasingly erratic. When I spoke to the As’ ticket office regarding the anthem controversy, they said they’d received hundreds of phone calls and emails from fans voicing concern over Maxwell’s actions.

Fans should be concerned. The NFL is having a hard-enough time with their attendance and ratings drop from players’ on-field politics. If Maxwell’s grandstanding spreads to the rest of the MLB, baseball is at a much greater risk for its survival. This is due to three main reasons.

1. Baseball’s Identity Is Synonymous With America

Although football is very much an American sport, baseball is far more entwined with what it means to be an American. Baseball is called America’s pastime for a reason. Its unique rules tie into the American dream far better than any other professional entertainment. People from toddlers to grandparents can throw a ball and hit, giving anyone a dream of playing baseball akin to having a home with a white picket fence.

Very few times in our nation’s history have sports so eloquently summed up the American spirit as directly after 9/11, when the New York Mets thanked the first responders who worked on the scene in downtown New York City. The Mets’ solidarity with workers, police, and firefighters is still remembered more than 15 years later.

The team was also responsible for one of the most emotional moments in sports after 9/11, when, on their first return to the field after days of games cancelled for fear of terror threats, Mike Piazza hit a home run that received some of the loudest sustained cheers of all time.

“I remember looking up and praying to God, saying, ‘Lord, please give me the strength to get through this, because I don’t know if I can,’” he said in a documentary. “It’s amazing, when you’re in the right place and the right time, and you believe in yourself and you have a lot of people pulling for you, and you feel it.” The sentiment perfectly portrays what baseball means to America in both trying and good times.

Fans associate the national anthem with baseball far more than they do any other sport. MLB.com opined about the anthem on the song’s 200th anniversary in an article titled, “Star-Spangled Banner, baseball forever linked.” Sportswriter Doug Miller wrote, “Every year now, we’re treated to incredible musical talent on the baseball field. It’s now a grand American tradition to bring out the best in the business to sing ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ at the biggest baseball games.”

With such a rich history, disrespect for the song implies a deep disrespect for baseball itself. Such protests are prone to upset fans of this particular sport far more than others, and could lead to deep troubles for the MLB if the kneeling continues.

2. Attendance Still Hasn’t Recovered From the Strike

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, baseball seemed unstoppable. The level of fame players reached is akin to the level we see from NFL stars today. It all changed on August 22, 1994, when the players’ union called a strike. The World Series wasn’t played for the first time since 1904, and the effects on the sport were disastrous.

Fans saw the players as rich, entitled spoilsports who didn’t care about the game. It didn’t help when the media was reporting matters like superstar Jose Canseco being pulled over for driving 104 mph in his Porsche, specially modified to take jet fuel instead of regular gasoline. With optics like Canseco, the working American fan saw players’ protests as a frivolous money grab. Average attendance dropped by 20 percent, and television ratings dipped severely.

Although baseball’s viewership and attendance has been on a steady climb ever since, barring a slight dip in 2008-2009 with the recession, it still hasn’t reached levels of the pre-strike era. Seeing their heroes lapse into selfishness hurt fans.

The reason the strike cut so deeply is because fans identify with baseball players far more strongly than they do athletes of the NFL. There is a “that could be me” factor with baseball because it doesn’t have other sports’ perceived physical demands. When fans see these particular players acting disrespectfully, fans tune out more quickly—and they stay out as a consequence. If we see widespread protests of the national anthem, we might see another big drop in baseball’s viewership. With so many difficulties for small-market teams, a drop comparable to that after the players’ strike could bankrupt a good portion of the league.

3. Family Friendliness Is Part of Baseball’s Brand

Local news about the NFL regularly reports aggressive incidents or violence near football games. Just recently, a Raiders lineman had an altercation with an unruly fan in the parking lot after the game on October 9. The very next week, on NFL’s Thursday night Carolina Panthers game, an Internet video of two fans punching each other went viral. Football games are notorious for not being the safest places, but the aggressiveness and safety issues aren’t prevalent in baseball.

Baseball has a more family-friendly environment, with players much more prone to interact with kids in the stands during the game. If you’re seated in the front rows anywhere in the ballpark, there are typically lines of kids shouting to try to get a foul ball thrown in their direction. It’s a large part of the atmosphere and culture of baseball.

When children see players involved in these protests, it poses a difficult situation for parents, regardless of their political stances.

Like many sports, baseball suffered from a performance-enhancing drugs epidemic in the 1990s and 2000s. However, very few sports have been as adamant in testing and outing players or as harsh with their suspensions and penalties as the MLB. Many of the great players in the steroid era have not been admitted to the Hall of Fame because of their known drug use. The MLB does this because of their family-friendly culture, and the steroid epidemic caused a big problem for that carefully cultivated image. Every time a major star is caught with a substance, it’s something parents want to shelter their children from.

National anthem protests pose a similar problem. Families teach children to remove their caps and stand for the anthem, and it’s announced at the stadium before the song starts at each game. When children see players involved in these protests, it poses a difficult situation for parents, regardless of their political stances. They are forced to explain that either 1. Their children’s heroes are engaging in bad behavior, or 2. Mire children in toxic identity politics. It leaves one solution for parents: extricating their children from the ballpark in favor of other family-friendly entertainment.

If the MLB loses the families, it stands to lose a lot more than other sports would because of the way baseball has been so heavily marketed to children and families for more than 100 years. But it’s the combination of the three reasons above that spell severe danger for baseball if Maxwell’s anthem protests continue, or, worse, expand to other players.

Sports leagues have been reluctant to do anything that could be perceived as infringing upon players’ rights. It’s up to the league to protect fans and their game from on-field politics. The NBA reacted to the issue by sending a memo to teams reminding them a rule requires players to stand for the anthem. So far, there hasn’t been any sitting or kneeling during the games to cause basketball any problems.

The MLB is right not to address their anthem problem during this postseason, less they distract from the beauty of October baseball and a very exciting World Series. Having Maxwell in the news is already distracting enough to a very exciting Dodgers versus Astros match-up. However, the league must take similar action to the NBA during the coming offseason in order to protect America’s pastime from the kind of negative attention the NFL is receiving.

One back-up player causing a commotion does not make national waves in the world of baseball, but if it spreads, we could see a ratings and attendance devastation to the Major Leagues on far greater a level than we’ve seen to the NFL. A swift and decisive move from the league will show they care about the fans and this country, and keep America’s pastime a fun, family-friendly celebration of American culture for decades to come.

Kremlin-Linked 'Troll Farm' Organized Facebook Event To Protest Trump,"Days after Donald Trump won the presidential election in November 2016, thousands flocked to the streets of New York City to demonstrate against the president elect in a protest organized by a Kremlin-connected Facebook page called BlackMattersUS, The Hill reports. Between 5,000 and 10,000 people attended the protest organized by the Facebook page, which, according to an archived screen grab, had more than 99,000 likes.

“Join us in the streets! Stop Trump and his bigoted agenda!” the Facebook event page reads for the protest, which was called “Trump is NOT my President. March against Trump.” “Divided is the reason we just fell,” it reads. “We must unite despite our differences to stop HATE from ruling the land.”

BlackMattersUS hosted another event page to protest the Electoral College, called “One Person One Vote One March” to question the legitimacy of America’s democratic system.

As it turns out, BlackMattersUS is linked to Internet Research Agency (IRA), a so-called “troll farm” with connections to the Russian Kremlin that’s purchased 3,000 political ads and has been identified as operating 470 now-deleted Facebook accounts to push agitprop and sow discord among Americans, The Hill reported. IRA also used an Instagram account to push anti-Dakota-pipeline propaganda under the username @Native_Americans_United, The Daily Caller reported.

Facebook officials estimate content disseminated by IRA-run pages has reached 126 million Americans via the social network over the past couple of years. Top executives from tech companies including Facebook, Twitter, and Google are currently testifying before Congress about how foreign entities use their platforms to spread misinformation and propaganda.

In the wake of the 2016 election, much has been said about Russia’s influence in our public discourse, including hysterical claims from Democrats who allege such influence may have stolen an electoral victory from Hillary Clinton. The truth is, Russia’s interference cut both ways, as the “largest and most successful known effort” by a Kremlin-connected troll farm was to protest the man Democrats say may have colluded with Russian officials to beat his opponent.

“In the wake of the election and now President Trump’s election, we saw a lot of activity directed at fomenting discord about the validity of his election,” Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch said in response to a question from Sen. Lindsay Graham on Tuesday.

NFL Kneelers’ Biggest Problem Is That We’re All Bored With Their Protest,"The NFL’s national anthem kneelers have fallen into liberalism’s biggest trap, and finding Colin Kaepernick on the cover of GQ despite not having played a game in 324 days will not get them out.

The Left is inherently inclined to self-indulgent subjectivity that often alienates the majority they need to win over. Oblivious to this, NFL protestors have taken a knee on liberals’ most dangerous pitfall: Boring instead of persuading.

For an eleventh week, NFL players took to their knees during the national anthem. Although protests were down on Veterans Day weekend and have been decreasing, Thanksgiving offers a chance to reach a new and broader audience and perhaps reinvigorate an effort trending to rigor mortis. Perhaps the kneelers’ attention has followed America’s in wandering away. If so, they too have fallen victim to liberal activism’s existential threat: Boredom.

Saul Alinsky was the godfather of American leftist activism. In his protest primer, “Rules for Radicals,” he describes the Left’s ultimate peril. “I cannot repeat too often that a conflict that drags on too long becomes a drag…After a period of time it becomes monotonous, repetitive, an emotional treadmill, and worse than anything else a bore.” Forty years and 40 yard-lines later, the NFL kneelers have become a case study in Alinsky’s prescient warning.

Why Boredom Is Inherent to Liberal Activism

The risk of boredom is inherent to liberal activism because of its subjective, self-centered approach. It is the Left’s nature to proclaim a problem, but never an endpoint for a solution. Liberals simply take it as given that the vast majority of America must accept the Left’s premise and wait patiently.

The conundrum manifests itself throughout liberals’ agenda. How do we know when the planet will have been saved? When will affirmative-action programs have fulfilled their mission? What exactly constitutes a “living wage?”

Liberals’ amorphous agenda-to-infinity often leads to a muddle of one protest morphing into another with none ever really ending. Any of the Left’s protests can supply evidence of this, inevitably attracting aggrieved comrades until it resembles a Woodstock of Woe. The resulting common perception is that the Left are only happy when they protest. For the majority of America, such constancy quickly appears as futility and then becomes boredom.

Why Are We Doing This Again?

The NFL kneelers have captured—or rather, been captured by—this leftist predicament. Their muddle began at the beginning: Over what kneeling actually means. Kneelers currently say their action is not disrespectful. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell reiterated recently the action is not intended to be “disrespectful to the flag.” As he explained, the kneelers “will state to you, and they have stated to everyone publicly, they are not doing this in any way to be disrespectful to the flag.”

Goodell went on to say: “But they also understand how it’s being interpreted.” No unbiased observer, Goodell would love nothing more than to get his league out of the box kneelers have created for themselves and the league. So he parrots the kneelers’ line while ignoring the problem: It runs counter to the protest’s origins and common sense.

As every NFL fan knows, the kneeling protest began with Kaepernick. When asked last summer why he was kneeling, he was crystal clear. Speaking to NFL Media: “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.” Kaepernick was explicitly not standing because that he thought that equated to showing “pride in a flag.”

Kaepernick kneeled, then, to show the opposite. However, Kaepernick took it further than just a lack of pride in the flag, to also (and more importantly) a lack of pride in the country it represents. People do not respect what they do not have pride in. So his action intended to express that and visibly differentiate him from those tens of thousands standing around him showing pride in—and respect to—the flag, and thereby America.

So the rest of us are left to ponder the protest’s diametrically opposed contradictions. Are there different factions within it? Despite its originator plainly stating its intent and other kneelers copying him, does it mean different things to different kneelers?

Of Course They’re Protesting the Flag

Of course, the “no disrespect” excuse runs counter to common sense too. The flag is a symbol, as Kaepernick points out and all the kneelers know. This is precisely why they kneel during the national anthem. They could easily have knelt at any other juncture and at any other venue, just as any person could. However, using these countless other opportunities would have lacked the impact that their deliberate ignoring of common treatment of the flag intends to create.

Even Goodell acknowledges that the kneelers “also understand how it’s being interpreted.” Of course they do, because that’s precisely why they are doing it. They could have chosen any other approach and not been “misinterpreted,” and stopped when it was (something the Left immediately demands when its sensibilities are offended).

So how do the kneelers get up? Like liberal protests in general, they have painted themselves into a corner. Having created a cause so amorphous and pursuing it in so self-contradictory a way, there can be no real resolution. There is no objective way to say what it even means, let alone that it has been resolved. They have created a social version of a perpetual motion machine. So there they kneel.

America has moved on from the self-contradiction and repetition. If ever there was a definition for being bored, that is it. And if ever there was a demonstration of it being the Left’s greatest potential pitfall, this it. You do not need to read Saul Alinsky to understand it. Billy Joel summed up the contrast between the kneelers’ self-view and the public’s perception in “The Angry Young Man”: “And there’s always a place for the angry young man / With his fist in the air and his head in the sand… / But his honor is pure and his courage as well / And he’s fair and he’s true and he’s boring as hell.”

Denzel Washington Presents Two Choices: Revenge Or Reconciliation,"This review includes major plot spoilers.

To protest or not to protest—that is the question of Denzel Washington’s latest project, “Roman J. Israel, Esq.” The film challenges us with whether it is “nobler to suffer”—and to forgive real and perceived injustice—or to “take up arms” at possible racism at every turn. “Israel” (Denzel Washington), as a hapless, overweight, savant defense attorney puts this question to us all.

The film opens focused a document that reads, “Roman J. Israel, Esq. vs. Himself” in the “Universal Court of All Humanity.” Only at the end do we fully understand what is afoot. The question put simply: Is the answer to our racial woes an overwhelming protest of oppressed over the oppressor, or is it forgiveness and genuine reconciliation?

From this question, the film can be apprehended in two manners. One, it could indeed be true that to correct the sins of our history the once-oppressor may simply have to submit and become the subject of the once-oppressed. It may be true that the system in place must be destroyed so genuine justice can prevail. On the other hand, the picture presents its audience with a weighty and lingering question: had Israel simply played by the rules in a few key instances, the justice he sought his entire life could have begun to come to fruition.

Is It Better to ‘Take Up Arms,’ O Israel?

This question avails itself to the audience throughout the film. For instance, is George Pierce (Colin Farrell), the lawyer who hires Israel after he falls on hard times, simply trying to exploit this black legal genius, or is Pierce trying to give Israel a real chance in the legal world, perhaps a chance of fulfilling his ultimate dream? Are Israel’s constant protests warranted, or is his persistent consternation actually harming his cause?

The film continues in this way and culminates in one of Israel’s ultimate protests of the system. After improperly plea-bargaining on behalf of one of the firm’s clients and being reprimanded by Pierce, Israel does the unthinkable in objection to Pierce’s reprimand. He exchanges privileged information on another of the firm’s clients for a $100,000 reward leading to an arrest in a murder case from local law enforcement.

Again, there are two ways to understand this. One is to say that Pierce was being unfair to Israel by limiting his power within the firm. Furthermore, it demonstrates that a black man cannot make it in the white, privileged system, so the only answer is to subvert the system and begin operating outside of it.

On the other hand, it could be equally argued that Israel is looking a gift horse in the mouth. In Pierce’s law firm, Israel earned a solid salary as a junior man. He was given the opportunity to work on civil rights cases within the criminal courts, which was clearly his passion. Instead of learning how to work within the system and taking advantage of his opportunities, Israel chooses to once again subvert it. When he doesn’t get what he wants, Israel is wont to cry “racism” and seek revenge instead of forgiveness and reconciliation.

Then Revenge Turns on Israel

Ironically and tragically, Israel’s protest turns out to be all for naught. Pierce quickly chooses to forgive Israel instead of firing him for an egregious violation of the firm’s policies. As if to add insult to injury, Pierce offers to help Israel pursue his sweeping civil rights ideas legally. Finally, under Pierce’s leadership the firm restructures their hourly billing to begin a pro bono arm that is placed under Israel’s direction.

All of these fortuitous events follow Israel’s petty protest of being reprimanded. Israel’s feelings of guilt over his crime then mount to unbearable proportions. The scenes following this good fortune are reminiscent of Edgar Allen Poe’s “The Tell-Tell Heart.” The muffled beating of the “vulture-eyed” man’s heart begins for Israel just as the madman from Poe’s tale, with a deafening ringing in the ears as he sits with a new love interest at supper. His heinous deed is catching up with him.

Israel is summoned to the county lock-up to represent a certain man. As the door slowly opens, his face falls in fear. It is the man he betrayed for the $100,000 reward. Make no mistake, the man is not looking for counsel in his capital case. He is looking for revenge.

Israel’s existential crisis, the case of “Roman J. Israel, Esq. vs Himself,” is now in full bloom. Does he protest until the system breaks, or learn to forgive and reform the system? Several times throughout the film we see Washington’s character staring, with great angst, at a portrait of one of his civil rights heroes, Bayard Rustin. The picture contains one of Rustin’s quotes: “Be enraged at injustice, but let us not be destroyed by it.”

Israel is being destroyed by what he perceives as injustice. The question driving the audience to madness is in full sympathy with our man Israel. On three significant occasions in the film, Israel is branded as “crazy.” On each occasion, his response is, “I’m not crazy.”

This recalls, “True, nervous, very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am, but why will you say I am mad?” from “The Tell-Tell Heart.” Israel is the very definition of madness, and so are we as the audience. Sadly, just as the day of reckoning came for the madman in Poe’s chilling tale, so it comes for our madman, Roman J. Israel, just as surely as it will come to us. It is a question we cannot avoid.

Israel Wins His Case Against Himself

His law firm eventually discovers Israel’s crime, but that concern is miniscule compared to his mortal danger from the murderous criminal who seeks revenge. In the case of “Roman J. Israel, Esq. vs Himself.” Israel won decisively.

Israel is the consummate protestor, the savant lawyer who can quote entire tax codes from memory, the one who will transform the American legal system into one of true justice. “Himself” is the one who wanted to simply forgive either real or perceived injustices and attempt to seek dialogue and reconciliation.

Washington’s character, at his core, wanted healing between himself and others, but his rage against injustice ultimately destroyed him. The murderer upon whom Israel informed said it best: “You are breaking your own law, and I want to see you pay for that.” The “law” Israel broke was Rustin’s wise advice: he allowed his rage at injustice to destroy him.

The name “Israel” means “struggles with God,” and it seems the creators of this film want their audience to struggle with two very important concepts about race relations and life. First, we must always struggle against a system that discriminates based on skin color. We should never take this a given, or become complacent in it. Living in a world where it is harder to make it just because you are black is a world in which no moral person wants to live.

Secondly, the film teaches its audience that if we can no longer trust one another and engage in open and honest dialogue, then our great experiment with freedom is doomed. If a man, even if he is white, cannot be trusted because of his skin color and socio-economic status—moreover, if he cannot be forgiven for his sins—then all will be lost.

The film teaches that while we must heed Malcom’s warnings, we must always embrace Martin’s teleology. The goal must never be to see the once-oppressed become the oppressor. Instead we must embrace Martin’s “dream…that one day…the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave-owners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood.”

That was the dream Roman J. Israel, Esq. forsook and, because of that, betrayed everything he ever stood for. May we never forsake this dream in favor of revenge. May outrage at injustice never destroy this dream. May the “Universal Court of All Humanity” find its judgement in favor of us on these merits on our day in court.

"In 2017, The ‘Resistance’ Couldn’t Shoot Straight At Trump","The beginning of this year presented Democrats and their sympathizers in the media with both an important job and a big opportunity. Donald Trump governs in a style that somehow manages to combine authoritarian bluster with a total lack of self-discipline. He requires an effective political opposition to keep him in check, which also gives the opposition plenty of ammunition to work with.

So how is that the Left spent most of 2017 managing to blow it?

The year began with the Left screaming that Trump got elected because of the dissemination of “fake news” on the Internet. Then they immediately and repeatedly published false or uncorroborated news stories. I focused on a specific one: BuzzFeed’s publication of a dossier of supposed intelligence on Trump, which was passed on with the admission that BuzzFeed hadn’t bothered to verify any of it, but “Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect that have circulated at the highest levels of the US government.”

[This] makes for an interesting contrast to the outrage against Facebook for merely allowing its users to share dubious news stories, for which crime it has to bring back the old mainstream media ‘fact-checkers’ to serve as gatekeepers for all of Facebook’s millions of users. Yet when BuzzFeed promotes news that may very well be fake—well, hey, you don’t expect them to be like the old media gatekeepers, do you? Actually, I do expect them to be like the old media gatekeepers—exactly like them, like the actual reality of their practice, not their idealized self-image. I expect them to have the same attitude as Dan Rather and the New York Times all those years ago. Fake news is really bad, unless it’s about someone we hate.

The result is that “fake news,” which began as the rallying cry of a Left trying to explain away the presidential election, has been taken up as a rallying cry by the president and his supporters to dismiss any report they don’t like in the mainstream media. It was the beginning of a long series of own goals.

Dissecting another piece of “fake news,” this time about how the House Obamacare reform bill would “make rape a pre-existing condition,” I analyzed how this helps the Left get trapped in Perpetual Rage Mode.

As someone who attempts to interact with the other side pretty regularly on social media—and not always just to score rhetorical points—I’ve begun to notice a distinct pattern. People on the left will interact with someone on the right just long enough to be able to find some sign, some slip of the tongue, some violation of accepted speech codes (like not being a prig about Cinco de Mayo) that allows them to dismiss that person as racist, sexist, homophobic, or just insensitive—which provides an excuse to ignore anything he has to say. The conclusion is always the same: all arguments from the right can be dismissed without consideration because they come from bigots. They need to stop doing this, and not for our sake—if you’re on the right, you’re probably used to coping with an omnipresent background radiation of political hostility—but for their own sake. It is a spectacularly unconvincing method of argument that drives people back into their own social media ‘filter bubbles.’ It doesn’t convince anyone. It just convinces them not to talk to you any more. And then you end up on an evening in November, stunned at the fact that so many people voted for a candidate whose sole political function is to stick a finger in your eye.

The beginning of the problem is that the Left was not content to view themselves as a traditional political opposition. Instead, they had to glamorize themselves as “the Resistance,” which implies a hostility to the entire system of government under which Trump is elected—which I suppose is why they began by protesting the peaceful transition of power in a republic.

If you’re “the Resistance,” then you might set yourself up to spy against your own government—which was my best theory about why The New York Times exposed classified information that will merely make things more difficult for overseas aid workers.

The whole report is inexplicable, and you get the sense that the reporters just wanted to tell a splashy, thriller-like story. Except that there’s a larger pattern: it has become acceptable to open the floodgates of classified information because Trump. This is the same paper that just outed the CIA bureau chief for Iran, citing as their rationale that he was ‘leading an important new administration initiative against Iran.’ In a sane universe, that would be the reason not to report it. This is more evidence that the election of Donald Trump has broken something in the American left. The same people who style themselves ‘The Resistance’ have decided to treat the entire administration as an enemy country and appoint themselves as a freelance intelligence agency dedicated to revealing its secrets. They are placing partisan enmity, the desire to find or make trouble for the current administration wherever they can, above the interests and national security of their own country.

What is broken in the Left that causes them to get caught in a loop—a “pattern of action, over-reaction, and counter-reaction—of Trump, Anti-Trump, and Anti-Anti-Trump”?

The entire Trump phenomenon is a live-action version of the old parable about the boy who cried wolf. Spend decades telling everyone that Bush is Hitler or that Mitt Romney is a racist, and you’ll find that there is nowhere left to go when you try to warn everyone that Trump is worse. Crank your reaction to every Trump statement or speech all the way up to eleven, and people dismiss you as noise and tune you out. So there’s no reserve of extra outrage to tap when Trump really does do something awful…. I have suspected for a while that Trump’s election seems to have broken something in the left, and I think I can finally put my finger on exactly what it is. He so thoroughly seems to confirm all of their fondest caricatures of the right that they think he excuses them from having to react objectively and thoughtfully to new facts, or from having to understand the actual arguments, ideas, and attitudes of anyone who disagrees with them. This means that they’re not figuring out how to appeal to anyone who is not already with “the resistance.”

The ultimate example of this was the failed protest of players taking a knee during the national anthem at NFL games.

I would say that Trump outsmarted the Resistance, but that doesn’t seem to take much work. The Resistance has framed the issue so cleverly that they are on one side, and Trump is on the other—along with the national anthem, the flag, and military veterans…. It was an ill-conceived form of protest, bound to backfire. The symbolism is all wrong. By its very nature, it does not come across to most Americans as a protest against excessive use of force by the police. It comes across as a protest against the national anthem. And since the national anthem is, well, our national anthem, it comes across as a protest against America…. If anybody thinks this is going to hurt Trump with the people who voted him into office, then this is going to be a long eight years.

In retrospect, the warning of this total incompetence in the use of symbols was the brief fad of wearing a safety pin after the 2016 election. In theory, this is a symbol that tells oppressed minorities that they are “safe” with you. But a safety pin is also a good way to send the message, “I’m a big baby.”

But wait, the disastrously misplaced symbolism gets even better.

To give you an idea of how far the Resistance has disappeared up its own backside, several prominent left-leaning figures are now suggesting that ‘The kneel will now become a sign of opposition to Trump.’ But kneeling, of course, is an ancient sign of submission, not resistance. So you get suggestions like this, and I honestly can’t tell whether it was meant ironically or not. ‘Wouldn’t it be great if taking a knee became the symbol of resistance to Trump & wherever he want, wherever people gathered, they did it?’ That’s what happens when blind, unthinking opposition become more important to you than actual principles and good sense. You end up resisting Trump so much that people kneel before him wherever he goes.

They actually did it, kneeling before Attorney General Jeff Sessions “as if he were the viceroy of an absolute monarch.” This led me to conclude: “I hereby declare this political opposition to be mentally incompetent and unable to manage its own affairs.”

The ultimate lesson is something I figured out while doing a segment for an online video special from Sports Illustrated.

What struck me about the discussion before my segment is how everyone in that office—way up on the 60th floor somewhere, with Manhattan spread out below them—really seemed to think that we’re all having a great conversation about race and policing because of this. But it’s a conversation they’re having with themselves. They somehow forgot that a conversation is supposed to have two sides and that maybe they should listen to the other one. The thing that struck me after my segment is how resistant they all were to anyone bearing the message that people outside of their bubble are not having the same conversation and don’t see the protests the same way. There are big, obvious reasons why normal people would view refusing to stand for the anthem as a sign of disrespect for the country. Anyone paying attention to the reaction of viewers and fans would decide to rethink this form of protest and find some other way to make their point. But for years, the left has trained itself in the habit of assuming that the only reason anyone disagrees with them is because of racism. As a consequence, those who live in this bubble tend to reflexively dismiss anyone who brings them a contrary message from the outside world. Their ideology and the groupthink of their closed-in peer groups insists that they show contempt for the very country and the very people they’re supposed to be winning over to their side. That’s how they can use basic symbols with such apparent incompetence and be out of step with at least half the country and still convince themselves that they’ve reached a consensus.

But of course the political right has its own problems, evidenced by how Republicans managed to lose elections in Virginia—and in Alabama, for crying out loud.

The conundrum the presidency of Donald Trump created for the Right will be the next step in my look at this year’s top stories.

Why The ‘Death Of White Evangelicalism’ Is Not The Death Of Christianity,"Time and time again, the media and the Left launch efforts to discourage Christian conservatives after major victories for their values in the culture. With Public Religion Research Institute’s (PRRI’s) recent research release on “America’s changing religious identity,” their CEO Robert P. Jones tries to eulogize “white evangelicals” by citing America’s demographic shifts and decline in those identifying by this term.

It’s been no secret that President Trump’s victory was due largely to the unprecedented number of evangelical voters who showed up and voted for the conservative policies that the Republican platform promotes. Yet Jones sees these actions as merely a last-ditch effort to remain culturally relevant.

By hailing the “end of white Christian America,” they’re really trying to say it’s the end of the influence of Christian moralism on the culture, and that simply isn’t true. Out of PPRI’s 14-point findings, here are three statements worth scrutinizing.

White Christians now account for fewer than half of the public. Today, 43% of Americans identify as white and Christian, and only 30% as white and Protestant; as compared to 1976 when roughly eight in ten Americans identified as white and identified with a Christian denomination, and a majority (55%) were white Protestants.

White Americans do not hold a monopoly on Christianity or evangelicalism. There is a growing and diverse movement within evangelicalism that is not highlighted by polls like this one. Nor do they take into account the growing, ethnically diverse population of Americans who are not white but also identify as evangelicals (like me).

After the passage of the 1965 Immigration Act, we’ve seen major growth in the non-white population, to the point where projections are that white Americans won’t be the majority of the U.S. population by 2065. If these projections are correct, white people shouldn’t and wouldn’t be making up the majority of anything, including religious groups.

White evangelical Protestants are in decline, along with white mainline Protestants and white Catholics. White evangelical Protestants were once thought to be bucking a longer trend, but over the past decade their numbers have dropped substantially. Fewer than one in five (17%) Americans are white evangelical Protestant, but they accounted for nearly one-quarter (23%) in 2006.

Why are there so few polls on black evangelicals—do we not exist? As noted in PRRI’s findings, Baptists make up the largest denominational family among Protestants, and they are making major strides in diversity. A growing number of churches are mega-churches that host an ethnically diverse congregation and do not cater to a majority-white audience. It is natural that as the demographics of the country change, so will the demographics of the church.

White evangelical Protestants remain the dominant religious force in the GOP. More than one-third (35%) of all Republicans identify as white evangelical Protestant, a proportion that has remained roughly stable over the past decade. Roughly three-quarters (73%) of Republicans belong to a white Christian religious group.

Is this a bad thing? No. It is natural that people identify with a political party on the basis of ideology, and since the Republican Party’s platform most aligns with biblical principles that Protestant and evangelical Christians believe in, this simply makes sense.

The Left’s bigotry against religion is not by accident. It is designed to silence those who stand for the righteousness that convicts their consciences. As Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said, “White people do not have a corner on biblical Christianity. It’s not about the color, it’s about the cross.”

The fail-safe to this so-called “end of white Christian America” (otherwise known as the “end of Christian moralism”) is the Great Commission. In Matthew 28:19-20, Jesus says, “Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.”

As Christians, we are commanded to share our faith with the nations or, as some translations say, “all the people groups.” There is no color left out of needing to hear the gospel, and no place we should not be spreading the good news of Jesus Christ. If Christians are faithful to do this, then there will be no end to our influence on culture.

Iranians' Protests Offer A Real U.S. Reset In The Middle East,"Over the past four days, Iranians have taken to the streets in several cities to protest corruption and living conditions in the repressive Islamic Republic. The unusual public protest of the Iranian regime has provoked a predictable government crackdown. While protests in Iran are rare, they aren’t unprecedented. However, this time, unlike in 2009, the White House is poised to support the protesters, not leave them in the lurch.

Demonstrations began in the northeastern city of Mashhad on Thursday, and quickly spread to several other cities on Friday. They began over high prices, but now protestors are calling for the ouster of Tehran’s powerful clerical class, and speaking out against police beatings and other government abuses. Ironically, the protests began just two days before previously scheduled pro-government rallies that took place on Saturday, meant to mark the eight-year anniversary of the 2009 Green Movement protests that the Iranian regime harshly suppressed.

Much like the complaints that first sparked the Arab Spring in Tunisia in 2011, Iranians are protesting corruption and poor living standards. But those gathered across Iran this week were also protesting something else: Tehran’s involvement in foreign conflicts. Iranians held signs this week that read “Get out of Syria and take care of us” and “Not Gaza, or Lebanon, I would give my soul for Iran.” The protestors also reportedly shouted things like, “Death to Hezbollah.”

All of this refers to Iran’s ongoing and ever-increasing involvement in regional affairs, including its support of the powerful Lebanese militia Hezbollah, as well as the role it has played in helping Syrian President Bashar al Assad crush the rebellion in the ongoing Syrian civil war. Then there’s Iran’s backing of the Houthi rebels in the bloody Yemeni civil war, not to mention its support of various militias throughout the Middle East and South East Asia. Apparently, not all Iranians are happy about their country becoming a regional hegemon while problems persist at home.

The Consequences of Leading from Behind

The connection with the Obama administration’s policy toward Iran is plain to see. President Obama sought desperately to get the United States out of the Middle East, no matter the cost. He wanted to pass the torch, so to speak, so America could go home and no longer be responsible for regional stability. Bizarrely, he saw Iran as the answer to his problems. By empowering Iran and allowing it to be the new Mideast sheriff, America would be free to “lead from behind,” i.e., shrink from the international stage, repudiating the misadventure of the Iraq War.

The path forward for this plan rested on the Iran nuclear deal, which secured unenforceable guarantees that Iran would halt its nuclear program while lifting economic sanctions and welcoming Iran back into international engagements.

With his eye ever on this prize, Obama failed to support Iranian protestors in 2009 during a would-be revolution that foreshadowed the Arab Spring two years later. The Green Movement protests began after a presidential election in which the hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad beat Mir-Hossein Mousavi, a more moderate candidate. Supporters of Mousavi claimed that Ahmadinejad had stolen the election and massive street protests ensued, as did a violent government crackdown that left as many as 100 dead and thousands imprisoned. It was thought to be the largest protest in the country since the 1979 revolution that brought the mullahs to power. Protestors shouted “down with dictatorship,” but Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei backed Ahmadinejad.

Obama was widely criticized for remaining quiet for the first several days of the protests, making weak statements about it being up to Iranians to decide who the nation’s leader would be, and saying that America “respects Iranian sovereignty” even if he is “deeply troubled” by the violent crackdown. Obama even went so far as to tell the protesters that the world was “inspired by their participation” in the political process “regardless of what the ultimate outcome of the election was.”

After several days of harsh criticism at home, particularly from Sen. John McCain, Obama condemned Iran more forcefully, although administration officials said nothing more could be done. However, they did note that while talks about Iran’s nuclear program appeared stalled then, they hoped that later in the year Iran would be able to come to the negotiating table.

Their meaning was obvious. Obama had plans for Iran that didn’t involve bringing down the ruling party and ushering in reform-minded revolutionaries. They also didn’t involve ticking off the powerful mullahs whose cooperation Obama needed to reach a nuclear deal. The almost-revolution was a fly in the ointment for Obama’s plans for the Middle East. He needed a stable and strong Iranian government with which to do business, not a democratic revolution.

Now, eight years later, we see those anti-government sentiments have not gone away among ordinary Iranians and that many aren’t very happy about Iran’s expanding role in the region.

These Protests Re-Expose Years of Iranian Regime Lies

Iran’s harsh response to this week’s protests is a reminder that the Islamic Republic is not a flourishing democracy and the Iranian people aren’t free. Iran’s powerful clerics closely control who runs for office, and the government censors the media as well as what Iranians can access on the Internet. All street gatherings of any kind are banned without a government permit.

This week’s protests once again expose the falsehood of Tehran’s official narrative, which has been aided and abetted by our mainstream media, that Iranians are happy with their country’s leadership and are swelling with national pride. The New York Times recently ran a feature with the headline, “Long Divided, Iran Unites Against Trump and Saudis in Nationalist Fervor.” The article raves about how Iranians are proud of the role Iran is playing in the region and that, by virtue of their leaders locking horns with the Trump administration, Iranians have a newfound self-respect as a nation. But the Times missed (or chose to ignore) the other side of the coin: the apparently large and now vocal constituency of Iranians who value prosperity at home above foreign adventures, reject authoritarianism and corruption, and are not happy with the ways things are going in their country.

Now that Trump is in office, the American response to all of this is likely to be much more supportive of the protestors in Iran than the Obama administration’s was in 2009. Vocally opposed to the Iran nuclear deal, Trump has shown in the last year that his administration is looking to America’s long-time ally — and Iran’s nemesis — Saudi Arabia as its partner in the region. He has called out Tehran repeatedly for its meddling and blatant support of terrorism.

Ironically, and contrary to the New York Times piece, it could turn out that the Trump administration’s tough position vis-à-vis Iran actually emboldens the protestors, giving them hope that someone out there cares what’s happening in their country — and might even support them should things escalate.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/12/31/iranian-protests-offer-opportunity-real-u-s-reset-middle-east/,2017-12-31
5 Worst Echo Chamber Talking Points About The Iranian Uprising,"The Iranian people are in the midst of their largest protests since the 2009 Green movement, and many on the Left don’t seem especially thrilled about the prospects of a free Iran. The muted reaction is partly due to a troubling trend of justifying and excusing Islamic fascism in a broader and confused attempt at signaling tolerance. But almost surely an even more powerful factor is the need to protect Barack Obama’s legacy and criticize Donald Trump.

While we don’t know what will happen in Iran, or what we can do about it, it’s clearer than ever that our funding, legitimatizing, and propping up the Iranian regime — one that is now killing peaceful protesters who are demanding economic opportunity, freedom, and secular governance — was morally and politically tragic. (This includes imaginary “moderates” and mullahs alike.) Rather than further isolating and economically stunting the regime, Obama gave it cover.

It’s important to debate, not because we need to re-litigate the past (although why not?), but Democrats still believe the Iran deal was worth it. Rather than unequivocally supporting a movement that demands freedom, the Obama administration’s Echo Chamber, initially silent, has some talking points for you.

Nothing to See Here

The initial coverage of these historic protests—or in some cases, the lack of it—was scandalous. The New York Times’s Thomas Erdbrink, in particular, veered into revolting Walter Duranty territory. Looking back at the paper’s coverage of Iran, it’s unsurprising.

“For many years,” the reporter wrote only last month, “many Iranians were cynical about their leaders, but that is changing thanks to Trump and the Saudi crown prince.” Every unfiltered report from Iran told a different story.

Actually, thanks to Trump, the Times’ coverage swerved unconvincingly from “The protests are only small and and not worth your attention’” to “These protests are about economic woes and have nothing to do with political disputes and are not worth your attention” to the “Violence is the protesters’ fault because they won’t listen to the regime’s calls for calm.” All of this is particularly offputting when you consider how hard some in the media worked to make the Iran deal a reality.

Be Quiet!

“Be quiet about freedom and oppression” is really the Democratic-liberal foreign-policy mantra right now? Really? — John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) January 2, 2018

The first inclination of many liberals was to demand Americans shut up about a movement that demands self-determination and liberalism. Why? Whenever Trump fails to weigh in on a world event, the Left accuses him of implicitly endorsing fascism. Yet when the administration offers a statement condemning the Iranian regime, a long-time committed terror-supporting adversary of the United States, the same folks who daily call out Russian authoritarianism advise the president to ignore those protesting for freedom.

On the first days of the demonstrations, The New York Times ran an op-ed by former Obama administration official Philip Gordon, a long-term proponent of strengthening the regime’s “moderates,” arguing that the best thing Trump could do for the Iranians was to be quiet like Obama had been in 2009. This was repeated by a number of liberals, some claiming we had no moral authority to lecture anyone on freedom, which is, of course, absurd.

The more sophisticated case went something like this: If we encourage the protesters, the regime will begin to blame outsiders for agitating the situation and this will make the protesters look like saboteurs. This might come as a surprise to some people, but the Iranian regime has been blaming imperialists and Zionists for all their troubles for many decades. Yet protesters still chant, “No Syria, no Gaza, we’d die only for Iran.” From what we know, in fact, it seems that one of the key grievances of the demonstrators is that they’re sick of Iranian regime creating enemies around the globe rather than concentrating on their people at home.

What if the protesters don’t want the help? For starters, we don’t know what they want us to do. They may still detest United States, but that doesn’t mean we can’t advocate the cause. Perhaps, and this might sound nuts, they may appreciate others who advocated for their liberty. Perhaps that will win them over? And perhaps one day we can ask them how they felt about Gordon and others in the Obama administration legitimizing the regime that now threatens their lives.

Meanwhile, Obama’s silence did nothing for the Iranian people. The world’s silence does nothing. Just because the United Nations calls for an emergency meeting every time a Jew builds an extension on his bedroom in Jerusalem, doesn’t mean the United States has to follow suit. Sanctions hurt the Iranian regime. And the threat of new U.S. sanctions that target the Revolutionary Guard, which has its hand in much of the economic turmoil and answers only to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has, according to The Wall Street Journal and others, put Iranian government “in a corner.”

It’s About Them, Not Us

The Iranian people are rightfully demanding dignity, less corruption, more opportunity, and greater control over their lives. In looking at US twitter, it seems lost on too many that this is about what Iranians want for Iran, and not about us. — Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) December 31, 2017

The Echo Chamber likes to make the Iranian protest sound like the Women’s March. Well, some of the Iranian protesters — the bravest of them — are also demanding freedom from theocracy, something Ben Rhodes will likely never mention. Nor John Kerry, nor Samantha Power, nor Hillary Clinton, nor anyone who tweeted out this talking point. Americans, they say, shouldn’t make this about themselves, but rather the aspirations of the Iranian people (which they misrepresent).

Fortunately, most human beings have the capacity to concern themselves with multiple events. How we react is important because Democrats constantly peddled what we now know is a false choice: war or the Iran deal. There is a restive population in that nation demanding freedom. We knew this in 2009, when we were told that the uprising was merely about voting irregularities, and we know it know.

A free Iran would be one of the most momentous events in the past 20 years. Yet, rather than tighten economic sanctions and undermine the regime, Democrats did everything they could to strengthen it. This includes the Obama administration ignoring the uprisings of 2009, releasing Iranian spies, slow-walking and shutting down investigations into Iranian criminality, and paying ransoms. These are political decisions made by a party that seeks to regain power here in the United States.

So why isn’t every supporter of the Iran deal being asked why he voted to fund Hassan Rouhani and the mullahs?

Well, We Didn’t Fund the Protest-killing, Terror-supporting Islamists, We Were Just Unfreezing Their Assets

I am wondering how many folks are aware that the money the US sent Iran as part of nuclear deal was actually Iran’s assets to begin with. It was their own money we returned. It wasn’t tax payer money. — Matthew Dowd (@matthewjdowd) January 1, 2018



For 30 years, both Democrat and Republican administrations managed to freeze funds that we procured in a dispute over a failed arms deal signed before the 1979 Islamic revolution that deposed the shah. Until, that is, the Obama administration decided to secretly send more than a billion dollars in various foreign currencies in unmarked planes as ransom for American hostages. Between those two events, Iran held 52 American citizens hostage for 444 days, was likely responsible for the death of another 500 American servicemen fighting in Iraq, and her proxy killed 220 Marines and 21 other service personnel in Lebanon.

None of this takes into account Iran’s attacks on allies, support of our enemies, funding of terrorism, and suppression of its own people. We don’t owe this iteration of Iran, a nation that has ignored international agreements for decades, anything. On what moral grounds does Dowd believe unfreezing the assets of a group that funds terror acceptable? The truth is, this talking point is simply meant to rationalize the tragic underpinning of the Iran deal.

But Trump…

We stand with the Iranian people so much that we won’t let them come here. https://t.co/fzbv8idiiJ — Samantha Power (@SamanthaJPower) January 1, 2018

Many echo-chamberists, who only a few days earlier were arguing that we should concentrate on the Iranian people or just shut up, attacked Trump’s support of Iranian protesters as a vacuous since he supported a travel ban for a number of suspected terror-supporting states, including the Islamic Republic.

It should be pointed out that none of these people, Power included, ever said anything as tough about Iranian fascists the Obama administration coddled for eight years. But Iran in fact offers a great example of why travel bans may be necessary. The Iranians refuse to cooperate with the United States on terror and security risks, because they are the security risk. Iranian nationals have not only been sent here to spy (the Obama administration released or slow-walked investigations into 14 of them, at least) and to create criminal enterprises through their terror proxies (the previous administration shut down those investigations), but to recruit other Iranians to assassinate ambassadors and blow up embassies.

Now, though we shouldn’t overestimate our ability to help the protesters, one wonders how this situation would look if Power and others hadn’t been so accommodating to Iran. Once the regime is gone, surely we can have open travel like we do with most other peaceful nations.

Why The United States Should Back Iranian Protesters Now,"As many people around the globe welcome 2018 through parties, dances, and champagne, ordinary people in Iran are ending their 2017 and welcoming 2018 through massive street protests. According to The Wall Street Journal, the protests started small in several Iranian cities in September 2017.

People initially took to the streets to voice economic grievances and protest government corruption, harsh economic conditions for ordinary people, and a high youth unemployment rate. However, as more Iranians joined the protest since December 28, protestors focused less on economic issues and more on demanding fundamental political reform in Iran. They reject their government’s policy of supporting terrorists in countries like Syria while ignoring economic hardship at home. They call for the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down and for “death to the Revolutionary Guards,” a powerful military force loyal to him.

The authoritarian government of Iran responded with its typical iron fist. It imposed restrictions on social media apps such as Telegram and Instagram. It’s also reported that police arrested several hundred protestors and at least two protestors died of gunshot wounds. The Iranian government also wasted no time in blaming foreign powers, especially the United States, for being behind the protestors.

The current protests in Iran represent the largest and most significant civil uprising since the Green Revolution in 2009, and the United States shouldn’t ignore it.

Let’s Learn from Obama’s Failures

The last time Iran saw a similar scale of public protests was in June 2009, following the announcement that incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won re-election, despite several reported irregularities and voting fraud. Supporters of all three opposition candidates believed the election was rigged and took to the streets to protest.

The Iranian police responded to peaceful protestors with clubs, pepper spray, and guns. Iranian officials confirmed that 36 protestors were killed. People from the opposition estimated the actual death toll was much higher, not to mention thousands of protestors arrested and tortured.

Then U.S. president Barack Obama, the supposed embodiment of “Hope and Change” and soon-to-be Nobel Peace Prize winner, was very slow to act. He avoided condemning the violence against protesters for a long time and never publicly questioned the Iranian election. According to the book, “The Iran Wars,” by Wall Street Journal reporter Jay Solomon, President Obama was so obsessed with making friends with the mullahs and getting his legacy nuclear deal with Iran that his administration strenuously avoided showing the Iranian opposition any moral or material support.

While protesters were shedding blood on Iranian streets, President Obama ordered the Central Intelligence Agency to sever contact with and material support to the Iranian opposition. He also ended U.S. programs to document Iranian human rights abuses. He even wrote letters to Khamenei assuring him the United States was not trying to overthrow him.

The Iranian government eventually brutally crushed the Green movement. President Obama got his nuclear deal. Yet the deal failed to bring the world peace he envisioned. Instead, it enriched the Iranian government and enabled it to support other rogue regimes and terrorist organizations that cause harm around the globe.

There is no evidence that Iran has actually halted its nuclear weapon development post-deal. Rather, the latest report shows Iran and North Korea are deepening their cooperation in ballistic missile and nuclear weapon technology. The world is a much more dangerous place today than in 2009, and President Obama’s arrogance and poor judgment are partially responsible.

Some people argued that even if President Obama lent support to the opposition, there’s no guarantee that opposition would have succeeded and brought badly needed political reform to Iran. However, it was worth trying.

The current Iranian regime represents an existential threat to not only the United States but all of western civilization. Had we supported the opposition in 2009 and they succeeded, a real fundamental political reform could have taken place in Iran, and a truly free and democratic Iran could one day have become an ally in peace, rather than a continued threat.

The Iranian People Deserve a Better Life

Iran’s former self, the Persian Empire, produced great culture. Its art, literature, and language have influenced the rest of the world. Some English words we use today, such as “pajama” and “paradise,” derive from Persian. Poems by great Persian poets such as Hafiz and Sadi enchanted Ralph Waldo Emerson and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

Even prior to the 1979 Iranian Revolution that ushered in today’s oppressive regime, the Iranian people lived a much freer life. There is ample evidence that the theocratic Iranian state since the 1979 revolution has failed to make the Iranian people’s life better.

An Iranian woman I follow on Twitter, Rita Panahi, recently shared a picture of her mother and her mother’s girlfriends from before the 1979 Islamic revolution. No woman in the photo was covered head to toe with a burka. Instead, they dressed like Westerners, with bright eyes and big smiles. In Rita’s words, the women in the photos were professionals, independent and free.

Recently, a 19-year-old Iranian chess player, Dorsa Derakhshani, was banned by the Iranian chess federation for refusing to wear a headscarf while competing in public. She was the second-highest-ranked player for girls under 18 in the world in 2016 and the second-highest-ranked female chess player in Iranian history. But the regime only cared about what’s on her head, rather than the talent inside her head. She moved to the United States and will compete on our behalf. A brutal regime’s loss is a free country’s gain.

What President Trump Needs to Do

“History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” The Iranian protests today offer the Trump administration a historical opportunity it can’t afford to ignore. I applaud President Trump for openly and unequivocally supporting the protestors and warning the Iranian regime on Twitter. But a few 280-character social media posts are not a substitute for a concrete foreign policy.

President Trump should give a speech directly appealing to the Iranian people, just like the speech he gave last year in Seoul, South Korea, when he spoke directly to and appealed to the North Korean people.

In his speech, President Trump needs to acknowledge that Iranians deserve a better life and a better government. He said in his speech in South Korea that “the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a tyrant. It comes from the true and powerful glory of a strong and great people.”

That is true for the Iranian people, too. They deserve to live freely, to flourish, to develop their own destiny, a destiny that “is not to suffer in the bondage of oppression, but to thrive in the glory of freedom.”

A Speech Isn’t All, Either

The Trump administration should also develop a set of initiatives to help the opposition in Iran, such as reaching out to opposition leaders, providing communication equipment to get their message and news of the government’s oppression out, and applying pressure to warn the regime against using violence against protestors. If and when credible evidence shows any oppression against protestors, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley ought to share such intelligence on the world stage to publicly shame the Iranian regime.

The U.S. Congress should expand the application of the Magnitsky Act, a law that enables the United States to withhold visas and freeze financial assets of foreign officials thought to have been involved with human rights violations. We should let Iranian officials know that this will apply to them. In addition, we need to be ready and willing to bring back the economic sanctions the Obama administration let go.

Some Americans probably are concerned that the Iranian regime will blame the United States for interfering with Iranian internal affairs. But the regime is already blaming the United States for instigating civil unrest caused by the regime itself, and it will not stop pointing the finger at us even if we choose to do nothing.

America has the moral obligation to stand up for and stand by people who are thirsty for freedom and want to take charge of their own destiny. We had a leader who totally missed a historic opportunity in 2009. Let’s not repeat our mistake in 2018.

"As Protests Rage, Let’s Be Honest About Iran’s Tyrannical Regime","The protests in Iran are now a week old and continue to spread across the country. Hundreds of Iranians have been arrested and more than 20 people have been reported killed. These are the largest protests since the 2009 Green movement, when millions of Iranians demanded a recount after the country’s sham presidential election brought Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power.

In sharp contrast to President Obama’s muted reaction to those 2009 protests, President Trump tweeted a message of solidarity with Iranians Tuesday morning, calling the regime in Tehran “brutal and corrupt,” and warning that the United States is watching.

In other words, the Trump administration has chosen to talk about the Iranian regime and the plight of the Iranian people in clear moral terms:

The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime. All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their “pockets.” The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018

Good. After nearly a decade of the Obama administration’s moral equivocation on Iran, it’s time to be clear: Iran is a theocracy, ruled by a tyrannical regime led by the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his fellow clerics, all of whom have innocent blood on their hands. That includes the current president, Hassan Rouhani, whom Obama administration officials like Ben Rhodes cynically styled as a “moderate” in order to sell the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.

The truth is, there are no real moderates among the Iranian ruling class because the regime itself is incapable of reform. Iran isn’t just a theocracy, it’s also a revolutionary regime that seeks to expand Shiite Islamist rule, first to its immediate neighbors in the Middle East and eventually to the entire world. Iranians will only enjoy things like democracy and human rights and an end to government corruption when Khamenei is overthrown and the regime forced from power.

Obama Refused To Speak About Iran With Moral Clarity

But that’s never going to happen with loose, Obama-era talk about “moderates” like Rouhani. As Ray Takeyh noted yesterday in Politico, Rouhani’s reelection campaign last year was “cynical and subversive… Facing a formidable hardline opponent in Ebrahem Raisi, Rouhani spent much of his reelection campaign castigating official corruption and even alluded to one of the regime’s darkest chapters, the mass murder of political prisoners in summer of 1988. He promised rapid economic growth, a human rights charter and an accountable government free of graft.”

Of course, Rouhani didn’t deliver on any of those things because he is a longtime functionary of a regime incapable of combating corruption because it is based on corruption. Obama and Rhodes knew that all along, but their goal wasn’t to bring down Khamenei and the mullahs, it was to strengthen them so America could wash its hands of the Middle East once and for all.

All of which to say, it’s entirely appropriate—in fact, long overdue—for an American president to note, as Trump did, that ordinary Iranians “have little food, big inflation and no human rights”—that they are the victims of their corrupt ruling class. Too often, that’s lost in our rhetoric about Iran. Like all people living under the heel of despots, Iranians want freedom.

That includes economic freedom, but we need to dispense with the misleading notion that the unrest in Iran began as a “protest about economic conditions” then grew into a “general political protest.” The two are one and the same because Iran’s political system is thoroughly corrupt and cannot be moderated or reformed. In the decades since the 1979 Islamic revolution that brought the clerics to power, the government in Tehran and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard have used their power to enrich themselves and their families at the expense of the rest of the country. When I say Iranians want freedom, I don’t mean they all want gay marriage and abortion on demand. They want something more basic: a chance to improve their lives, earn a decent wage, and provide for their families.

That universal human desire is what President Ronald Reagan tapped into during the Cold War, when communism thwarted the desires of hundreds of millions across Asia and Europe. In contrast to his predecessors, Reagan was willing to cast America’s struggle against communism in strictly moral terms. In his famous speech to the National Association of Evangelicals on March 8, 1983, Reagan denounced the Soviet Union as an “evil empire,” and urged his listeners not to be complacent in the face of that evil:

Yes, let us pray for the salvation of all of those who live in that totalitarian darkness—pray they will discover the joy of knowing God. But until they do, let us be aware that while they preach the supremacy of the State, declare its omnipotence over individual man, and predict its eventual domination of all peoples on the earth, they are the focus of evil in the modern world…. So, in your discussions of the nuclear freeze proposals, I urge you to beware the temptation of pride—the temptation of blithely declaring yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire, to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil.

Of Course The Iranian People Are Revolting

It’s easy to see how Reagan’s logic could and should apply to the Iranian case today. Just as the Obama administration did, many on the Left are inclined to ignore the facts of history and label Iran and the West as equally at fault for the sorry state of the Middle East. Obama and Rhodes were so eager to do so that they pushed through the nuclear deal and allowed Tehran access to more than $100 billion in funds that had been frozen by United Nations sanctions. Those resources have gone to support Iranian military adventures across the region, funding terrorists and militias—and clearly not benefiting the people of Iran.

We should therefore not be surprised that Iranians are once again revolting. Samira Mohyeddin, a freelance Iranian journalist in Toronto, told the Canadian magazine MacLean’s in a recent interview, “It blows my mind that people will sit here and say, ‘Where is this coming from?’ How long do you think people will take this? How long do you expect people to take this kind of repression? It’s going to blow.”

The sooner it blows, the better. Most of the instability and violence in the Middle East is, after all, funded and promoted by Iran’s ruling mullahs. The downfall of the Khamenei regime and its replacement by a secular, non-revolutionary regime—even one that’s frail, as Iran’s first-ever democratic government is certain to be—will significantly reduce bloodshed in the region.

It might even herald the beginning of a new era for the oppressed peoples of the Middle East, when they will choose their own leaders and write their own laws. Perhaps, in time, they will even come to know and enjoy what George Washington, quoting the Book of Micah, promised the Hebrew congregation at Newport, Rhode Island: that “every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid.”

But that will not happen without a revolution in Iran. Americans, and especially the White House, can hasten that day by speaking about the Iranian regime in clear moral terms.

President Trump Has A Clear Shot At The Iranian Regime,"Over the past week, a new wave of anti-regime protests has broken out in Iran, and it could not have happened at a more opportune time. Following the defeat of ISIS in Syria, this gives America the clearest shot we have had in a long time at helping the Iranian people take down a dangerous and oppressive dictatorship. Please, please, please let’s not mess this up.

I describe this as a “clear shot,” because this is not the first time the Iranian people have risen up against their rulers. But each time it has happened before, America has seemed too distracted or blinded to do much about it.

The Islamic Republic—which is not a republic but a theocracy—has been on thin ice for a long time. It has often been observed that Iran was a rapidly modernizing and relatively liberal country before the Islamic Revolution in 1979, which in a way explains the revolution, as a backlash against all that modernity. But by the same token, the Iranian people have always chafed under the restrictions imposed by the mullahs, and have been trying to undo the Islamic takeover ever since, whenever public dissatisfaction reaches a boiling point.

Since the end of the Iran-Iraq War, mass protests have broken out every ten years or so. They flared up for a while in 1999 and into the early 2000s, but we were too absorbed by our conflicts with Iraq—which were not invented by George W. Bush but simmered throughout the 1990s—and by 9/11, in which Iran was not directly involved, so we had no casus belli for focusing our attention on that regime.

Bush believed that creating a successful democracy in Iraq would help undermine the Iranian regime, but by the time the Iranian uprising came in 2009, the Obama administration had decided to always do the opposite of the Bush administration. They were so intent on cozying up to the regime and striking a diplomatic bargain that they pointedly ignored the Green Revolution. Then they got distracted by the civil war in Syria and the rise of ISIS. This is undoubtedly one of the reasons the Iranian regime likes to light fires across the Middle East: to keep everyone’s attention tied up elsewhere.

Yet the underlying causes of the dissatisfaction with Iran’s rulers didn’t go away. An oppressive regime is constantly producing new reasons for the people to hate it, from arbitrary restrictions on their behavior, to the predatory kleptocracy of regime insiders, to massive official corruption and incompetence, to squandering the people’s wealth and sustenance in military adventures that serve the regime’s goals but have no compelling connection to the national interest. All of these are themes expressed by the current protesters—particularly the money Iran has spent to prop up the Assad regime in Syria while cratering the economy back home.

This indicates the big overlap between the protests in Iran and American interests. The Islamic Republic is a notorious state sponsor of terrorism that constantly tries to export its revolution, supports anyone who hates America, and has built a network of proxies and satellites throughout the Middle East. Currently, the sphere of Iranian influence goes through Iraq, where Iran supports and controls Shiite militias; to Syria, where it has provided so much support to the Assad regime that some are calling it an Iranian takeover of Syria; to Lebanon, where Iran is the main sponsor of the Shiite state-within-a-state run by Hezbollah, which it is currently trying to whip up into a new war against Israel.

In response—and in the absence of any substantial American leadership during the Obama administration—Saudi Arabia has been trying to gather together Arab and Sunni forces in a kind of Cold War against Iran, including a possible nuclear arms race. I don’t think I have to explain to you why this is not a good thing.

I have pointed several times to a startling graph showing how the number and deadliness of wars across the world dropped off precipitously after the collapse of the Soviet Union, revealing the degree to which Communism was an engine of conflict. (We American warmongers were still around and stronger than ever, yet strangely we failed to keep all of the wars going.) The Iranian regime is a similar engine of conflict, if on a smaller scale. Imagine the peace dividend that could follow from its fall.

Better yet, this new uprising comes at a time when ISIS has been defeated and its foreign fighters have gone underground. There will be hell to pay when they get back to their home countries, but for now there is a lull. There is nothing to distract us from supporting the Iranian protesters and helping them topple the regime.

Unless, of course, we distract ourselves. President Trump started, well, using Twitter—appropriate in this case, given the role of social media in Iran’s protests—to proclaim his support for the uprising.

Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food & for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 1, 2018

Big protests in Iran. The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. Looks like they will not take it any longer. The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2017

The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime. All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their “pockets.” The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018

Just as the Obama administration was obsessed with doing the opposite of the Bush administration, so Trump is strongly motivated to do anything that is the opposite of Obama. In this case, that’s a pretty good rule of thumb. So far, Obama-era CIA Director John Brennan has harshly criticized Trump’s approach, which is the best endorsement he could hope for.

But our mercurial commander-in-chief has since become distracted again. When North Korean dictatorship Kim Jong-Un made an indirect nuclear threat against the United States, which happens every other Tuesday, Trump took the bait and responded by boasting about the size of his button.

North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2018

In fact, the likelihood of war on the Korean peninsula has been decreasing lately. For the Kim regime, rattling the saber is also their way of rattling the tin can, angling for financial support from South Korea, China, or the United States. It’s their shtick. But Trump can’t resist a petulant battle of boasts, so he has to go chase that squirrel.

We can only hope that the administration’s response to the uprising in Iran will follow the same pattern as our war against ISIS, which we quietly won while the president was tweeting about other things. We won against ISIS because we had competent strategists in top national security positions who were focused on the issue and not distracted, even by their own commander in chief. Let’s hope they can maintain their focus on Iran, too, because there are a lot of things the United States can do.

One of the measures, as Eli Lake points out, is to publicize the names of dissidents and protesters who are arrested, and to make all Western relations with Iran—both diplomatic and economic—dependent on their treatment. “The model here is the late-Cold War diplomacy with the Soviet Union, when US envoys made the treatment of dissidents there a feature of every other encounter with this dictatorship of the proletariat.” To the extent that the West can use this kind of publicity to shield dissidents from the worst forms of retaliation, we can help break down the Iranian people’s fear of the regime.

Helen Raleigh provides some more substantive suggestions, including giving protesters and dissidents material support, whether overtly or covertly, particularly focusing on technology that will help them communicate and get around the regime’s crackdown on the Internet, social media, and messaging apps. In effect, we should do for the Iranian opposition what we did for the Solidarity movement in Poland in 1980—and on the same time scale, if necessary.

It is also time to seize the assets of regime officials and supporters. The latest wave of protests began after the Obama administration gave Iran $100 billion in frozen assets as part of the failed nuclear weapons deal, and that money promptly disappeared into Iran’s foreign adventures and a vast morass of official corruption. The Iranian people noticed, and so should we. It’s time to take back as much Iranian money as we can get our hands on and seal off the regime and its supporters from the international banking system and the international economy.

Finally, we need to recognize that this is only the beginning of a long process. A few tweets won’t do the job. If their role in Syria is any guide, the Iranian regime isn’t going down without a bloody fight, even if they have to go to war against their own people. Get ready to back a new Iranian revolution with arms, training, intelligence, and even air support—or sit back and watch the Middle East collapse into chaos on a scale bigger than the disaster in Syria.

It may take years. It may take more focus than the president has shown so far. It will certainly require vigorous, careful, patient effort on the part of this administration’s top strategists. It will also require this administration to very prominently undermine the interests of Russia, which has adopted Iran and its Syrian satellite as the center of its sphere of influence in the Middle East. But the rewards are enormous.

It’s not often you get a chance to undermine, not just the power of your enemies, but their entire ideology and model of government. That’s what is at stake here. The young, reform-minded Saudi crown prince who has been consolidating his power put it this way recently:

After the Iranian revolution in 1979, people wanted to copy this model in different countries, one of them is Saudi Arabia. We didn’t know how to deal with it. And the problem spread all over the world. Now is the time to get rid of it. We are simply reverting to what we followed—a moderate Islam open to the world and all religions. Seventy percent of the Saudis are younger than 30. Honestly, we won’t waste 30 years of our life combating extremist thoughts, we will destroy them now and immediately.

This is exactly the sentiment being echoed by Iranian protesters who are denouncing the Islamic regime and demanding a secular government. Now imagine what the Middle East might look like if the big regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran is over which country can be more modern, secular, and liberal.

Maybe it’s a long shot, but so was the Reagan administration’s effort to undermine the Soviet Union. It’s definitely worth a serious effort, if we don’t let ourselves get distracted.

Do Mass Protests In Tunisia Mark The Start Of A New Arab Spring?,"Yesterday marked seven years since protests in Tunisia ousted its corrupt authoritarian leader, sparking the Arab Spring and setting the Middle East on fire. As if by some cosmic irony, Tunisia is once again being rocked by mass protests and its government, once again, is cracking down.

Thousands have taken to the streets since demonstrations first began early last week. This kind of political unrest has a habit of spreading fast, not just within a country, but, as history shows us, throughout a region. Is the Middle East seeing the early days of its second Arab Spring?

Demonstrations began in the capital city of Tunis as a small gathering to protest a hike in taxes on things like cars and phone calls, which took effect January 1. But the protests quickly spread throughout the country over the next few days, sometimes turning violent and destructive. Protesters have reportedly burned down dozens of state buildings, including a national security building in the city of Thala, near the border with Algeria, and there are reports in multiple cities of looting.

On Thursday, the government arrested hundreds of people in an attempt to tamp down the mass demonstrations and discourage protests planned for the weekend. The army has even been deployed to several cities after police retreated. But, while the government claims that it’s only arresting looters and criminals, human rights advocates insist that police are detaining individuals who haven’t broken the law and are indiscriminately cracking down on Tunisians.

So far, the police have arrested 778 people, many of whom are accused of rioting, according to the Ministry of the Interior. Of those detained, 16 were classified as “Islamist extremists.” Some opposition leaders were also arrested, accused of setting a government building on fire. One protestor has died and, reportedly, dozens of police officers have been injured. Protests continued over the weekend with thousands pouring into the streets of Tunis on Sunday and violence erupting in parts of the city.

It’s Déjà Vu All Over Again for Tunisia

Tunisia is experiencing déjà vu. Back in 2011, when protests in Tunisia first began, Tunisians were motivated by economic concerns. At that time, their complaint had more to do with government corruption — particularly the largesse of authoritarian leader Zine al Abidine Ben Ali and his family in the face of high unemployment and a corrupt police force — than with austerity measures. The Tunisian Arab Spring was sparked, quite literally, by a street vendor, whom police so consistently harassed that, in desperation and out of a sense of helplessness, he set himself on fire.

After several weeks of massive protests, Ben Ali dissolved the government and fled the country on January 14, 2011. A transitional government was put into place and a commission formed to rewrite the constitution. The protests — and their success in effecting change — inspired peoples across the Middle East, leading to a chain-reaction of similar uprisings.

Tunisia has been lauded as the only real success story of the Arab Spring. It had a peaceful transfer of power and held elections that were generally accepted, although corruption persisted. Other countries to which the Arab Spring spread — Libya, Egypt, Syria, and Yemen — did not fare nearly so well.

Civil war broke out in Libya, Syria, and Yemen, resulting in de facto failed states in all three (although the Syrian government is swiftly moving to consolidate power with help from Iran and Russia). Egypt, meanwhile, is widely considered to have returned to its authoritarian roots under the rule of a military man, Abdel Fattah al Sisi.

Hopes that freedom and democracy had finally reached the region were dashed, as one by one, each Arab Spring country failed to shake off the shackles of authoritarianism, by either descending into civil war or using the democratic process to vote in an authoritarian or Islamist government. The Arab Spring caused huge upheavals not just in the countries in question but in the region overall, destabilizing the Mideast’s relative balance of power.

The Syrian civil war has drawn in both Iran and Russia as allies of the Assad regime, increasing tensions with the United States, which is in Syria fighting the Islamic State, another by-product of that civil war. Iran’s presence in Syria — particularly its proxy, Hezbollah — has put Israel on alert, fearing an incursion from the Golan Heights. The Yemen civil war has Saudi Arabia and Iran fighting a proxy war, with the United States thrown into the mix as a major weapons supplier of the Saudis.

Last Time Around, High Hopes Failed Fast

The Arab Spring was hailed as the dawning of a new age in the Middle East, but it turned into a disaster. Now, here we are again at the beginning of a new year watching the same country that lit the match of the Arab Spring start to tremble with civil unrest. But this time, Tunisia isn’t the canary in the coal mine — Iran is.

Two weeks ago, Iranians took to the streets in the largest demonstrations there since 2009, the year of Iran’s almost-revolution. Their complaints are similar to those of the Tunisian protesters: high prices, high unemployment, and government corruption. Iranians defied the highly centralized government of the Islamic Republic by voicing their anger. The protests swiftly turned from the economy to the authoritarian rule of Iran’s clerical class and the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, with protesters shouting “Death to Khamenei,” a twist on the commonly heard chant “Death to America.”

Iran’s government brutally cracked down on the protests: Dozens were killed and 3,000 protesters detained. The government claims the uprising has been put down. As evidence, the popular messaging app Telegram has been unblocked. But protests have continued outside the notorious Evin Pison in Tehran.

Last week, authorities ceded to the demands of hundreds of protesters, who had gathered to ascertain the whereabouts of their family members, by releasing four political prisoners. On Sunday, the government announced it had released hundreds who had been arrested during the protests. This is a small victory, no doubt, and every time the government gives some kind of concession, it strengthens the Iranian people. Other countries are bound to notice.

But are Tunisians protesting because of what happened in Iran? It’s impossible to say. However, political movements are often like a fever: contagious and fast-spreading. That Tunisia’s protests come so quickly after Iran’s seems like more than a coincidence.

It’s not clear, however, whether other countries will be willing to risk the instability that so often follows mass protests and governmental upheavals. Iranians came out to the streets because they have been consistently repressed since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. They haven’t tasted success like Tunisians have, nor have they learned the hard lesson of a failed uprising like the Syrian rebels did. Tunisians, on the other hand, have experienced the triumph of holding their government to account and seeing democracy work in their country. It’s natural that they’d be willing to take a risk again.

If Tunisians are able to exact huge concessions, or even once again oust the government as a result of their protests and civil disobedience, it might be enough to inspire other Mideast countries to take action once again. Let’s hope that if another Arab Spring is stirring, it goes better than the first one.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/01/15/mass-protests-tunisia-mark-start-new-arab-spring/,2018-01-15
Joe Scarborough’s Single Is The Protest Song No One Was Waiting For,"Imagine yourself as a mad scientist charged with creating a computer program to write the anthem for the next Monsters of Vaguely Folkish Alterna-Rock Festival. The song will be performed by a replicant attempting to pose as a newly woke hipster dedicated to the #resistance.

Now imagine that your work is pointless because Joe Scarborough beat you to it, albeit ostensibly via his own hand and not an algorithm run amok. Whether he can pass the Turing test remains to be seen.

What can be seen or at least heard, and never unseen or unheard, is “Stand,” Scarborough’s latest anthem. Anthem may be overselling it a bit. Let’s just agree that it is a song and, per Scarborough’s own statement, “[inspired] by the Women’s March and dedicated to those who #Resist.”

Also, Mika and he salute you. They do not specify if their salute is related to the marchers about to rock, but we can hazard a guess to that question, especially given the song in question.

The Song Has Its Moments

Let’s start with the good. Scarborough is pretty skilled at enunciation. This is an important thing when delivering scorching lyrics such as the opening verse of “Stand,” each line a towering summit of insight and originality. It would be a shame if any of it crumbled, Tower of Babel-style.

As the acoustic guitar begins, Joe’s raspy-ish voice gently blasts us, preparing us to take on the establishment or something. “Once in your life, you may get the chance to stand, against a column of tanks, holding up your hand.”

He doesn’t say why the tanks are holding up your hand. Since you’re against them, it’s unlikely a sign of solidarity. We also don’t find out if the tanks can pass the Turing test, but we don’t have time for that, because Joe is still going. “Once in your life, you may get the chance to say, words like deep within your heart, I’d change the outcome of a day.”

At least I think that’s it. He’s not a master of enunciation, he’s only pretty good at it. Also, I have no idea what he’s talking about regardless, so it isn’t worth doing a Google search or anything. Plus, the drums and other instruments are getting going by that point, and we’re treated to “once in your life, you may dare hold out your hand, to a stranger in need, whose world you cannot understand.”

Music’s Teleportive Potential

I don’t know about you, but just reading those words transports me into the throngs of a crowd marching on the White House and just generally resisting things, except for the panhandler we apparently encounter along the way. We don’t resist him. And that’s just the first verse. The chorus is where the jam really gets rolling.

“And how the world turns, violently. We’re battered by the savagery. But we will not break, not on bended knees. We will not go down quietly. We will not go down silently.”

Please refrain from holding your lighters up in the air, it’s triggering to moths. Instead, use the hand that would’ve held a lighter to scratch your head at the notion that the #Resistance has been silent, much less quiet. Joe should know this, since he spends a lot of time howling about Trump ever since he stopped giving Trump a bunch of air-time because it was good for ratings.

Also, the production values are good and the song is decently composed, if not particularly surprising in any way. It’s not very long. Joe’s vocals are adequate and there isn’t any unnecessary fluff or a guest verse by a random rap artist or anything. (Sorry, Tay Tay, I love you, but whatever track that is on “Reputation” didn’t need a guest appearance by a random rap artist. Or maybe he’s famous. I don’t know and I’m digressing.)

Second Verse, Not the Same as the First

Moving back to “Stand” and onto the second verse: Scarborough continues spouting fire, at least what he imagines fire to be. To appreciate it, I have to write out the second verse in its entirety: “Once in your life. [Musical interlude.]”

Most artists, when writing protest anthems, are compelled to use words. Think of John Lennon’s “Imagine,” and please forgive me for making you think of John Lennon’s “Imagine.” Its second verse is way more than one sentence and it even has a third verse. Scarborough not only resists Trump, he resists the normal formula of including lyrics in the second verse, instead letting the music play until it’s again time for the chorus.

Lest you think he merely repeats the chorus exactly—continuing with an established level of lyrical boldness not heard since “Feliz Navidad”—he most certainly does not. No, he expands on the first chorus. How so? He repeats the part about not going down quietly not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES before closing with “we will not go down silently.”

Point? You’re Missing the Big Picture!

At this juncture you may be wondering exactly what any of that has to do with the Women’s March. That’s an excellent question that I have no answer for. You might also be curious about the tanks from the first, and honestly, only verse. We’re not talking about a Tiananmen Square redux here, because Trump is Hitler, so those must just have been symbolic, man.

So maybe “Stand” doesn’t really have a point, other than showcasing that a human can do the work of a computer program designed to write an anthem for the next Monsters of Vaguely Folkish Alterna-Rock Festival. That human will definitely not do it on bended knee, quietly or silently, but can still do so while bursting with bot-like adequacivity. That’s because when you want a small cornucopia of protest non-sequiturs strung together in musical form, you want artisanal mediocrity from a human. Rage against the machine, not with help from a machine.

For that, and for not being about to rock or make sense or anything, Joe Scarborough, we don’t salute you, but we’re not going to form a new #Resistance either. At least not yet, though maybe you should take your own resistance toward having second verses with lyrics and instead resist the urge to hit the studio entirely.

Calling Persian Spring A ‘Disaster’ Is Desperate Cover For Obama Failures,"People who love freedom and see the advantage of aggressive regimes distracted by turmoil at home were glad for the recent uprisings in Iran. Not so Professor Gawdat Bahgat, of the National Defense University in Washington DC. In The National Interest, he recently cast the Iran protests as dangerous for regional stability and the wrong solution for the conflict between the West and Iran and for what is distressing the Iranian people.

He’s wrong on all counts. But his ideas are worth dissecting because they are what Obama administration defenders have been saying for years about Iran in defense of the flawed nuclear deal.

This Is Internal Dissent, Not Foreign ‘Regime Change’

The recent demonstrations across Iran lasted for several days until brutally suppressed by the Republican Guards Corps (the force behind the mullahs’ theocracy that runs the “republic”). Between 3,700 and 8,000 people have been arrested and more than two dozen killed by the regime, not counting those still dying due to torture and execution during their detention. It is hard to know the real numbers, but the regime has handled previous incidents the same way.

This time, however, is different in that the protestors were not just demanding economic relief and jobs but across numerous cities went straight for the heart of the matter by chanting “death to the ayatollah” and calling for an end to the regime’s aggressive and adventurous foreign policy that wastes the nation’s resources in support of terrorism and rogue regimes such as Syria’s Bashar al Assad.

But Bahgat doesn’t seem to see it that way. In the very first two paragraphs of the essay, rather than relay the actual nature of the protests, he uses the term “regime change,” which conjures up not oppressed people demanding an end to their oppression but suggests outside forces are trying to overthrow the regime. That’s exactly what the regime accuses the United States of doing.

The term “regime change” is not used to describe citizens voluntarily rising up against dictators but to describe other states’ foreign policy. I think Bahgat uses the term on purpose to conjure that image. One imagines the regime would be pleased with Bahgat’s description.

Bahgat also uses the Iranian government’s term for what is happening: “sedition.” Then he offers a curious thought: “It will take some time to accurately understand the roots of this violence and how it will impact Tehran’s domestic and foreign policies.”

Will it, really? The roots of the violence are the misrule and tyranny of the theocracy the people are protesting. Also, the violence is of the regime against the people—very few instances have been reported of Iranian citizens physically assaulting the regime (and who could blame them when peaceful protests are met with brutal crackdowns?). What is unclear about that?

It should also be no surprise. Many Iranians are educated, professional, young, and modern. They quite naturally chafe under the endemic corruption and oppression of a 30-year cleric dictatorship that operates a religious morals police and wastes the nation’s patrimony on the violent adventures of a pariah regime that hates Sunnis, Jews, Christians, and the United States. Bahgat would do well to consider the facts being reported rather than pretending we can’t be sure what is wrong in Iran.

We Can’t Let Freedom Get in Our Way, Now

But Bahgat has another goal in mind. His is a not-so-subtle attempt to defend the Obama approach to Iran (i.e., be nice to the regime and it will be nice to you) by trying to deny what is really happening. That is, the Iranian people’s uprising threatens the Obama policy because their demand for freedom and self-rule would end the rule of an aggressive, corrupt, and expansionist Shiite regime.

Above all, Bahgat seems most interested in saying what will be most useful in maintaining support for the Obama deal with Iran. His flawed arguments are numerous and breathtaking. Warning us that the fall of the ayatollah’s corrupt and oppressive government is dangerous, Bahgat ignores realities and offers up nonsense.

The fall of the mullahs’ government is dangerous only to the rulers themselves. The people of Iran are perfectly capable of self-government if given a chance. They certainly cannot do worse than this regime. Besides, it is a human right to throw off a dictatorship.

As to the idea that instability endangers the region, Bahgat engages in a long-held and flawed belief that dictatorships are somehow more stable than what he apparently assumes is the unruly nature of democratic governance. Democracy might be unruly at times, but it is violent and chaotic only when entrenched elites do things like, say, steal elections and mandate who can and cannot run in them; or meet peaceful protests with violence.

Thus the Iranian people rose up in 2009 over stolen elections, and were met with violence. They rose up again recently because the fruit of the stolen elections was broken promises, increased adventurism, and support for terror—with the $150 billion the Obama administration paid to get the Iran nuclear deal.

The people know very little of that money went anywhere but the rulers’ hands, and much of it was spent on controlling Syria and Lebanon and supporting terrorists. All the promises of reform and improvement for citizens’ lives were broken, just as one would expect them to be under a dictatorship. The fake moderates that so many in the United States and Europe want to believe in are simply pawns in the hands of the Ayatollah Khamenei and the Republican Guards who enforce his rule.

Okay, Let’s Closely Examine Iran Policy

Says Bahgat: “A close examination of Iranian policy suggests that the government has a long way to go to meet the aspirations of the socioeconomic and political needs of its large and young population. These include unemployment, gender equality, transparency, corruption and pollution, among others. The ‘right’ way to address these challenges is a gradual reform of the system, not regime change.”

A close examination of matters is always a good thing, but let’s not pretend it is hard to understand the Iranian regime’s moral and economic failures. Every problem listed above is caused by dictatorship. If the Iranian people were free to choose their leaders, they would be moving toward solutions for all these problems because their interests are to solve them. The regime’s interests are to do exactly the things the people are protesting, such as mismanaging the economy through corruption and military adventurism and imposing the mullahs’ ideas of public morals.

Let’s not pretend it is hard to understand the Iranian regime’s moral and economic failures.

Next, Bahgat says that “experiments with regime change in the broad Middle East are not encouraging. Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen are cases-in-point. The process of regime change by definition is destabilizing. An unstable Iran would threaten key global interests.”

There is no question that Obama’s policy in all these places made matters worse, and again Bahgat ignores that in every one of these countries the people were rising up against brutal dictatorships long before any foreign power contemplated regime change. As Elliott Abrams discussed in his most recent book, “Realism and Democracy: American Foreign Policy After the Arab Spring,” tyranny is what destabilizes a country. Blaming the people for resisting it is a weak—and immoral—argument in favor of “stability.”

Then Bahgat makes an astonishing suggestion: we should desire the preservation of the regime because, like any other regime worried about its national security, it is fighting terrorism by working to defeat the Islamic State. He reminds that “ISIS would welcome a regime change in Tehran.”

Of course Iran opposes the Islamic State. So does the entire world. But the regime is not fighting ISIS simply because of national security reasons. It is using the fight to advance its own interests across the region, especially in Syria and Lebanon, and to further threaten Israel and oppose U.S. interests in the region.

If the mullahs’ regime were to succumb to citizen demands for democracy, there is no reason to believe that a democratic government would cease opposing ISIS. Rather, it would do so without trying to be the hegemon in the region. Further, the regime’s opposition to ISIS is itself destabilizing given the reaction of all Iran’s neighbors to its attempts to establish a Shia-controlled corridor to the Mediterranean.

Throwing Stuff at the Wall to See What Sticks

Next, Bahgat tries to argue the mullahs’ nuclear program is domestically popular, so any change in the regime will not end it. But there is a difference between a nuclear program per se, and a nuclear weapons program designed to protect the dictatorship from its opponents foreign and domestic. A nuclear program about energy and research is not a threat to anyone and can be had by states like Iran under the aegis of global treaties and cooperation with other countries.

That is not what the mullahs (or Kim Jong Un, for that matter) want or have ever wanted. A democratic Iran could theoretically have a nuclear program that isn’t weaponized and doesn’t threaten its neighbors or cost a significant portion of its national resources, but a violent theocracy isn’t interested in any of that.

Bahgat apparently knows better than the Iranian people, who are protesting a cruel dictatorship.

Finally, Bahgat throws in the regime’s efforts to support Afghan refugees living in Iran and somehow connects this to the drug war. Oh, and something about Iran’s energy reserves being destabilized if the regime falls and that causing turmoil in the global energy market. We are now at the point of throwing things at the wall to see what will stick, to see what will scare the complacent into just continuing the Obama approach of wishing the regime into niceness.

Thus we arrive at the most bizarre of Bahgat’s assertions: that what is really needed is not the fall of the mullahs’ regime but the West reaching out to help the regime reform. Because the regime is so important to stability in the region (yes, that is what we are to grasp from this article), we should be helping to keep it in place. Bahgat apparently knows better than the Iranian people, who are protesting a cruel dictatorship.

Never mind that the mullahs and the Republican Guards have been receiving Western diplomatic and financial assistance since Obama came to office. They got this help after the U.S. Congress forced Obama’s and Tehran’s hand with sanctions. On the brink of economic collapse and having had to put down the 2009 uprising, the mullahs agreed to negotiate a deal on their nuclear program with the naïve Obama administration in exchange for cash and an end to sanctions. They hit the jackpot, and until Donald Trump came to office were on track for a nuclear weapons program after a few years of unverifiable “scrutiny,” along with money to pay for it and for military adventurism abroad.

The regime has had plenty of time and money to address the public’s demands but have only done more of what the public is protesting against.

But to Bahgat, all is well because “The demonstrations that started in late December have ended and the authorities have been able to restore order. Top Iranian officials, including Ayatollah Khamenei and President Rouhani, have acknowledged the need to address the socioeconomic and political roots of this wave of protests.”

Note the description: with no praise of protestors who are demanding their human rights, having treated the protests as dangerous mucking about with global security, Bahgat wants us to understand that the mullahs have dealt with this risk and acknowledge they need to do more to address the public’s demands. Never mind that the public and everyone other than Bahgat and Iran deal supporters know that the regime has had plenty of time and money to address the public’s demands but have only done more of what the public is protesting against.

And of course the regime put down the uprising. It is an existential threat to the regime and its project of a Shia-controlled region.

No Dictatorship Lasts Forever—Or Should

Bahgat says, “Like any country, Iran’s domestic and foreign policies will continue to reflect the perceptions and interests of different factions within the political establishment. Like it or not, the Islamic Republic is here to stay.” But Iran is not like any country; it is like a dictatorship that oppresses its people to the point of uprisings and threatens its neighbors as a matter of course. The regime represents its own interests, period.

Besides the Trump administration, the uprisings are the primary threat to the regime’s agenda.

And why should the regime be here to stay? What dictatorship has lasted forever? Why should we believe this when it is faced with a crisis like this twice in eight years? Whether outside powers push or stay out of the turmoil, dictatorships in the modern era of digital communication fall when the public is aware of how they are treated and that they don’t have to accept it. Iran, of all countries in the region, is subject to turmoil because of its educated, informed, and young population.

Bahgat’s recommendation: “A better approach would be for the United States to work with its European and Asian allies to help the Iranian government to address the major socioeconomic and political aspirations of the Iranian people. Adhering to the nuclear deal, supporting foreign investment, activating cultural engagement, and promoting strategic dialogue are likely to serve the interests of all concerned parties. A stable Islamic Republic is good for the Iranian people, regional powers and the international community.”

Obama and the Europeans have assiduously tried everything on his list, and still the ungrateful Iranian people rose up across the nation for days, risking their lives to demand self-governance as the only solution to their problems. I suspect the only thing Bahgat really intends is to support the Obama nuclear deal with Iran. He does so because he knows, as does the regime, that besides the Trump administration the uprisings are the primary threat to the regime’s agenda.

At the end of Bahgat’s piece is the usual disclaimer for people who work for U.S. government academic entities, noting that he does not speak for the Department of Defense. Indeed, he does not speak for Defense Secretary James Mattis or the U.S. government, and thank goodness for that.

His career includes a presidential appointment with Senate confirmation as assistant administrator at the U.S. Agency for International Development; as a professional staff member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives; and as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly.

"MSU Students Are Right To Oppose Spencer, But Their Method Is Wrong","More than 500 protesters shouted “Nazis, go home” and “F-ck the police” outside Richard Spencer’s speech on Michigan State University’s campus Monday. Their motivation is sound, but their method is faulty.

With faces covered by bandanas and combat boots on their feet, many of the protesters seemed primed for violence. Police in riot gear had to escort individual speech attendees into the building, crouched around them to protect them from the rowdy crowd. Every time a cluster of police would appear with an attendee nestled in the middle, a mass of screaming protesters would surge forward, only stopping at the line of riot officers. Some protesters would hurl rocks and other items at the groups as they hurried away. Occasionally protesters would confront the lines of police, spitting in their faces and asking who they served.

By the end of the protest, MSU Police had made 25 arrests, ranging from misdemeanors to felonies. Some involved weapons.

Richard Spencer says terrible things, but people who want to hear him speak shouldn’t have to wade through a mob to do so. These protesters — in all their sign-wielding, “f-ck the police”-chanting, Nazi-chasing glory — have ultimately created a third group of people. They’re not with Spencer, but they’re not with the protesters, either.

One example is Daniel Bailo, 31, who stood alone about a block away from the protest by several police cars. Bailo, a self-declared libertarian, didn’t know it was necessary to have a ticket to attend the event and was unable to enter. He said he was standing by the police cars because he didn’t feel it was safe to stand by the protesters. Since he was dressed in khaki pants and had fair skin and cropped hair, he suspected the protesters mistook him for a follower of Spencer.

“I wanted to see who actually came to these events,” Bailo said. “I’d love to be in there to ask a legitimate question.”

Bailo had been standing outside for more than 40 minutes, waiting for his sister to come get him. Protesters passing by hurled insults at him, admonishing him for standing by the police.

“There’s swarms of people who hate anyone who looks like me,” Bailo said.

Bailo’s hesitation to even be near the protesters not only shows the breakdown in discourse, but is an indicator of a third group: The group that would possibly join the protesters if they curbed their violence and kept their anger directed at the actual subject.

This is the group that values hearing opposing ideas, even if only to understand how to better argue against them. This group understands that being willing to hear the other side does not necessarily mean they agree with it.

Encouraging conversation and exposure to opposing ideas is important to the university environment, and cussing someone out or calling them names is not an argument. Protesting a speaker shows dissatisfaction, but chasing attendees only bolsters their narrative by victimizing them. And screaming in the faces of police officers, who are there to protect both protesters and attendees, only isolates those who value that protection.

The protesters at MSU had momentum behind them. Some had even travelled from out of state. Their movement was well-organized and had a noble cause. But by creating a violent atmosphere, they exclude people from that cause, hinder actual conversation, and paint themselves as out-of-control children.

If these protesters want to be taken seriously by the third group, they must make more efforts to curb their violence, properly direct their anger, and fight with arguments, not screaming matches. It is not enough to just be angry or to wave signs. Protesters must be willing to engage in actual debate and to value those who believe in exposure to a variety of ideas.

Keep the motivation, change the method. Then we’ll talk.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/03/06/msu-students-are-right-to-oppose-spencer-but-their-method-is-wrong/,2018-03-06
Marching In The Streets Is Not An American Virtue,"Over the weekend, hundreds of thousands of kids marched for gun control in Washington DC and other cities. The protests themselves, I was told, were what participatory democracy looks like — an event worth celebrating whether you agreed with the marchers or not. Indeed, the very act of caring, whether or not these kids fully understood the issue, was a laudable example of civic responsibility. To point out the numerous misleading and ugly partisan attacks they leveled was not only a low blow against the children, but an assault on free expression.

These are convenient myths. For starters, chanting crowds of emotionally charged protestors aren’t exhibiting any great American virtue. Mass protests aren’t only often antithetical to the aesthetics of republicanism, but sometimes they undermine its purpose, as well. In our system, inalienable rights — including the one to self-defense — can’t be swept away by angry crowds.

Marching in the streets and condemning your ideological opponents as abettors of mass murder is just a common impulse of passion, a growing and caustic ingredient in American political life. We see it online all the time. Simply because you scrawl your thoughts on a sign rather than tweet them to your friends doesn’t imbue them with any more pertinence. This goes for all of us. Yet we live with the insufferable need to act as if protesting is tantamount to patriotism rather than a collective act of frustration. This is merely confusing activism with good citizenship.

Of course, the reason for the media’s favorable and idealistic coverage of these marches is that its own position comports with gun control. This idealization of people practicing their First Amendment rights certainly does not extend to the National Rifle Association, which is also lawfully exerting its right to petition the government.

But like anyone whose aspirations are tethered to politics — another un-American instinct — these kids are going to be frustrated by the results. In this country, marches are rarely good barometers of public sentiment. That’s not to say marches don’t occasionally reflect the prevailing politics of the day, it’s simply to say that they rarely change the trajectory of events.

In the common hagiographic rendering of the 1960s, for example, protesters stopped the Vietnam War. But unless you’re arguing that the protesters were so irritating their actions finally led to Richard Nixon’s landslide victory in 1972 against George McGovern, and that allowed Nixon to end the Vietnam War, it is just revisionism. For that matter, the Tea Partiers did not stop Obamacare, the One Percenters could not stop basic economics, and anti-war protesters did not stop the Iraq War.

It’s unlikely that kids being propped up by gun control activists will change the dynamics of this debate, either.

Like with all things, there are exceptions. The civil rights marches, in which Americans demanded that all individuals be protected equally under the Constitution, were successful. In tyrannies — which you might be led to believe we live in if you listen to p*ssy-hatted marchers — they are also consequential. The protesters of Tienanmen Square and the Prague Spring were, in fact, marching for their lives. Even the Americans who stood up against the Stamp Act did so in contempt of authoritarian rule, risking everything. Not getting your preferred national legislation passed in a federalist system of government isn’t repression. Sorry.

In ideological terms, marching is a leftist ideal. The theatrics of this march, as many others, rested on a giant ad populum fallacy. It is a call to justify government’s interference on the basis of popular will and fearmongering regarding public safety — or, more specifically, on making people feel safer. It is why we should be thankful that the anti-federalists insisted we write these self-evident truths down.

Now, it’s debatable whether most of these kids understand that they attend schools that are safer than ever in a nation that has bequeathed them more freedom and wealth than any other group in the history of the world. It’s almost certain, however, that the adults who stand behind them don’t care that the Founders were antagonistic toward arguments predicated on feelings. What they do seem to believe is that if you’re louder and more passionate, if you care enough, you win.

“So tonight—to you, the great silent majority of my fellow Americans—I ask for your support,” Nixon famously said in 1969. In this sense, the great silent majority was about politics (Nixon probably cribbed the line from Warren Harding), but for decades it was a term that meant the dead, or the legacy and traditions they left us.

The “right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances” is one of those inheritances. It guarantees that people can march without worrying about punishment or reprisals from the state. No one is saying Americans don’t have the right to protest. But nothing in a free country compels us to celebrate what they’re doing, either.

The March For Our Lives Was Just ‘Helicopter Protesting’,"The big “March for Our Lives” pro-gun-control demonstrations last weekend are being touted as the defining moment of the late millennial generation. Much as I like to think ill of millennials, second only to thinking ill of the Baby Boomers, such projections are unlikely to be true because, as Dave Marcus points out, they weren’t true of the Boomers, who were not defined by the hippies and went on to vote for Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.

“Neither of these generations, and in fact no generation at all, is defined by…media-hyped paradigms of what they think and do.” That’s especially true when we discover more confirmation that this spontaneous student activism isn’t so spontaneous, after all.

First of all, the numbers are in for the weekend rallies, and the crowd size is estimated at 200,000. That’s comparable to what we had in DC for the big Tea Party rally in September of 2009. It’s probably smaller than the nationwide Tea Party demonstrations in April of 2009. Perhaps a more direct comparison would be the almost identically named “March for Life,” an annual anti-abortion rally in DC that peaked at 650,000 people a few years back and regularly brings in protesters in the hundreds of thousands. And this is without the benefit of weeks of free publicity provided by the national media.

But these protests had the benefit of more than just free media. Under a carefully neutral title, “In Gun Control Marches, Students Led but Adults Provided Key Resources,” The New York Times basically admits that the marches are astroturf—artificial grassroots.

Although the events, which together drew hundreds of thousands of demonstrators across the country, were inspired and often led by students, many protests simultaneously benefited from groups with more financial resources and organizational skills than the teenagers had on their own…. Everytown for Gun Safety, which was founded and financed by Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire and former New York mayor, proudly declared that it had doled out more than $1 million in grants to local organizers. A nonprofit led by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, arranged for more than 200 people from the Parkland area to attend Saturday’s march in Washington, and said it had worked with the owner of the New England Patriots, Robert Kraft, to use the NFL franchise’s plane to bring some people to the capital…. ‘Our mission was to give them the biggest megaphone possible,’ Shannon Watts, the founder of an Everytown-affiliated group, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said on Sunday.

There’s a lot more of this sort of thing in the report, but it’s all summed up in this amazing statement:

‘The kids did everything,’ said Jenn Hoadley, 36, who helped students organize a march in Anchorage. ‘All I did was say, ‘You want a stage? Cool. I’ll find one for you. You need a sound system? Cool. I’ll find one for you. You want to march in the park? I do paperwork to help you get that done.’ They planned it all, and they should be given credit for that.’

“The kids did everything” ends up meaning that they expressed their preferences and adults swarmed in to do all the actual work. Plus, in the words of another local student “organizer,” the adults “were paying for everything.” As we usually do. Oh, and all the angry rhetoric about politicians being bought and paid for by the National Rifle Association? That was spoon-fed to them, too, by a Parkland teacher whose “government” class apparently spent a lot of time railing against “special interests” and not much time on the Constitution.

I don’t blame the kids for this, not primarily. They are responding to a perfect storm of two big trends among the older generation. The first trend is the rise of protest culture, in which your entire personal and political identity are supposed to be tied up in which protests you attend. Combine that with helicopter parenting, in which parents are so eager for their kids to enjoy success and a wide range of experiences that they hover over the kids and hold their hands the entire way. I guess we could call this helicopter protesting.

This isn’t new. It’s a phenomenon I observed during campus protests a few years back, when the president of Claremont McKenna college announced “I’m holding a sit-in in my office.” As I wrote, “Today’s students are so coddled that they no longer have to make the effort to take over university buildings. Their elders will take it over for them. It’s like a weird kind of helicopter parenting: ‘Here, let me rebel for you, sweetheart.'”

Similarly, one education reformer observed the irony of the recent anti-gun school walkouts, “protests” that were effectively sponsored by the school’s own administration. “If students have permission to walk out, it’s no longer student activism at all. It’s a field trip.”

I have no doubt that the some of the kids from Parkland and elsewhere will do amazing things some day. Some of them already have, but they’re not here to talk about it. The rest will go on to accomplish much in their lives, eventually. But they will start to do that only after they emerge from under the protective wings and ideological influence of their teachers and parents and decide what they think on their own. Then maybe some of them will dare to launch protests without the permission and support of their elders.

What Ireland's Good Friday Agreement Teaches About Deep Divides,"This week will mark the 20th Good Friday since the Belfast Agreement of 1998, also known as the Good Friday Agreement, was reached by the governments of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland in conjunction with the major political parties of Northern Ireland. Approved by referendum in May of the same year, the GFA was the culmination of a lengthy peace process that ended The Troubles, a decades-long period of terrorist violence in Northern Ireland waged by sectarian paramilitary groups.

Americans have often made the mistake of characterizing the Troubles as a religious conflict, with groups such as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) likened to al-Qaeda. This misconception evinces a profound ignorance of the Northern Ireland conflict and the circumstances surrounding it that prevents us from learning its true lessons. Although religion has served as an identity marker for the warring factions in Northern Ireland, the divide it represents is social and political rather than theological, encompassing nearly all aspects of Northern Irish society in a way that continues to pose significant challenges for peace in the region.

Besides miscategorizing the Troubles as a religious conflict, the biggest mistake outside observers make with regard to conflict in Northern Ireland is believing that it began in the 1970s. Although the most recent shooting war began at that time, conflict of sorts between Irish Catholic and Protestant communities goes back as far as the conquests and plantations of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when English policies brought Protestantism, along with English laws and customs, to Ireland at the point of a sword.

They undid Ireland’s pre-existing social, political, and economic structure, overthrowing chieftains in favor of lords loyal to the crown and dispossessing a huge percentage of the native population. They broke the dominance of the Catholic Church in religious life and forced it underground by fining and imprisoning worshippers. Later penal laws barred Catholics from voting, holding public office and owning firearms while banning intermarriages between Protestants and Catholics and breaking up Catholic estates unless their inheritors converted to the (Anglican) Church of Ireland.

In response, Irish Catholics turned inward and developed a closed, solidaristic community based on adherence to tradition and identity. Protestants in turn further insulated themselves against the threat of this recalcitrant underclass. The Catholic emancipation movement led by Daniel O’Connell in the nineteenth century succeeded in relaxing harsh anti-Catholic policies and integrating Catholics into the Irish economy, but it also gave them the resources and the legal standing to form large and effective nationalist political movements.

Protestants responded with near uniformity by adopting Unionism and emphasizing the importance of British identity. Religion thus became significant not only for its own sake but also as a byword for political and social allegiances, with Catholic vs. Protestant standing in for repressed vs. ascendant, Gaelic vs. British, and nationalist vs. Unionist.

These divisions were particularly intense in Ulster (modern-day Northern Ireland) because it had the greatest degree of British settlement and a large, established Protestant and loyalist population. So when Ireland was granted independence in 1921 after a two-year guerrilla war between British security forces and the first incarnation of the IRA, Ulster was exempted and remained part of the U.K. The new regional government at Stormont Castle featured gerrymandered political districts designed to ensure Protestant control of the legislature and blatantly discriminatory civil services. Its police force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, harassed Catholics and repressed dissent.

The divisions between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland went far deeper than government, reaching into nearly every element of daily life. Cities like Belfast and Derry physically separated the two denominations from each other; some of Belfast’s infamous “peace lines” still stand as monuments to the Troubles. Schools were (and are) heavily segregated, with Catholics choosing private schools while public schools were almost exclusively Protestant. Sports became dividing lines, with hurling and Gaelic football isolated to Catholic communities, while Protestants dominated rugby and soccer. Pubs were exclusively patronized by one denomination or another. Traditional Irish music thrived among Catholics and was rejected by Protestants.

Both Catholics and Protestants were jealously protective of their traditions, and participation in activities associated with the Other was actively discouraged. In business, professional and managerial roles were mostly dominated by Protestants, with Catholics usually relegated to lower-paid positions. Catholics who were able to advance in business practiced similar favoritism. Both communities patronized businesses run by co-religionists whenever possible. Free enterprise, one of history’s most tried-and-true tools in fostering peace and undermining barriers between cultures, was instead subsumed into them.

The post-1921 arrangement in Northern Ireland was bound to face resistance, and it did from an organized civil rights movement beginning in the 1960s. The Northern Irish Civil Rights Association (NICRA) was the primary organization leading this movement, and its goals were mostly non-sectarian: protesting housing and employment discrimination, gerrymandered districts and abuses of power. However, it quickly and irreversibly became attached to Catholic identity and Republican politics, making it radioactive for Protestants to support. Indeed, by this point the two communities were so firmly entrenched in rivalry with each other that as the civil rights movement grew more active, loyalist impulses grew stronger among Protestants who sought to counter it.

The minister-turned-activist Ian Paisley led a potent counter-movement, while the ranks of paramilitaries like the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) swelled. On top of this, the RUC and British Army frequently practiced violent repression of marches and demonstrations, even working at times with Protestant paramilitaries. Violent clashes culminated in the Bloody Sunday massacre of 1972, in which British soldiers massacred 13 participants in a peaceful demonstration. It was this demonstrated lack of respect for free speech that pushed many Irish Catholics into the arms of the Provisional IRA, which embraced violence and became the dominant force in the nationalist movement. They and their Protestant counterparts began a cycle of tit-for-tat terrorism that did not end until 1998.

The failure of Northern Ireland’s civil rights movement and the descent into violence that followed illustrate the damage done by the construction of two separate and opposing identities in Northern Ireland, particularly as carried out through the use of force. Centuries of division along every line, great and small, made it nearly impossible for Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland to make common purpose and understand each other’s interests.

There was no opening for an Irish Martin Luther King, a leader who could bridge divides and work for both justice and unity. It was possible to be black or white, a liberal or a conservative, and support the American civil rights movement; the same could not be said of Catholics and Protestants, or nationalists and unionists.

Even if such a possibility existed, the lack of political freedom in Northern Ireland snuffed it out in its infancy. Without explicit legal protection for freedom of speech and assembly, the Stormont government and the British Army were empowered to violently and aggressively suppress dissent. This repression exacerbated Northern Ireland’s centuries-old divisions, pushing people on both sides even further away from reconciliation and toward violence.

Even now, 20 years after the bullets stopped flying, those same divisions still exist. In the years since the agreement, Sinn Féin (the Republican political party linked to the Provisional IRA) and the Democratic Unionist Party (the radical loyalist party founded by Paisley) have grown in influence while their moderate counterparts have shrunk. Clashes over power between the two parties have left Northern Ireland’s devolved government without a functioning executive since January 2017, raising the possibility of direct rule from London.

This is not just mere posturing from power players but reflects deep popular divisions that have flared up even in response to purely symbolic developments: in 2013, a decision by the Belfast city council to fly the Union Jack 18 days a year as opposed to every day was met with widespread protests, which included rioting and terroristic threats, from Ulster loyalists. Meanwhile, the specter of the IRA’s return is continually resurfacing.

What the Northern Irish still lack, which keeps them from taking the next step, is space to talk about politics without dredging up symbols of heritage and creed. Poll data shows that the Northern Irish have still not settled on a common identity, with Catholics and Protestants choosing, in overwhelming numbers, to eschew that demonym in favor of “Irish” and “British,” respectively. There are precious few issues in Northern Irish politics in which one’s opinion cannot be linked in some way to one’s ethno-religious affiliation, and those linkages still remain the most powerful rallying cry for Catholics and Protestants.

Important policy questions such as the looming issues surrounding Brexit and its possible implications for the free flow of people and goods across border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland thus remain ripe for exploitation by radical actors on either side. If Northern Ireland cannot find a way to separate political questions from culture and identity, any contentious political issue will be a threat to peace.

The Troubles were a violent outgrowth of divisions that had been nurtured in Northern Ireland for centuries. Catholic and Protestant in Northern Ireland did not merely represent denominational differences, but profound cultural and political alignments that set ordinary people wholly against each other. These barriers were comprehensively nurtured through both formal restrictions on speech and association and informal reinforcement through networks at all levels of society.

The depth of these divisions made tension and conflict inevitable, and peace tenuous, by inhibiting cross-denominational social and economic interaction. These are the lessons of Northern Ireland. Americans who would seek to mend our own wounds by restricting speech, aggressively policing cultural appropriation and fostering identity politics would do well to heed them.

Western Media Scrub Mention Of Hamas From Headlines On Israeli Clash,"Every once in awhile, the Western media finds itself complacent in playing to the narrative of those opposed to liberal values. In an attempt to seem universalist and open-minded, the international press often portrays immensely complicated global conflicts in Leibniz terms that fit their progressive and simplistic paradigm. In the course of such oversimplification, the press becomes increasingly more apt to demonize Western nations in order to fit their reductionist narrative.

Take, for example, the recent events in Gaza. This past Friday, before the first night of Passover, the Palestinian-Arab terrorist group Hamas launched a series of protests on the Gaza Strip near the Israeli border. Over the course of the afternoon, the protests turned violent, as Palestinian-Arabs heaved rocks and firebombs towards the border fence and sent tires engulfed in flames towards Israeli soldiers. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) responded in kind by targeting those civilians instigating violence or attempting to breach the border wall. In total, seventeen Palestinian-Arabs were killed in confrontations with Israeli soldiers, while over a thousand others were injured in the clashes.

For context, Hamas labeled the planned six-week insurrection the “March of Return,” a reference to the Palestinian-Arab desire to return to Israeli land after their defeat in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and subsequent departure. Hamas planned the protests to coincide with the Palestinian-Arab holiday known as “Land Day,” a day in 1976 when Israeli security forces killed six Arab-Israelis who were protesting the appropriation of Arab-owned land in northern Israel.

At the behest and encouragement of Hamas, roughly 20,000 Palestinian-Arab civilians set up five large camps near the border fence, demanding the “right” to enter Israeli land. The final “push” of the six-week protests will involve rushing the border wall on May 15, the day coined by the Palestinian-Arabs as nakba or “the catastrophe,” a politically absurd reference to Israeli Independence, which occurred on May 14, 1948. May 15 holds particular contention this year, since it is also the day upon which President Trump will open the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem.

In response to the Hamas-led protests, the IDF tweeted, “Hamas is responsible for violent riots and everything taking place under its jurisdiction. The IDF will not allow the security fence to be turned into an area of terror.” The IDF had earlier alluded to the existence of various terror sites within the rioting encampments, whose chaos Hamas has used to “camouflage” its terrorist activities next to the border wall.

Friday’s headlines did not disappoint in their failure to properly assign blame to the responsible parties. From The New York Times, the headline read “Israeli military kills 15 Palestinians in Confrontations at Gaza Border.” And from Reuters, “Israeli forces kill 16 Palestinians in Gaza border protests: Gaza medics.” And from CNN, “Gaza protests: 17 Palestinians killed in confrontations with Israeli forces” The LA Times performed its job, as well: “15 Palestinians reported killed by Israeli fire as Gaza border protest builds.” Like clockwork, various outlets have whitewashed any mention of Hamas from their headlines, though Hamas is solely responsible for instigating the violence. In fact, the media categorically ignore much of the context behind the Palestinian-Arab frustrations that have nothing to directly do with Israel.

For those unfamiliar with the various cadres of ineffective and corrupt Palestinian-Arab “leadership,” Hamas is the Sunni-Islamic fundamentalist faction that consolidated control of the Gaza Strip following the Battle of Gaza in 2007. As of now, Hamas remains in league with the Palestinian Authority (PA), the subordinate governing organ that controls the rest of the Palestinian-controlled territories in Judea and Samaria.

While the international community is strangely more forgiving of the PA, about 10 percent of its budget, which amounts to roughly $350 million, is allocated towards funding terrorism against neighboring Israelis. Similarly, there is no shortage of “Days of Rage” — public days of protest condoned and sponsored by the government — that Chairman Mahmoud Abbas has incited in an attempt to weaponize his own civilians against the Israeli army and distract from his own miserable approval rating within the Palestinian-controlled territories.

Indeed, much of what we are currently witnessing on the Gaza border is a direct attempt by Hamas to weaponize the Palestinian-Arabs under its control, much as the PA has done. According to reports from the IDF, Hamas is systematically goading its civilians to rush the wall in the hopes of drawing Israeli soldiers into confrontation with the civilians. For example, the IDF reported that a seven year-old Palestinian-Arab girl had approached the fence but that they were able to locate the young girl’s parents. The IDF then released a statement: “Hamas cynically uses women and children, sending them to the fence and endangering their lives.”

Israel’s cynicism of Hamas’s use of human shields is well-placed. Civilian deaths at the hands of Israeli soldiers capture the attention of the international media and result in the collective demonization of Israel, irrespective of whether the civilians were engaging in violence prior to being killed. With the Western media’s willingness to portray Israel as the routine aggressor despite the Israeli military following highly specific and moral rules of engagement, the Hamas method of using civilians as bait will continue to be a successful tactic for shoring up international apologia for the terrorist group.

Israeli reporter Caroline Glick summarizes this pernicious strategy well: “Hamas’s strategy of harming Israel by forcing its soldiers to kill Palestinians is predicated on its certainty that the Western media will act as its partner and ensure the success of its lethal propaganda stunt … So long as the media and the left rush to indict Israel for its efforts to defend itself and its citizens against its terrorist foes, who turn the laws of war on their head as a matter of course, these attacks will continue and they will escalate.”

There is also an additional element to the international press’s desire to frame the Arab-Israeli conflict in a negative manner toward Israel and it fits the Left’s theory of intersectionality. Elliott Hamilton, Daily Wire writer and former research associate for Americans for Peace and Tolerance, describes the Left and Western media’s propensity to blame Israel for Hamas’ actions as an example of turning non-westerners into a noble savage, a literary stock character that represents the “outsider” who usually garners sympathy due to his assumed goodness and his adamant resistance to a corrupt civilization:

“The Left’s propensity to view the world through the prism of race and ethnicity results in them blaming seemingly white, European, Christian, and Jewish entities to be at fault for every apparent disadvantage that non-Westerners face. In their eyes, the supposedly oppressed non-Westerners can do no wrong and are in the right when it seeks to resist against the supposed oppressors. Conveniently, they will actively ignore the most dangerous aspects of any given entity, such as Hamas’ modus operandi to wage genocide against the Jewish people.”

Hamilton suggests that by framing the Palestinian-Arabs as the “other” and placing the entirety of the blame on Israel for the tragic situation that the people of Gaza live under, the international press engages in the soft bigotry of low expectations, where the Palestinian-Arab leadership seeks to lack the agency to charter alternative directions to better the people they supposedly represent. This deeply-seeded racism within the progressive media elites obscures the nuance of the conflict and it prevents us from being able to actively discuss and tackle long-standing problems within the ranks of the Palestinian-Arab leadership.

I encourage you to actively examine how the international press portrays the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, taking special note of how the Israeli response to Palestinian-Arab aggression is categorically portrayed as the source of said conflict, rather than as the only logical diffuser. The Gaza protests are yet another battlefield for the press to display its overwhelming commitment to a narrative that only emboldens terrorism.

Law Students Protest Free Speech Talk With Shouts Of ‘F-ck The Law’,"The latest “non-platforming” of a speaker at a purported academic institution happened to my good friend and sometime co-author Josh Blackman at City University of New York Law School two weeks ago, when he attempted to give a lecture on the importance of free speech on campus. As he wrote on his blog in an epic post accompanied by copious pictures and video, once publicity for the event began after spring break, enraged students began planning a protest.

When Josh asked his host, the president of CUNY’s Federalist Society chapter, why his classmates were up in arms, he got the explanation that “first, that this is a Federalist Society event; and second, they saw a few of your writings (specifically a National Review article praising Sessions for rescinding DACA and ACA), and instantly assume you’re racist; and third, our event being titled about free speech is reminiscent of events that claim free speech just to invite people like Milo Yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter.”

Indeed, that sentiment resulted in Josh being greeted with assorted signs. Some attacked him personally: “Josh Blackman you are not welcome here” and “Pronouns matter, Josh Blackman does not.” Others went after the Federalist Society, which some smeared was “founded to uphold white supremacy.” Still others took on the Constitution itself: “The First Amendment is a weak shield for white supremacy” and “The First Amendment is not a license to dehumanize marginalized people.”

Then there were the ones proposing novel equations: “My existence > Your opinion,” “Constitutional originalism = White supremacy,” and “Conservative hate ≠ Intellectual debate.” And some were aimed at their own school: “Shame on CUNY: Don’t give oppressors a platform” and the related “No platform for fascists.” Finally, some apparently tried to make deep points of postmodern theory, such as “We reject the myth of legal objectivity.”

My favorite was probably the juxtaposition of signs saying “Your legal analysis is lazy and wrong” and “F-ck off”—both held by the same person. I mean, wow. Where to begin?

The Federalist Society arose in the early 1980s to combat the left-wing tilt of the legal academy. (Full disclosure: I’ve been a member for nearly 20 years and have spoken at more than 500 events without protest, although apparently this year the Vermont Law School administration nixed a planned invite.) Conservatives and libertarians are in the decided minority at essentially all law schools, so it functions as part counter-programming, part support group.

And it’s nerdy, really nerdy. If you want to hear debates on Supreme Court cases and theories of constitutional interpretation, it’s for you. If you want political red meat, you’ll have to look elsewhere.

Josh supports the DREAM Act, and said so at CUNY, which provoked gasps and a cry of “gaslighting.” His position is simply that this good policy needs to be legislated, that the president can’t enact it on his own. The protestors just couldn’t fathom that something can be a good idea and yet not legal.

Moreover, Josh is one of the most mild-mannered people I know. A professor at South Texas College of Law Houston and adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute, he writes forcefully and has a definite point of view, but he’s neither a bomb-thrower nor a troll. If the students were savvy enough to do background research, they would know that he and Milo have nothing in common. Josh is a budding public intellectual, not an attention-seeking entertainer.

He also showed his skill as a teacher by making an object lesson of Obama’s Deferred Action for Child Arrivals executive orders, which seemed to be at the heart of the student opposition. “The lesson is you can support something as a matter of policy,” he began to explain before yet another interruption, “but find that the law does not permit it. And then the answer is to change the law.”

The mob’s response to that rather obvious and banal point was “f-ck the law.” An incredulous Josh could only reply, “You are all in law school. And it is a bizarre thing to say ‘f-ck the law’ when you are in law school.”

Gee, it’s no surprise that so many law students struggle to find jobs, and that was the case at CUNY even before the Great Recession. But more broadly, it saddens me that these kinds of attitudes have infected our public discourse. Everyone assumes the absolute worst about the other side’s motivations and couldn’t care less about following the proper procedures for getting what they want.

As yet another sign put it, “Rule of law = white supremacy, violence against [people of color], violence against immigrants.” I guess the protestors’ position really is that when the law points you in an unfavorable policy direction, you’re a white supremacist. (And why is “white supremacist” the trendy slur these days anyway? Could it be that “racist” was thrown around arbitrarily for so long that it doesn’t mean anything anymore?)

By a Sunday email to Inside Higher Ed, CUNY Dean Mary Lu Bilek said the protest was “reasonable” and there would be no investigation or sanction of the students involved. This, even though hours before Blackman’s event, she emailed out to the student body CUNY’s Policy on Freedom of Expression and Expressive Conduct. That policy contains the following: “1.2 The freedom to express ideas does not mean that individuals may exercise that freedom in ways that are incompatible with the functioning of the University and the rights of other members of the community to freedom of expression and to a full and equal opportunity to pursue their education and to participate in the benefits of the University. . . . 2.2 Examples of prohibited conduct that adversely affects or directly threatens to adversely affect the health or safety of persons or their right to a full and equal opportunity to pursue their education and to participate in the benefits of the University include: … shouting down or otherwise preventing a speaker from delivering remarks at a program or event at a college campus or ejecting participants in a public forum or meeting because of their viewpoint.”

See also the CUNY Law Student Handbook, page 85 of which contains the “Rules of the university”: “1. A member of the academic community shall not intentionally obstruct and/or forcibly prevent others from the exercise of their rights. Nor shall she/he interfere with the institution’s educational process or facilities, or the rights of those who wish to avail themselves of any of the institution’s instructional, personal, administrative, recreational, and community services. . . . 5. Each member of the academic community or an invited guest has the right to advocate his position without having to fear abuse—physical, verbal, or otherwise from others supporting conflicting points of view.”

In the end, Josh handled himself admirably and deserves kudos for persisting despite the opprobrium thrown his way. But this doesn’t bode well for the future.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/04/17/law-students-protest-free-speech-talk-shouts-f-ck-law/,2018-04-17
"The Teacher Strikes Aren’t About Pay, They’re About Mobilizing Democrats","Teachers all over the country are going on strike. They say they want higher salaries and education funding and the tax increases necessary to pay for them. But there’s a bigger motivation underlying the strikes — mobilizing Democrats.

The strikes began in West Virginia on Feb. 22 when teachers walked off the job. They demanded higher salaries and relief from increasing health insurance costs. The teachers stayed off the job until March 7. The legislature approved a 5 percent pay increase for all state employees. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice appointed a task force to lower healthcare costs.

The strikes spread to Kentucky. The issue in Kentucky was not teacher pay, but pension reform. The state, like many others, is dealing with an unfunded pension liability crisis. The state owes $43.4 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. Something had to be done and the Kentucky legislature reformed the pension system. The system moved away from the traditional pension model and more towards 401(k)s. Kentucky teachers revolted and protested at the state Capitol. The protests forced the closure of schools in around two-dozen counties. Yet, Gov. Matt Bevin stood firm.

The next state to experience the wrath of the teachers was Oklahoma. On March 29, Gov. Mary Fallin signed a bill increasing teacher salaries by an average of $6,000. The pay increases were funded by the state’s first tax increase in over two decades. But, this pay raise and the tax increases that paid for them were not enough. Teachers went on strike in Oklahoma anyway starting on April 2. The 9 day strike ended with no additional concessions.

Then they came to Arizona. Teachers walked off the job on April 26 after rejecting a pay raise proposal from Gov. Doug Ducey. He proposed raising teacher pay 20 percent over three years, paid for by increased state revenue growth and small cuts.

But that was not good enough for the #RedForEd movement, which is the umbrella group leading the strike. They are demanding a 20 percent raise this year, a $1 billion increase in education funding, pay increases for support staff, and an end to corporate tax cuts. They’re also proposing an increase in income taxes on high earners.

Finally, Colorado has been hit by the teachers’ strikes and protests, which began on April 26. Teachers there are demanding a pay increase and are opposing pension reforms. However, due to Colorado’s unique Taxpayer Bill of Rights, Colorado voters must approve any tax increase to increase teacher pay and education funding. Teachers’ unions plan on taking the ballot to Colorado voters in November.

What do all of these strikes and protests have in common? They are taking place in states where Democrats are either trying to make gains or consolidate their power in this fall’s elections.

Democrats are trying to keep Sen. Joe Manchin in power in West Virginia. In Kentucky, Democrats are trying to retake the legislature and would love to oust Matt Bevin in 2019. In Oklahoma, Democrats are looking to build on their legislative gains in special elections and maybe even grab a Congressional seat. Arizona Democrats are looking to win the open Senate seat, grab the state Senate, and pull off an upset in the governor’s race. Finally, Democrats are fighting to retain the governor’s mansion, gain the state Senate, and grab a couple of Congressional seats in Colorado.

These protests are in line with other tools the left has employed to try and maintain momentum against President Trump and Republicans. Like the “Women’s March” and the “March For Our Lives,” these protests and strikes by teachers are giving Democrats and the left an opportunity to mobilize voters and activists.

What the Democrats and their allies among the teacher activists are doing is following the playbook outlined by Saul Alinsky in “Rules for Radicals.” These protests are part of an attempt to keep pressure up on conservatives and Republicans.

The attacks by #Resist and their allies are meant to come from different directions. First was the pro-abortion “Women’s March” that was designed to paint Republicans and conservatives as anti-woman. Then came the left-wing activist led so-called “March for Our Lives” designed to paint the right as supporting the murder of children by guns. Now comes the #RedForEd which is now designed to paint the right as anti-education and anti-children.

The frequently changing topics is Alinsky’s Rule 7 in action. That rule is, “A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.” The left knows that if they harp on calling the right “anti-woman” or even “murderers,” that becomes old after awhile. Now, they can attack them as anti-education. Surely before the midterms in November, the left will pick another cause du jour. It’s how they operate.

How can we fight back against #RedForEd and their teacher union allies? For starters, we point out the fundamental truth of the education debate. Despite the rhetoric of the left, more money does not improve education performance. The rest of the developed world spends less on education than the U.S. and enjoys better test scores.

Then we have to break the government school monopoly. We need to expand school choice options such as charter schools, vouchers, and education savings accounts. Empowering parents to choose what education is best for their children is popular among parents and increases student performance.

We also need to address the problem of school administrator bloat. The number of K-12 administrators has grown 2.3 times more than student enrollment over the past 20 years. Surely, we can find some more money for education by reducing this overhead.

Finally, if there are to be teacher pay increases, it must be tied to performance. Merit pay works and increases student performance. If teachers want to be paid more, they must earn it like employees in the private sector.

Despite the claims in the propaganda of #RedForEd, teachers are not underpaid and often enjoy benefits that are not available to most workers in the private sector. While we should be fair to teachers, we must be fair to taxpayers and not burden them with additional taxes.

The Catholic Church’s Support Of Celibacy Doesn’t Make It Like Feminism,"“The wife obeys Christ when she obeys her husband” says Elise Crapuchettes in her book titled “Popes and Feminists: How the Reformation Frees Women from Feminism” (emphasis added). Such a claim of the divine legitimacy of patriarchy may not be so surprising to many readers today in light of evangelicals’ #MeToo moment, where Southern Baptist Seminary President Paige Patterson is being asked to resign for counseling submission to abuse.

The common and normative “submit to your husband no matter what” mentality is prevalent across a wide spectrum of Protestant denominations. I remember one conversation with another couple when I was part of a micro-Reformed Protestant subculture: A wife submits no matter what, even to the level of her husband telling her how to clean the toilet. “Yes, even if he says ‘with a toothbrush.’” When I disagreed with that kind of thinking, I was accused of having imbibed “the feminist philosophy.”

That is one of the most fundamental problems within these circles: they see “the evil of feminism” lurking behind assertions of even basic agency for women. Although this subculture has variegated branches, they all have in common a hierarchical complementarian theology developed by John Piper and Wayne Grudem as a response to egalitarian Protestants.

The kernel of hierarchical complementarity is the claim that the biblically mandated position of man-woman relations in marriage requires the subordination or submission of the woman to the man. Viewed from the Catholic perspective, both hierarchical complementarity and egalitarian theories of the relationship of husband and wife are distortions of their mutual submission to Christ and to one another, their distinctions as man and woman, and their ontological complementarity found in Catholic integral complementarity.

Swinging Between Extremes Is Not an Answer

No one can doubt that Crapuchettes and her fellow travelers dissent from feminism, which is antithetical to the doctrine of hierarchical complementarianism. Although the framing of the argument is nominally that of marriage, the application of the theory often spills over to broader male-female relations. Recently there has been a debate within this subculture about whether men can learn theology from women either by reading books written by women or by allowing women to become theology professors that teach men who are being trained as pastors. This context is very important in order to understand the author and her broader milieu. From her hierarchical complementarian perspective, the Catholic Church can seem more “egalitarian” and, depending on one’s degree of myopia, even “liberal” or “feminist.”

The working thesis of “Popes and Feminists”—which, despite its numerous footnotes, is a poorly sourced, poorly argued book deserving of anonymity if not for a favorable review in this space—is that modern feminism is like sixteenth-century Catholicism, telling women that they “have to leave the home to make a difference in the world,” and that it was the Reformers and the doctrines of the Reformation that set medieval women free from nunneries and the corruption of the Catholic Church, by setting them on the path to a high view of marriage and motherhood.

She does not prove her thesis. As a Catholic convert from the same Reformed persuasion as Crapuchettes, I’ve given her a hearing and attempted to read with charity. But in the final analysis, the only possible way for her claims to be true is if one collapses the entirety of Catholic teaching to a handful of half-truths, and to narrow the theologically rich Catholic Christianity down to some wicked popes and foul priests.

You don’t get points for linking wicked popes to today’s feminism. There are more logical and consequential historical lines to our modern problems. I don’t want to get into the blame game for who really is to blame for the culture out of which modern radical feminism arose. Amy Welborn has a hefty piece on that at The Catholic World Report.

Read Catholics Making Catholic Arguments

If you are going to accuse the Catholic Church of Manichaeism (by name or by implication), you should research and read what the church and her theologians wrote against this heresy, and how they clarified and distinguished Christian dogma from such heresies. In other words, if you’re going to claim that the Catholic Church taught that sex in marriage was a sin—which is what Crapuchettes claims—or that the church “redefined” grace, faith, and justification, you ought to be reading primary church documents, not the church’s theological enemies.

The book reeks of anti-Catholicism, of the unscholarly type, and that makes it difficult to take seriously. It’s intellectually sloppy for a Protestant to engage with the faith claims of Catholics while quoting Catholics in abbreviated form, through Protestant mouthpieces.

The rare case of a Catholic primary source does not fare much better. While researching Crapuchettes’s sources, I noticed a partial sentence from Sister Prudence Allen—a contemporary Catholic philosopher, and a brilliant expositor of the Catholic Church’s teaching on women and human dignity.

I happen to be familiar with some of her work, and I traced that partial sentence back to its source. Crapuchettes uses it in a way to make it look like Allen said the Catholic Church embraced Aristotle’s views (in particular on women) in their totality, yet it was taken from a discussion in which Allen was specifically discussing the scope and limitations of Aristotelian ideas the scholastics brought into the church. To be sure, some of Aristotle’s ideas about the inferiority of women did find their way into Catholic academia of the time. But they were also resisted.

Before addressing the core of her argument, I want to dispense with an accusation which many anti-Catholic Protestants often make. Crapuchettes—predictably—asserts that: “In Catholic theology (historically and presently), the authority of the pope supersedes the authority of the Word of God.” Anyone giving a reading to Catholic, or even fair non-Catholic sources will know this is pure falsehood, yet this historical slander finds a place in this book, one riddled with such false, didactic sentences.

The “bogeyman” claim of unwarranted doctrinal papal authority is also rich coming from an author who lives within a Benedict Option-type community, under the leadership of a man wielding immense authority over his congregation’s lives and having a history of questionable decision-making on their behalf. Suffice it to say that the publisher of Crapuchette’s book is the in-house company started by this pastoral leader of her community to disseminate the doctrines he holds.

Does the Catholic Church Second-Rate Marriage?

Crapuchettes accuses the Catholic Church of the sixteenth century of being like modern feminists because the church encouraged women to choose a single life devoted to God in a convent. She writes that there is a parallel between modern feminists telling women that their only worth lies outside the home in a career, and the Catholic Church telling women that the only way to true holiness is to forsake marriage, home, and family and to become a nun.

In both cases, she claims, modern feminists and the Catholic Church downplay the role of wife and mother for the sake of something better outside the home. Ergo, the Catholic Church is like modern feminists. Her words: “American culture might be, in some ways, just repackaged popery.”

The church’s teaching on this subject is quite simple, and biblical, as in it takes the Bible seriously and obeys the words of its founder, Jesus Christ. The Roman Catholic Church advances two fundamental vocations for the human person: marriage, and celibate religious life and the priesthood. Both rest on biblical principles of the good of marriage and family, and the good of a life devoted to God.

In Matthew 19, when Jesus responds to the Pharisees on the question of marriage and divorce, his crestfallen disciples say: “If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.” Here’s his response to them:

Not all men can receive this precept, but only those to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it (emphasis added).

In 1 Corinthians 7:8-9,17, 27-28, and 32-34, Saint Paul writes:

I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has his own special gift from God, one of one kind and one of another. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain single as I do. But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion…. Only, let every one lead the life which the Lord has assigned to him, and in which God has called him…. Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek marriage. But if you marry you do not sin, and if a girl marries she does not sin. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that…. I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to please the Lord; but the married man is anxious about worldly affairs, how to please his wife, and his interests are divided. And the unmarried woman or virgin is anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit; but the married woman is anxious about worldly affairs, how to please her husband.

Contra Crapuchettes—who ironically does not engage with the biblical text—this does not mean that married people can’t love God or are “unholy.” St. Augustine, in “Of the Good of Marriage,” writes, concerning the “either/or” dichotomy some people like to infer:

What there he [St. Paul] says, ‘She, that is unmarried, thinks of the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit;’ we are not to take in such sense as to think that a chaste Christian wife is not holy in body.

The Catholic Church has never said that married women were not, or could not be, holy; she has only always maintained exactly what Scripture says, that the married man and woman’s first priority becomes their spouse and home, while the unmarried are free to devote themselves completely to God. Those who are called to marriage give the gift of themselves to their spouse, and those who are called to celibate priesthood or religious life (e.g., priests, monks, nuns, religious sisters and brothers) give the gift of themselves wholly to the kingdom of heaven. It is not my intention to give a full defense of the priesthood; Bishop Robert Barron makes a case here for those interested.

During the history of the Roman Catholic Church, both vocations existed from the time of Saint Paul, and the church has attempted to support both/and. There were seasons in the church when the surrounding culture may have placed emphasis on one rather than the other.

St. Jerome, for instance, is said to have erred on the side of virginity—to wit, holding up the celibate religious life as more excellent than marriage. Yes, there have been people in the history of the Roman Catholic Church who give the sense that somehow sex even within marriage carries with it a tinge of sin. But this is not the official teaching of the church.

The Catholic Church Highly Esteems Marriage

It is hard to argue that the Catholic Church holds marriage in low esteem when it is the Catholic Church, not Protestantism, that maintains marriage is a sacrament, and which continues to maintain after 2,000 years, contra all the Protestant world, that Jesus meant what he said about divorce (Matthew 19: 3-12).

The Protestant view? Well, in a chapter titled “Protestant Marriage Instead of Catholic Celibacy,” Crapuchettes quotes a Heinrich von Kettenbach, a Franciscan monk who joined the Protestant Reformation: “I believe that God has so established marriage, that a pious married person, even one who has been married three times, is more esteemed by God than a monk or a nun who has been chaste for thirty years. Therefore, I reckon the fruit of marriage to be a hundredfold, and that of monks and nuns [the equivalent of] three ripe pears.”

The Roman Catholic Church is at her best when both vocations are functioning properly and strengthening each other.

Apparently, in Crapuchette’s book, an ex-monk putting words in God’s mouth without justification suffices as an argument for serial marriage and against chastity.

My argument is not that there are no unfaithful Catholics. There have always been unfaithful followers of Christ throughout the church’s history, whether they were ordinary men and women, priests, bishops, or popes. Even today some dioceses have a relaxed annulment process that makes a mockery of what the Catholic Church officially teaches. There are also bishops, priests, and parishioners who do not faithfully practice the church’s teaching on contraception, marriage, divorce, remarriage, and other social and familial teaching.

So yes, there is definitely a disconnect in some places between the official teaching of the church and its implementation on the local level. This is why faithful Catholics are constantly calling on their brethren to repent and believe the gospel, and to walk faithfully in the truth of Christ.

In some Catholic circles today, there is a lot of talking and writing about the good of marriage and the family. No one means that as a disparagement of the vocation to the priesthood or religious life, but to some it can seem like that, just like in times past, due to the state of the surrounding culture, there may have been emphasis on the vocations to the priesthood and religious life, in a way that may have seemed demeaning to married life. The world needs both, and the Roman Catholic Church is at her best when both vocations are functioning properly and strengthening each other.

The Catholic Church at Its Best Celebrates Women

Crapuchettes makes many unfounded claims to boost her thesis that the Catholic Church was a dark, evil brothel, and the Protestant Reformation set all women free from this whorehouse. The Protestant motto from that time—post tenebras lux—which means, “after darkness, light,” echoes throughout her book.

Crapuchettes is oddly silent on 2,000 years’ worth of Catholic women who worked side-by-side with men.

Yet Crapuchettes is oddly silent on 2,000 years’ worth of Catholic women who worked side-by-side with men, within the Catholic Church and in their families for the sake of the gospel: the women of the New Testament, Monica the mother of Augustine, Hildegard of Bingen, Catherine of Siena, Christine de Pizan, Teresa of Ávila, modern women like Dorothy Day and Mother Teresa; and women without number up and down the centuries, married and unmarried, who lived by faith in Jesus and gave their all for the kingdom of heaven; women of whom the world is not worthy.

The Roman Catholic Church is not afraid to call some of these women doctors of the church, because they are seen as top-tier theologians, from whom all—women and men—can learn of the glory of God and man’s place in the cosmos.

The Roman Catholic Church today has the most complete, beautiful, and robust doctrine on love, marriage, and sexuality. This didn’t come about ex nihilo. It was a struggle, a product of 2,000 years of faithfulness by brilliant men and women working out their calling in the church, and yes, by sometimes correcting her from within. In “Popes and Feminists,” Crapuchettes attempts to teach women that being a wife and a mother is a good and high calling—a noble desire to be sure, and one I favor—but what a grievous and destructive approach.

Why Publix Shouldn’t Have Tried To Pander To Gun Control Protesters,"Publix is a Florida-based grocer known throughout the southeast. They treat their employees well, maintain a wholesome image, and sell what are known to us native Floridians as the best sub sandwiches on the planet. In late May, though, they found themselves arbitrarily thrust into a national gun debate in which they had no stake and seemed to want nothing to do with. They hopefully learned that there is no winning in stupid battles.

One might wonder how a purveyor of foods and dry goods got wound into a gun debate. Publix sells no guns or ammunition. Its shelves will leave you with no impression of what how the newest Austrian duty pistol handles or what you should attach to your AR. It started when David Hogg noticed that the chain, who regularly donates to political candidates irrespective of party, had made donations to state Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Putnam. The issue? Putnam was guilty of making non-particularized pro-National Rifle Association comments on Twitter, or something.

To call attention to Publix’s alleged three- or four- times removed support of the NRA, Hogg and his co-conspirators organized a “die-in” at the Florida supermarket. The idea was to lay down in the aisles of the store, inconveniencing and confusing customers, with the goal of ending Publix’s support of Putnam, and thus their apparent support of gun rights. Or something. It’s hard to pin down the purpose of the protest in light of the fact that Publix suspended all political contributions days before the protest.

Publix’s move was tactically sound. They knew a particularly rabid group of protestors had trained on them, poised to stage a PR disaster. Knowing their support of Putnam was at the core of the issue, Publix decided to temporarily suspend all political contributions and “re-evaluate” their giving process, and release a statement ahead of the protest.

It was a clever move, to noncommittally give the protesters what they were asking for in hopes they would be satisfied. The issue is, though, that the protesters didn’t actually care. Even though the decision was made ahead of the May 25 “die-in,” protesters weren’t aware of the decision until after their display, so they considered it a victory. Some reports incorrectly claimed the decision came after the protest, with protesters and journalists alike failing to do their research, further confusing the matter.

In hindsight, it is clear that there was nothing Publix could have done to prevent the protest. With only a few days of lead, they managed to suspend the donations. Hogg made an additional demand immediately ahead of the protest for $1 million to be donated to a victim’s fund and that the company “never support an A rated NRA politician again.”

There was obviously no time for Publix to respond to this. Hogg’s statement would be made and Publix would have to deal with it. Even though the company seemed to respond by ceasing political contributions, they still faced anger from the anti-gun crowd for not acquiescing to subsequent extortive demands for money and that the protesters be allowed to dictate the privately held corporation’s giving philosophy. Simple demands, really.

Anti-gun protesters were not the only ones upset about Publix’s actions, though. The pro-gun crowd viewed the company’s suspension of political donations, despite being non-committal, as too easily “giving in” to the demands of the Hogg trouppe. Naturally, this spurred yet more boycotting. Of a grocery store. Regarding guns.

The moral here is that there was nothing Publix could have done in response to the protests that would have satisfied anyone. This should come as no surprise given how ludicrous the concept of protesting guns at a grocery store is from the get-go. We know that Publix “did not intent to put [their] associates and the customers they serve in the middle of a political debate.” They were thrust into one, regardless. This comes in the midst of several other examples of nonsensical organizational involvement in political issues like Disney’s Rosanne calamity and the NFL’s various fits.

These controversies show the true absurdity of “corporate wokeness.” It’s stupid to attempt to force divisive political change through business. A business needs to watch out for its shareholders. Sure, there are circumstances in which shareholders are benefited by the company taking a stance on an issue that has the nation divided. One would probably find it pretty odd for a gun company to publicly denounce gun owners, for example.

With a grocer, however, it’s clear Publix had no interest in the gun debate, and attempting to force them into such a debate yields no winners. When businesses are forced into political battles, the question stops being about what individuals think, and becomes about cementing tribalism and reinforcing battle lines. What is the end goal? To wage ideological wars, the winners of which earn the privilege to shop at the battleground stores in which they prevailed? For us to have our stances on guns, drugs, or abortion dictate where we buy our chicken? These are stupid battles, with no winners.

Publix would have been right to ignore the protesters outright and let the event blow over. Debates at Publix should surround more comprehensible issues, like whether it is their chicken tender or Italian sub that truly reigns supreme.

Trump Shouldn’t Punish Patriotic Eagles For Chris Long Being A PC Bro,"Donald Trump has decided to cancel the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles’ trip to the White House after the team announced it would only send a contingent of 10 players, not the whole team. Sadly, the president is punishing patriotic Eagles who wish to attend, because some players like Chris Long can’t stop being PC bros.

That decision by the Eagles was prompted by the National Football League’s decision to bar players from protesting on field during the national anthem, an issue Trump has been somewhat strangely fixated on. It is an especially thin-skinned move by a president who, for all his Queens braggadocio, just can’t stand even the slightest insult.

As a lifelong fan of the Birds, I’m sure I am a little biased, but it seems to me that sending a portion of the team, a portion that wants to be there and includes Super Bowl MVP and miracle man Nick Foles, was a reasonable compromise by the Eagles in a tough situation. Some NFL players are upset that the league took the anti-protest action and are well aware that Trump rode the issue of player protests like an eight-year-old who got a pony for her birthday.

This also isn’t a particularly new or uncommon phenomenon. Many of last year’s champs the New England Patriots, including this year’s losing Super Bowl quarterback Tom Brady, skipped the White House event. The White House visit is a nice event. It’s fun, but it’s not exactly the North Korea summit in terms of importance. The question that jumps out upon Trump cancelling the event is why he is choosing to keep himself so involved in the player protest issue.

An Unhealthy Obsession

If I invite 15 people over for dinner at my place and only four or five can or choose to attend, I might be annoyed at those not coming, but I wouldn’t disinvite those who are because my feelings were hurt. It’s a weird thing to do. In this case, it is also the choice that is destined to draw far more media coverage than just holding the event with 10 Eagles there. Indeed, had smug anchors on the president’s least favorite networks mocked the small contingent of Eagles, they, not the president, would have seemed small and petty.

But alas, in any race to most easily offended it is ironically Donald Trump, destroyer of political correctness and slayer of snowflakes, who always comes in first. It is arguably the least attractive of the president’s personality traits, and one that makes those who support his policies but do not adore him shake our heads and say, “Why?” Why does he want to focus on this instead of just doing the event and moving on?

Trump’s choice to weigh in on the NFL protests again and again as president has made many observers deeply uncomfortable. Whatever one thinks of the anthem protests, the Eagles didn’t kneel, but safety Malcolm Jenkins did raise his fist, in the style of the 1968 Olympics. The players are protesting a real problem. Police often do not, or appear not to, treat black men in our country the same way they do white men. This is an issue that police forces themselves acknowledge and attempt to address.

But for the president, this issue is not only unimportant, he views raising it as a slight to the country and, more importantly, to himself. While the president is quick to condemn almost any celebrity not sufficiently deferential to Trump making great of America, he seems particularly bothered when black athletes won’t take a knee and appreciate him. Why the fixation on black athletes? That question is above my expertise, but it’s not a good look. It is also a tension that the president is actively courting.

This Is Not Uniting The Country

Trump is not particularly well known for taking the high road, but in this case he is taking an event that could have been fun and a good photo op for everyone and turning it into an opportunity to divide the nation yet again. How easy it would be to simply hold the event and take the credit for being the bigger man. But, for all his accomplishments in office, Trump is rarely the bigger man. He is more often the whining man furious over slights and insults. Sometimes it seems like Trump couldn’t be the bigger man in Munchkin Land. It’s just not in his nature.

It’s a shame, because not only does it make the president seem weak, these Eagles and particularly quarterback Foles are a perfect fit for this president. The team was a wild underdog with the motto “Nobody likes us, we don’t care.” That is downright Trumpian.

Maybe White House visits by championship teams are just something we should stop doing. Some players and this president don’t seem to able to hold the events without making it about their political beliefs. It’s just not fun anymore, which is too bad.

But what is really sad is how much of the country, on both sides, is acting like Trump and simply refusing to respect those who disagree with us politically. This is not a situation that Trump created, but it is one that he is making worse.

Picking Another National Anthem Fight Makes Trump Look Like A Loser,"The debate over the national anthem protests reignited last month when the NFL announced that they will be enforcing a new policy that requires its athletes to stand or face fines. What began with a handful of players (most famously Colin Kaepernick) became a heated political feud between President Trump and the entire NFL when he referred to kneelers as a “son of a b-tch” during a rally last September, causing hundreds of players to kneel during the anthem for the rest of the season.

The kneeling was supposed to draw attention to police brutality, but animosity towards the president hijacked the protests and the protests became largely about him. It was a culture war Trump was willing to wage and it largely worked in his favor. Poll after poll shows that the majority of Americans do not favor these protests, which many see as disrespecting the American flag and the military, and the NFL saw a huge decrease in viewership and game attendance.

But despite him being on the right side of the issue, Trump went too far in cancelling the Philadelphia Eagle’s visit to the White House. The White House says it was led to believe up until last Friday that most of the Super Bowl-winning team were planning to attend the event in their honor. Turned out fewer than ten players were going to show up.

So instead, Trump cancelled the event and issued this statement:

The Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House with their full team to be celebrated tomorrow. They disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country. The Eagles wanted to send a smaller delegation, but the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better. These fans are still invited to the White House to be part of a different type of ceremony — one that will honor our great country, pay tribute to the heroes who fight to protect it, and loudly and proudly play the National Anthem. I will be there at 3:00p.m. with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus to celebrate America.

There’s a lot to digest in this statement, the first being the “they disagree with their President” line. One of our greatest freedoms is to be allowed to express our dissent of those in power. While many of his haters are quick to compare him to a dictator over that remark, it’s simply egotistical of him to even imply that they did something wrong because they “disagreed” with the president.

Second, his statement strongly mischaracterized the Eagles, one of the few teams that actually stood for the national anthem throughout the whole season. Whether it was a gross generalization or flat-out dishonestly, it was wrong for Trump to make that assertion.

Finally, the statement painted the picture that the Eagles were ditching the White House visit out of disrespect for the anthem, but that’s not true. These players simply don’t like this president. Whether they think he’s a racist or a white supremacist or not, they apparently had no interest in doing a photo-op with him.

So in order to save face like he did with his invite withdrawal of the Golden State Warriors last year, Trump saved himself the embarrassment of being seen with a measly two or three players and a mascot instead of the entire team and scraped the event altogether in favor of the “Celebration of America.”

Perhaps the Eagles did in fact attempt to embarrass the president with their last-minute bow-out and attempt to reschedule the following week, which everyone knows is when Trump is having his high-stakes summit with North Korea. That’s what Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed on Tuesday. Obviously, they have the right not to show up, but while they also have the right to accuse Trump of dividing the country, the Eagles didn’t do much uniting for their part either.

Being invited to the White House should be an honor no matter who is the occupant. Whether it’s Trump, Obama, or Bush, you put your political differences aside in respect of the Oval Office and to preserve civility in this country. So the Eagles could have put a little more effort in extending an olive branch instead of pulling dirty tricks like they seem to have done.

Ultimately, President Trump comes off as the loser in this dustup mostly because disinviting the Philadelphia Eagles from coming after most of them decided not to come anyway comes off as petty and desperate. Trump already struck a victory with the NFL changing its policy so he could have taken the high road with this celebration no matter who showed up. Sadly, taking the high road isn’t exactly what this president is known for.

Baptists Consider President Who Supports Race And Sex Preferences,"At this week’s annual Southern Baptist Convention, America’s largest Protestant denomination will vote to select their next president. The process is usually of little interest to the rank and file of evangelicalism—candidates sometimes run unopposed—but this year’s campaign has been widely recognized as a “pivotal” clash between the “old guard” of the conservative resurgence and the rising Southern Baptist Left.

The primary policy issue is whether the SBC should pursue race- and sex-based proportions in hiring for leadership positions within the denomination. The two men running for president, J.D. Greear and Ken Hemphill, both have strong church credentials and unimpeached personal character. But they differ on how the church should respond to accusations of sexism leveled against SBC leaders and the widespread claim in the mainstream media that white evangelicals are racist because they voted for President Trump.

Hemphill’s platform emphasizes a responsibility within the convention to continue to “preach the whole counsel of God’s Word which teaches that racism is sin,” and highlights the important role of women within the church as found in the New Testament. Hemphill also seeks to recall and celebrate the SBC’s positive role in opposing racism in the South.

Greear’s platform is a little more pessimistic. “Our doctrine and our mission are solid,” Greear said in a recent campaign video, “but I think we need a new culture, and a new posture in the Southern Baptist Convention.” This culture would not be created by simply teaching more of “God’s Word,” but by repenting of a “failure to listen to and honor women and racial minorities” and “to include them in proportionate measures in top leadership roles.” This failure, Greear explained, had “hindered [the SBC’s] ability to see sin and injustice and call it out.”

While Greear does not specify what “failures” he is talking about, he is likely referring to accusations against Dr. Paige Patterson, a former president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. Patterson was recently fired on allegations that he has displayed a sexist attitude towards women at least twice in the past 20 years, and failed to properly report two incidents of rape. The failure-to-report accusations have been called into question by comparisons to documents from the time and a police report, but Patterson has not escaped a verdict of guilt in the public eye.

As the Washington Post pointed out, Patterson’s fall from grace has significant political implications within the denomination, since Patterson is “one of the main figures credited with steering the Southern Baptist Convention in the 1980s and ’90s away from liberalizing changes going on in the wider culture and into the conservative religious force it is now.”

Racism as a Sin of Which to Repent

Traditional Baptists tend to see racial biases within the church as a matter of “sin” that must be overcome by a “renewing of one’s mind,” whereby a common Christian identity overpowers secondary differences of sex, class, race, and ethnicity. Running on this platform, Hemphill argues that while there is much left to be done about racial relations in the SBC, “preaching the Gospel and pointing people to Jesus provides the most powerful way forward.” Hemphill cites the Apostle Paul’s writings in the New Testament, which, when addressing racial and ethnic tensions of the time, spoke of a higher call to follow Christ in breaking down cultural and ethnic barriers.

A story from his youth illustrates Hemphill’s approach. Having been raised in the South, Hemphill remembers the day his local public school was integrated. The first black student who walked into his high school chemistry class stood awkwardly at the door, not sure whether to come into the room. So Hemphill invited him to share his desk. Hemphill’s small act of kindness was certainly conscious of the cultural context, but it refused to be controlled by that culture, defying it in the name of Hemphill’s Christian upbringing.

Race relations, from this point of view, are a matter of individual moral responsibility. Since Christians are to be “renewed” in Christ in a manner that creates “no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman,” those who persist in creating such distinctions simply need more of the gospel.

Racism As a Sin for Which We Can’t Fully Repent

The Southern Baptist Left tend to see race and ethnicity within the church from a more sociological and institutional standpoint. In a recent sermon on racial reconciliation, Greear made no mention of the New Testament commands about race, sex, and class-based distinctions within the church, choosing instead to emphasize racially correlated differences of experience and opinion.

Greear reflected on how the racial bias that influenced his early education in the history of the church had created a subconscious bigotry within him that persists to this day. “During that time I never learned about Augustine and Athanasius, who are both Africans… I never learned that the first American missionary was not a white guy…. I ended up thinking that the ones who made civilization and church history were pretty much exclusively white, and if somebody of color had contributed to it, well then they were the exception. And that just leads to a way that I approach the world and a way that I approach people.”

While traditional Southern Baptists would likely argue that such bias should be combatted with a stronger commitment to leave behind “worldly” distinctions when approaching people within the church, Greear emphasizes strategic efforts to increase the percentage of church leadership that is non-white.

Greear reports that while only 17 percent of attendees at the megachurch he pastors are people of color, more than 33 percent of pastors and worship leaders are non-white. Aggressively pursuing people of color for leadership positions and prominence onstage helps his church have more of the conversations about race that the Left sees as the ultimate means of reducing white bigotry and ignorance.

Whether these kinds of measures really do work—not solely to eradicate racial bigotry, but also to fight sexism—is a matter open to question, and one of the main issues the SBC will be voting on in this year’s election. The outcome will be worth watching, not simply for those within the SBC, but also for Americans interested in the political trajectory of America’s largest Protestant denomination.

Update: J.D. Greear was elected president of the Southern Baptist Convention on Tuesday. The decision was released that afternoon.

Left Blames Evergreen’s Bat-Wielding Mobs On Anti-Racism Professor,"Noah Berlatsky is a herpes lesion on the lip of cultural criticism. This is someone who thinks Janis Joplin’s music is racist. He thinks the show “Altered Carbon” is racist. He can probably find racism in cloud formations and wood grain.

After several years of politicizing culture to within an inch of its life, he turned to politics. There, his attitude—that the world is divided into white supremacists, and people who agree with him—has guaranteed him an audience as a progressive journalist.

Berlatsky’s mendacity and sloppiness are known to a wide political swath. Jonah Mix, writing for Feminist Current, called him “the Platonic Ideal of cartoonishly worthless liberalism.” Jesse Singal’s 2017 article for New York Magazine, “There Have Been So Many Bad Lefty Free-Speech Takes Lately,” featured an excerpt from a Berlatsky essay, about which he said, “The level of wrongness contained in these two paragraphs is astounding.”

Berlatsky, then, is the man for the difficult job of carrying water for George Bridges, the disgraced (but for some reason, not yet fired) president of The Evergreen State College who stood by impotently while former professor Bret Weinstein was threatened with bodily harm for daring to contradict a social justice mob. We’re talking students carrying bats, searching cars, shutting down school, and holding university administrators prisoner after Weinstein merely expressed in a private email that he objected to a “Day of Absence” to exile white students from campus based solely on their race.

A ludicrous Evergreen analysis pinned blame for their campus mobs on Weinstein. In that analysis he is unnamed but easily recognizable as the “faculty member [who] took advantage of this situation to make a national news story out of it through high-profile interviews with national media, including the FOX News Network, that were used to make a political point, magnify the events’ significance, and ended up drawing to campus radical groups from the left and right, intent on causing further disruption and attracting more media attention to the Evergreen events.”

The “Independent External Review Panel” that authored the report consisted entirely of Bridges nominees.

If Weinstein Got Beaten, He Woulda Deserved It

That’s the background you need for Berlatsky’s recent missive for Pacific Standard, a hit job on Weinstein that does not recognize the slightest wrongdoing from social justice activists at Evergreen, nor the college’s spineless leadership. This, of course, is part of the larger project to rehabilitate the progressive brand, since progressivism has been the source of one frightful attack on free speech after another around the country.

Berlatsky has built a writing career out of redirecting accusations rightly directed at progressive targets back at the accusers. It’s basically “I know you are but what am I” for the college-educated. He is keen to present the Evergreen debacle as a conservative ploy to advance their agenda using free speech as a cover. Therefore he says they are the “real” threat to free speech.

“‘Free speech,’ wielded in bad faith by right-wing media, can turn into a gag to silence student protests and activism,” he says. Note the scare-quotes around “free speech.”

Days after Pacific Standard published his hit piece on Weinstein, NBC News posted a Father’s Day essay in which Berlatsky claimed that the crisis in masculinity is not the fault of feminism, but masculinity. This insipid table-turning is the utter extent of his analytical powers, and he does it over and over again.

His narrative about the “real” threat to free speech requires an attitude about the truth akin to a dog’s attitude about a fire hydrant, and Berlatsky delivers. A full account of the misstatements, lies of omission, and faulty reasoning would be longer than the article itself, but here are some highlights.

The Carlson Smear By Association Is Nonsense

Berlatsky elides one of the most important parts of the saga: “Though Weinstein calls himself a progressive,” he writes, “he went on the rabidly right-wing, anti-immigrant Tucker Carlson Tonight on Fox News shortly after the protests.” On Twitter, Berlatsky refers to Carlson as “a white supremacist asshole spouting false conspiracy theories.” In his article, he leaves the appearance unexplained, as if there were no explanation except that Weinstein should perhaps stop referring to himself as a progressive.

Berlatsky continues, “Weinstein’s appearance on Carlson alerted the far right to the anti-racist protests at Evergreen, unleashing a flood of hate mail and a credible far-right terrorist threat that led to administrators evacuating the campus for three days in June.” This media appearance is central to Bridges’ complaint as well. It seems to be Bridges’ main objection, and Berlatsky’s, that had Weinstein not gone to Fox with his story, then the Right would not known of his situation, and its trolls would not have targeted Evergreen.

In an interview with Glenn Loury from last June, Weinstein explained that when Carlson invited him on the show, it was clear that he intended to run a segment on the state of free speech at Evergreen with or without Weinstein’s interview. Weinstein hoped his appearance would provide the report a “nuanced view, rather than have a caricature portrayed.” Besides, he noted, “the degree to which the nominally left-leaning press has still not dealt with this story is amazing to me.”

Weinstein went on to say that, rather than his interview baiting alt-right types, his inbox was flooded with emails from Fox News viewers expressing appreciation of his willingness to engage intelligently and how much they respected him despite their differences in politics. He added that if Chris Hayes or Rachel Maddow had invited him appear on MSNBC at the time instead of Carlson, he would have preferred to do so.

Rule 5,692: Don’t Tell About Bad Things the Left Does

People on the Right would have found out about this free-speech fiasco one way or another. While nothing excuses a harassment campaign, laying responsibility for one at Weinstein’s feet is absurd. We could just as easily pin culpability on MSNBC for ignoring the story instead of airing it with the journalistic probity of which it is allegedly capable.

If the Berlatsky-Bridges position is that Weinstein should not have gone on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” while no liberal-sympathetic news outlet was interested the story, the obvious conclusion is that they think that he should have remained silent about the impossible and dangerous situation that he, his wife, their children, and Evergreen students trying to defend him were in. If that doesn’t “turn into a gag,” as Berlatsky puts it, it’s hard to imagine what does.

Berlatsky tries to make hay out of Weinstein not contradicting Carlson’s statement that the protesters outside of his classroom were demanding that all whites leave campus. Carlson had conflated that protest with the demand from a separate social justice effort for whites to leave campus for the school’s upcoming, annually observed Day of Absence. In the video, you can see Weinstein trying to keep up, in the midst of a slight audio lag, with Carlson’s question about what Bridges was doing in the midst of the mayhem, which was a more important issue to address.

But in describing the video, Berlatsky writes, “Carlson claimed that white people had been forced off campus, which was not true.” That statement is itself not true. At no point in the video did Carlson report that white people had been forced off campus. For all the culpability Berlatsky has tried to pin on Weinstein for allowing Carlson misrepresent the protesters, it’s clear that Berlatsky has no problem with misrepresentation per se.

The Threats Were as Real as a Baseball Bat

In Berlatsky’s tendentious retelling, “Evergreen became a crucible for the campus wars in March of 2017, when evolutionary biologist Bret Weinstein spoke against anti-racist protests and activities on campus. As a result, Weinstein claims, he was targeted with physical and verbal harassment.” Later he drops this doozy:

Weinstein also tweeted several pictures of college students who he claimed were involved in violence. For example, he claimed that students with bats were roaming campus, and used as evidence a clearly staged photo, unlinked to the protests, with no evidence that the students pictured were involved in any violence.

The “clearly staged photo” was this one. You can see some of the same students, with the same creative hair, some wearing the same outfits, in this video. Note that bat at the 1:40 mark.

https://youtu.be/ef6pQyspYAk

You would think one might question how one’s student-led social justice movement is going when your school’s Residential and Dining Service director is obliged to advise you, “Community patrols can be a useful tool for helping people to feel safe, however the use of bats or similar instruments is not productive. Some members of this group have been observed carrying batons and/or bats. Carrying bats is causing many to feel unsafe and intimidated. The bats must be put away immediately in order to protect all involved.”

To recap, social justice types wielding bats appeared proudly in an Instagram photo and were filmed walking the campus, armed.

To recap, social justice types wielding bats appeared proudly in an Instagram photo and were filmed walking the campus, armed, as credible reports emerged that vigilante social justice posses had taken to patrols. This is after the school’s police chief at the time, whom Bridges had ordered to stand down, told Weinstein that she could no longer guarantee his safety, and had witnessed student patrols looking from car to car in the faculty parking lot for who knows what. At that point, Weinstein had already been shouted out of his classroom and obliged to teach in a park.

Berlatsky’s complaint here is, seriously, that Weinstein illustrated his tweet about credible reports of Evergreen protesters with bats with a picture of Evergreen protesters with bats—one that they had taken themselves and posted to social media. Again Berlatsky implicitly blames Weinstein for the online abuse of the students posing in the Bat Patrol photo. It’s as if Weinstein had violated some kind of standard of evidence, as if it would have never occurred to anyone else to pair the photo with the circulating stories of marauding SJWs, and as if nobody would have targeted the subjects of that already widely circulated image if not for Weinstein.

The students in the photo were possibly not the same who screamed at him, “You’re useless, get the f-ck out of here, f-ck you, you piece of sh-t” when he approached them for rational dialogue, but Weinstein never said they were. I repeat that nothing justifies harassment campaigns, but the case against them overlaps heavily with the case against pursuing social justice with blunt weapons and shoving around people who don’t take you seriously enough for your liking, as has happened with Evergreen protesters.

Is Pacific Standard Doing PR for Evergreen?

Quite a few people have noticed that Berlatsky’s account is so flattering to the Bridges administration that Evergreen’s public relations staff could have written it. This is an appropriate thing to wonder about.

The majority of the attacks on free speech, free thought, due process, and academic liberty are coming from progressivism.

Benjamin Boyce, a former Evergreen student who has been covering its mismanagement and intellectual breakdown, broke the news that a self-evaluation Bridges recently submitted to the college’s Board of Trustees listed among administrative accomplishments that “a team of four staff and five student writers wrote more than 50 online stories highlighting achievements by students, faculty, staff, and alumni.” This effort “inaugurated new partnerships with NPR member stations and alternative weekly newspapers throughout the West Coast and Alaska.”

Does this “partnership” with West Coast media include the Santa Barbara-based Pacific Standard? If not, it would be easy enough to say so. Instead, when Boyce proposed that possibility to Berlatsky, the latter protested too much. “F-ck off -sshole,” he replied, then blocked him.

But whether Berlatsky’s alliance with the Bridges administration is official or tacit, it’s clear that Evergreen has the sympathies of precipitously slanted journalists who are eager to obscure a sad reality: that the majority of the attacks on free speech, free thought, due process, and academic liberty are coming from progressivism.

That’s too bad for them, because Weinstein, a progressive even conservatives respect, is far more likely to advance progressive goals than a college student throwing a brainless tantrum at a professor. Berlatsky never considers, or perhaps cannot comprehend, that some efforts to fight prejudice and inequity are better than others.

"14 Times Republican Officials Viciously Harassed, Threatened With Death","Throughout the past couple of months, Republicans and government officials who work for President Trump have received death threats, been run out of restaurants and stores, and followed to their cars. The uptick in harassment coincides with increasingly aggressive rhetoric from leading Democrats.

Here are 14 times Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers have been threatened or run out of establishments recently.

1. Protestors to Mitch McConnell: ‘We Know Where You Live!’

Protestors followed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to his car outside of a restaurant in Kentucky on Saturday. In a video recording of the encounter, protestors are seen walking behind McConnell and shouting at him: “Vote you out!”

Hundreds of protestors were demonstrating outside of a nearby Immigration and Customs Enforcement Office on Saturday, when the senator was spotted dining at a restaurant just a few miles away, CNN reported.

“We know where you live too, Mitch!” the group of protestors are seen yelling. “Abolish ICE!”

2. Protestors Follow Elaine Chao To Her Car

Two weeks ago, protestors followed McConnell and his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, as they were getting into a vehicle. These demonstrators played audio of border-crossing foreign children whose parents were reportedly apprehended and heckling the senator for the Trump administration’s border enforcement policies.

“Why are you separating families?” the men ask.

“Why don’t you leave my husband alone!” Chao responds.

video: @SecElaineChao telling protestors to leave her husband, Mitch McConnell, alone. pic.twitter.com/9jj1AojRMM — Adam Parkhomenko (@AdamParkhomenko) June 26, 2018

The day before this showdown between Chao and protestors, Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters called for Democrats to “create a crowd” whenever they see a Trump administration official at a restaurant or shopping mall and to “tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere.”

3. Liberals Wish Rep. Steve Scalise Was Dead

In response to Water’s call for mobs of protestors to heckle and crowd around Republicans, Rep. Steve Scalise, who survived an anti-Republican shooting last year, called for civility among all Americans, from both sides of the aisle. His call for civility was met with pushback from people who said they wished he had “succumbed to his wounds.”

4. Liberal PAC Fundraises For Billboard Encouraging Passersby to ‘Take Out’ Scalise

In May, a liberal PAC was raising money to erect a poster encouraging passersby to “take out” Scalise. The wording of the billboard, combined with a comment from the PAC chairman saying his group was planning to “toss mortars” at Republicans, was sloppy, to say the least.

5. Man Arrested For Threatening To Kill Republican Supporters

On Saturday, a man was arrested in Suffolk County, New York, for threatening to kill supporters of Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin and President Donald Trump. The Daily Caller has more:

‘Martin Astrof was arrested after he threatened to kill supporters of Congressman Lee Zeldin and President Donald Trump,’ Suffolk PD said. ‘Astrof went to the campaign headquarters of Congressman Zeldin and became irate with a campaign worker at approximately 11:15 a.m. After threatening to kill the campaign worker and other supporters, Astrof backed his car up in an aggressive manner nearly striking the worker.’

6. Cynthia Nixon Calls ICE a ‘Terrorist Organization’

“Sex and the City” star and gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon, who campaigned in Suffolk County over the weekend, called ICE a “terrorist organization,” and called for the “monstrous Trump-Pence administration” to be abolished.

I can think of no better description than to call ICE a terrorist organization, and I will wear any criticism from @mike_pence as a badge of honor. — Cynthia Nixon (@CynthiaNixon) July 6, 2018

7. Woman Screams Out Steve Bannon at a Bookstore

On Saturday, a woman reportedly screamed at former White House advisor Steve Bannon, who was shopping at a bookstore in Richmond, Virginia. The woman called Bannon a “piece of trash” and continued to yell at him until the bookstore owner called the cops, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

8. Woman Confronts Scott Pruitt At DC Restaurant With 2-Year-Old Son On Her Hip

Last Monday, a woman eating with her two-year-old son at a restaurant in Washington DC confronted former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt and urged him to resign.

“This is my son, he loves animals, wants clean water, clean air,” the woman said. “I’m urging you to resign before your scandals push you out.”

9. Mob of Protestors Swarm DHS Secretary at DC Restaurant, Yell ‘Shame! Shame!’

Days earlier, a group of protestors swarmed Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen at a Mexican restaurant in Washington DC and shouted “SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!” at her repeatedly until she left.

10. Restaurant Owner Kicks Out Sarah Huckabee Sanders

Two weeks ago, the owner of a restaurant in Lexington, Virginia, asked Sarah Huckabee Sanders to leave her eatery because the White House press secretary works for the Trump administration.

11. Net Neutrality Supporter Threatened to Murder FCC Chairman’s Family

In late June, a man was arrested and charged for threatening to kill Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai and his family. Earlier this year, Pai, had to cancel appearances because of bomb threats aimed at him after the chairman voted to repeal Internet traffic regulations last December.

12. Protestors Left A Burnt, Decapitated Animal Body On DHS Employee’s Front Porch

In a recent threat assessment, DHS officials reported an uptick in the number of threats made against employees at the department since the increased attention to Trump’s enforcement of U.S. immigration policies. In one case, a DHS employee who lives in the Washington DC area found a body of a burned, decapitated animal on his front porch, ABC News reports.

13. Idaho State Rep. Threatened With Death, Rape

Idaho State Rep. Priscilla Giddings has been threatened with rape and encouraged to kill herself by people who disliked a Facebook post in which she explains how having a gun saved her life while fighting the Taliban overseas. Giddings, a former combat pilot and current major in the Air Force Reserves, says that disarming women in the U.S. is a step backwards. You can listen to the vile voicemail messages she received here.

14. Protestors Hand ‘Wanted’ Posters With Stephen Miller’s Face On Them To His Neighbors

Several weeks ago, White House senior advisor Stephen Miller’s face was slapped onto “Wanted” flyers found circulating among his neighbors at an apartment complex he reportedly lives in.

Miller reportedly told his colleagues that a bartender at a restaurant flipped him off when he went to pick up a sushi order at a nearby restaurant and repeatedly yelled at him. This confrontation prompted Miller to throw away $80 worth of sushi for fear that it had been tampered with.

3 Ways ‘Humanae Vitae’ Changed This Protestant’s Views On Sex,"The first time I discovered there were legitimate reasons to not use the contraceptive pill, I was in my mid-20s and had just gotten engaged. A married friend handed me a cassette tape entitled, “Contraception: Why Not,” featuring a talk by a Catholic professor named Janet Smith.

“You should really check this out,” he said. Since I was producing a radio show at that time, I assumed he thought Smith would be a good guest. But when he added, ‘This really changed our thinking about birth control,” I remember thinking, “What could a Catholic professor possibly say about birth control that I need to hear?”

But I took it home and ended up listening to the tape over and over again. What I heard not only made me think twice about using the pill, it also led me on a journey that began a shift in my thinking about the purpose of sex, how I viewed my body and what I put into it, and my understanding of marriage and our responsibility to children.

I remember being so excited about what I learned that I wanted to share it with anyone who would listen, so, of course, I started with my fiancé (a devout Baptist). I still remember the shocked expression on his face the first time I asked him whether he was open to “having as many kids as God wants us to have?”

On the recording, Smith made a mostly academic case against birth control but also shared some of the Catholic Church’s teaching on married sex. I wanted to learn more, so I ordered some information from a Natural Family Planning (NFP) group I found online. The packet that came in the mail included a small copy of “Humanae Vitae.” What I read there, and later in Pope John Paul II’s “Theology of the Body,” left me in tears.

“Humanae Vitae” affected me in three main ways. I’ll share them.

1. I Learned More About How the Pill Hurts People

“Humanae Vitae” led me to do more research on the negative side effects of the Pill, which convinced me to reject chemical birth control and to embrace more natural methods.

I was really bothered that in 20-something years of growing up in a Christian community, I had never heard anything negative about the Pill—not in the Pentecostal church we attended when I was a child, nor in my Baptist-run high school, or even at my Presbyterian college.

Sure, I’d heard from several friends and family members that the Pill gave them headaches or caused them to gain weight, but no one had ever voiced any moral qualms, or otherwise, about birth control. It was assumed that when I got married (since I was saving sex for marriage), I would get on the Pill, just like every other woman I knew.

As a result of being introduced to “Humanae Vitae,” I sought out an NFP-friendly OB/GYN, learned more about the Billings Ovulation Method, and eventually began charting my cycle. Although my husband and I did not end up following NFP religiously, we did use the Billings Method to get pregnant with our children.

2. ‘Humanae Vitae’ Empowered Me with Knowledge About My Body

“Humanae Vitae” also empowered me with knowledge about my body and how it is perfectly designed to work in creating new life. Charting my cycle and learning about the fertile and infertile phases were empowering to me as a woman. By paying attention to my body’s natural patterns, I knew when I was most likely to get or not get pregnant.

This also helped me be aware of any changes that might affect my health. I credit NFP with the fact that we never had any problems getting pregnant, even though we got married later in life and started “trying” in our 30s/mid-30s (I was 35 when I had my youngest).

3. Deepened My Understanding of Sex, Marriage, and Children

Finally, “Humanae Vitae” expanded my understanding of sex, marriage, and children as a sacred part of God’s creative order. Reading “Humanae Vitae” for the first time, I felt like a thirsty person gulping down a glass of water. I had never heard marriage described in such ethereal terms.

It began by emphasizing that marriage is not “result of blind evolution of natural forces.” Rather, it is a “wise and provident institution of God the Creator.” I was particularly struck by the idea that through marriage, a husband and wife are “cooperating with God in the generation and rearing of new lives.”

As someone raised by a single mom in an extended family where divorce was common, I really longed for this vision of marriage as a holy institution where couples are working with God to have and raise children.

As for how “Humanae Vitae” defined sex, I had never heard it described as a “divine act,” nor had I been taught that it was equally about uniting a husband and wife and creating new life. Thus far, my understanding of “responsible parenthood” was having as many kids as you wanted and could afford within marriage.

But “Humanae Vitae” defined responsible parenthood as naturally welcoming to any new life that results from the sexual union, noting that “each and every marital act must of necessity retain its intrinsic relationship to the procreation of human life.”

‘Humanae Vitae’ gave me a vision of married sex to aspire to by presenting it as something beautiful, sacred, and consequential.

I was not sure how this vision of parenthood would work in my future marriage, and whether I could even uphold this ideal in practice. Still, “Humanae Vitae” gave me a vision of married sex to aspire to by presenting it as something beautiful, sacred, and consequential. In other words, sex is about more than the partners involved; it is about the children that act may produce and our responsibility to those children.

This new way of thinking about sex was radically different from the secular vision that said sex was mostly about self-fulfillment and pleasure. But it was also different from what I’d learned in the Christian community where I grew up.

Although I’d been taught that God created sex and that it belonged in marriage, most of this centered around a list of “dos” and “don’ts.” There was no theology of sex, no attempt to articulate a heavenly vision that could compete with the secular vision—or at least not that I had ever heard (Later, I discovered Protestant writers, like Nancy Pearcey, author of “Love Thy Body,” who present a holistic Christian view of sexuality.)

As a Protestant woman whose vision of sex, marriage, and parenthood was radically changed by “Humanae Vitae,” I am proud to join my Catholic sisters and brothers in celebrating its 50th anniversary this week. Along with leading me to make healthier choices about what I put into my body, through “Humanae Vitae” I gained a richer understanding of and appreciation for the sacredness of sex, the blessings of children, and marriage as an institution worth preserving.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/07/25/3-ways-humanae-vitae-changed-protestants-views-sex-family/,2018-07-25
"NY Abortion Activists Spied On Pro-Lifers, Then Lied About Them In Court","In May 2018, New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman resigned from office in disgrace following reports that he had physically assaulted four women. Before his departure, Schneiderman had launched a year-long investigation into peaceful pro-life protestors. He eventually filed suit against 13 individuals in June 2017, alleging violations of the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE) and the state and city corollaries.

Ironically, in a press release announcing the lawsuit, Schneiderman accused the protestors of “threatening, violent, and obstructive behavior” at Choices Women’s Medical Center, a Queens, New York abortion facility.

However, after holding a hearing on the claims, a federal judge found the attorney general’s witnesses were not reliable and “that despite the availability of hundreds of hours of video evidence, the [attorney general] has not cited a single video that corroborates the witness testimony claiming near-weekly violations. Instead, the video evidence contradicts the escorts’ accounts of protestor conduct on specific occasions.”

While the decision obviously represents a victory for the defendants, most of whom are members of the Church at the Rock or Grace Baptist Church, the district court’s detailed summary of the facts proves important for another reason: It exposes the lies and tactics abortion activists and politicians rely upon to silence pro-life voices.

Government Surveillance of Pro-Life Activists

In her 100-plus page order, Judge Carol Bagley Amon, a George H.W. Bush appointee, dispassionately detailed Schneiderman’s efforts to keep the Christian protestors quiet, and why. At a press conference held outside the Choices facility to announce his lawsuit against the protestors, Schneiderman declared this is “not a nation where you can choose your point of view.”

In furtherance of these efforts, the attorney general dispatched undercover investigators to Choices, with most of the investigators “pretending to be patients and their companions, and wearing hidden cameras recording video and audio.” But, as Bagley Amon explained, “[d]espite these investigative activities, the [attorney general] did not call any of its investigators as witnesses, and introduced few of the undercover videos as evidence.”

In addition to the undercover investigators, Schneiderman used two of the abortion “escorts”—volunteers who walked abortion clients into the Choice facility—to help gather evidence. The escorts, Pearl Brady and Theresa White, wore recording devices and helped prepare a “protester dossier” that collected personal information about the protestors.

White recorded the protestors’ license plate numbers and periodically searched the Internet for information about the protestors. Brady also conducted Internet searches to learn information about the individuals protesting outside Choices and “created and maintained a Facebook account in which she pretended to be ‘Shelly Walker,’ a vocal and fictitious anti-abortion advocate. Brady used this fake account to ‘friend’ some of the protestors on Facebook, gather information about them, and determine whether they posted online any of the photos and videos they took outside Choices.”

In Court, Pretend You Don’t Know The Truth

Brady also used Facebook to communicate via “group chat” with fellow escort witnesses about how to testify in depositions: “Just remember,” she said, “yes, no, I don’t know, I don’t remember, and I don’t understand the question. Short answers. Don’t elaborate. This is for them to get more information, and it’s our job to give them as little help as possible.” These “directions” led the federal judge to question Brady’s veracity.

The attorney general called Brady, White, and several other escorts to testify as witnesses at a hearing held between February 12 and March 6, 2018. The judge found these witnesses’ testimony largely unreliable based on the “inconsistencies between [the witnesses’] descriptions of protestor conduct and the conduct shown in the supporting videos and photographs.” Although the district court generously called the witnesses’ sworn testimony “exaggerated descriptions of protestor misconduct,” “inconsistencies,” or “misremembered specific events,” the truth is the abortion activists lied.

For instance, one escort testified that two protestors “moved into [her],” but when questioned further revealed they had not actually moved “into her” but only close to her. The same escort had also testified in a deposition that the defendants had unlawfully obstructed clients from entering the abortion facility, but admitted after being confronted with a video recording that there was no such obstruction.

The district court also reviewed the security videos admitted as evidence and concluded that, contrary to the attorney general’s claim, the videos did not show the protestors obstructing access to Choices. Additionally, a security guard falsely testified that protestors would “shoulder check” clients, but when questioned on cross-examination, he admitted that what he really meant was that someone accidentally bumped into another person.

More Doctored and Exaggerated Evidence

Beyond the false testimony from the abortion escorts, the attorney general attempted to prove one of the protestors illegally intimidated clients when she filmed women on two occasions. The judge, however, noted that the protestor credibly testified that they “began filming because they had ‘a lot of incidents where the escorts would just surround, surround us ladies, at least those that were giving out literatures, [sic] and they would purposely push us out the way [sic] so, to have something documented, to have it on video just to protect ourselves because it’s going to be, when they call the cops, I want to be able to show the cops we didn’t do anything wrong.” Given the escorts’ propensity to lie, the protestors acted prudently, as well as legally, since they avoided capturing the clients’ faces on video.

Nonetheless, Bagley Amon refused to find that the witnesses intentionally lied at the hearing, stating instead “their overstatements of what occurred and who caused it are colored by their views that the protestors are overzealous and that it is the escorts’ mission to shield patients from any interaction with them.” But it wasn’t just the abortion activists’ testimony that was euphemistically “overstated,” it was also forms the abortion facility kept supposedly detailing confrontations with the protestors.

The attorney general attempted to admit these forms, which consisted of “Clinic Escort Recaps” and “Protester Experience Questionnaires,” but the judge refused to give that “evidence” any weight, finding the forms were not reliable. For instance, the Clinic Escort Recap forms, which escorts completed during a debriefing inside the abortion facility after the protestors left, purportedly provided an overview of the day’s events and noted any significant incidents. But the details included were false.

Bagley Amon illustrated this problem by pointing to one Clinic Escort Recap that stated: “Mary Lou called [the police] at 8:10 after being shoved by Ron and Griepp.” But, as Bagley Amon noted, the escort admitted during the hearing that the men did not “actually shove her,” but just moved toward her very quickly.

The attorney general also sought to prove the protestors violated the law by sharing the responses clients provided in “Protester Experience Questionnaires.” These questionnaires asked clients to summarize any interaction with protestors and any efforts to prevent them from entering the abortion facility.

The judge refused to consider this evidence because only a sampling of the questionnaires was submitted. Most were destroyed. When asked about the facility’s decision to destroy the forms, the abortion facility’s director of the volunteer escort program lied, claiming she had a system for deciding which questionnaires to keep, before eventually admitting she had no system.

Bad Behavior Is a Bad Reason to Respond In Kind?

Although the judge refused to call the abortion facility witnesses liars, she nonetheless concluded that their testimony was “insufficiently reliable” to support the attorney general’s accusation that the defendants used force against the escorts and clients. The district court likewise rejected claims that the defendants intentionally harassed the clients, in violation of the access laws. Yet the judge added a word of caution, telling the defendants that her “decision should not embolden the defendants to engage in more aggressive conduct,” noting that some of the protestors’ actions came close to crossing the line.

When a client asks to be left alone, voluntarily disengaging is evidence of goodwill.

The judge added a practical point that pro-life protestors would be wise to heed: When a client asks to be left alone, voluntarily disengaging is evidence of goodwill. Continuing to hound the women will annoy and not persuade, and not only violates the law but would be contrary to the defendants’ stated objectives.

Goodwill and non-confrontational offers of help, however, won’t placate abortion activists, as seen most recently when the Texas-based Whole Woman’s Health abortion facility lobbied the South Bend, Indiana mayor to prevent a pregnancy resource center from locating next door. The nearly 35-year-old Women’s Care Center pledge to prohibiting all protesting on its property and stressed that there has never been an act of violence associated with its organization.

Nonetheless, the Democratic major, Pete Buttigieg, vetoed the common council’s rezoning approval necessary for the Women’s Care Center to open. Buttigieg justified his decision based on the same type of evidence Bagley Amon found worthless— abortion facility employees’ self-reported, anecdotal claims of violence.

Whole Woman’s Health’s reliance on fake statistics benefitted the abortion provider no more than the New York-based Choice abortion facility’s attempt to silence protestors with false claims of violence. Following the mayor’s veto and the common council’s failure to override the veto, a business owner across the street offered to sell his property (which was properly zoned) to the Women’s Care Center. This location proves even more ideal, because women facing crisis pregnancies will be able to access the pregnancy resource center without crossing paths with the protestors picketing across the street.

The Last Antifa Altercation May Forecast Worse In Portland This Weekend,"On June 30, I attended a rally in Portland, Oregon, put on by a group called Patriot Prayer, at which Antifa and other militia-like groups congregated and fought. Patriot Prayer has said they will continue marches in Portland until everyone who wants to can march safely, because Antifa has threatened and carried out violent responses to others’ attempts to exercise free speech.

On August 4, people are going to come in from all over the United States for another rally, and I’m worried about what might happen given that police did not prevent violence last time. I have attended several of these marches over the last year up and down the west coast. It feels like the violence and lawlessness is increasing, especially due to lack of police action as protesters brawl.

For the June 30 rally, Patriot Prayer worked with the Department of Homeland Security and the Portland Police Bureau to get the permits needed and to plan a march that they hoped would be safe for the participants. The police, under supervision of DHS, established a no-weapons zone and searched the participants and all who entered the park. No guns, mace, bear spray, Tasers, or anything that could be used as a weapon.

All of the flag poles I looked at were hollow PVC pipe. Anyone found with a weapon or banned item at the checkpoint was arrested.

Another group, Proud Boys, came in to provide protection for the march participants. Both local and several out of state chapters attended the event. While the Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled them an alt-right hate group, they contend that they are not at all alt-right and accept people regardless of race or sexual orientation.

What happened at the last rally, in my estimation, was preventable. The police made sure the people attending the rally were disarmed (not even mace) and all of those people readily agreed to the conditions knowing they would be arrested if they did not comply. It was obvious that no one surrounding the park — i.e., Antifa — would face similar searches and could be carrying an assortment of weapons.

Because of this, it was imperative that the police provide protection on the pre-planned march route, because the marchers had voluntarily disarmed. The police didn’t. A police escort flanked the marchers on the east side and used moveable barricades on the roads intersecting on the west side. Antifa and black bloc anarchists just went around to the side streets and attacked from there.

Below is the story in pictures.

This was the entrance into the park, a federal plaza. Security inside and around the park was through DHS. To get in to the park you had to submit to a search of your things and if it was found you were carrying any kind of a weapon you were subject to arrest.

Originally, the attendees were told they could bring mace in quantities of less than two ounces. Rules were changed once they got there. For anyone wondering why they would want to carry mace or pepper spray, several people have been attacked on the way out of rallies while returning to their vehicles. They were allowed to keep helmets, safety glasses, and protective gear.

Portland Police guarding the northwest corner of the Federal Plaza. Across the street is Chapman Park, where Antifa and black bloc were gathering.

There was a significant amount of police in and around the park. I saw officers from DHS, the county sheriff, and Portland Police. The park was secure and free from violence. The protestors on the other side were yelling epithets and sometimes throwing things, but you could easily avoid interaction with them by stepping away from the barrier.

People mingled and waited for the speeches and music to start. There were people from Washington, Oregon, California, Texas, Florida, and New York.

I walked around the borders of the park to take a look at the outside. These three were at the entrance to the plaza with the woman doing all of the talking. She yelled at the police about their jobs (she thought police were a waste of her tax dollars) and about the racist people inside the park and how guarding them was a waste of the public’s money. Remember these three, as we encounter them a few photos down.

While walking to Chapman Park, I came across these people, who were masking up to join Antifa and black bloc there.

In Chapman Park. Protestor stands with her sign facing away from the Federal Plaza.

Police in riot gear wait for the march to start.

Remember these three? They moved down the front of the barricades closer to Chapman Park, where most of Antifa was waiting and continuing to argue with officers who then began to ask them to leave.

This man appeared in front of me as I was walking back towards the Federal Plaza and the Patriot Prayer gathering. He wouldn’t say anything when spoken to, just held up his sign higher. I am not sure who or what he represents other than the usual Keep Portland Weird scene.

Here we are again. These three. The woman decided to engage this Proud Boy. Conversation went along the lines of race and race betrayal. Both held their own until they were asked to leave the barrier.

Shortly after I took the picture above, one of the two men outside of the barricade, who was asked to leave, refused. He was then arrested. It was one of the few arrests of the day.

Back inside Terry Schrunk Federal Plaza, the rally begins with speeches and songs.

Patriot Prayer founder and Washington state U.S. Senate candidate Joey Gibson called on everyone to bend a knee for prayer. It is the only thing, he said, that you should bend a knee for.

Gibson addresses the group before they left for their march.

Getting ready for the march, Joey pumps up the crowd with words of encouragement. A large contingent of Proud Boys were at the front and rear of the marchers to provide extra security. They would be needed.

Proud Boys traveled from several states to be a part of this rally and to provide security.

Someone started yelling out “I pledge allegiance…” and the crowd jumped in and finished with him.

Attendees started the march and were greeted on the corner with this scene. Antifa and other protestors swarmed over from the park into the street screaming things like, “Racist mother-ckers! Go home, Nazis! Lights out, alt-right!”

Antifa and other protestors swarm out into the street at the back end of the protest. They were taking pictures, using airhorns, and screaming at the marchers.

A few seconds into the march someone (the guy in the middle) threw firecrackers and Antifa and black bloc surged forward even more. It made me nervous so I started to retreat.

As I was retreating, DHS, or maybe Portland Police, started firing pellet guns for crowd control. It got very loud, very quick. According to Antifa’s social media posts several of the crowd was hit. They pulled back and the tail end of the marchers got safely past with the police following behind them.

As the Patriot Prayer contingent marched forward there were other protestors screaming “Racists!,” “Bigots!” “F-ck you!” and taking pictures of them.

These people ignored police orders to get back from Patriot Prayer.

The police start to load up onto their vehicles to follow the marchers from behind.

​This is the moment the march turned the corner and were confronted with the sight of Antifa coming up the side street. Antifa had taken down barriers and were pouring up the street in large numbers. Shortly after this some kind of explosives were thrown and detonated in the middle of the crowd here.

The moment the two sides met up.

​I talked to the Proud Boy in the helmet above and asked what was happening. He said he was pulling that person off of someone to separate them. There were dozens of brawls going on in this street at that moment. Antifa tossed at least three different homemade improvised explosive devices into the crowd in this block as well as spraying copious amounts of pepper spray. The groups eventually separated and the march resumed.

This is the next block up on the march that had been closed off by police with barricades. Antifa just went around it and came towards the march again.

The two sides meet up again: Antifa and a Proud Boy. Immediately after this, fights started on every side of me and all up and down the street. The man with the red scarf in the back is holding a weapon of some sort under his arm. Remember, anyone attending the Patriot Prayer event had been disarmed of anything that even resembled a weapon.

These are Sharps/black bloc/Antifa. The man in the denim vest (also giving the finger in the picture above) in the middle of turning away had just been punched in the face by someone from the march.

Here’s the brawl that started a moment later. I was surrounded on all sides by brawls.

​Police in riot gear clearing the streets and breaking up the fighting. Portland police held everyone there for around five minutes and then on a loudspeaker told everyone to return to the plaza. The march had been declared a riot and permits were revoked.

Streets are cleared and everyone started the walk back to the park a few blocks away. Medics started attending to the injured across the street.

I took some pictures of the injured at the park. Many people had been pepper-sprayed repeatedly by Antifa. The telltale sign is the milk of magnesia that they wear from rinsing their eyes and skin. Looking over my pictures later, I discovered a discarded can of wasp spray as well.

Pepper sprayed.

Hit in the head with an asp.

Pepper sprayed.

Pepper sprayed and hit in the forearm with a blunt object.

Pepper sprayed and hit in the head with a blunt object. At this point I ceased taking pictures and was trying to figure out my exit from the park. Antifa and black bloc were still at the exit to the park and the Department of Homeland Security was clearing the park and demanding that everyone leave.

Most people had nowhere to go, as they had taken a chartered bus in from Vancouver in an effort to prevent their tires from being slashed, which has happened in the past. While I knew I could leave the park and walk to my car, I didn’t want to be followed. Eventually police used flash bangs to disperse the crowd of protestors so people from Patriot Prayer could leave safely.

The one thing that always sticks with me when I attend these events, especially as I look at the images I took, is the hatred and anger from the people “protesting” Patriot Prayer. It is disconcerting to look at all the faces, even through the protection and emotional distance of a camera lens, screaming and spitting and throwing things. They are enraged, and use foul language. They hate you, and want to physically harm and intimidate you.

In following up I asked Portland Police about how they managed the march, why they changed the route, and did not keep the two groups separate. I also asked about the explosions I heard and felt. This was the response I got from Portland Police’s public information officer:

The Police Bureau attempts to ensure a safe environment so community members may exercise their First Amendment to free speech and assembly, as well as ensure safety for community members not participating in events. The Police Bureau assesses multiple aspects of an event and determines the best course of action after careful assessment and understanding of the capabilities of the assets available at an event. It was the Police Bureau’s desire to have the pre-planned route followed. The Police Bureau cannot limit access to public areas based on a person or group’s political ideology or past behavior. Events, like the event on June 30, 2018, are extremely complicated and difficult to ensure for the safety of all those around. There are people that arrive at events that have the intention of participating in criminal behavior. I do not know that we have located and investigated the specific types of fireworks being thrown during the event; however, I am aware that officers reported hearing items that made loud booms during the event. Sergeant Chris Burley Public Information Officer Portland Police Bureau

Kathryn Townsend of Patriot Prayer said the march had been planned with the police, who had promised to keep the two groups separate. “We were supposed to have a police escort in front, in back and on the sides. In fact, the police told David [the march organizer] to get the permit SO they could help us. They said they couldn’t protect us UNLESS we got a permit.”

She went on to say, “I trusted the safety plans so much, I even told people not to worry, [that] Antifa will be [kept] away from us. It feels now like a set up.”",https://thefederalist.com/2018/08/03/pictures-last-antifa-altercation-may-forecast-worse-portland-weekend/,2018-08-03
Protestant Questions For Scandalized Catholics Who Still Remain Catholic,"In light of the scandals again roiling the Roman Catholic Church, many are understandably asking why they should remain Catholic. Some, such as Damon Linker, have simply announced that they will not. Others are answering in a way that, at any other time, might seem rather surprising to Catholics and Protestants alike.

Writing in the Wall Street Journal, for example, George Weigel explains that he and his fellow Catholics attend Mass “to hear what we believe to be the Word of God in Scripture and to enter into what we believe to be communion with God because of Jesus Christ.” He emphasizes “the basis of Catholic faith, which is trust in Jesus Christ.” Only Jesus Christ, he reminds his readers, has “the words of eternal life.”

Princeton University’s Robert George sounded the same note even more emphatically. “Our faith is in Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ alone,” he wrote. “The subject and object of our faith,” he continued, “is Jesus Christ—and him alone. It is Christ and him alone who saves.” “It is in him, and in no one else, that we place our hope and trust.”

Writing at The Federalist, Matthew Petrusek echoes a similar theme in the advice he offers to those contemplating an exit from the Catholic Church. “Pause, turn around, and look up,” he says; “That man you see hanging there is what this is ultimately all about.”

Are These Reasons Distinctly Catholic?

Since virtually all Christians at all times and in all places voice the earnestly pious sentiments expressed by Weigel, George, and Petrusek, why might they seem “surprising” to Catholics and Protestants alike? Most immediately, it is precisely the fact that all Christians of all traditions do profess these fundamental truths. If “what this is ultimately about” is “trust in Jesus Christ” and “him alone,” it is not at all clear how this constitutes, as Weigel claims, “the reason to be Catholic, the reason to stay Catholic.”

Yes, George explains that the above theological claims are “the teaching of the Catholic Church.” But surely a man of his intellectual stature and ecumenical activity is well aware that they are not the teaching of the Catholic Church only. Even more pointedly, Petrusek raises what he calls “distinctly Catholic” questions for those tempted to leave the Roman communion:

Do you believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth? Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died and was buried, rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?

But even those of the most modest theological literacy will recognize these as questions answered affirmatively in the ecumenical creeds—that is, the creeds confessed by the whole Christian church. There is nothing “distinctly Catholic” about them.

You Guys Sound Kinda Protestant

In short, what each of these authors suggests, without stating it explicitly, is that the essential teaching and belief of the Roman Catholic Church is no different from that of any other Christian Church. This may or may not be the case, but, again, it’s difficult to see how it amounts to an argument for exclusive loyalty to one particular communion of the broader Christian church.

Indeed, if true, the claim appears much more amenable to an argument for abandoning any particular communion if and when it evidences an entrenched culture of corruption, criminality, and cover-up from its lowest to highest levels. If the Christian faith is ultimately and essentially about trust in Jesus Christ and him alone, and if one attends church to hear the word of God in scripture, why not choose to hear that word and have that trust cultivated in a less compromised environment?

There is yet another reason the recent emphases of Weigel, George, and Petrusek might seem surprising. Although each highlights that which all Christians share in common, George most explicitly does so by emphasizing a theme historically associated with one particular Christian tradition. His repeated emphasis on “Christ alone” echoes a rallying cry of the sixteenth-century Reformation and the subsequent Protestant tradition.

There are of course ways in which a faithful Catholic can say, as George does, that “it is Christ and him alone who saves.” But historically such rhetoric has sat less comfortably with other Roman Catholic emphases, from popular understandings of Mary as “co-redemptrix” to the formal teaching that submission to the papacy is also “absolutely necessary for salvation.”

Is This All about the Church?

It is precisely the traditional association of “Christ alone” with Protestantism that prompted Jeffrey Mirus—in an article published only a few days before Weigel’s—to ask, “Why do Catholics speak so often of ‘the Church’ instead of ‘Christ’?” His answer is revealing in itself, but also for the manner in which it complicates the narrative forwarded by Weigel, George, and other of his fellow Catholics.

“Protestants can hardly refer to ‘the Church,’” Mirus writes, “because they do not have a ‘church.’” Catholics, on the other hand, may speak more often of the church than they do of Christ because they “recognize the Church AS Christ” (emphasis in original); “She is Christ present in the world.” Although Mirus also refrains from explicitly stating the logical conclusion of his premises, it is clear enough:

Protestants don’t have a church. The church is Christ. Therefore, Protestants don’t have Christ.

If Protestants and their “not-churches” are without Christ, then neither can in any real sense be called Christian. If one truly believes this, then of course there can be no thought of abandoning “the church with Christ” for a “non-church without Christ,” no matter how compromised, corrupt, or even potentially dangerous that church might be. However wrong Protestants—and many Catholics—might find this sentiment, it is clearly a coherent reason for remaining Catholic even in a time of scandal.

Let’s Be Honest, Please

But because it is the presence of scandal that has precipitated the many and loud cries for honesty and transparency, allow me to add another request for the same. Catholics, be honest with yourselves and others, and be clear about the implications of your beliefs.

If you truly believe that you cannot leave the Roman Catholic Church without abandoning Christ himself, without severing yourself from the body of Christ, openly admit it. If you truly believe the Anglican, Lutheran, or Presbyterian communions are false churches, without Christ, and therefore not Christian, be forthright about this. Even if we think you’re wrong (and we do), we’ll appreciate your honesty and better understand your reasons for remaining in a church that is quite obviously causing you a great deal of anguish.

Incidentally, such honesty might also allow us to forego heartfelt explanations of why “Protestants Should Care Deeply about the Catholic Catastrophe.” If it’s your view that Catholicism and Protestantism are nothing like complementary “ships in the Christian armada,” but more akin to navies at war with one another, perhaps we can simply stop caring about your catastrophe. (We won’t, of course; but if you don’t care that we care, maybe we’ll just do so a bit more quietly.)

On the other hand, if you believe that the word of God, the words of eternal life, and Christ himself—“the subject and object of our faith”—are indeed present in those non-Catholic communions that also confesses the ecumenical creeds, openly acknowledge this. And if you truly believe that “our faith is in Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ alone,” because “it is Christ and him alone who saves,” and that this is what Christianity is “ultimately all about,” be forthright about the real implications this confession has for answering the question of why you should—or perhaps shouldn’t, or at least needn’t—remain Catholic.

Korey D. Maas teaches history at Hillsdale College in Hillsdale, Michigan, where he lives with his wife and five young children. You can’t follow him on Twitter, because he doesn’t know what that is.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/09/25/protestant-questions-scandalized-catholics-still-remain-catholic/,2018-09-25
Why I Remain Catholic In Spite Of The Church’s Latest Scandal,"Korey Maas presented a thoughtful article in The Federalist regarding Catholics who remain with the church despite the latest abuse scandals. He did not so much argue against their decision as express dissatisfaction with the reasons prominent Catholics have given publicly.

In the wake of the latest scandal, which now involve even the holy father himself, many prominent Catholics have come out declaring that their reasoning for remaining Catholic is that it is all about Jesus. Maas understandably responds by asking, If that’s your whole reason, then isn’t that also true of Protestant denominations and the Anglican and Orthodox churches?

I don’t particularly like getting into inter-denominational debates with Protestants, mostly because I think all Christians today face much bigger problems than each other. However, as the question has been raised, I feel it my duty to answer it, and I will answer both his direct challenge – Do you believe Protestants have Christ? – and the question of why I will never jump the Bark of Peter.

In the first place, Maas is perfectly correct, as far as it goes, when he says, “If the Christian faith is ultimately and essentially about trust in Jesus Christ and him alone, and if one attends church to hear the word of God in scripture, why not choose to hear that word and have that trust cultivated in a less compromised environment?” (Although judging from that he apparently is unaware of the immense sex abuse problem in Protestant churches, which I do not bring up to deflect from the Catholic problem, but in response to his description of Protestant denominations as a “less compromised environment.”)

More importantly, he misses the rather crucial fact that, for Catholics, one does not primarily attend church to hear the word of God in scripture, but to adore and receive the Eucharist. The sacraments and apostolic succession essentially derail his argument entirely, at least as regards the Protestant denominations. (It is more complicated regarding the Orthodox, Anglican, and similar churches. However, it would take too long to adequately delve into them here.)

He is also gravely mistaken if he thinks “Christ alone saves” is in any way complicated by Catholic doctrines regarding the Blessed Virgin or the Papacy, as if they had any independent glory or worth outside of Christ. The absolute sovereignty of Christ and the necessity of his saving act are at the very heart of Catholic doctrine. Everything else, from Mary and the saints to the church hierarchy, is derived from and directed to that end.

But now I will answer his question directly. The Protestant asks: “Do you believe Protestants have Christ?” The Roman answers: “Not as we do.”

You Protestants have him as a distant voice; we Romans have him body and soul and majesty and divinity. We feed upon his body and drink his blood. We hear, with our bodily ears, his voice through his anointed ones saying, “Your sins are forgiven you” and, “This is my body.” We touch the bones of his saints and venerate the wood of his cross. And yes, we hear his written word in scripture as well. We have him not only as Protestants do, but also in a way that can be seen and and touched and tasted.

Christ is not words on paper or high lessons. He is a man, solid and real. A man who tromped the Earth with his feet, struck people with his hands, and sweat and bled from his body. He is hard, brute, unmistakable Reality, and his bride the church is no different. She is no invisible collection of believers, but men and women bound by words spoken aloud under the same law and the same doctrine: doctrine that means one thing and not another. A visible, objective entity upon Earth, just as he was and is.

You Protestants do not have that. You have pieces that you tore off and carried away. We are original: you are derivative. You have an echo or an image or a dream of Christ. By the grace of God, that may be enough to bring you to salvation, but it is a poor substitute for the real thing. So, that would be my answer to Maas’s question. I hope that makes the issue a little clearer.

I am afraid Protestant readers may find all that a little harsh, but, well, I was asked. Also, so that we are clear, please note I am not speaking of anyone’s personal piety or faith, but of what the different denominations are and contain.

Now that that is all said, you probably have a fair idea of why I remain Catholic. To paraphrase St. Peter, to whom else should I go? The Roman Catholic Church is the bride of Christ, instituted by him and descended from the apostles. There is no other.

As John Newman put it, it is not a question of whether anyone can be saved outside the Catholic Church; it is a question of whether I can be saved outside her. If, knowing what I know of her, granted the gift of being raised in her fold, and seeing her current plight, would God forgive me if I abandoned her now because I am disgusted by the treason of her ministers?

To take the same issue from another side, I do not see that the present scandals have made the teachings of Martin Luther and John Calvin a whit more convincing, nor those of ThomasAquinas and Robert Bellarmino a whit less. Sola Fide and Sola Scriptura still seem to me incoherent and illogical propositions, and no one’s behavior can change that.

The difference between truth and falsehood, what the substance of the faith is and has been, what reason dictates, and what the church fathers did and did not teach are all matters wholly irrelevant to whether the pope and a large portion of the hierarchy are good or bad men, faithful or unfaithful. In short, the same things that have in the past convinced me of the truth the Roman Catholic Church’s claims have not been changed in the least by this scandal.

Finally, there’s simply the fact that this nightmare is not the church’s alone. As I noted above, Protestant denominations have a similar problem, although their decentralized nature makes it harder to tell the extent of it, as do Jews. Outside the religious sphere, just about every area of our society from Hollywood to public schools (estimates are that one in ten public school students are sexually abused by an educator, which doesn’t count what students do to each other) to professional sports to medicine suffer epidemics of sexual abuse.

Again, I am not saying any of this to downplay the problem in the church: I am saying it convey an idea of just how massive and nightmarish this problem really is. We live in a sexual cesspool, and it wasn’t the Catholic Church that put us into it.

On the contrary, the Catholic Church was one of the few institutions that saw this coming. Pope Paul VI in “Humanae Vitae” predicted many of the exact same consequences that have arrived. He was roundly ridiculed for it and a large portion of the clergy and laity have spent the intervening half-century trying to downplay his warnings. What we are seeing is not the result of the Church’s teachings: it is what happens when those in the Church neglect her teachings in order to appeal to the world around them.

In summary, therefore, I remain a Catholic because the Roman Catholic Church is the body of Christ, because I do not think I could be saved if I abandoned her, and because, quite frankly, in this day and age the last thing I would ever want to do is step away from Christ, from the saints, and from the sacraments. The Church of Rome may be a compromised fortress with its gate left wide open, but it is a fortress nonetheless, and the only one we have left. And outside it is growing very, very dark.

Republican senators met privately last week to discuss the Kavanaugh nomination and what they say is an unprecedented level of aggression, violence, and threats — even higher than the aftermath of President Trump’s election. Remember, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) was shot by an anti-Republican shooter a few months after Trump’s election, upon which more than half the members of Congress requested additional security.

Yet the past two weeks have been “the worst it’s been since I’ve been here,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who has been in office for 11 years. “I think we need to recognize that it’s not going to go away with the final determination of whether [Kavanaugh] is going to be on the Supreme Court. There’s something underlying there that we’re experiencing throughout the country right now that we’ve got to figure out a way to address.”

Sen Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said of the Kavanaugh protests, “The level of intensity is probably unlike anything I’ve seen in three and a half years.”

A week ahead of the Kavanaugh vote Saturday, Sen. Ted Cruz and his wife, Heidi, were chased out of a restaurant by anti-Kavanaugh protesters who describe themselves as socialists, LGBT activists, and anarchists: “You are not safe,” wrote an activist group in taking responsibility for the harassment. “We will find you. We will expose you. We will take from you the peace you have taken from so many others.”

It’s not only Republican politicians. The restaurant where the Cruzes dined — and were later given a private dinner to make up for the altercation — hired security guards and told customers in an email this week that its owners have received death threats and that staff have been “inundated” with hateful phone calls and threats. All for being the place a Republican chose to eat dinner.

During debate on Kavanaugh’s nomination, Republican Sen. Jeff Flake said a caller threatened to “take out” Flake and his family if Flake didn’t do what the caller wanted on the nomination. Senators’ in-state offices have been also mobbed. The Washington Post did a poignant portrayal of the four staff members for Sen. Susan Collins at her home office in Maine dealing with a barrage of protesters and threats ever since Trump’s election.

In Maine, a staffer for Susan Collins absorbed anger, stories, death threats… “Thank you for sharing that,” she said over and over… ⁦@GregJaffe⁩ https://t.co/bVZfC7D5iv — Stephanie McCrummen (@mccrummenWaPo) October 6, 2018

“In December, [Collins’ local office manager Kate] Simson had to call police to arrest nine religious leaders who set up a portable toilet in her waiting room and tried to stage an overnight sit-in at her office to oppose Trump’s tax bill… Out-of-state progressive groups, such as UltraViolet and MoveOn, began organizing demonstrations, Simson said. Protesters no longer just wanted to share their stories. ‘Increasingly, they are focused on filming me as they hand me something,’ Simson said.”

Protesters have mailed more than 1,000 coat hangers to Simson’s office, many spray-painted red, in a gesture intended to convey that Kavanaugh’s confirmation will cause coat-hanger abortions. During a “die-in” demonstration at Collins’ Lewiston office, one woman put red paint on her pants to simulate an abortion. (Why people want to preserve something that they know devastatingly bloodies women is beyond me.) Last week, Collins’ office got cardboard penises in the mail with the message “F-ck You and the donor class you rode in on.”

“It has become harder and harder for Simson not to take the stress home with her,” the Post article says.

She was deboning a roasted chicken a few weeks ago after work and started sobbing. ‘I was just mentally and physically exhausted by the barrage,’ she said. ‘I get that people feel the need to tell me how they feel face to face. When you are looking a person in the eye, you feel more heard. But it becomes a lot. That night, it just pushed me over the edge.’ Another frustration: The almost ceaseless demonstrations are making it hard for constituents who need help with Veterans Affairs benefits or emergency medical visas to get through to Simson and her team. For years, this had been their bread and butter.

Five senators, most of them Republicans whom serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee that oversaw Kavanaugh’s nomination, were allegedly doxed this week by a young man working for Democrat Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee. Local police report that Jackson Cosko edited these senators’ Wikipedia pages to include their home addresses and cell phone numbers, and threatened to release their children’s health information and Social Security numbers. Cosko faces up to 50 years in prison.

Cosko’s lawyer said he was not on Lee’s payroll but a “fellow” whose position in the Senate, which has included stints at the offices of Democrats Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Sen. Maggie Hassan, and former senator Barbara Boxer, was funded by an unnamed “outside institution.” He’s not the only one.

As the anti-Kavanaugh protests roiled this week, the Washington Free Beacon and Daily Caller found organizations funded by Democratic big-money backer George Soros paying protesters’ legal fees and provide a lawyer on retainer “as part of an organized effort to derail the confirmation process,” write Peter Hasson and Joe Simonson at The Daily Caller. The leftist organizations offered to pay protesters’ “cash-and-forfeit” fees to bounce back into the protests directly after an arrest, the pair reported.

The Center for Popular Democracy, a Soros-funded reboot of ACORN, took credit for a group of protesters cornering Flake in an elevator before the Kavanaugh vote to pressure him into voting no. “CNN reported that Flake was visibly shaken after his encounter with us,” CPD co-executive director Ana Maria Archila wrote in triumph. The Washington Free Beacon has documented CPD’s anti-Trump protester astroturfing with “sister organizations” that U.S. taxpayers have also funded to the tune of $25 million since 2002.

The people driving these agitprop efforts say they’re just getting started. Democrats including Sen. Cory Booker and Reps. Luis Gutierrez and Ted Lieu say impeaching Kavanaugh is possible if Democrats take the House or Senate in November. Seventeen members of the House Judiciary Committee say they want to re-litigate Kavanaugh’s confirmation by investigating him until kingdom come. And “40 members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which speaks for the left flank of House Democrats, sent a letter to Trump last week suggesting Kavanaugh’s impeachment could be the outcome of further investigation,” says NBC.

So, to recap: These are people who accost other humans in restaurants and hallways, attack restaurants for the political ideas of the customers who eat in them, claw at the doors of the Supreme Court when they don’t get their way, threaten to release medical information about senators’ children in retaliation for facing the consequences of losing a free and fair election, face polls turning upside down on them by doubling down on these kinds of tactics — oh, yes, and send shock squads to assassinate the character and terrorize the family of anyone who thinks differently as racists, murderers, and rapists. All this while insisting through clenched teeth that they are the party of tolerance, love, and empathy.

"No, ‘Mere Christianity’ Isn’t Enough To Keep Me Catholic Post-Scandal","In my almost ten years of experience of ecumenical dialogue that began as a dyed-in-the-wool Calvinist seminarian and resulted in a conversion to Catholicism several years later, I periodically read some theological reflection that both provokes and puzzles. Sometimes that leads to a deeper understanding of some theological idea, or perhaps even a change in my opinion.

Other times, despite my best attempts at a charitable reading, I have to conclude that the author has misunderstood things so badly it causes confusion and detracts from the ecumenical project. The latter, unfortunately, is my reading of Korey Maas’s reflection in The Federalist on frustrated Catholics choosing to remain Catholic despite the many recent scandals rocking the church.

Maas reads the writings of several Catholics who have written in the wake of the latest clerical sex scandal–namely, George Weigel, Robert George, and Matthew Petrusek–and argues that “what each of these authors suggests, without stating it explicitly, is that the essential teaching and belief of the Roman Catholic Church is no different from that of any other Christian Church.” Maas comes to this conclusion because each of these authors urges his fellow Catholics to keep their eyes on faith in Christ, in whom they should place their ultimate trust.

Yet, Maas observes, there’s nothing uniquely Catholic about this idea, which is essential to just about every Protestant tradition. Indeed, it is a concept that matches up quite well with the “mere Christianity” affirmed by most Protestants.

Moreover, “if the Christian faith is ultimately and essentially about trust in Jesus Christ and him alone, and if one attends church to hear the word of God in scripture, why not choose to hear that word and have that trust cultivated in a less compromised environment?” In effect, asks Maas, if Weigel, George, and Petrusek are making essentially Protestant arguments for why Catholics should remain Catholics, what’s so special about Catholicism, and why can’t people be Protestants instead?

A Word On Catholic Self-Conception

Before evaluating Maas’s argument, a short explanation of Catholic self-understanding is required to do an effective, responsible reading of Weigel, George, and Petrusek. There are many things that Catholics recognize as unique and essential to themselves, but in official catechesis, there are basically two ideas that loom largest for why people should be Catholics.

The first is that the Catholic Church is a visible religious institution founded by Christ that enjoys apostolic succession, meaning that its leadership can trace its authority directly to the apostles of Christ, who were given authority by Christ himself to guide his church on earth. (A corollary to this belief––which still divides Catholics from their Eastern Orthodox brethren––is that the bishop of Rome is the inheritor of the seat of Peter, the leader of the apostles.)

The second belief is that part of what constitutes the church’s apostolic authority is the privilege and responsibility to faithfully administer the sacraments, especially the Eucharist, the “source and summit” of the Christian faith. Indeed, in official Catholic doctrine, to worship and consume the Eucharist–which we believe is Christ himself–is the closest we can get to Christ on this earth.

Thus any time we read Catholic authors reminding the faithful of why they are still Catholic, we should be on the lookout for appeals to the church’s unparalleled ecclesial authority and its sacramental system, particularly the Eucharist, since to depart from the church’s offering of the Eucharist is tantamount to departing from Christ himself.

These Catholics Aren’t Making Protestant Arguments

We can now consider if Maas is reading these authors accurately. Take George, a famous professor of law at Princeton University, who does indeed assert : “Our faith is in Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ alone,” a slogan that any Protestant could support. Yet at the end of that same article, George further argues: “Christ, the faithful bridegroom, will remain with the Church, making reform and renewal possible, and ensuring that the gates of hell, whatever inroads they may make, do not prevail against her.”

George is citing Jesus in Matthew 16:18–a verse affirmed by any Bible-believing Protestant–although its usage is intimately united to the nature of the Catholic Church. Any Protestant who has spent time debating Catholics knows that Matthew 16:18 is used as biblical justification for both Petrine primacy and the doctrinal infallibility of the Catholic Magisterium (i.e., apostolic succession). The idea is that the Catholic Church cannot fall into error, no matter how egregious the sins of her members or leaders. Thus we must read George as offering not a “mere Christianity” line of argument, but one decidedly reliant on classic Catholic apologetics regarding her unique authority.

Let’s move on to Weigel, the author of the best-selling biography of Pope St. John Paul II, who begins his Wall Street Journal article with reference to the phrase “one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church,” which appears in the Nicene Creed. Yes, it’s true, many Protestants also affirm the Nicene Creed as an accurate reflection of scriptural teaching. But the Catholic Church interprets this fourfold description, called the “marks of the Church,” in an essentially different sense than Protestants. Most important for our purposes, the term “apostolic” refers to the church’s claim to possess apostolic succession, something Catholics believe Protestants cannot claim.

Moreover, Weigel in the same article makes reference to the “Bread of Life” discourse in John 6, a text that Catholic doctrine relies upon to support its interpretation of the Eucharist. Weigel is obviously citing it to remind Catholics that they believe that Jesus is truly present in the Eucharist, and that we cannot abandon Him there. Again, Weigel appeals to “those of us who believe in God’s providential guidance of the Church,” and declares that “the living parts of the Catholic Church are those where people have embraced Catholic teaching in full.”

To believe that God is providentially guiding the Catholic Church (a reference to her infallible teaching authority), and that the best expression of Christianity is found where people embrace “Catholic teaching in full,” is antithetical to Protestant theology and practice. It would be hard to interpret Weigel’s article as anything less than a full-blooded appeal to Catholic preeminence.

Finally, let’s consider Petrusek, assistant professor of theological ethics at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. Maas cites Petrusek’s call to Catholics to “please pause, turn around, and look up. That man you see hanging there is what this is ultimately all about.” Yet what is lost here is the practical component of Petrusek’s statement. He’s referring to the crucifix, a representation of Christ the Protestant Reformation sought to abolish in its repudiation of what it considered “idols” and “graven images,” forbidden by Exodus 20:4.

The church’s use of the crucifix is not only to serve as a reminder of Christ’s bloody death on the cross–it is also intended to draw worshippers’ hearts to the Eucharist, where that unbloody sacrifice is now offered for the salvation of the world. This is a doctrine just about every Protestant tradition has fundamentally rejected. Although less explicit than George and Weigel, Petrusek likewise seeks to remind Catholics of what is unique about their own church and its faith, namely, the centrality of the Eucharist.

Misunderstanding Catholic Teaching

Maas then quotes Catholic Jeffrey Mirus, who recently argued: “Protestants can hardly refer to ‘the Church because they do not have a ‘church.’” Mirus adds that Catholics, alternatively, “recognize the Church AS Christ” (emphasis in original); “She is Christ present in the world.”

Maas deduces the following logical conclusion from Mirus’ argumentation: (1) Protestants don’t have a church. (2) The church is Christ. (3) Therefore, Protestants don’t have Christ. Maas concludes: “If Protestants and their ‘not-churches’ are without Christ, then neither can in any real sense be called Christian.”

Rather than try to defend whatever exactly Mirus is trying to argue, let’s consider what the Catholic Church actually teaches––in her own words––regarding Protestantism. The church has declared in her magisterial capacity that Protestants do indeed “have Christ,” to use Maas’ phrase. Paragraph 818 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church declares:

…the Catholic Church accepts them [i.e. those in Protestant communities] with respect and affection as brothers…All who have been justified by faith in Baptism are incorporated into Christ; they therefore have a right to be called Christians, and with good reason are accepted as brothers in the Lord by the children of the Catholic Church.

The next paragraph of the Catechism, 819, expands upon this:

Furthermore, many elements of sanctification and of truth are found outside the visible confines of the Catholic Church: ‘the written Word of God; the life of grace; faith, hope, and charity, with the other interior gifts of the Holy Spirit, as well as visible elements.’ Christ’s Spirit uses these Churches and ecclesial communities as means of salvation, whose power derives from the fullness of grace and truth that Christ has entrusted to the Catholic Church.

The Catechism in both these paragraphs is quoting magisterial documents from the Second Vatican Council, which, in the Catholic paradigm, has infallible magisterial authority. Thus no person, be he Catholic apologist or Protestant interpreter, could possibly deduce from this that Catholicism thinks Protestants don’t possess Christ.

Notice, however, that the Catholic Church usually calls Protestant denominations “ecclesial communions.” This is because the church does not recognize these Christian organizations as possessing apostolic succession, one of the marks of the church. Thus Protestant communities, as understood by Catholic teaching, are not properly churches.

A common Protestant question to the above is “if the Eucharist is ‘saving,’ then how do Catholics think Protestants can be saved if they don’t possess it?” The answer to that question has taken up entire chapters of Catholic books, but here is the abbreviated version: the Eucharist is indeed saving, but not in the sense that if one never receives it, he or she is by default excluded from salvation.

If this were the case, Catholic children who haven’t yet received the Eucharist would not be saved. Rather, the Eucharist, being the means by which Christ actually makes present his saving work on Calvary, is saving as a sort of “engine of grace” that empowers not only the other sacraments (like baptism, which most Protestants practice), but can achieve salvific effects outside the church’s ordinary means of salvation.

This is why, in Catholic teaching, even a Protestant who wasn’t baptized could in theory still be saved if he or she professed faith in Christ. In Catholicism, the sacraments, including the Eucharist, are the “ordinary means” of salvation, but this does not negate God’s omnipotent ability to act as he so pleases outside the ordinary to draw people unto himself.

Of course, if the Eucharist and the other sacraments are the ordinary means of being united to Christ and giving a person the best chance of persevering in faith unto death and enjoying eternal salvation, it would be the pinnacle of foolishness to reject them as they are offered in the Catholic Church. This, as I argued earlier, is the heart of what George, Weigel, and Petrusek are getting at–one shouldn’t leave Christ where he most fully offers himself for our salvation.

Catholics Can’t Admit What They Don’t Believe

Maas ends his article by urging Catholics like George, Weigel, and Petrusek:

If you truly believe the Anglican, Lutheran, or Presbyterian communions are false churches, without Christ, and therefore not Christian, be forthright about this. Even if we think you’re wrong (and we do), we’ll appreciate your honesty and better understand your reasons for remaining in a church that is quite obviously causing you a great deal of anguish.

The problem here, as evidenced by the quotations from the Catholic Catechism above, is that no faithful Catholic can believe “Anglican, Lutheran, or Presbyterian communions” are “without Christ” or “not Christian.” For a Catholic to assert this in the face of magisterial teaching would mean rejecting Catholic doctrine, and, if done publicly and without repentance, risks inviting Church discipline.

Ultimately, I believe the problem in Maas’ consideration of Catholicism is a lack of precision of language. Catholicism teaches that Protestant communities possess Christ, but that they don’t possess him in his fullness, since that is located in the Catholic Church, with her Christ- and apostolically derived authority, and her sacraments, particularly the Eucharist, which Catholics believe to be Christ himself.

Of course, if we believe a small wafer is somehow truly the Lord we worship, than anyone who isn’t willing to worship him there would be lacking! Moreover, given that Catholics believe that free will makes it possible for any of us to lose our salvation, it would be crazy to deprive ourselves of what will keep us closest to Christ.

As someone who spent about 20 years as a Protestant, I know that one of the traits that defines the tradition is a desire for simplicity and straightforwardness. Martin Luther was an inheritor of the nominalist school of philosophy, associated with William of Occam. This is the same Occam of “Occam’s razor” fame, which teaches one should gravitate towards the simpler solution.

In perceiving Catholic teaching, and Catholic writers speaking to one another in a moment of crisis as we now endure, the Protestant temptation is to employ simple terms and simple ideas to explain church teaching. Yet, as Maas’ article demonstrates, this is fraught with problems, the greatest of which is the propensity to misinterpret or mischaracterize what Catholicism actually teaches.

Yes, Professor Maas, Catholics “truly believe that ‘our faith is in Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ alone.’” Yet commensurate to that belief is a recognition that the Catholic Church–in all her magisterial authority, and all her scandals and sins–is where the fullness of Christ dwells, especially in the Eucharist as faithfully administered by those with apostolic succession. In the Catholic paradigm, those two realities of human weakness and salvific glory coexist . My appeal for all Protestants is to find out how.

VIDEO: Protesters Chant 'John McCain's Dead' Outside Shapiro Lecture,"Students put on a shameful display Tuesday at Ohio State University, where conservative commentator Ben Shapiro appeared as part of his campus lecture tour. Leftist protesters who gathered outside the doors to the venue led chants of “Reagan’s dead” and “John McCain’s dead” while Shapiro attempted to deliver his remarks.

Video provided to The Federalist by Young America’s Foundation (in full disclosure, I’m on YAF’s board of directors) captured the pathetic demonstration. According to YAF, the national sponsor of Shapiro’s tour, protesters also started to chant “Bush Senior’s dead” before realizing they were mistaken.

A group of demonstrators can be seen chanting “F-ck Ben Shapiro” in the video below. They continued marching into the building where the event was being held, but did not manage to actually disrupt Shapiro’s lecture, YAF said.

While a productive and civil discussion is going on inside the event, the hypocrisy of the Left is on FULL BLAST outside the venue. There’s only one place that hate is coming from tonight and it’s not @BenShapiro… pic.twitter.com/YtstspUIzc — YAF (@yaf) November 14, 2018

The foundation also authenticated an email sent earlier on Tuesday to students in the school’s Morrill Scholars Program, asserting that Shapiro’s “rhetoric has the potential to threaten the emotional and mental safety of much of the campus community.” The message, signed by the program’s student advisory council, also noted anyone without a “safe space” or who didn’t “want to be alone” was welcome to gather with other students and staff from 5 to 8 p.m.

YAF owns the Reagan Ranch in Santa Barbara, which likely explains protestors’ chants about the 40th president’s death. What prompted the group to chant about the recent passing of a U.S. senator remains unclear, although it should be noted McCain fought and was a prisoner of war overseas to preserve their freedom to do so. For OSU’s senseless demonstrators, that might be worth dwelling on.

Is There Any Church Abuse Too Far For The Catholic Faithful?,"I am grateful for the many responses to my “Protestant Questions For Scandalized Catholics Who Still Remain Catholic,” whether in the comments thread, private correspondence, or replies published here at The Federalist and elsewhere.

I’m especially pleased that David Breitenbeck, almost singularly, understood that the central point of my essay was not that Catholics are wrong to remain Catholic in the light of recent scandals, but simply that “the reasons prominent Catholics have given publicly” for doing so appear, in many cases, less than adequate.

Most particularly, I’m happy to know that both Breitenbeck and Casey Chalk, at least implicitly, concede that this is the case. Breitenbeck does so by simply forwarding his own reason for remaining in the church, and ignoring the reasons the aforementioned prominent Catholics have publicly articulated.

Chalk does so by foregoing a plain reading of those authors in favor of esoteric exegesis. Thus, when Robert George makes the entirely uncontroversial claim that Christ will not allow the gates of hell to prevail against the church, what he’s really doing is invoking papal primacy and Roman infallibility. Or, when Matthew Petrusek makes the equally uncontroversial claim that Christianity is “ultimately all about” Christ crucified, what he’s actually doing is dog-whistling about the Eucharist, to “remind Catholics of what is unique about their own church.”

It’s All about the Eucharist—Or Not

Whatever one makes of that interpretive exercise, Chalk’s essay, like Breitenbeck’s, is to be commended for requiring no esoteric reading. Both are admirably explicit about what they believe to be unique about their church. Specifically, each appeals to the Eucharist, in which Christ himself is truly present.

Thus, in response to the question, “Do you believe Protestants have Christ?” Breitenbeck can answer, “Not as we [Catholics] do.” Instead, Protestants have a mere “echo or an image or a dream of Christ.” Less polemically, but for the same reason, Chalk can acknowledge that Protestants have Christ, but “they don’t possess him in his fullness.”

Given Catholic presuppositions, such assertions are entirely understandable. (Indeed, it was precisely the lack of such assertions in the recent writings of prominent Catholics that prompted my previous essay.) Believing that Protestant bodies lack apostolic succession, Catholics believe Protestant ordinations are invalid, and therefore Protestant clergy do not possess the power to confect the Sacrament.

For the sake of argument, let’s pretend all that is true. But let’s also remember that the original question addressed by George, Petrusek, and others wasn’t “Why not become Protestant?” It was “Why remain Catholic?” This being the question, even appeals to the Eucharist must be judged inadequate, for a reason Breitenbeck hinted at.

He notes that Eastern Orthodoxy makes things more “complicated.” Even on Catholic premises, the Orthodox truly have Christ in the Eucharist, because they have valid ordinations on account of a recognized apostolic succession (as, for example, Rod Dreher has repeatedly noted in explaining his own move to Orthodoxy from Catholicism). If matters were “ultimately all about” the Eucharist, then, it would have to be admitted that Eastern Orthodoxy remains a perfectly legitimate option for discouraged and disillusioned Catholics.

It’s All about the Papacy

Since neither Chalk nor Breitenbeck wants to concede this, however, we must look elsewhere for what’s actually “unique about their own church.” That which is most obviously unique—setting Catholicism apart not only from Protestantism but also from Eastern Orthodoxy—is of course its doctrine of the papacy, specifically its confession that the Bishop of Rome enjoys primacy in the church by divine right, and that, within certain parameters, his teaching is infallible.

As Chalk notes, this “Petrine primacy” and “doctrinal infallibility” are “intimately related to the nature of the Catholic Church.” This is because, as the Catechism of the Catholic Church (§881-882) asserts, Christ made Peter alone “the ‘rock’ of his Church,” so the papal office—with its “full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church”—“belongs to the Church’s very foundation.”

Because the papacy, in this understanding, is of the very essence of the church, those “ecclesial communities” not acknowledging or submitting to its primacy or infallibility are, Chalk notes, “not properly churches.” He charitably wants to avoid concluding that the members of such communities are not Christians, but it is precisely Rome’s unique claims about the papacy that make that conclusion difficult for Catholics to avoid. Chalk attempts to do so by appealing to what he describes as the “infallible magisterial authority” of the Second Vatican Council.

One problem with this is that it’s not actually clear even to many Catholics that Vatican II defined any infallible dogma. Pope Paul VI, who concluded that council, explained that it “avoided issuing solemn dogmatic definitions engaging the infallibility of the ecclesiastical Magisterium.” While still prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the future Pope Benedict XVI was even more blunt: “this particular council defined no dogma at all.”

No, Really, It’s All about the Papacy

An even greater problem is that, as alluded to in my earlier essay, Pope Boniface VIII, in a pronouncement that does bear all the marks of infallibility, declared, proclaimed, and defined that “it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff.” For good measure, the eleventh session of the Fifth Lateran Council reaffirmed that “subjection to the Roman pontiff is necessary for salvation for all Christ’s faithful.”

The clarity, authority, and consistency of such pronouncements are such that the pre-Vatican II Catholic Encyclopedia could remark without qualification or embarrassment that “this has been the constant teaching of the Church.” With equal bluntness it could specify the implications of this constant teaching: “When, therefore, the Greeks [i.e., the Orthodox] and others say they are not subject to the authority of Peter and his successors, they thus acknowledge that they do not belong to Christ’s sheep.”

While I can therefore appreciate the ecumenical charity Chalk expresses, such charity comes at the cost of playing fast and loose with Catholic history and theology. When he claims that “no faithful Catholic can believe” that Protestants stand outside the Christian faith, and that to do so “would mean rejecting Catholic doctrine,” one is forced to ask: Which Catholic doctrine? That of Vatican II, which “defined no dogma at all,” or that of Boniface VIII and Lateran V, which defined and reiterated “the constant teaching of the Church”?

Yes, I’m fully aware of the many attempts to harmonize Boniface VIII with Vatican II. But any explanation that requires “absolutely necessary” to be understood as “not absolutely necessary” involves an esotericism beyond the ken of all but the most ardent apologists. Also, any invocation of the “development of doctrine” must honestly address the obvious point often reiterated by the inestimable Ed Feser: “simply calling something a ‘development’ rather than a contradiction doesn’t make it so.”

Chalk’s decision to highlight only a single, recent, and questionable strand of the church’s teaching therefore suggests that it might be he rather than I who, in trying to simplify matters, is prone to “misinterpret or mischaracterize what Catholicism actually teaches.” The ongoing disputes about how actually to understand the content and authority of Vatican II’s pronouncements might further suggest that any confusion about Catholic theology is less attributable to me than to that theology itself.

Who, Then, Can Be Saved?

Indeed, the documents of the council themselves reveal at least a vague awareness of the corner into which the church was being painted. Despite its qualified assurance that Protestants “have a right to be called Christians,” for example, it (and the Catechism, §846) also explicitly states that “they could not be saved who, knowing that the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, would refuse either to enter it or to remain in it.”

To be sure, that word “knowing” leaves open a sizeable if subtle escape hatch. For example, despite regularly being told that the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, I certainly don’t “know” this to be the case. I’m in fact quite confident that the Catholic Church—as Roman Catholics understand it—was not so founded.

Thus, despite the generous loophole possibly left to me and others outside of Catholicism, I laud the brutal frankness of Breitenbeck’s reply from inside. He writes, “it is not a question of whether anyone can be saved outside the Catholic Church; it is a question of whether I can be saved outside her.” He answers by confessing, “I don’t think I could be saved if I abandoned her.”

Chalk is less explicit; but given his professed belief in Vatican II’s infallible authority, as well as his presumed “knowledge” that the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God, it seems safe to infer that he too believes he “could not be saved” if he refused “to remain in it.”

Concluding Questions

Some further and serious questions, then, for both of my interlocutors here and any of their likeminded co-religionists. What abuses, both physical and spiritual, might the hierarchy not commit, cover up, or even reward in the confident belief that the faithful can never depart without endangering or even forfeiting their salvation?

Where, if anywhere, is the line that cannot be crossed before one stops “knowing” that the Catholic Church was founded as “necessary”? Would reversals of “the constant teaching of the Church” cross such a line? About, say, subjection to the pope being necessary for salvation? Or regarding capital punishment? Or communion for the divorced and remarried?

Perhaps the line would be crossed if the church began—again—compelling magistrates to burn men and women to death for holding opinions contrary to its teaching? (Those of you who enjoy trolling Massimo Faggioli need not answer; your votes have already been tallied.) Since the line is apparently not to be located in decades of winking at sexual abuse, of protecting and even promoting the abusers, where exactly is it to be located?

Or is there no such line? Must one remain in the Catholic Church, as one of Dreher’s readers concludes, “even if every bishop is found to be serial rapists and murders”? Finally, if the church’s defenders publicly advertise that there is no line that, being crossed, might justify shaking Rome’s dust from one’s feet, do they not also become culpable for perpetuating the mindset partly responsible for the scandal once again roiling the church?

The Riots Over Macron’s Global Warming Tax Will Likely End His Career,"Count me among the disappointed about Emmanuel Macron. I listened closely to his 2016 campaign rhetoric and promises to return France to greatness. You might say he wanted to make France great again.

I was under no illusion that a former member of the Socialist Party and successful climber of the statist French elite was going to be a continental Margaret Thatcher, but his regular refrains about reform sounded genuine. I hoped that he understood France’s problems were a result of ignoring the counsel of great French thinkers and doers like Jean-Baptiste Say, Claude-Frédéric Bastiat, Alexis de Tocqueville and Marquis de Lafayette while embracing the unwise counsel of practically every other French thinker or doer since France began its journey toward republican government in the 18th century.

It was encouraging that he had talked about (and implemented) some reforms when he served in the previous administration of the socialist François Hollande. As minister of the economy and finance, Macron pushed business-friendly reforms. His career as an investment banker doesn’t mean, in my view, that he learned the best lessons about capitalism, but I’m sure they were better for his future government career as a reformer than if he had been a labor union leader.

In sum, because of his resume and rhetoric, as he ran for the presidency one hoped he would bring hard but good medicine to a state and a culture that wanted none of it. I expected the typical French public revulsion at being told that the state should not micromanage business, but thought Macron would hold firm and use his almost total control of government and initial popularity to weather the protests and force the issue.

French presidents are almost kinglike in their authority, and Macron had that, plus a landslide victory and immense popularity. But Macron disappointed in three major ways.

Macron’s Fixation With The Wrong Issues

First, he hasn’t put forward a reform agenda deep and broad enough to get at the root problem: low growth in the French economy due to its high costs of labor. Employers cannot make the economy boom (and make the government popular through expanded employment) if they cannot afford to do it.

Macron is like most technocrats in that he wants the state to manage debt and budgets above all, but right now, after decades of tinkering, France needs bold reform that puts business in the lead of the economy. He says he worries over debt and European union fiscal mandates, and we know his goal is to outshine Germany’s Angela Merkel (who doesn’t matter much anymore), but this just won’t do.

He admirably weathered protests over his early reforms of the railways and other smaller matters, after watering them down, but what really matters is making France an engine of economic growth through its business community and foreign investors. So far, he’s not impressed them much and the really big reforms of labor rules and pensions don’t appear likely given his fall from grace.

Second, he appears to have made as much of himself as the press did early on, and that’s always a mistake. Hubris is what the Ancient Greeks called it. Thinking that a mandate from the voters means what you think it means––or that it lasts once the pain of reform sets in–is unwise, especially in France, with the body politic being as fickle as they come.

Inevitably, the shine faded from the new administration, but Macron didn’t seem to notice. The media stopped fawning and started reflecting the public’s mood, and together, the public and media have brought this erstwhile champion low. His foolish attempt to protect a favorite among his security detail portrayed a president who thought himself above the law, and the public might never forgive him for that.

Third, he’s now trying the wrong things to solve his problems. By taking on President Trump, he might encourage France’s Trump-hating population (I am sure there are many) but he won’t be doing anything to fix the French economy. Sparring with Trump might eventually be ridiculed as a sideshow especially as, in doing that, he’s also talking up his plans for a European army.

That, too, might fire up those who want to pretend France is the leader of Europe and Europe is the leader of the world, but surely everyone in France (and Europe) knows deep down that this is a hollow gesture. Europe has neither the money nor the will to defend itself. Even if it did, nationalism is waxing, not waning, and Europe remains divided, as Donald Rumsfeld noted, between old and new Europe.

Besides, no one trusts the two senior European powers (France and Germany, as the UK is almost out of Europe and too close to the United States anyway) to lead Europe. So Macron can posture as the leader of the preeminent global leader of Europe and thus the world, and take on climate change, but the average French citizen who did not attend the École Polytechnique is still highly irritated that he is paying more for fuel.

The public reaction to Macron’s fuel tax increase that caused this weekend’s protests is making him even less popular and represents a profound challenge to Macron’s future. He may have even blown his chance to truly reform France’s economy.

The Tax Fuel Protests Are Serious Cause For Concern

The protests over the fuel tax were worse than we have seen in a long time in France. As many as 250,000 people came out across the country, with Paris’s center becoming almost a war zone. Previous presidents have, of course, suffered protests whenever tough economic measures had to be taken. And Macron, as noted above, has endured his fair share.

But this is happening without his major reforms in place. Instead, he’s focused on an elitist concern about people driving their cars too much, never mind that the poor are struggling to get to work, run their small businesses, and buy food that must be transported.

This is just too bad. Europe and the United States need a strong France led by a capable leader. The challenges we face in an aggressive Russia and a rising China, as well as terrorism and global economic growth, are considerable. France can be a leader and an important ally for the United States, but not if its government is unwilling to to address its root problems and instead engages in delusional thinking about France’s role in the world.

This delusional thinking is a serious problem. Outside observers placed so much hope in Macron because he appeared to be the only French leader capable of taking on the real problem: the delusions of the French people about economics. Indeed, the delusions weighing down on France are not simply those of its elites.It is the people of France who suffer the delusion that the state can micromanage the economy while still promoting economic well-being.

France Needs to Come to Its Senses, and Soon

The French have never rejected statism, nor have they ever really been asked to. Every French government of the right, left, or center maintains a statist view of economics: the French rely too much on the state to coddle labor and they want the government to regulate business so it can’t compete without protection.

Sometimes, when the French people voted in a socialist government, they got socialism in its pretty pure form, like in the early Mitterand administration of the 1980s. But once it failed miserably, the Mitterand government pulled back, not to free market economics but to statism. Conservative governments have hardly been better. In sum, the French do not reject statism, centralized government, and an overly regulated market, they just want someone to make their preferences work. Good luck with that.

Macron can complain all he likes about “a very small element of far right and the far left” engaging in violent protests, but his plans are wholly unpopular with the whole of France. The protestors are not some extremist elements representing a tiny portion of the population: they represent his countrymen’s views at the death of their dream of a magic young man who promised to save them.

It is highly likely that he’ll limp through the rest of his term and face declining chances of being re-elected, because he’s no longer seen as a wise elitist trying to reform the French state and economy. Instead, he looks like a hectoring elitist who cares more about his personal agenda and fame. But then the French have only themselves to blame: they want their cake, and to eat it, too.

"France's Riots Aren't Just About Gas Taxes, But About The West's Decline","This past week, Parisians in yellow safety vests took to the streets to riot against French leadership. They have defaced the Arc de Triomphe, thrown rocks at policemen and soldiers, and lit fires all over the city. Macron literally had egg on his face and continues to suffer abysmal approval ratings, while the current protests enjoy high approval ratings in the country, despite the destruction.

Most commentary (which happened all over France, not just Paris) has focused on the fuel tax increase as the main reason for the protests, as though the French have never paid exorbitant taxes before. It has also characterized the yellow vest protests as a recent event, but they had been going on for weeks before they became violent these past few days.

Macron and the French media have unsurprisingly tried to pin the protests and riots on Marine Le Pen’s racist minions without evidence, while residents in France have claimed that the protesters are mostly middle-aged Frenchmen with no political affiliation.

Losing the Body and Soul of France

While protests and car-burnings are actually common in France, what’s happening now is much worse than usual and will not go away anytime soon. What observers should know is that this is not about fuel prices or Macron’s incompetence; this is about the fall of the West.

People have long complained of France losing its soul by becoming a secularized, progressive, socialist welfare state shortly after two miserable losses in the two world wars. After being known for its fine arts, beautiful landscapes, rich Catholic tradition, genius philosophers and scientists, and famous monuments, people now see France as a stagnant irrelevant pool of decadence (this descent is captured well in Thomas Merton’s description of the country in Seven Storey Mountain).

It is the land of nasty writers like Celine and Michel Houellebecq, nasty singers like Serge Gainsbourg, and nasty architecture like the Musee de Pompidou. All the same, most Frenchmen didn’t seem to mind this decline as long as they could have shorter workweeks and socialized health care.

As a result of losing its soul, France has also been losing its body—its people, communities, business, and infrastructure. Like the rest of the developed world, the French are having fewer children and compensate for the population loss by taking in more immigrants. Consequently, the Parisian slums keep expanding while French villages gradually disappear.

The lucky few French workers who actually have a job labor under heavier tax burdens and can afford little. Middle-class families are lucky if they own a small apartment, an economy car, and a set of cheap clothes from China. The luxury products sold on the Champs-Elysees and elsewhere are mainly for the rich.

The most striking sign of decline in France for people visiting, however, is the disintegrating infrastructure. The government will go to great lengths to keep its landmarks safe and relatively clean, but it cannot hide the graffiti that mars everything, from train cars to buildings. It also cannot extinguish the stench of urine, feces, and body odor from the homeless, permeating every public space. Even if the roads are kept up in most places (thanks to high fuel prices, high tolls, and light, fuel-efficient cars), the subways and trains are decades old and decrepit.

To make matters worse, French cities feature ghettos of unassimilated immigrants who pose an ever-increasing drag on the economy and culture. They do not speak French; they do not work; some of them follow Muslim Sharia law; and they make up much of the country’s poverty, crime, and terrorism (“no-go zones”). They also collect handsome taxpayer benefits. For this reason, the protesters are also calling for France to vote against the UN migration pact, an agreement that would undermine participating countries’ efforts to regulate migration.

The Elites Fail to Respond to a Dying France

Those in charge of France, a very obvious class of elites, have responded by covering their eyes and ears, holding their noses, and spewing out platitudes about diversity and the global community. Naturally, the media and academy support them and allow them to rule over the French very much like the aristocracy before the French Revolution. Shilling for the European Union, climate change, and birth control while railing against nationalism and Trump, childless yet youthful Emmanuel Macron is the perfect symbol of this group.

For those wondering who the other choices for president were, there was Francois Fillon, a center-right candidate accused of hiring and paying family members for work they didn’t do, and Marine Le Pen, politician who was forced to take a psychiatric examination for tweeting images of ISIS murders. Like his predecessor, Francois “Mr. Normal” Holland, Macron just had to stay boring and maintain the status quo to win the presidency.

It is this whole miserable state of affairs that the French are protesting. France, and most other countries in the Western world, are on an unsustainable course. Taxes, the political establishment, ghost towns in “La France profonde,” nationalism, globalism, and the rest of it are all symptoms of the same underlying malaise.

The riots and protests are also symptoms. Although perhaps cathartic, they will not solve anything. People who resort to violence have rejected the merits of reasoned debate and fair elections. The French who used to be so proud of their republic are now opting for mob rule.

As history can attest—most notably the French Revolution—mob rule doesn’t end well. If it succeeds in toppling a government, it almost always results in an autocracy, like that of Napoleon. If it doesn’t succeed, it leads to a corrupt oligarchy or elite that doubles down on anti-democratic practices, like what’s happening in EU countries today.

Angry Masses, Disconnected Elites, and No True Leaders

For real reform, the people need leadership—intellectual leaders, political leaders, and economic leaders. In other words—and populists will undoubtedly cringe at this—they need their own elite. Unlike their American cousins across the pond, French conservatives do not have an elite. They have angry masses of people who have rejected the status quo, but have not seriously embraced a clear path forward.

Hating the EU, the UN, mass migration, Macron, and high taxes will not lead to constructive reform. Only if this energy is channeled into articulating a vision for transcendent, cohesive ideals such as limited government, free speech, free market capitalism, and a return to orthodox Christianity will the French have any hope of returning to their former glory.

As for the rest of the world, they should take heed at what is unfolding in the streets of Paris. In many ways, France is simply further along in the progressive experiment than other countries in the West. English Prime Minister Theresa May’s cowardice in carrying out Brexit will likely spark similar kinds of protests, and Angela Merkel is now paying immigrants to leave Germany in order to keep the peace in her country.

The United States is different only in that it is a few decades behind. Conservatives here do have an elite (although a much smaller, less influential one than liberals), which is divided between those who support Trump and those who don’t (although the latter is quickly disappearing). Nevertheless, many conservatives fear that Trump may be the last Republican president before the inevitable decline brought on by liberals’ stranglehold on the culture. Once that decline comes, Americans will take to the streets and voice their grievances like the French people are doing now.

So let the events in Europe be a warning to Americans here: progressive policies will slowly but surely work their ruin on any society, and it’s incumbent on conservatives today to counteract this by supporting their own elite and exercising the civic duties responsibly (i.e. voting for good candidates, challenging injustice, and defending essential freedoms). Not only should this be done for posterity, but for the sake of protesters around the world who are fighting for the same things.

The Carbon Tax Riots May Be The Breaking Point For France’s Socialism,"France’s motto is “Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité,” or “Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood.” Over several decades the French government has tried to achieve this motto through socialist policies. However, French President Emmanuel Macron’s climate change gas tax hike appears to be a watershed moment.

Many French working and middle-class citizens feel they have little liberty to live how they would like. They also feel that there is a lack of equality regarding public services and a lack of brotherhood between different parts of France as well as between government officials, like President Macron, and the middle class.

This sentiment has created much of what is being called the “yellow vest” movement. This movement appears to be comprised of mainly the French middle class; however, many supporters are said to be from various socioeconomic backgrounds. The one uniting factor appears to be the gas tax. France has been rocked by yellow vest protests for the last four weeks. Now this movement is appearing in Belgium and the Netherlands.

Could this be the beginning of the end for European socialism? Maybe. According to interviews with yellow vest protesters and their supporters, liberty, in terms of being free and having the power to do what they wish, is diminishing.

Some protestors took control of a toll booth and allowed cars to travel free of charge. Jacques, a teacher and yellow vest protester, said the road was once used by everyday French people to go on vacation and was known as the “holiday road,” but due to increasing costs average citizens can no longer afford to take such vacations. Another protestor said many people feel they can’t afford Christmas presents for their children.

Chris Despres, a baker, lamented that he cannot hire more employees because of the taxes he would pay. Cindy Conseil, a wife and mother, was forced to move her family from their home to be closer to her husband’s workplace in order to reduce his fuel costs. Every month at the end of the month, both Florian Dou, a warehouse handler, and Fabrice Girardin, a former carpet layer, wonder if they will have enough food for their families.

According to many yellow vest protestors and supporters, there is also a lack of equality and brotherhood in France. One problem is that some French working-class citizens live in an economic “no man’s land” where they earn too much to qualify for welfare, but too little to make ends meet. Additionally, there are large regional inequalities regarding access to health care.

Another problem is that there is a perception of two Frances, Parisian France and the other France. Macron, a former banker, has been dubbed “President of the Rich” by many working-class citizens who saw him remove the wealth tax from his rich Paris constituency then propose a gas tax on his “other” constituency.

After more than four weeks of protests and violence by the yellow vests and others, Macron spoke to the French citizens on December 10. In an attempt to save his political career, Macron pleaded with them to stop the violence and proclaimed that he heard and understood their discontent.

During his speech, Macron promised several last-minute political Christmas gifts. Macron’s promises included an increase in minimum wage, policies to help all graduates find a job, tax free overtime pay, and an end-of-year, non-taxed bonus for every worker. So who will pay for these political promises? Most likely the working class will, either with their jobs or with their money.

In the short-term, Macron may survive; however, his chances of survival are not high, since protests have continued even after his government dropped the gas tax proposal. Now protestors are calling on Macron to resign. In the long-term, it is becoming clear that socialism is gasping for air and struggling for life. In France, there is a feeling of frustration with the low quality of life and increasing financial hardships citizens endure. This frustration seems to be shared by people in other European countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, where similar protests have emerged.

Like other European countries, France has high tax rates in order to pay for its ever-increasing and overburdened welfare system. To make matters worse, Alexis Spire, a French sociologist, asserts that the average French citizen expects welfare programs to be available, but they are growing weary of paying taxes.

These people may believe in climate change and want to protect the environment, but not at the expense of their families and their lives. Eventually, a line will be crossed where services and resources will be unavailable to most people, similar to what has happened in Venezuela. With immigration issues, high unemployment, a stagnating economy and a national debt of more than $2.5 trillion, along with other economic and social issues, how much longer can socialism in France or other similarly situated European countries survive?

If the middle class feels threatened by the status quo, then perhaps winter will come for socialism. According to political scientists such as Carles Boix, author of “Democracy and Redistribution,” Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, authors of “Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy,” and Ben Ansell and David Samuels, authors of “Inequality and Democratization,” the middle class is a critical factor for regime survival. This is one reason the yellow vest protests are significant political events. The middle class has access to vehicles, social media, and enough money to travel to Paris to protest the Macron government. These resources make a frustrated French middle class a legitimate immediate concern for Macron and for French politics overall.

The path leading to the demise of France’s socialistic policies will likely be long. One possible path leads to bankruptcy and the kind of despair and desperation that we see in countries like Venezuela. However, there is another possible path. There is one political party that could act as a mechanism for transforming France and leading to the eventual end of socialism.

This political party is called Debout La France (DLF), which means “Stand Up France.” DLF is viewed as a political party concerned with France’s diminishing sovereignty. DLF is headed by Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a French politician and former presidential candidate “whose power base is in the suburban and semi-rural Essonne region south of Paris.”

DLF has supported the yellow vest movement from the beginning and has argued that yellow vest protests should not be silenced due to the recent terrorist attack in Strasbourg. DLF is encouraging all lovers of France to unite and has called on Macron to come up with real long-term solutions to the French people’s lack of purchasing power and to rein in government spending. Additionally, DLF is calling for the French government to allow citizen referendums on major issues, which is something the yellow vest protesters are also advocating.

The yellow vest movement is multifaceted and not directly calling for the end of socialist policies. However, the movement is complaining about the low standard of living and beginning to question the relationship between the French government and its citizens. Many French citizens share the belief that taxes are too high and hurting both the working class and small businesses.

With political parties like the DLF supporting the yellow vest movement and calling for long-term economic solutions, such as reductions in government spending, this could be the first step of many to come that could end socialism in France. As calls for the reduction in government spending and taxes continue, there will have to be a national discussion regarding welfare spending and other socialist policies. However, this would require the yellow vest movement to not dissolve after the Strasbourg attack and for the DLF to effectively capitalize on its connection with the yellow vest movement.

Students Insist Sarah Lawrence College Is Racist Because Tuition Is Pricy,"The newly formed Diaspora Collection, a group of students, has taken over the main administrative building on the Sarah Lawrence College’s campus, the Dutch-inspired Westlands, and issued a list of demands. The students at this longtime deeply leftist institution allege that the college is racist, based on the college president’s backing of a professor who wrote that college administrations are politically far left and a huge list of other grievances.

Protest at Difference in Dialogue https://t.co/dNhgRIHsyG — The Phoenix (@SLCPhoenix) March 13, 2019

If Sarah Lawrence is a racist institution of higher education, there is absolutely no hope for anyone anywhere. We should basically pack up our things and move back home, because if there is any institution in the nation that is willing to hate itself more for its failure to meet its absolute best intentions on making things right for all the glittering, unicorn-y, peace-loving, spectacularly doe-eyed and lovely students of the world, it’s Sarah Lawrence College.

The tiny, idyllic Sarah Lawrence College campus, with an undergrad population of some 1,400 students, is a comfortable place to be. Learning is paramount, and introspection a mandate. I know all this because Sarah Lawrence is my alma mater. I’d say Go Gryphons, but I went there in the 1990s, and we didn’t care about non-stoned sports then. Situated in the glorious northeast corridor of overly elitist institutions of higher education, with institutional peers such as Bard, Wesleyan, Hampshire, and Bennington, Sarah Lawrence is a hotbed of leftist orthodoxy.

The Diaspora Coalition’s Issue

Case in point are the protests happening there right now. The Diaspora Coalition and their allies have been sitting in, chanting, and generally causing a stir to call attention to the plight of being mistreated by one of the most liberal, leftist educational institutions in the northeast.

The student newspaper, The Phoenix, has been documenting all this on Twitter. In one of the videos, the students of the Diaspora Coalition, surrounded by the curved, hard wood banister of Westlands, and the outdated carpeting, chant, “When black and brown bodies are under attack? What do we do!” The reply comes loud and clear: “Stand up, fight back.”

It’s true that I completed my Sarah Lawrence bachelor’s degree way back in the 20th century, and haven’t been back to campus in a few years. But even way back then, no one was under attack. Like, it’s not Baghdad. No one has been under attack at Sarah Lawrence in the history of Sarah Lawrence. There are not violent, hate crime type events on the this quaint, Westchester campus in the rich little towny town of Bronxville, New York. Protest, however, is part of the culture.

Back in the 1990s, there was a big protest because a beloved professor didn’t get tenure. Lots of beloved professors didn’t get tenure that year, but this one was a lot of students’ favorite, and one of the few professors who was a person of color, so students protested. Students went on a hunger strike, and because they were so hungry and needed to keep their strength up, they ate plain bagels and drank orange juice. (Classic Sarah Lawrence-style self-care. We’re not afraid to take what we need.)

Another clip from this latest protest, courtesy of the Phoenix’s Twitter feed, shows students chanting “Stop the perversity, we want diversity!” But oh, young whippersnappers, we went to Sarah Lawrence for the perversity. You’ve got this whole thing upside down.

Just as they claim, the school was not founded on diversity. Instead, it was basically supposed to be a sort of intelligent finishing school for young ladies who needed somewhere to go before they got husbands. And it found success in that space for a while. What could be more perverse than that? That it developed an identity of its own as a liberal bastion of quirky thought and open ideas and rigorous standards of academic exploration is a testament to the work put in by the faculty and students to date.

In the age of wokeness, of course, none of this is enough. That the school tries, while being broke, to facilitate everyone, to speak the right pronouns, to give to her students like some collegiate Little Edie who knows the cupboard is bare when offering you her last biscuit, is not enough for the Diaspora Coalition.

That diaspora means the dispersal of any people from their original homeland, and these students are all paying (in one way or another) a large tuition fee to voluntarily be at Sarah Lawrence instead of their local, home state schools, is apparently irrelevant. Squatters unite, or whatever.

A Bastion Of Privilege

Tuition in 2018-19 was something like $55,000 per year. Sarah Lawrence is a cool and quirky school and everything, and I’m glad I went there and all that, but is anything that comes in at $55,000 per year good? The massive tuition expense has something to do with what the student protesters are on about. They want more kids to be able to attend, and don’t believe that the large tuition should dissuade students from attending. But is it so wrong to say that maybe it could be?

I know this is not the going wisdom from my fellow SLC classmates, and that they would call me out on this in a second, but is it really so bad to say that if, even given full financial accommodations, a prospective student and her family can’t afford the school, that maybe she should go to another school? One where she doesn’t have to suffer food and housing insecurity and come out the other side with a burden of debt larger than the GDP of some small countries?

It is with expenses in mind that the Diaspora Coalition has released their list of demands, and here they are, broken down in plain English. It’s not surprising that pretty much all of their demands, except for “stop centering whiteness,” cost money.

Winter housing, no charge, with free food

Segregated housing for students of color, that will increase in size with demand

Basic toiletries for all

Free meals in a variety of restricted options, for any students in need, including grad students

Staffed food pantry for 300 students per semester. (Somehow this is in addition to the free meal plans?)

Kosher kitchen

Full-time staff position as administrative liaison for first-generation college students

Increase in book, travel, and internship stipends

Redesign the website to be available in more languages and for more non-traditional students

Free storage over summer

Free health insurance

A first-year (that’s freshman for all you non-Sarah Lawrence people, because we’re egalitarian like that) seminar about intellectual elitism and classism

Reduction in some tuition-based fees

Extra info sessions for international students who don’t speak English

Off-campus transit to storage locations and therapy sessions

Seminars on American taxes for international students and counseling for the same

Admit more students with financial need from the Global South, with recruitment efforts

Expand international scholarship funds

Give international students jobs on campus since they are not legally allowed to work in the United States (but if they’re not allowed to work in the United States, and the campus isn’t some specialized diplomatic zone…you see the conundrum).

Two new tenured professors in African diasporic studies, but only one each of Asian, Latinx, and indigenous backgrounds, who will then teach courses in the areas of their ethnicity. (Do they get to teach other stuff? Or must their ethnic and racial backgrounds determine what they can teach?)

Stop taking money from the Koch Brothers. (So this is interesting: The Diaspora Coalition would like the college to spend a grand heap of money, but also would like to give some back? This money isn’t good enough? Is the board supposed to find pure money somewhere? Untouched by heathen hands? Perhaps soaked in the blood of young virgins who died for their purity?)

Revoke tenure for Professor Samuel Abrams (He wrote an op-ed in the New York Times about how school administrators are leftist…crickets? Yeah, me too.)

Add specialized diversity staff, hired only from a pool of people of color, per Title IX: a dean, a director, and an assistant director

Three new therapists, of specific ethnic and racial backgrounds (if they’re on campus, then who do the students need rides to?)

Annual diversity training

Scholarships specifically for students of color for the full four years

An endowment set aside for these scholarships

Annual fundraising goals for the endowment (oh, for sure, yeah, the president of the college and the board don’t try desperately to fund raise as much as possible already. And hey, look how successful they were with the Koch Brothers? Oh, wait, yeah, let’s give that money back, shall we? Good call. Pats on backs all around the daisy chain.)

Stipends for the students with the specialized scholarship, and private housing, and a meal plan, and field trips throughout the year! (Who doesn’t love a field trip?)

Meet all financial needs of all students of color (Is this before or after the funds are secured in the endowment?)

Guaranteed work study (Maybe someone wants to be the new dean? Or drive those cars to therapy? Staff the food pantry? Best way to make some jobs, spend some money you don’t have.)

$500 per semester to eight identity specific student groups. (So $8,000 per year for segregated clubs!)

Land acknowledgment. (Sure, surprised we didn’t have this already, frankly.)

No repercussions for missing work study or class for participating in protests. (Because yeah, no one should have to make tough choices or prioritize one thing over another.)

In short, the Diaspora Coalition demands that the college fix all the problems! And all at once! Or else they will shut the school down and take their $55,000 per year with them! Even though they don’t want to pay it anyway. What’s interesting is the one, giant, glaring neon omission in these demands: At no point does the Diaspora Coalition ask for a reduction of base tuition itself.

Why, oh Diaspora Coalition, don’t you just ask if there’s a way costs can be cut and tuition lowered, so that more students from lower-income backgrounds can attend without the president and board having to send out more asks for donations that I can’t reply to because I went to Sarah Lawrence and my sole qualifications are to think deeply and write fast? The most egalitarian, equitable thing any of these glorified private institutions of learning can do is reduce tuition from unfathomably high to maybe sort of manageable.

College President Cristle Collins Judd issued a statement on March 12, after meeting with students. In true Sarah Lawrence fashion, she acknowledged the nobility of their purpose, placed them within the protest history of the school, but she absolutely would not back down in refusing to revoke tenure for Samuel Abrams. For Judd, “the proper response [to offense or grievancd] is vigorous and informed debate and criticism.”

This non-emotional, facts over feelings, rational approach is exactly what is missing in so much of cultural discourse. Judd takes the students seriously, but maintains her position as both educator, and the only adult in the room.

If the kids occupying Westlands can’t see that, they truly have no idea what they want, or how to get it. Go back to class, learn something, and get off my lawn.

Protest Erupts Outside New York Times Offices Over Anti-Semitic Cartoon,"Last week, in its international edition, The New York Times ran a blatantly anti-Semitic political cartoon that depicted a blind President Trump being led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was depicted as a dog wearing a collar with a star of David. This was not trading in tropes. This was old-school, nauseating bigotry that would not be out of place on neo-Nazi websites or the deepest, darkest corners of Reddit.

The Times has apologized (disclosure, I have written for the Times) but for many New Yorkers that just wasn’t good enough. Monday evening, they staged a protest outside the lavish offices of the Gray Lady and demanded the firing of those involved with publishing the offensive cartoon.

At a time when anti-Semitism is growing around the world, synagogues in the United States are the subject of terrorist shootings, and Jews in New York are being violently attacked at an alarming rate, the response from the Times to its outrageous decision to run the cartoon is underwhelming and unacceptable.

According to Hillary Barr, one of the organizers of the protest, who works with Mothers Against Terrorism, “whoever was involved with the decision to publish this cartoon must be fired immediately.” She went on to say that “if it were any other race or religion it would never have been published.”

Robert Rogoff, wearing Trump 2020 garb, went even further. He and his wife are planning to move this year to Israel, and for Rogoff, this cartoon was evidence that America is becoming increasingly hostile to Jews. Rogoff told me that “The Democratic Party makes us feel unwelcome as Jews.” He fears that if Trump loses the 2020 election, this situation will become even worse.

The first speaker, Jeffrey Weisenfeld, asked a fair question: “Would the New York Times run a caricature of any other race of people?” The answer is, almost certainly, no. So why did the paper feel comfortable portraying Jews as literal dogs? The speaker said this harkened back to the bigoted media representations of Jews in pre-Nazi Germany. He called for an independent investigation, arguing that the Times could not be trusted to police itself on this issue.

Former New York Assemblyman Dove Hikind rallied the crowd with the chant, “Shame on the New York Times.” He recalled the ways the paper denied the Holocaust as it was happening. He said that from 1939 to 1945, the Times ran 23,000 headlines. Of them, only 26 stories were about the Holocaust. This is not a fantastic record for a paper of record. Hikind said that he is a Democrat, but a very embarrassed one.

During Hikind’s remarks, the crowd began shouting, “Where is Schumer?” Well, the Senate minority leader, a Democrat from New York, wasn’t there today. What his reaction is to this controversy is not entirely clear. Schumer has had no press conference regarding the incident and might fairly be said to be hiding. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler also came under attack for his lack of outrage over the cartoon.

The next speaker was professor Alan Dershowitz, who described himself as a formerly strong supporter of The New York Times who does not understand how this could have happened: “The New York Times has been wrong so often when it comes to Israel and when it comes to the Jewish people.” He suggested that because The New York Times is owned by Jews, they bend over backwards to not be seen as pro-Jewish.

Dershowitz particularly called out the Times for editorializing in its reporting, calling their “news analysis” pieces little more than opinion posing as news. He’s absolutely right.

Ultimately, the biggest question is: How did open and offensive anti-Semitism become something that professional journalists are unable to recognize? Have Jews so completely become white people in the eyes of progressives that they may now be treated, like white people, as a problem in society that has to be fought? If so — and it increasingly seems to be so — can’t that be achieved without literally depicting Jews as dogs?

The New York Times has much to be ashamed about here, and their response has been extremely weak. The good news is that American Jews have taken notice and are prepared to respond.

Soccer Star Megan Rapinoe Uses Soccer To Push Her Politics,"United States Women’s National Soccer Team (USWNT) player Megan Rapinoe recently declared, “I’ll probably never put my hand over my heart. “I’ll probably never sing the national anthem again” (mphasis mine). Fewer than 30 days before the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup, where USWNT will defend their world title, it was only a matter of time before the elephant in the room revealed itself once again.

It started three years ago, at the height of the national anthem protests. In a show of solidarity with protest spearhead Colin Kaepernick, Rapinoe knelt during the national anthem before a match with her club team and, later, before an international match. After U.S. Soccer expressed its disapproval, Rapinoe ceased her protest, but no longer sings the anthem nor places her hand over her heart.

Then and now, Rapinoe expressed anger with the reaction to the protests, including hers. “I think it’s actually pretty disgusting the way [Kaepernick] was treated and the way that a lot of the media has covered it and made it about something that it absolutely isn’t,” she said in 2016. “We need to have a more thoughtful, two-sided conversation about racial issues in this country.”

Rapinoe is correct—a more thoughtful, two-sided conversation regarding just about every issue is needed in this country. Besides toxic rhetoric, there is a startling lack of good faith and dedication to reasoned argument that is either the product of a faltering civil society or a contributing factor to it.

But, as the saying goes, there’s a time and place for everything. The Women’s World Cup is a prime face of the USWNT and a de facto national emissary. Is this international athletic tournament that has grown grander in stature over the years the place to air grievances and express what can only be described as contempt for one’s country?

Rapinoe Needs to Consider the Effects of Her Choices

The choice is hers alone. But should she persist in being a “walking protest,” as Rapinoe describes herself, she would benefit her team and country to acknowledge the unfortunate and unnecessary distraction and divisive effects her actions pose.

Of course, if Rapinoe feels as strongly about her cause as she seems, she is not only free to protest but probably should. Americans should never be forced to choose between their conscience and their livelihood, nor be discouraged from taking part in the important conversations of the day. The nation doesn’t need less engagement from citizens, it needs more.

But the freedom to protest has been conflated with the constitutional right to protest. As many legal analysts pointed out, there’s no such thing as the latter. Paul Callan explained in 2017: “The First Amendment restricts only the government from abridging ‘the freedom of speech.’ Private employers can do as they please. Thus, kneeling during the National Anthem can never be legally prohibited by the government, but can always be prohibited by private employers.”

Nobody needs to indulge any player’s personal conduct. As a recent interview with ESPN President Jimmy Pitaro reveals, most fans believe athletics and politics shouldn’t mix.

Soccer’s Entry into the Culture War

In the case of U.S. Soccer and the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL), however, that ship may have already sailed. Both organizations became embroiled in the culture wars long before Rapinoe’s protests. Soccer in the United States has a strong LGBTQ following. U.S. Soccer celebrates Pride month every year and invests considerable time and money in LGBTQ-associated programs. More than any other sport in America, soccer has been at the forefront of ensuring LGBTQ people can partake in the game openly and have their interests represented.

A supporter of such gestures would counter by saying this isn’t about politics, but about acceptance, tolerance, and a constant reminder the game is open to all. But is it, really? In June 2017, fellow USWNT player Jaelene Hinkle discovered there isn’t a whole lot of room in professional soccer for those who aren’t in lockstep with the LGBTQ movement.

After being called up to the national team in June 2017, Hinkle, a devout Christian, withdrew herself from the roster, later citing personal opposition to wearing the rainbow-adorned jerseys celebrating Pride month. She faced tremendous backlash from fans and critics, who made a fair point about whether her views might cause issues in a LGBTQ-saturated sport—many players are open regarding their sexual orientation, which can generate controversy in other sports.

The point isn’t to judge Hinkle’s beliefs. It’s to show why so many Americans are wary of turning sports into yet another culture war battlefield. Hinkle’s views were virtually unknown prior to the June ’17 incident, and she didn’t divulge her reasons for her withdrawal until much later. Moreover, according to coaches and teammates, her “homophobic” views had never been an issue on the playing field.

Even her critics had no choice but to concede the Pride month flap had created an unfortunate dilemma where the USWNT would have to enter the World Cup without a player described by many as one of the best at her position. The culture wars’ effects on sports are undeniable—they impose ideological conformity in an arena where athletic ability and a willingness to represent one’s country should serve as the sole litmus test.

Nobody should be forced to choose between her conscience and her livelihood, but the culture wars often assess such a decision. Hinkle chose her conscience. Although she hasn’t expressed any regret, between her and Rapinoe, only one made such a choice, and it wasn’t the latter. More importantly, one player sacrificed a once-in-a-lifetime privilege due to her personal convictions, while the other insists on using that same privilege to essentially declare, “You’re either with me or against me.”

Rapinoe: Representing America?

Rapinoe will likely go down as one of the greatest soccer players in American history. She has been a key cog in the machine that has won three World Cups and is the clear favorite to win a fourth in 2019. It’s more reason why it’d be so unfortunate to see her as likely the only player in the entire tournament to draw such a stark line in the sand between herself and her country.

While Rapinoe insists her protest is about “representing all of America,” how exactly does a protest represent her country in any capacity? Protesting during a league game is one thing. Doing so during international matches is another. It sends the message that her differences with her country are irreconcilable to the point she, even on the grandest global stage of them all, cannot set them aside.

If these differences are irreconcilable, then why not follow the example of Hinkle and commit the ultimate protest of all: leave the national team? This would at least be consistent with Rapinoe’s belief that U.S. Soccer has insufficiently addressed the critical issues of the day, accusing the federation of “[trying] to just stop me from doing what I’m doing instead of at least having a conversation, and trying to figure out a [solution] that makes sense for everyone.”

Only extreme culture warriors honestly believe institutions like U.S. Soccer can solve all the world’s problems. They’re not policymakers nor partisan institutions. They exist solely to regulate a game beloved by millions around the world, entertain and, hopefully, unite a world in a shared passion.

For that unity to manifest, players must be willing to set aside their differences when walking onto the pitch. Representing all Americans includes representing those they don’t see eye-to-eye with.

The overall controversy would be minimal had Rapinoe chosen to pursue social justice during her personal time, but her insistence on using the soccer pitch to do it has made the situation more fraught than it needs to be. In the end, her “somber protest” will find acclaim among those who share her views and upbraid those who simply want to see the United States win another world title without engaging in self-loathing. Less hyperpartisanship might be a tough ask, but more is the last thing America needs.

Unfortunate as her actions may prove, Americans who choose to tune in to the 2019 Women’s World Cup can offset any negative impact her “somber protest” will have by setting the example themselves—support the USWNT and Rapinoe in a highly competitive tournament. It would send the message that, for all our differences, we still comprise one nation worth honoring and proudly representing on the world stage, proving again that yes, we can rise above our differences and accomplish great things. It’s the American thing to do.

"30 Years After The Tiananmen Square Massacre, One Protester Reflects","In late May and early June, 1989, students and workers took to the streets to protest the Chinese’s government and push for democracy and better-secured human rights. Thirty years after the immortalized protest, a Chinese-American protester who was there, and who wishes to remain anonymous for personal and security reasons, reflects on the protest, China’s improvements, and how far the country has to go. Interview with Paulina Enck. Here are her words:

At the time, almost everyone went on the streets. It was this general feeling that there was too much corruption, too much economic imbalances, and for students, it was for a semblance of democracy, more representation of people’s will. Political and economic aspirations are what brought us to the streets.

It was massive. The whole city of Beijing was paralyzed. The daily life was … they all stopped. The whole Tiananmen Square, even the streets nearby, were all clogged with protesters. It was not just Beijing residents. People from all over the country had come. Actually, the railway staff let you ride for free if you told them you’re going to Beijing to protest. The whole country was mobilized.

For some time, there was a brief period of less censorship. The state-run media published articles in support of the student’s demands, for a very brief period. My understanding is the staff, the people who were responsible for printing those were punished by one way or another. It was very encouraging, because, usually, you only saw government propaganda, but for a month or so, there was true reporting, journalism, and it was just so different than what we normally saw.

At the time, just about everyone looked up to the United States. There was this statue, called the Goddess of Liberty; it was not a replica, but inspired by the Statue of Liberty, made by the students of the Central Fine Arts Academy. The United States was very much on everyone’s mind. The student leaders all spoke the language of freedom, democracy…

I think U.S. media presence during that time, and foreign media in general, all the major media outlets had a massive presence there, and students were very eager to tell their story in the language that was very western democracy. At the time, the United States had a 100 percent positive image with the Chinese. They all looked up to and wanted the country to be like the United States.

On China Now

As I grow older, I realize that idealism can only get you so far. You have to acknowledge that, in terms of economic development, China’s government did deliver a lot. Still, I believe that in terms of what China can achieve, it’s way below its potential. I always say that the Chinese economy developed in spite of the Chinese government, not because of the government.

I think that, probably, the Chinese people are the most industrious people in the world. They’re so motivated, they work so hard, and they all want to get rich, but the system is really not helping, especially ordinary individuals. People who have gamed the system have definitely gained a lot more than honest, hardworking, ordinary citizens.

In general, I think that life’s better; living standards nowadays are so much higher than when I left China. I always tell people, in the early 1990s, China was just like North Korea. You cannot believe the difference. Every time I go back home, I don’t recognize my hometown or the city where I studied and lived. Everything is just completely changed. People are generally much happier with their lives.

I think the political restrictions are actually, if you compare with what China always had, not just under the Communist Party, there are giant improvements, but I think there’s a lot more to be done. Unfortunately, this most recent government, Xi Jinping, has been pedaling back, that’s very disheartening. People like me, who’ve left the country, and have cheered the development ever since, are very stressed by what we’re seeing nowadays, because, under Xi Jinping, the political front is really getting worse than under previous administrations. It is not very encouraging.

In general, I still applaud what has happened in China. China deserves some credit for lifting so many people out of poverty. On the political side, certainly there’s a lot more things to do, but I think the west definitely shouldn’t be lecturing. In that way, I actually think it’s counterproductive. I think there are better ways.

For example, the Chinese students studying are a great force to bring back not the technology but the ideas and the behavior of a citizen of a society with rule of law. It’s kind of stupid, what the American government is doing nowadays; they are closing the door. I wish China could do a lot more on the political front. I believe in the ultimate drive for a better society is there, when everyone has their rights fully, and can make their own decisions. China is far away from that.

Looking Forward

Every country has an obligation to speak out against injustice and arbitrary abuse of power by the government. Especially for countries like the United States, world leaders, they have an obligation to uphold the values and standards. How you go about to do these things is an art. I always believed in diplomacy and mutual dialogue instead of antagonism or threatening. Those sort of things can be very counterproductive. Nowadays, with trade war, etc…

As a Chinese American, I’m an American citizen, but I still have a very strong attachment to China, and it pains me to see. America has a brand, and almost all Chinese looked up to the U.S. as the ideal society they want to have, but unfortunately this has been eroded. Bullying is not the ideal way to propagate American ideals and values; it creates a lot of backlash, and it’s eroding the American soft power.

And, for a government like China, they need to learn to speak the language, the international language. I believe dialogue and cooperation instead of a clash of civilizations, which is very dangerous and not very helpful for anyone.

Million-Person Protests Of Beijing In Hong Kong Warrant A U.S. Response,"Last Sunday, more than 1 million Hong Kong residents, despite brazing heat, took to the streets to protest the government’s controversial extradition bill. Should this bill become law, Beijing will be able to demand Hong Kong authorities extradite anyone, including pro-democracy dissidents and human rights activists.

The Sunday protest is the largest since the United Kingdom handed Hong Kong over to Beijing in 1997. The protest was peaceful until midnight, when a small group of protestors clashed with local police. For an event involving 1 million people, a mostly pacifist protest is a no small accomplishment.

In some way, Sunday’s protest feels like Hong Kongers’ Alamo moment. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive appointed by Beijing, vowed the day after the massive protest that she would push ahead with the extradition bill in spite of dissent. She probably doesn’t have much choice, because Beijing won’t allow her to back down. Since 1989, Beijing has always suppresed any dissent immediately and ruthlessly.

Hong Kongers Want to Keep Their Freedoms

But Hong Kongers won’t back down either. More protests are taking place this week. What’s amazing is that, unlike 2014’s “umbrella movement,” which demanded universal suffrage, there is no single visible leader like Joshua Wong who is in charge of this week’s protests. Instead, ordinary Hong Kongers—students, airline crews, office workers, labor union organizers, Catholic Church workers, business people, and even some legislators—are taking part in these protests of their own initiative.

Teachers’ unions called for closing schools on Wednesday so teachers and students could participate in the protest. Art galleries, restaurants, and many other businesses gave their employees a day off so they could join. These grassroots efforts demonstrate that the protest isn’t only about opposing the extradition bill. Hong Kongers are fed up by the constant economic and political squeeze by Beijing. They feel that Beijing has broken its promise of respecting Hong Kong’s autonomy. They are also deeply disappointed in Hong Kong authorities’ submissive attitude. Now, ordinary Hong Kongers are showing they won’t go down without a fight.

Protesters have surrounded Hong Kong’s legislative building since Tuesday, which forced the pro-Beijing legislature to temporarily delay the second round of debate of the bill. However, the Hong Kong government’s responses to the peaceful protests have become more hawkish.

The legislature resumed the debate of the extradition bill on Wednesday. Lam called the protests “riots,” which reminded people of the language Beijing used against the 1989 pro-democracy protest in Tiananmen Square. The latest video shows Hong Kong police are firing rubber bullets and tear gas into the crowd. According to a government report, more than 70 people, including both police and protesters, were injured during the clash.

The most likely outcome of this extraordinary event in Hong Kong is that the legislature will pass some version of the extradition bill. So are Hong Kongers’ efforts futile? I don’t think so.

The protests in Hong Kong accomplish at least two things. For one, the maturity and dignity that Hong Kongers are demonstrating while protesting, as well as their devotion to political freedom, serve as a powerful rebuttal to Beijing’s assertion that western democracy is incompatible with Chinese people and culture. According to Beijing, Chinese people can only achieve prosperity and security under an authoritarian regime. Hong Kongers can proudly point to the political freedom and prosperity they have enjoyed under a free-market economy, and remind the world of how ridiculous Beijing’s assertion is.

Beijing’s Credibility Tarnished Over Broken Promises

Second, when the extradition bill does become law, this week’s protests will cast a long shadow on Beijing’s credibility. If Beijing can’t keep the promise it made to Hong Kong, should the rest of the world trust anything Beijing says?

Is the “Belt and Road” initiative really an altruistic infrastructure program? Should we trust that island building in the South China Sea is innocently about fishing, as China has claimed? Should we really expect that if the United States and China sign a trade deal, Beijing will stop stealing technological secrets from U.S. firms? Sure, Beijing will win this fight in Hong Kong, but it will lose its credibility in the long run.

Hong Kongers are standing up for their rights and their future. The rest of the world needs to stand with them. Some have already done so. Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted:

#China has already jailed innocent foreign business executives as retribution against other countries. If #HongKong legalizes the kidnapping of people who disagree with Beijing it will have a devastating effect on their economy https://t.co/b2I99cKbHN — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 11, 2019

In a statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, “The extradition bill imperils the strong US-Hong Kong relationship that has flourished for two decades. If it passes, the Congress has no choice but to reassess whether Hong Kong is ‘sufficiently autonomous’ under the ‘one country, two systems’ framework.”

Trump’s Unusual Silence Should Be Broken

President Trump has been uncharacteristically silent about Hong Kong’s protests. Maybe he doesn’t want to jeopardize the U.S.-China trade negotiations.

Someone should remind him of a history lesson: the world, including the United States, gave Beijing a pass after it brutally suppressed peaceful pro-democracy protestors in Tiananmen 30 years ago, hoping economic engagements would turn China into a more open and tolerant society. Thirty years later, that strategy has proven to be a failure. China has become a powerful authoritarian and competes against the United States in every field. The United States has much less leverage to confront and contain China today; we can’t afford to make the same mistake again.

Two years ago, President Trump spoke at the South Korea Assembly with these words, “the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a tyrant. It comes from the true and powerful glory of a strong and great people.” A million strong and great Hong Kongers are taking a stand for freedom this week. Will the American president stand by them?

Oberlin College Pays $11 Million To Bakery Students Smeared As 'Racist',"Imagine living in an ideological bubble so watertight you will excuse the criminal activity of your students just because of your completely unfounded gullibility to the idea that the victims of the crime are racist.

That’s exactly what happened at Oberlin College, in Ohio, when a jury found Friday that several high-profile administrators encouraged libel against a local bakery simply because it had caught several African-American Oberlin students for shoplifting. According to the text of the civil suit, Oberlin’s administrators encouraged their students to boycott the establishment and actively participated in publicly shaming the owners.

Here are the facts: on November 9, 2016 (the day after Election Day), three African-American students were caught shoplifting at Gibson’s Bakery. When news broke of the incident, some of the students accused the owners of racially profiling the shoplifters, and demanded a boycott of the establishment. They immediately began protesting, even though all three of the implicated students eventually pled guilty and paid restitution.

Oberlin’s Administration Chose to Escalate

Oberlin had a chance to quell the outbursts but instead capitulated to student protesters by cutting off all business with Gibson’s, including all longstanding catering deals. It also spread a Student Senate resolution that condemned the bakery of racism, although there was no evidence of racism. Suffering irreparable damage during the smear campaign, the bakery chose to sue Oberlin on a number of counts including libel, tortious interference with contracts, and trespassing.

The jury found that Oberlin’s administration had libeled Gibson’s Bakery. There was also evidence that the Oberlin administration conspired to emotionally harm the bakers. The college’s Multicultural Resource Center Director sent a text that read “after a year, I hope we rain fire and brimstone on that store.” In an email sent to a (now-former) theater professor who criticized Oberlin’s approach, Dean of Students Meredith Raimondo said “I’d say unleash the students if I wasn’t convinced [the situation with Gibson’s] needs to be put behind us.”

The jury ordered Oberlin to pay $11 million in damages to Gibson’s for their role in destroying the business’s credibility and good reputation. For the owners of the bakery, this verdict relieved two years of immense legal strife and belittling, including a shameful attempt by Oberlin to argue that Gibson’s Bakery (a multigenerational family establishment) carried only $35,000 dollars in total value.

For Now, Libel Is Still Illegal

For the rest of America, the victory represented hope that basic standards of order can prevail over the lawless atmospheres of contemporary campus life. Americans should be concerned about the new naming-and-shaming culture, often wielded by leftist activists to punish anyone they don’t like. In fact, just this last week, YouTube demonetized several popular conservative podcasts just because a Vox journalist thought some of its content was offensive.

But Oberlin would apparently rather protect the worst excesses of its own race-shaming students than stand up for basic standards of evidence-gathering. According to the plaintiffs, Oberlin tried to force Gibson’s Bakery to give first-time shoplifters a pass in exchange for resuming business with the college. Such a rule would clearly violate a business’s right to press charges against criminals, but Oberlin cared more about appeasing student protesters than the bakery’s rights to due process.

Oberlin responded to the lawsuit by asserting that it claims no responsibility for the free speech of its students, false as its protests were. This is a false framing. Oberlin College administrators and staff are responsible; they actively participated in smearing Gibson’s reputation.

In addition to the aforementioned conspiratorial emails and alleged intimidation, a senior official at Oberlin helped organize the rally against Gibson’s, encouraging the protests and abetting the false claims of the owners’ racism, according to witness testimony. The jury saw this case as not a simple free speech issue, but a libel issue specific to the actions of the college administration.

Oberlin Deliberately Incited Students’ Criminal Behavior

Another objection contends that the libel standard used against Oberlin is too broad. After all, so the argument goes, if mere encouragement of damaging actions is libel, then shouldn’t the talk-show hosts who “inspire” mass shooters also be charged with libel?

But the relationship between Oberlin’s encouragement and the actions of the protesters is far more direct. Oberlin staff stopped all business with Gibson’s, appeared at rallies with the protesters, and passed out fliers calling the bakery a racist establishment. Without the assistance of the college staff, it was unlikely the protest and damage would have swelled to the size it did.

In the end, the jury saw malicious intent, defamation, false statements by the college, and numerous irreparable damages as evidence enough to require Oberlin to pay $11 million to the bakery for its reprehensible and libelous conduct. It’s a verdict that was necessary and deserved.

Liberal academia, drunk on its own power and past successes in playing the naming and shaming game against people they don’t like, have pushed it too far this time. The stern punishment against Oberlin will perhaps serve as a reminder to college campuses that words, especially inflammatory ones like “racist,” are capable of devastating harm and should not be used lightly, and should especially not be used along with intimidation, defamation, and destruction.

How Christianity Is Helping Keep Hong Kong's Stunning Protests Peaceful,"What’s more impressive than 2 million people walking down central Hong Kong demanding freedom? How about the scene where the human wave moved to the side in an orderly fashion to let an ambulance pass without anyone directing them?

How about before going home for the night, the young protesters stayed to ensure there was no litter left on the streets that 2 million people walked? How about that there was nothing, not a trash can, nor a car, nor a building, burned down, despite protesters’ emotions running high?

Anyone who has paid close attention to Hong Kong recently can’t help being in awe at how well-behaved the Hong Kong protesters, especially the youth, have been throughout the anti-extradition bill protests, which have gone on for two weeks now.

Journalists tweeted grateful messages to those who helped them:

Two million protesters — orderly, recycling, giving way to ambulances as massive crowds part, giving safety hat and gear to visiting foreign correspondents — what better example of peaceful resistance in 2019? — Melissa Chan (@melissakchan) June 16, 2019

What contributed to Hong Kongers, especially the youth’s, orderly, thoughtful, and dignified behavior? The outspoken Cardinal Joseph Zen credits the city’s prevalent Catholic school education. He is not exaggerating.

In an article titled, “Church, State and Education: Catholic Education in Hong Kong during the Political Transition,” John Kang Tan notes that “many schools subsidized by the Hong Kong Government have religious bodies.” More than 50 percent of secondary schools in Hong Kong are faith-based. Although only an estimated 10 percent of Hong Kongers identify as Christian, many more Hong Kongers receive a faith-based education, despite the city’s outward appearance of an overly commercial and secular society. Most of these schools are run by Protestant or Catholic religious bodies.

According to Tan, “In terms of the number of schools, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest denomination that sponsors schools.” Zen confirmed the island city has about 300 Catholic schools, from kindergartens to colleges, providing education to 25 percent of the population. Catholic schools have such a stellar reputation for quality that they are highly sought after by eager parents.

Why are there so many Catholic schools in Hong Kong? It has everything to do with the island’s colonial past.

Catholicism and Colonialism

The first Catholic church in Hong Kong was founded in 1841, a year before the Chinese government officially ceded Hong Kong to the United Kingdom. Under British rule, Hong Kong was the freest city that is closest to mainland China, so foreign missionaries often established their bases here before they ventured onto the mainland.

As China suffered one war to another from the 19th to early 20th centuries, many mainland refugees flooded to Hong Kong. The Catholic church took the lead in providing orphanages, social services, medical care, and education to the poor and the displaced. Hong Kongers have more confidence in the church’s moral leadership than in the local government.

The first Catholic school in Hong Kong was founded in 1843, an all-male school. Since then, Catholic schools have played an important role in educating generations of Hong Kongers and shaping Hong Kong’s cultural, social, and political environment. On the Hong Kong Catholic Diocese’s education website, under “vision and mission,” it says its mission includes “help youth and students to cultivate wisdom and virtues, pursue the truth, verify merits, and to develop into persons who hold dear the basic human rights and dignity.”

After the United Kingdom handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, the Catholic church didn’t retreat from politics. Catholic schools, like many agencies in Hong Kong, have faced intrusions from Beijing. A 2004 Education Bill attempted to interfere with the management of Catholic schools. The church fought back by pointing out to the pro-Beijing legislature that if Catholic schools “did not have the freedom to continue [their way of managing their schools], their mission would be ruined, and this would damage the entire society of Hong Kong.”

Zen, who was made cardinal in 2006, has been vocal on issues regarding human rights, political freedom, and religious liberty in Hong Kong as well as in mainland China. He warned Pope Francis not to be misled by Beijing. But the pope ignored his warning and reached an agreement with Beijing last year, accepting the atheist government’s authority over how Catholic bishops are appointed in China.

This means bishops and priests in mainland China will be selected by the Chinese government—run by the atheist Chinese Communist Party—and must prioritize their loyalty to the party and country before God. They have to support government-sanctioned practices such as support for abortion, which violates the church’s teaching. The Vatican hasn’t released any text of the agreement. Zen decried the deal as “a total surrender” by the Vatican and “an incredible betrayal” to the seven million Catholic faithful in mainland China.

This year, when Carrie Lam, the Beijing-appointed chief of Hong Kong, tried to rush a controversial extradition bill through the Hong Kong legislature, the Catholic church joined by several other Christian organizations, provided moral guidance to the opposition. The Catholic dioceses urged “[the Hong Kong government] not to rush to amend the fugitive bill before fully responding to the concerns of the legal sector and the public.” When it became obvious that Lam wouldn’t listen, Zen called the faithful to join the peaceful protests.

As The New York Times noted, “Christians have been a visible part of the protests this month, providing food and shelter at demonstrations and condemning efforts by the police to break them up. Many protesters, even those who are not religious, have embraced the teachings and messages of Christianity to denounce a proposed law to allow extraditions to mainland China.”

Peaceful Protests By Faithful, Freedom-Seeking People

After Hong Kong authorities called the peaceful protests “riots,” Hong Kongers sought protection by singing “Sing Hallelujah to the Lord.” Because religious assemblies in Hong Kong are protected, they hoped signing the hymn would protect protesters from police attacks and show the authorities the peaceful nature of their protest. No wonder this hymn has become the movement’s theme song and has been heard everywhere the protests took place.

After Lam apologized to Hong Kong people this week but still refused to meet protesters’ demands, the Catholic dioceses asked the government to “launch a thorough independent inquiry” on reported police brutality and to “make an explicit, public statement that the Bill has been ‘withdrawn’ to meet the strong demand of the general public.”

The Catholic church and other Christian organizations’ active involvement adds a moral dimension to the protest. They unite Hong Kongers from all walks of life as one powerful voice against injustice. They also serve as a restraint that helps keep the protests peaceful. It’s very likely that without faith-based organizations’ involvement in Hong Kong’s education and politics, the mass protests might turn out very differently.

Here in the United States, churches may lose their tax-exempt status if pastors or priests discuss politics from the pulpit. Progressives have been lecturing us that our religious beliefs are “private matters” and have no place in a public forum.

That’s why they keep dragging nuns to court for not wanting to pay for contraception and suing the same Christian bakers over and over again for not being willing to make a cake to celebrate occasions that violate the bakers’ religious beliefs. Opponents of school choice argue that when parents send their kids to faith-based schools using school vouchers, they somehow blur the separation of church and state.

Such attacks on religion haven’t made us any happier. We are so bitterly divided that it seems we can’t get anything meaningful done. Some even feel justified in using violence to shut down disagreement. As we cheer for Hong Kongers in their fight for freedom and note how much churches have taken the lead in the movement, we Americans should probably learn something, too.

"Activists Are Forcing Museums To Take a Long, Hard Look At Their Donors","Near the conclusion of the film “Dangerous Liaisons” (1988), there’s a moment in which the Marquise de Merteuil (Glenn Close) arrives at her box at the opera, and becomes the target of incessant booing and catcalls. The private correspondence between herself and her deceased ex-lover (John Malkovich) has become public, causing her cruel machinations to be laid open to scrutiny. Forced to return home in shame, she distractedly removes her pancake makeup before her dressing table mirror, no doubt reflecting on the fact that the show’s over for her, socially speaking.

Given the trajectory of contemporary art in general, one might be forgiven for thinking that shame has become utterly foreign to the art world. The controversy around the infamous 1999 “Sensation” exhibition of works by young British artists at the Brooklyn Museum, which then-New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani attempted to defund, seems like it took place a lifetime ago.

Nearly two decades later, the Met’s 2018 “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination” show opened with a costume ball containing more blasphemy than an old George Carlin standup routine, and among those in attendance was the present cardinal archbishop of New York. Sic transit gloria mundi.

Yet strangely enough, public shaming still holds power over the art world today, albeit along different lines. In the past, displaying offensive art got you into trouble. These days, it’s not so much what you display, but rather who paid for the display, that’s becoming increasingly problematic.

Inflicting PAIN

Following a wrist injury in 2017, contemporary art photographer Nan Goldin became addicted to the prescription pain medication OxyContin, and after emerging from rehab formed a group called Prescription Addiction Intervention Now (PAIN). Under her leadership, PAIN began to organize protests at art institutions that receive funding from members of the Sackler family.

Some of the Sacklers are well-known art philanthropists, and the Sacklers happen to own Purdue Pharma, the leading U.S. manufacturer of this particular opioid. Goldin’s painful experience in taking the drug turned into a cause for public advocacy in her milieu, the art community, where she found that others had undergone similar experiences.

Goldin’s specialty is the “die-in,” in which she and other members of PAIN fall to the ground and play dead. Arguably her most famous staging of this to date occurred in March of last year, when she and a group of around 100 people gathered in the Sackler Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which houses the Ptolemaic Temple of Dendur. They tossed empty pill bottles into the ornamental waterway that surrounds the temple, before the participants proceeded to “die” on the spot.

In February of this year, Goldin was contacted by the National Portrait Gallery in London, which asked if she would mount a retrospective of her work at the museum. She refused, noting that the museum was accepting donations from the Sacklers, and she would have nothing to do with the museum while that was the case. A few weeks later, the museum refused a Sackler grant of over $1 million, albeit without reference to Goldin. Within a few months, the Tate, Guggenheim, and Met each individually announced that they would no longer accept donations from the Sacklers.

Human nature being what it is, guilt by association has now spread to other branches of the Sackler family who had nothing to do with OxyContin. The late Arthur M. Sackler, for example, who died well before either Purdue Pharma or OxyContin came into existence, was a major art collector and museum donor. Indeed, the Smithsonian’s Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of Art on the National Mall is named for him, and houses his substantial collection of Asian art and antiquities.

Just recently however, Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon took the unusual step of writing to Lonnie Bunch, secretary of the Smithsonian, requesting that Arthur Sackler’s name be removed from the museum, to erase any public connection between the Smithsonian and the Sackler family. To date, the Smithsonian hasn’t issued a formal response. However, as the Smithsonian is a congressionally chartered, taxpayer-funded institution, this isn’t a request Bunch can simply ignore.

Big Trouble for Big Oil

Pharmaceutical industry donations are not the only target for activists related to funding. Perhaps not surprisingly, Big Oil is increasingly being shut out of the international art philanthropy arena as well, as climate activist groups seek to shame art institutions that accept donations from the fossil fuels industry. While this particular wave has not really broken on these shores yet, some recent examples from across the pond may portend what will be arriving here in the near future.

Back in 2017, the Tate ended its corporate giving relationship with British Petroleum, which had provided millions of dollars in funding to the museums over the course of many years. The parties publicly blamed the business environment, rather than a series of protests staged by climate activists targeting both BP and the Tate, as the cause for the end of their long-standing agreement, but the art press has remained more skeptical of the root cause.

The following year, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam and the Mauritshuis Museum in The Hague severed their corporate relationships with Royal Dutch Shell Oil, after both institutions became the targets of escalating climate protests due to the donations they received from the oil and gas giant. Again, press releases made no allusions to the influence of climate protestors, but no one in the art world seriously believed that these long-standing ties were severed purely by chance.

The most recent target of climate activists is the British Museum, which will be opening a major exhibition on the Trojan Wars this fall under BP sponsorship. Protests earlier this year surrounding BP’s sponsorship of a British Museum exhibition on the Assyrian Empire were unsuccessful, which has only made these groups more determined to force the museum to end its donor relationship with Big Oil. Activists have publicly stated that they intend to use the time before the exhibition opens to plan their next shame campaign, so we’ll have to wait and see what they come up with.

In the United States, of course, Big Oil has been involved in the art game for quite a long time; consequently, its influences may prove to be more difficult for climate activists to disentangle. The most obvious example is the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, founded by oil magnate J. Paul Getty, who left the bulk of his personal fortune to a trust that runs the museum, making it the most richly endowed art institution in the world.

A substantial number of major art collections in the United States came to be because of petroleum, or at least, have something of a whiff of the stuff about them, including the Met, MoMA, and practically every art museum in Ohio or Texas. Big Oil, both foreign and domestic, continues to provide corporate sponsorship for art institutions large and small across the country.

If activists in the U.K. are able to persuade more British institutions not to accept funds from the fossil fuels industry, the beneficiary will likely be the United States—at least for a while. In the past year, BP served as a major corporate sponsor of exhibitions at the Art Institute of Chicago, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and at the National Gallery here in DC. However, it’s not hard to imagine that at some point its philanthropy will no longer be welcome here, either.

The Future of Philanthropy?

To give credit where it’s due, through the exercise of free speech some relatively vocal groups that are deeply concerned about certain issues have managed to overcome the fundamental tendency of major art institutions to care more about the amount of their revenue, rather than the source of it. That has to be a good thing, not only for advocates of free speech, but also for the art world as a whole. Museums that care more about making a buck than in preserving and displaying the objects in their care have been a major problem in the art world for decades now.

On the other hand, it’s difficult to think of any business—transportation, agriculture, electronics, apparel, cosmetics, finance, real estate, etc.—that could satisfy the ethical requirements of everyone. Nor is it patently clear who gets to decide which companies’ or individual’s money is acceptable, and which are to be considered anathema. Yet given the clear traction such efforts are having in major museums at home and abroad, we can only expect this trend to continue.

China Attempts To Hide Another Mass Protest Against Authoritarian Rule,"While the rest of the world watches in awe at the sight of millions of Hong Kongers protesting against an extradition bill and demanding greater political freedom, a different protest erupted in Wuhan, in the heartland of mainland China.

Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, is the seventh-largest city in China, with 10 million residents. Sitting on the bank of Yangtze River, it has long served as an important harbor, a commercial and industrial center in central China. Wuhan is known for its hot weather, hot food, and hot-tempered (but talented) people.

It’s the hometown of tennis star Li Na, who won the 2011 French Open, and Fu Mingxia, who probably is still the most decorated diver in Olympic history. Since I spent part of my youth there, I call it my hometown too.

Starting on June 28, thousands of people in Yangluo, a suburb of Wuhan—and only 18 miles from downtown and a designated economic and technology development zone—have been protesting a proposed waste incineration plant in their neighborhood. They have every reason to be angry. Their city used to be a beautiful place with hundreds of picturesque lakes. Relaxed seniors could often be seen practicing Taiji near waving willow trees at the lakeside.

Now, most lakes are gone, replaced by factories, high-rise apartment buildings, and landfills for garbage. People have lived with smog and terrible smells for years. Seniors can’t do their morning exercises, and parents won’t let their children play outside. People complain that they can smell the terrible smell from the landfill several miles away. Residents keep their windows shut all year round, in a futile effort to keep the disgusting smell out.

The Waste Incineration Controversy

After years of complaints, the local government finally promised the people of Yangluo that it would build a park. But in June, people learned the government was going to build a waste incineration plant, which would turn 2,000 tons of trash each day into energy by burning it on the very site of the promised park. The city insists such a plant is necessary to promote renewable energy and help tackle the city’s worsening trash disposal situation due to fast urbanization and shrinking available land for building additional landfills.

The residents told foreign journalists they wanted to support the government’s green initiative, but the proposed plant would be less than half a mile away from a dense residential area, which violates even the government’s own minimum recommended distance of at least one mile from any residential area.

Having a waste plant so close to their homes isn’t residents’ only concern. They are also concerned about emissions. Waste plants such as this are known to produce substantial amounts of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide. According to reports, such emissions “are not only dangerous in China but can also float on air currents across the Pacific, reaching as far as the United States.”

The technology that helps reduce such toxic emission is available, but it is expensive. Chinese companies are known to cut corners to save money. Residents don’t have to search too hard to validate their concerns.

China’s Government Won’t Follow Their Own Rules

The city already has five similar waste incineration plants. One is only about 300 feet from a residential area. All of these five incineration plants are reportedly beleaguered with problems, including “illegal construction of waste incineration plants close to residential areas, manipulation of the assessment process, limited public participation, and failure of the Wuhan Municipal government to properly enforce disposal standards.” In other words, had the government’s own environmental standards been strictly followed, none of these plants would have been built.

In an open letter, residents of Yangluo raised many other concerns, including the trustworthiness of the plant’s construction company. Paperwork shows the company, a state-owned enterprise, was formed on April 17, 2019. People are asking why the government chose to award such a high-impact project to a brand new company that has no track record in building waste incarnation plants.

Rather than addressing the people’s concern, some government officials tried to quiet them by stating that once the waste plant is built, the air pollution and the bad smells will go away. They also insisted the building plan was still under consideration even though residents have heard construction noise. People are fed up with the government’s lack of transparency, lack of accountability, and lies.

On June 28, concerned Yangluo residents took to the streets to protest the government’s plan. They carried banners such as “Return us the green mountain and clear waters”; “We want fresh air, not toxic air”; and a direct plea to Chinese President Xi Jinping: “Xi Da Da (Father Xi), Please save Yangluo. Air pollution will ruin our children.”

Government officials were caught off-guard by this demonstration because public protest carries significant personal risks in China. Chinese people are well trained from a young age that going up against the government is like “hitting a rock with an egg”: it never ends well and will only cause self-harm. Therefore, they rarely take to the streets unless they have no other viable options.

That’s exactly what happened in Yangluo. The local government, on one hand, told residents to stay home and that everything they heard about the waste plant was a rumor. On the other hand, it sent thousands of police in riot gear to confront peaceful protestors.

Videos such as this one and this one recorded police brutality, including beating peaceful protestors. You can hear in the background someone shout in Chinese, “Police are beating people!” A few dozen protestors were arrested. Still, protestors are undeterred. They have been protesting for seven days by the end of last week, and some carried a new banner that says, “Don’t beat us. We only want to breathe fresh air.”

Of course, Chinese censors quickly scrubbed the internet of any images and references to the Yangluo and Wuhan protests. The local government also reportedly disabled internet service to prevent residents from using social media to coordinate their protests.

Are the Hong Kong Protests Spreading to the Mainland?

Since the Yangluo protest has taken place at the same time Hong Kongers are protesting over the extradition bill, outsiders may think the Hong Kong protests have inspired Yangluo residents. But Chinese state-run media and internet companies haven’t covered what’s going on in Hong Kong.

Even for those mainland Chinese who know about the Hong Kong protest, there is little sympathy for Hong Kongers because since 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, most Chinese agreed to this unwritten social contract with their government: people will accept limited political freedom in exchange for economic prosperity. Therefore, many mainlanders consider Hong Kongers spoiled children because they already enjoy political freedom beyond the reach of most mainlanders.

This is why the protest in Yangluo over environmental issues present a bigger problem to the Chinese government, especially Xi. While the majority of mainlanders have little sympathy for Hong Kongers, they have shown sympathy to Yangluo protestors because what people in Yangluo are fighting for—fresh air and less pollution—is something every mainlander can relate to.

China has achieved its impressive economic growth in the last three decades at the expense of its environment and public health. It’s the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Smog is common in many Chinese cities, including Beijing, the capital city. In December 2015, Beijing had to issue red alerts due to severe air pollution. According to the Council on Foreign Relation’s report on China’s environmental crisis:

In 2014, groundwater supplies in more than 60 percent of major cities were categorized as ‘bad to very bad,’ and more than a quarter of China’s key rivers are ‘unfit for human contact‘… And about 1.05 million square miles of China’s landmass are undergoing desertification, affecting more than 400 million people.

While most Chinese people have demonstrated great tolerance for the government’s internet censorship and massive surveillance, no one is willing to drink contaminated water or breathe toxic air for very long. Environmental issues have become the top cause for public protests in China. Environment issues are also the top reason why Chinese with means are immigrating to other countries in droves. When they move, they take their talents and capital with them. Even the Chinese government realizes that environmental issues are threatening the Communist Party’s legitimacy.

In 2015, a documentary about air pollution in China, titled “Under the Dome,” received 100 million views by Chinese netizens within 48 hours. In the film, a 6-year-old girl told the interviewer she doesn’t know what a white cloud looks like. The film director raised the question of China’s development model and was forced to cut that part out for fear of it not passing the censor. Government censors then quickly shut the film down after its popularity proved it touched a nerve of the country.

In their open letter, people in Yangluo concluded with this: “As ordinary citizens, we don’t demand much. We just hope to live in an environment that is healthy and safe. We don’t want to harm the interests of anyone else…As Chinese citizens and residents of Yangluo, we believe our government knows what’s the right thing to do.”

I don’t know if they were being sarcastic or hoping that showing good faith in government would help their cause. No matter their intent, if the Chinese government fails to listen to its people, it will have a big problem on its hands.

"ICE Isn’t The Enemy, The Drug Cartels Weaponizing The U.S. Border Are","It is important to make one thing clear to the protesters attacking U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement: ICE is not the enemy, dangerous Mexican drug cartels and the anti-American forces aiding them are.

Last Friday, anti-ICE protestors stormed a facility in Colorado, disrespected our men and women of law enforcement, lowered the American flag, and raised the Mexican flag in an offensive display that left me speechless. I happened to be in Colorado last weekend not far from the facility, so I did what anyone who seeks the truth would do. I went to tour the facility with my own eyes.

Just visited the @ICEgov facility run by GEO in Aurora, CO, where last night people who disrespect the USA stormed the facility & took down Old Glory and put up a flag from Mexico. Well – she flies again today. #EndBorderCrisisNow #OldGloryFlies (1/x) pic.twitter.com/5EoiWTENNp — Chip Roy (@chiproytx) July 13, 2019

Upon arrival Saturday, I received a full tour of the facility.

I saw what any American would, which is a law enforcement entity doing its job. I saw a clean facility, equipped with medical supplies, food (three meals per day provided), and even ping pong tables and television sets for entertainment. IPads were available so illegally present foreign citizens could catch up on news from their home countries.

The facilities were clean, gymnasium, television, iPads with access to news from home countries, 3 square meals (I saw them being dished), doctor, nurses, dentist, ping pong… all taxpayer funded. #StateOfTheBorder (4/x) — Chip Roy (@chiproytx) July 13, 2019

It became clear during my visit that ICE is not the enemy. The Colorado protestors, however, are not the only people making those law enforcers out to be evil. Democratic members of Congress have made maligning ICE and Border Patrol a full-time job.

Only a few weeks ago, in an act of complete insincerity, a dozen of my colleagues across the aisle visited a Border Patrol facility in Clint, Texas. They lied about children drinking from toilets. They lied about the state of the facility. They lied about the officers.

These lies tell you all you need to know about my Democratic colleagues’ actual compassion for children at the border, concern for the safety and sovereignty of our country, and regard for the American people. They are playing this anti-ICE game for cynical and political purposes, and I’m tired of it.

As a former federal prosecutor, I stand with law enforcement. I don’t know what my Democratic colleagues want to say, but I stand for the rule of law.

I am not going to watch the American flag being trashed by folks who hate the United States of America. I am not going to watch protestors who have never been to the border a day in their lives disparage the men and women of American law enforcement who are doing the best they can to house and process an extraordinary volume of foreign citizens illegally crossing our southern border. There is no excuse for spewing hatred at these law enforcement personnel, including those contracted.

We have an expression in Texas to anyone who would want to take down the American flag: “Come and Take It.” It was heartwarming to see all the proud Americans who stopped by all weekend and dropped off flags to the facility. When I left, the Stars and Stripes were flying once again.

And a big thank you to the numerous patriotic Americans who came to the facility today to bring an American flag as a gift – and those who are standing watch. #GodBlessAmerica (6/6) — Chip Roy (@chiproytx) July 13, 2019

These protestors are misguided in their approach. What they fail to realize while they are maligning law enforcement is that the true targets of their ire should be the drug cartels who are abusing our asylum laws, trafficking human beings and drugs for profit.

If my Democratic colleagues want to solve the problem, Republicans are here and willing to work with them. Open border policies, which will empower these cartels, will be non-starters. Furthermore, the American people will not accept those approaches.

If we want to ensure the state of our border is strong and America, not cartels, is in control, we need to begin with three things: fixing our broken asylum laws, ending judicially created “catch and release,” and labeling these drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.

Cartels, not ICE, are abusing little girls on their journeys across international borders. Cartels are holding men, women, and children as indentured servants in stash houses in Texas. Cartels are keeping immigrants in abhorrent conditions. Cartels are the enemy. Not the Americans serving in ICE.

Puerto Ricans Demand Gov Resignation Over Leaked Text Messages,"Protesters this week in Puerto Rico and New York were accompanied by celebrities in their demands for Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló to resign. Protests broke out five days ago when almost 900 pages of rude private messages between Rosselló and his top officials, including anti-homosexual comments, were leaked.

Puerto Rican composer and playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda joined the protest in New York’s Union Square and posted a clip on Twitter with the caption “#RickyVeteYa.”

The mainland protests were vastly different than what took place in Puerto Rico. Agitated protests there broke out after Saturday’s leaks, with numerous clashes between protesters and police officers within the week.

Another Puerto Rican star iLe said to the crowds in Old San Juan on the fifth day of protests, “It was about damn time to wake up.”

Ricky Martin, a Puerto Rican singer, was mentioned in Rosselló’s messages. Targeting Martin’s sexuality, Rosselló wrote, “Ricky Martin is such a male chauvinist that he f—- men because women don’t measure up. Pure patriarchy.” Martin also joined the protests in Old San Juan.

NBC News producer Annie Rose Ramos was on the ground in last night’s protests, updating Twitter with live videos throughout the night. One of her first videos showed the crowd gathered outside Rosselló’s house, locally known as La Fortaleza, in Old San Juan.

Ramos’ feed continued documenting police storming the protesters’ barricades, throwing tear gas, firing rubber bullets, and launching what are presumed to be fire bombs.

The protests erupted in response to the governor’s recent scandal referred to as “Chatgate” or “Rickyleaks.” Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism published 889 pages of a private group chat on Saturday between Rosselló and his aides. The messages were filled with offensive and crass language against political adversaries and allies.

In one of the messages Rosselló wrote the federal oversight board controlling the Puerto Rico’s finances since 2016 should “go f— yourself,” with a line of middle finger emojis following. Rosselló’s Secretary of State Luis G. Rivera Marín was among the numerous members of the group chat to resign or be let go.

Rosselló, however, dismissed the chat as “just a way to relieve stress,” wrote the Washington Post. Apparently for Rosselló, relieving stress includes calling former New York City Council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito a “whore.”

This recent scandal is the icing on a cake of mismanagement and disaster for many Puerto Ricans. According to a New York Times article, Rosselló may not deserve to be the focal point of the protests.

Thousands died when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in 2017. The island was just recovering from Hurricane Irma that hit two weeks before, and Puerto Rico miserably struggled to recover. Rosselló, at the forefront of the rehabilitating efforts, was deemed responsible for the epic reconstruction failures. The hurricane hit not even nine months after his inauguration and has defined Rosselló’s administration.

“This has been a process of trauma,” said retired historian from the University of Puerto Rico Silvia Alvarez Curbelo in an interview with The New York Times. “And so now, all of that trauma has come out, all of that pain.”

Combined with other economic failures that led to recessions, Rosselló’s popularity has spiraled downward. Now with the scandal, Puerto Ricans seem to be saying they’ve had enough with the corruption and political chaos.

The Hong Kong Protest Is Beijing’s New Tiananmen Square,"Hong Kongers have been protesting a controversial extradition bill since April. They are concerned that if it becomes law, Hong Kong authorities under Beijing’s pressure will surrender anyone Beijing wants based on trumped up charges — including critics of Beijing, pro-democracy activists, and human rights activists — to mainland China. We all know what will happen to them after that.

For more than two months, Hong Kong’s anti-extradition bill protest was peaceful. In the middle of June, many people around the world watched in awe as more than 2 million Hong Kongers took to the streets to demand the withdrawal of the extradition bill in the most peaceful and restrained way.

Most Chinese in the mainland haven’t had any idea about what’s going on in Hong Kong because Beijing leaders, always insecure and paranoid about anybody challenging their legitimacy and rule, forbade their tightly controlled state media and internet companies from showing any image of Hong Kong’s peaceful protest or offering any context of why the protest was taking place. Chinese media companies remained silent until the Hong Kong protest lost its completely peaceful nature in the beginning of July.

What gives? Keep in mind that the majority of Hong Kong protesters are youths. Since April, they showed a level of maturity and restraint beyond their age. They’ve made a number of demands to Hong Kong authorities, including a complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, the resignation of Hong Kong’s appointed chief Carrie Lam, and an investigation of reported police brutality.

Yet other than announcing the extradition bill is “dead,” Lam hasn’t met any of the protesters’ demands. Skeptics pointed out the different words Lam used in her English and Chinese announcements as evidence that she is playing a word game so she can easily resurrect the extradition bill when she feels the time is right.

Tensions Are High After Governments Refused to Budge

Hong Kong youth are understandably frustrated because they have gotten nowhere in their quest after more than three months of protesting. They are anxious and angry. Their goal has evolved from opposing the extradition bill to opposing the government and demanding more political freedom, including universal suffrage.

Protesters also changed their tactics since the beginning of July. On July 1, the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to China, some protesters broke into the Hong Kong legislative building (Legco) and vandalized it. China’s government mouthpiece, the Central Television Station, immediately jumped on it, showing the anti-Beijing spray paint in the Legco without saying anything of the extradition bill nor mentioning any prior peaceful protests, claiming, “If such atrocities are encouraged and condoned, it will violate the rule of law in Hong Kong and challenge all law-abiding citizens.” Protesters quickly offered rebuttals by showing that they paid for drinks inside Legco and kept books and cultural artifacts intact.

Last weekend, more violence broke out in Hong Kong, followed by more state media coverage. Chinese media showed images of a defaced national emblem in the Chinese central government office in Hong Kong, followed by strong condemnations of protesters, branding them “as frenzied as rioters and as cowardly as villains.” While angry protesters did deface China’s national emblem, this state media coverage omitted the violence against these protesters the same day.

Images of thugs and gang members dressed in white brutally attacking peaceful protesters, bystanders, and journalists quickly surfaced on social media. Even more disturbing is that after Hong Kong police were criticized for failing to protect protesters, a video appeared showing police chatting with club-wielding gangsters. Not surprisingly, some protesters accused Hong Kong police of intentionally giving these gangsters a free hand to attack protesters.

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican, believes these gangs are on Beijing’s payroll. He said on Twitter, “Communist Party of #China used organized crime groups to attack protestors in #HongKong. Shows you who we are dealing with.” Of course, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying accused the United States of being behind the Hong Kong violence, and at a regular press briefing this week, she told the United States to “withdraw their black hands” from Hong Kong.

Beijing Is Following its 1989 Playbook

Onlookers should not see Chinese media’s sudden coverage of Hong Kong protests the moment they turned violent and China’s accusations of foreign power influence as random or even desperate moves. Beijing is following its repression playbook from 1989. Back then, when the pro-democracy students were occupying Tiananmen Square, their peaceful demeanor and especially their prolonged hunger strike won hearts and minds of the Chinese people. Chinese state media under the reform-minded leader Zhao Ziyang gave the protest relatively fair coverage in the early days.

But when Deng Xiaoping, the leader who controlled the Communist Party and the country, decided “enough is enough” and put Zhao under house arrest, state media coverage of the student protest became very negative. Media referred to the students as anti-government and anti-revolution rioters. To support such claims, they blasted an image of a burned corpse of a People’s Liberation Army soldier throughout all media day in and day out.

Some government critics said the whole thing was staged. But it might have shifted some public opinion of the pro-democracy movement. Of course, Beijing also accused students of being under a foreign enemy’s influence. Once the public relations was under control, the Chinese government sent soldiers and tanks to Tiananmen Square to brutally crack down on protesters on June 4, 1989.

A lie is easier to sell if it is wrapped in a half-truth. Beijing has been waiting for Hong Kong protesters to lose their patience and do something silly, so it can discredit their demand for more political freedom as emanating from unpatriotic rioters manipulated by foreign forces. This week, the widespread Chinese state media coverage of the Hong Kong protest, in its biased and selective way, should be seen as Beijing’s effort to control the narrative and set the stage for more aggressive actions by both Hong Kong authorities and Beijing in the near future.

Many mainland Chinese citizens already feel little sympathy for Hong Kongers. Now the image of a defaced national emblem has stirred up plenty of nationalist fever in China. Anyone who cares about Hong Kong’s future and Hong Kongers’ freedom and safety should be very concerned.

"Kamala Harris Praises Anti-Semite Who Incited Race Riots, Anti-Jewish Pogroms","Senator Kamala Harris defended the Rev. Al Sharpton as someone who has “spent his life fighting for what’s right,” after President Trump called the MSNBC host and controversial figure a “con man,” claiming he “hates whites & cops.”

If Harris believes inciting violence, leading race riots, rallying anti-Jewish protests, and corporate shakedown schemes count as “working to improve our nation,” then Sharpton has gone above and beyond.

.@TheRevAl has spent his life fighting for what’s right and working to improve our nation, even in the face of hate. It’s shameful, yet unsurprising that Trump would continue to attack those who have done so much for our country. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) July 29, 2019

Since the 1980s, Sharpton has engineered protests, boycotts, and riots, often pitting African Americans against Jewish communities. Perhaps the most gruesome being a four-day race riot in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, after a Hasidic driver killed the child of Guyanese immigrants in a tragic car accident. Sharpton stirred up anti-Semitic protesters, shouting, “No justice, no peace!” They targeted innocent Jewish homes, breaking windows and setting cars on fire, and an angry mob murdered Jewish bystander Yankel Rosenbaum. Sharpton lead the mobs who chanted about killing “bloodsucking Jews” and “Jew bastards.”

According to reporter Philip Gourevitch, Sharpton used his speech at the child’s funeral to stoke anger.

“Talk about how Oppenheimer in South Africa sends diamonds straight to Tel Aviv and deals with the diamond merchants right here in Crown Heights. The issue is not anti-Semitism; the issue is apartheid. … All we want to say is what Jesus said: If you offend one of these little ones, you got to pay for it. No compromise, no meetings, no coffee klatsch, no skinnin’ and grinnin’,” Sharpton said.

Four years later, Sharpton was riling up protesters again, this time against Fred Harari, a Jewish subtenant who operated Freddy’s Fashion Mart in Harlem, and evicted his own subtenant, a black-owned record store. “We will not stand by and allow them to move this brother so that some white interloper can expand his business,” Sharpton told protesters.

At a separate rally, Sharpton’s colleague at the National Action Network, Morris Powell, said, “We are not going to stand idly by and let a Jewish person come in black Harlem and methodically drive black people out of business up and down 125th St.”

The Sharpton-led protests came to a head in December when Roland James Smith Jr., who had participated in Sharpton’s protests, walked into Freddy’s Fashion Mart, pulled out a gun, ordered all the black customers to leave, poured paint thinner on several bins of clothing, and set them on fire. Seven people died in the fire, and Smith shot himself. Sharpton claimed he was not involved in the protests and was only there to mediate. The reason Harari had raised the rent of his black tenant in the first place? His rent had been raised by his landlord, a black Pentecostal church.

Sharpton has not once apologized nor shown any remorse for the consequences of the riots or the deaths caused in his wake. He even criticized the NYPD for linking the protesters to the fire.

Despite a track record of anti-Semitism, the media has allowed the whitewashing of Sharpton’s career, eased by his relationship with President Barack Obama, who Sharpton endorsed in 2007. Courting Sharpton has since been a tactic used by presidential candidates to win over black voters. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Harris have all paid visits to have lunch with Sharpton in Harlem.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/07/29/kamala-harris-praises-anti-semite-who-incited-race-riots-anti-jewish-pogroms/,2019-07-29
America’s Apathy Toward Hong Kong Is A Crisis Of Confidence,"The protests in Hong Kong that began two months ago have now shut down the city’s airport—one of the busiest in the world—amid violent clashes with riot police in recent days. Chinese troops, we’re told, are amassing along the border even as Chinese propaganda outlets warned Tuesday that protesters were “asking for self-destruction” and Chinese officials decried the demonstrations as “deranged acts” that marked “the first signs of terrorism.”

In other words, it appears the situation is about to get much worse. Why has the American response to all this been so muted? Hong Kong is the most important city in the world right now, and the cause of the pro-democracy protesters is one that all Americans should rally behind.

Yet, rhetorically, it’s not even clear what side the United States is on. President Trump has been content to offer platitudes and unhelpful observations like, “We’ll see what happens. But I’m sure it’ll work out. I hope it works out for everybody, including China, by the way.” On Tuesday, he tweeted, “Our Intelligence has informed us that the Chinese Government is moving troops to the Border with Hong Kong. Everyone should be calm and safe!”

Okay, thanks for that, president of United States and leader of the free world.

News and social media have largely focused on other stories, like Chris Cuomo flying off the handle at some random guy in New York calling him “Fredo,” or whether the Clintons had Jeffrey Epstein assassinated, or how stupid the 2020 Democratic candidates look eating corn dogs and pandering at the Iowa Sate Fair.

Meanwhile in Hong Kong, protesters are waving the American flag and singing the “Star-Spangled Banner.” They do this because they know that America is an idea and that the principles of our Founding are universal.

They also know that those universal principles—that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed—terrify their communist rulers.

Even so, what the protesters are really asking for is rather modest: a measure of relative autonomy, and specifically for the proposed Chinese extradition law to be taken off the table. As some have pointed out, this too hearkens back America’s rebellion against Great Britain, when in the Declaration of Independence the Founders decried the king and Parliament “for transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences.”

American Indifference Is Dangerous

We have every reason, indeed every obligation, to stand in solidarity with Hong Kong. Our government arguably has every reason to do quite a bit more than that. So why aren’t we? Why hasn’t any of this stirred our collective imagination?

Earlier this week, Tyler Cowen posited the reason is that, “Americans and many others around the world simply do not care so much anymore about international struggles for liberty.” The internationalist bent of democratic revolutions in the 18th and 19th centuries has faded, as has the spirit of anti-Communist movements during the Cold War. Americans, suggests Cowen, are too busy fighting each other and waging culture war ahead of the 2020 election to pay attention to struggles for liberty abroad.

It might also be that Americans have seen too many such struggles end badly in recent years to invest much emotional energy or inspiration this time around. Whether it’s been a movement in which protesters were repressed by an authoritarian regime, like the 2009 Green Revolution in Iran, or a movement where the protesters ostensibly got what they wanted, like in Egypt’s Arab Spring, but things turned out badly anyway, maybe Americans are wary of another uprising gone wrong.

More likely, our apathy over Hong Kong stems from something worse than fatigue, cynicism, or even our own domestic fights. Maybe it’s because many of us don’t really believe in the great promise of America anymore. We don’t really believe we are the last, best hope for liberty on the earth, and we don’t really hate and fear totalitarianism or tyranny as we should because we’ve convinced ourselves that our system is no better than those enforced from Beijing or Moscow.

After all, if America is a white supremacist country with a racist president, if we can’t deliver universal health care and free college, if we can’t stop mass shootings and rising drug addiction and suicide rates, then who are we to judge? Confidence in our institutions has been eroding for decades, and now we’re beginning to see signs that young Americans’ confidence in the government and the basic trustworthiness of their fellow citizens is in serious decline.

This isolation and wariness is connected to our apathy, which isn’t just poisonous to our American experiment, it’s dangerous—and not only for us. The protesters in Hong Kong clearly still believe in the promise of America. The question is, do we?

Gun Fired Into Office Makes Fourth Attack On ICE In Past Month,"On August 13, a man was arrested for allegedly firing shots at two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) offices in San Antonio, Texas. Investigators told News4 multiple shots were fired into an office building. The bullets were aimed at the upper floors, where ICE employees conduct administrative and executive business. No one was hurt, but a window was broken.

San Antonio Field Office Director Daniel Bible blamed the media, activists, and politicians for rash of violence against ICE’s public safety employees.

“Political rhetoric and misinformation that various politicians, media outlets and activist groups recklessly disseminate to the American people regarding the ICE mission only serve to further encourage these violent acts,” Bible said. “ICE officers put their lives on the line each and every day to keep our communities safe. This disturbing public discourse shrouds our critical law enforcement function and unnecessarily puts our officers’ safety at risk.”

This shooting is the fourth anti-ICE incident in the past month, according to Washington Examiner immigration reporter Anna Giaritelli. The other three occurred in Aurora, Colo., Tacoma, Washington, and Washington DC.

Protesters Attack ICE Facility in Aurora, Colorado

On July 12, anti-ICE protesters took down the American flag flying in front of an ICE facility and raised Mexico’s flag in its place.

According to Fox News, the protesters also took a “Blue Lives Matter” flag and spray painted the words “abolish ICE” on it. Then they proceeded to fly the vandalized flag upside down.

In a July 2 tweet, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) called ICE detention centers “concentration camps.” Aurora’s protesters said they were “March to Close Concentration Camps.”

These are concentration camps. According to concentration camp experts, people begin to die due to overcrowding, neglect, and shortage of resources. We saw all three of those signs on our trip yesterday. Another person died yesterday. And those are the deaths we know about. https://t.co/MhujNAYohJ — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 2, 2019

Man Attempts to Bomb ICE Facility in Tacoma, Washington

On July 14, police say a man named Willem Van Spronsen arrived at an ICE facility with a rifle and incendiary devices.

Tacoma police told the Seattle Times that Van Spronsen threw flammable items at buildings and vehicles, causing a car fire. Police also said Van Spronsen unsuccessfully attempted to ignite a propane tank.

The man was a self-proclaimed anti-fascist and anarchist. He was shot and killed by police officers.

Protesters Storm ICE Office in Washington D.C.

On July 16, protestors took to the streets of Washington D.C. outside of ICE headquarters. According to WUSA9, 11 protesters were arrested for unlawfully entering the ICE office building. Protesters outside chanted, “Never again means close the camps.”

The protest was led by a group called Never Again Action, which calls to “shut down ICE everywhere.” “Never again” is a reference to the Holocaust, in which six million people were systematically exterminated based on their race or religion.

Boston Judges Should Throw The Book At Cop-Assaulting Antifa,"There was some good news for Boston police and all Americans in a Boston courtroom where Judge Thomas Horgan told three protestors charged with assaulting police during an Antifa protest of the Straight Pride Parade in the city on Saturday to “Stay out of Boston” while they await their next court appearance in November.

In another courtroom, Judge Richard Sinnott denied requests from prosecutors — yes, you read that right, prosecutors — to dismiss charges against seven others arrested on lesser charges.

All of this came one day after the head of the Boston police union urged prosecutors and the city to take seriously the incidents this weekend in which 36 counter protesters were arrested. “We’re very happy with the judge’s decision,” said Larry Calderone, a representative of the Boston Police Patrolmen Association.

The judges’ actions were wholly appropriate but out of step with the lax way Boston city officials seemed to address Saturday’s events, and with the city of Portland, Oregon’s repeated failures to keep dangerous Antifa protestors in check. But it turns out Boston ain’t Portland.

One thing should be made clear: the Straight Pride Parade, which attracted a whopping 200 attendees, compared to more than 600 protestors, is a stupid event meant only to provoke angry opposition. Its grand marshal, Milo Yiannopoulos, is a consummate grifter who makes his money and reputation stoking anger in young men by convincing them they are being oppressed.

The 200 lost souls marching through Boston on some kind of supposed “straight pride” agenda, while following the flamboyantly gay Milo, are a pathetic bunch that should be ignored. Pointing at rare examples of anti-straight rhetoric, like a recent NBC news story arguing that heterosexuality may be obsolete, they decry their supposed oppression, but they really are trolls looking for attention that the counter protesters, including Antifa, foolishly gave them.

But hey, if people want to spend their actual lives in the equivalent of a daylong argument with anonymous Twitter trolls, it’s their dime. What crosses the line is violent or criminal activity. What crosses it further is violent activity directed at police.

Antifa, the darlings of many useful idiots on the left, often target police with their rhetoric, angrily and baselessly accusing officers of defending fascists instead of fighting against them. But they have friends in high places. Both Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ayanna Pressley had nothing but praise for these thugs accused of assaulting police, even urging followers to donate to their legal funds.

The disgraceful pass that too many on the left give to Antifa in this situation is wrong for many reasons, but two stand out. First of all, Antifa are not modern-day stormers of the beaches at Normandy, trying to stamp out some growing trend of fascism in the United States. They are in fact, generally privileged, entitled, totalitarian anarchists (yes, that’s a thing) who want to shut down the speech of anyone they disagree with. They accept and espouse violence as an appropriate method for their activism. They are criminals and thugs.

But the more important reason in this case is that the target of their violence was police officers. There aren’t a lot of jobs in civilian American life in which people literally have to put their lives on the line and wonder if they will be going home after their shift. Being a cop is one of them. Our duty as a society, the duty of our government, is to protect them to the best of our ability.

That prosecutors would seek dismissal of charges against those accused of being involved in the mischief of putting police at risk, and that congresswomen would applaud them, is extremely disturbing. The men and women of our nation’s police forces, who represent every possible demographic group our wonderfully diverse society has, deserve better. They deserve respect.

The judges in Boston did the right thing. Hopefully this will become a growing trend and Antifa will learn that their violent antics won’t simply be put up with because of a wrongheaded and simplistic notion that they are on the right side of history.

It is happily ironic that Horgan told them to stay out of Boston, as one of Antifa’s common rallying cries is that those they protest against aren’t welcome in the cities they claim to be defending. Not this time, Antifa. Boston cops and Boston judges are right to demand you have your day in court. Let’s hope more cities do the same.

"The More Leftists Protest Things Like Minds IRL, The More They Grow","The social media platform Minds teamed up with Mythinformed and new media venture Subverse to present the Minds IRL conference last weekend.

Minds is a new social media platform created as a place where no users or speech would be banned. Mythinformed is a not-for-profit that hosts conferences with the mission of promoting “viewpoint diversity to limit the effects of authoritarian ideology.”

Subverse was founded by Tim Pool, a YouTuber and journalist who is something of a polarizing figure. He self-identifies as a liberal, and first made a splash live-streaming the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011. Pool is one of a growing cadre of liberals who decry today’s leftism as inherently anti-liberal, and Minds and Mythinformed advocate for freedom of speech in all its forms.

Free speech absolutism was once the purview of the left. They decried censorship of art, political views (even those with which they thoroughly disagreed), music, and entertainment. Free speech advocacy was a cornerstone of a liberal ideology that supported individual over group rights and was most concerned with creating the conditions for a civil and equal society.

The Minds IRL conference was aimed at ending “racism, violence, and authoritarianism.” Pool said in a livestream that he “wanted to put together an event with people I thought were from different parts of the political spectrum.”

In the leftist arena, free speech activism has come to be almost synonymous with racism, primarily becaus the folks who lean right are currently advocating for free speech while the left proffers hate speech and compelled speech laws, and demands adherence to the new vocab, from pronouns to decolonizing language.

In this rich hellscape of contemporary discourse, Minds, Mythinformed, and Pool have been called racists, bigots, conservatives, and transphobes at one point or another, as have many of the conference panelists and speakers. The point of the conference in lots of ways seemed to be a way for them to say “Hey, we seemingly right-wing YouTubers actually have center-left political views and we are not racist.”

The Threatener’s Veto

Originally planned to be at the Broadway Theater of Pitman, New Jersey, about a 20-minute drive from Philadelphia, the venue received threats of violence and subsequently declined to host the event.

UPDATE!: We are receiving word that the theatre has decided to cancel the event! However, we are waiting on a public statement from the theatre confirming this so please keep up the pressure! The event itself has been moved and once we find out where, we will let everyone know https://t.co/xeXZqpuMAN — No Hate NJ (@nohatenj) August 19, 2019

Organizers relocated the conference to the SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia, but didn’t release the details of the change until only a few hours before show time. Freelance writer Talia Lavin (The New Yorker, The New Republic) made sure to let everyone on Twitter know.

im here in philly for the “minds irl” conference, featuring andy ngo, tim pool, sargon of akkad and a fleet of other right wing youtubers. after a last minute venue change, it’s gonna be at a casino. pic.twitter.com/esNEX5kT6i — Tal Lavin (@swordsjew) August 31, 2019

In welcoming attendees, Mythinformed’s Dmitry K said the purpose of the conference was to “promote viewpoint diversity,” “opposition to authoritarianism,” and that they “won’t give into keyboard warriors.” A few speakers and panelists who were scheduled to attend did not show up due to fears over the threatened violence. These included Blair White, YouTuber @ArmouredSkeptic, YouTuber @Shoe0nhead, and Josephine Mathias. Although it was reported on Twitter that Pool declined to attend, he did not pull out of his own event.

The audience was full of piercings, graphic tees, and combat boots. There was a guy with a long beard wearing a short-sleeved button down adorned with lobsters, and matching lobster-embroidered shorts. One wonders if he was a Jordan B. Peterson fan.

There was a guy with a yellow colander on his head, and I asked him about it. Turns out he’s a Pastafarian, a new religion designed to spoof all the other religions simply by being an official religion with odd accoutrements.

Now It’s Brave to Listen to Other People

There seemed to be a feeling among attendees that they were taking a stand in being at the event, and listening to ideas. While the conference organizers were quick to say that panelists were from left and right on the political spectrum, there was some disagreement on just how far left and how far right that extended.

The main thrust of the conversations on all the panels, from “The Great Migration: A Discussion on Digital and Physical Immigration,” to “Nuance, Context, and the Future of Comedy Online,” focused on free speech. Free speech absolutism is a driving force behind much of the conversation, and it’s in reaction the recent phenomenon of speech restrictions on college campuses, hate speech laws, and compelled speech about LGBT politics and more.

The free speech diehards make it a point to have the difficult and fraught gender identity conversations, and brought many of the prevailing issues in feminism to the conference. Melissa Chen (Spectator US, Aereo), moderated the all-woman panel with with Aydin Paladin (YouTube), Meghan Murphy (Feminist Current), Alice Vaughan (Two Girls One Mic, Offensive Crayons), and Karen Straughan (GirlWritesWhat) on “How Prohibition Amplifies Problems.”

Chen opened the panel by introducing her guests, noting that they are the perfect individuals to talk about prohibition: “Meghan is banned from Twitter, Alice banned from Amazon and often from Facebook, and Karen banned from polite society in general.” Chen invoked an Arab proverb, “That which is prohibited is often wanted,” and said “the human condition is anti-authoritarian at heart.” Numerous self-identifying anti-authoritarians applauded this.

The conversation began with online prohibitions, with Vaughan saying of machine learning, for everything from consumer sites to social media platforms, that “algorithms are in charge and they’re perfect but the reviews process lacks transparency… We need to get better at systems like that.”

Feminists Only Get a Voice When They Say Leftist Things

It quickly moved into the sex industry, porn, and exploitation. Murphy was the only panelist who spoke about prostitution as not quite a net boon for women, their agency, and equality: “In terms of the sex industry I find the conversation about prohibition… and legalization lacking in nuance… When we’re taking about things like pornography I don’t see porn as free speech… It’s not only imagery but it’s things that are actually happening… things that are being done to women and men, mostly women… We’re often talking about exploitation were talking about violence… and what I want to talk about is the impact on people who are actually watching it… Porn has an extremely negative impact on our sex lives… and ourselves”

She noted further that “feminists like myself are extremely misrepresented” in this conversation. Many of the feminists who oppose the way prostitution and porn are contemporarily discussed also oppose the concept that biological sex is a mutable construct. This means the progressive left has been able to offload these thinkers and their ideas to the realm of bigotry, and completely ignore their concerns. Nuance dissipates as divergent opinions are excluded from the conversation.

As the dialogue moved to cover hate speech, Karen Straughan referenced an old T-shirt that was, at one point, under penalty of being banned at the Canada border. It said, basically, “I hate” and then a long list of ethnic slurs, finishing with “but n-gg-rs are okay.” The crowd laughed at the joke that a person could advertise hate of individuals based on their ethnicity or race, but then in claiming to like another racial group, continue to use a slur to describe them, thereby appearing to both negate both the initial racist sentiments and the tolerant ones.

Lavin had been hanging out in the press room talking to speakers, taking photos, and tweeting about the event. She walked back into the main room from the press area at exactly this moment and reported that she heard the crowd laughing at racial slurs.

i walked out of the press room to hear “chinks, wops, gooks, spics… but n******s are okay.” uproarious laughter. here’s video of immediately after bc i didnt catch that moment on film. arguments against hate speech bans pic.twitter.com/zOh1HW69Tr — Tal Lavin (@swordsjew) August 31, 2019

She missed the moment, but tweeted that a crowd of racists were cheering about their shared hate. Lavin assumed that she understood what she heard and reported it without without further investigation.

Absolutists About Freedom of Speech

Staughan went on to talk about her son’s wish to buy and wear a new hat to school, and his fear that wearing the hat would get him suspended. She assured that crowd that it wasn’t a MAGA hat, but one that read “I’m not gay but twenty bucks is twenty bucks.” She told him, “You go ahead and get suspended, honey.” The crowd died laughing at this, too.

Her point was that freedom of speech is an absolute, and no speech, no matter how offensive, should be banned. Every panel carried this message in one form or another.

Lavin got some Twitter glory for her inaccurate reporting, and the conference took the heat. This exemplifies, in a very pure way, what is going on in culture. A conference was held to discuss and advocate for free speech and the takeaway by a left-leaning reporter was that free speech advocacy is equal to racism. Nuance is for sure lacking all over the place.

Panelists included many controversial figures. Sargon of Akkad, who has instigated social media mobbings, such as creating a petition for a college to remove a course he didn’t like, spoke on a panel about “Changing Minds: How to Admit You’re Wrong.” Andy Ngo, who has been attacked and milk-shaked by Antifa, spoke about “The Effects of Political Violence” with Minds co-founder Bill Ottman and Pool.

Making a Controversy

Lavin’s biases continued to lead to inaccuracies. The security at the casino was heavy, seeing as it was a casino, and that’s how they roll. Despite that, Lavin claimed to have been chased by racists out of the venue.

I’m safe and fine! I must admit “being chased by racists through a casino” wasn’t on my life bingo card but life is a rich tapestry — Tal Lavin (@swordsjew) August 31, 2019

Mythinformed reported that their team said a cordial goodbye to Lavin and her guest.

Our registration team said goodbye to this person and her +1 as they casually walked out of the casino and into the parking lot. No one was following them or chasing them.

Reporters from The Post Millennial spoke to security, and discovered that their account did not mesh with Lavin’s. In fact, the first any of the press heard of this was when Lavin posted it on Twitter.

https://twitter.com/jonkay/status/1167941939678679041?s=21

I reached out to Lavin on Twitter, but as of writing, have not heard back.

Philly is not afraid of protests. Way back at the turn of the century, the city saw protests for gay rights and gay marriage, to free Mumia abu Jamal, and so many others. I participated in many of these. The Republican National Convention was protested, the Democratic National Convention was protested.

This is no Portland, because most of the anarchists have day jobs, but the activists here are dedicated to speaking their mind, much like the notorious Philly sports fans. Despite the threats, the activists stayed away from the venue, instead expending their energy to protest a much smaller group of attendees at the after party, at a literal mom and pop brewing company in Pitman, New Jersey.

Antifa party-poopers showed up to Pitman, NJ to annoy speakers at the #MindsIRL after party. Great way to spend your Saturday night, guys! 😂 pic.twitter.com/zgX4FiP8hg — Roberto Wakerell-Cruz✝️ (@Robertopedia) September 1, 2019

Or You Could Try Actually Talking to People

While the protesters were gathering in Pitman, to protest about 60 people drinking craft beer, Daryl Davis, an anti-racism activist who has personally converted more than 200 Ku Klux Klan members away from their racist views, was the final speaker at Minds IRL. Lavin left well before Davis’s panel.

Davis was a last-minute addition to the list of speakers, and was brought on board after the protesters threatened the original venue. Davis spoke about how Black Lives Matter “lacks centralization,” and that someone once said to him “I hear you’re the first black member of the KKK.” His response to that was, “If there were black members of the KKK there wouldn’t be a KKK, it would be the O-KKK.”

“People don’t bother to read the backstory,” he said. “You all have to answer this question: ‘Do I wanna sit back and see what my country becomes or do I want to stand up and make my country become what I want to see? Any American city is your city, so whatever problems Charlottesville has, you have.” Davis’ philosophy is to reach out to individuals one by one, and said that what is lost in this conversation is that people are not their groups.

There was a heckler at the mention of Heather Heyer. Heyer died when a man intentionally plowed his car into a crowd at a 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. “She died of a heart attack,” the heckler shouted. It was not a pretty moment.

The account that first reported the canceling of the original venue followed up by letting everyone know where the after event would be, and signal boosting Lavin’s reporting.

Here are some of the attendees so happy to spread their racism. Truly a meeting of the minds today in Philly. Tonight they will be a Human Village Brewing in Pitman, NJ https://t.co/reEBux9SFn — No Hate NJ (@nohatenj) August 31, 2019

This was the first Minds IRL conference, and the kerfuffle it caused is enough to make the organizers either rethink the undertaking altogether or definitely make sure to go ahead and plan another one. As free speech absolutists continue to battle against the idea that they are racist and bigoted, the notoriety of being protested boosts their message and broadens the reach.

That the event was protested is evidence that this kind of thing is useful for public discourse, and strengthens the case for its relevancy. For many free speech absolutists, being told we shouldn’t speak is exactly what makes us open our mouths.

Hong Kong’s Drop Of Extradition Bill Leaves Many Questions Unanswered,"After more than three months of massive protests, strikes from professionals to students, and increasing brutality from police and street gangs, it seems Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement finally got one of their five demands met this week. On Wednesday morning, Hong Kong Chief Carrie Lam announced a formal withdrawal of the extradition bill, which would have allowed Beijing to demand Hong Kong hand over anyone to China, including human rights activists and dissidents. If this bill becomes law, it will erode Hong Kong’s independent judicial system and endanger the freedom of residents as well as visitors.

Lam’s withdrawal announcement marks a victory, however imperfect, for protesters, but also raises many questions. First, can Lam be trusted? Back in June, after millions of Hong Kongers took to the streets, Lam first said the extradition bill was suspended and then used the word “dead” in her English announcement.

Yet people familiar with Hong Kong’s parliamentary rule quickly pointed out there is no such thing as a suspension or death of a bill. A bill that isn’t withdrawn can be easily reintroduced in the legislative session with a 12-day notice. So Lam’s June announcement was merely playing a game of words, hoping to fool Hong Kongers. Protestors understood this and kept pushing for a full withdrawal. No wonder few trust that this time Lam will actually and completely withdraw the bill.

Lam is a puppet of Beijing, so she couldn’t possibly make the withdrawal decision without Beijing’s blessing. Beijing is known to deal with any dissent with the “take no prisoners” approach. Exhibits A and B are the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and today’s massive imprisonment of Uyghurs. So the next question is why has Beijing, under the iron fist of Communist Party Chairman and President Xi Jinping, backed down now?

There are several possible explanations. One is that the U.S.-China trade war has caused more economic damage in China than Beijing is willing to admit. Even the heavily manipulated official economic data out of Beijing can’t hide the deterioration of China’s economy: manufacturing activities are slowing down, more factories are closed, and the unemployment rate is rising. More foreign companies are moving or planning to move their productions out of China even before President Trump’s tweet.

Unofficial reports about the actual economic situation in China are more devastating. Matt Shrader, a China analyst at The Alliance for Securing Democracy, tweeted yesterday suggesting that due to the trade war and the spread of swine flu, China is experiencing a pork shortage so bad that the Chinese government brought back ration tickets to limit meat consumption, something widely used under Communist tyrant Mao Zedong. Such economic deterioration will no doubt embolden someone or some faction within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to question Xi’s leadership.

At this point, had Xi chosen to crack down on Hong Kong like China did in Tiananmen, the capital flight from Hong Kong and international economic sanctions could have pushed China’s economy over the edge in a way that endangered Xi’s political future. In modern China, no Chinese Communist Party leader can be politically secure with a devastating economic situation. Even a strong man like Xi can’t risk fighting a trade war with the United States and losing control of Hong Kong at the same time.

Especially given that this October 1 marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China, Xi probably wants to put on a good show and doesn’t want unrest in Hong Kong as background noise. Therefore, accepting the protestors’ demand to withdraw the extradition bill is an easier way out for Xi, so he can focus on the trade war.

Let’s not forget that even without an extradition bill, Beijing has never shied from sending plain-clothed police to Hong Kong to arrest anyone it doesn’t like. And by 2047, when the “One Country, Two System” agreement officially ends and Hong Kong becomes just another Chinese city subject to Chinese judicial and political systems, an extradition bill won’t even be needed.

By then, China may have developed a mainland alternative to Hong Kong, a Chinese city such as Shanghai or Shenzhen replacing Hong Kong as an international financial center. Should that happen, Hong Kong will become irrelevant and Hong Kongers’ demands carry no weight.

This outlook probably also explains why, among the five demands protesters made—withdraw the bill, Lam resign, establish an independent inquiry into police brutality, release those who have been arrested, and universal suffrage—Beijing chose only to withdraw the bill, which is the one Beijing regards as a compromise that won’t endanger its bottom line. In Beijing’s eyes, all four of the other demands are not acceptable because they directly challenge Beijing’s authority and legitimacy.

For example, if Beijing allows Hong Kong authorities to investigate police brutality, how will it respond to demands for justice by mainland families who lost loved ones during the 1989 Tiananmen massacre? If Beijing allows Hong Kong to have universal suffrage, how will it address similar request by pro-democracy dissidents in mainland China?

Should the rest of world, especially the United States, move on and shift their attention away from Hong Kong? Sen. Marco Rubio wrote recently that “China is showing its true nature in Hong Kong and the U.S. must not watch from the sidelines.”

He mentioned several things I have recommended before that the United States can do to help protect Hong Kongers’ economic and political freedom: the Trump administration can “impose sanctions against individual officials who have committed serious human rights abuses under the Global Magnitsky Act, which enables sanctions against foreign individuals or entities. In addition, Congress should pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act,” a bipartisan bill that “would mandate that officials in China and Hong Kong who have undermined the city’s autonomy are vulnerable to such sanctions.”

In the meantime, the withdrawal of the bill can also serve a sugar-coated poison pill to Hong Kong protestors. The Hong Kong protest started as an anti-extradition bill rally but has expanded to a pro-democracy movement in its 14th week. The question is how many protestors will accept the withdrawal as a victory and want to go back to their old way of life, and how many protestors will want to go on?

So far, the movement has enjoyed wide support from all aspects of Hong Kong society: students, teachers, workers, unions, civil servants, professionals, business owners, and churches. The withdrawal will no doubt sow disagreement and fractions among the leaderless movement. Any disunity within the movement will be a win for Beijing and its puppet Hong Kong authorities. Their dream scenario is that the movement will fall apart on its own.

Following the withdrawal announcement, Hong Kong protestors face a tough choice ahead. But they aren’t the only ones. Beijing has a choice to make too. Rubio summarized it this way: “China’s leaders must either respect Hong Kong’s autonomy and rule of law or know that their escalating aggression will inexorably lead them to face swift, severe and lasting consequences from the United States and the world. Today, that choice is theirs.”

What If Americans Wanted Freedom As Much As Hong Kongers Do?,"As I watch the fearless Hong Kong protesters risk life and limb, standing up to the Chinese juggernaut to protect freedom, I can’t help but wistfully wish we’re witnessing the beginning of a spreading popular movement. In my heart of hearts, it’s my fondest hope that these courageous, freedom-loving protesters succeed and that their message of hope catches fire in other countries in desperate need of the Hong Kong formula.

I’m not referring to a spread into mainland China, which would also be wonderful. No, here I’m hoping their thirst for freedom also spreads to the United States.

I’m not saying the United States isn’t free. But it’s a whole lot less free than the special experiment of Hong Kong. For one thing, the Heritage Foundation rates Hong Kong’s as the freest economy in the world, and the United States as the world’s 12th-freest. That’s embarrassing.

Hong Kong is a miracle economy. Its unemployment rate rarely rises above 4 percent. It recovered quickly from the financial crisis in contrast to the very lethargic U.S. recovery between 2008 and 2017. Hong Kong has avoided the curse of a large entitlement system due to its free market policies. It maintains a “simple and efficient” tax rate of 15 percent, from which it drives an astonishing budget surplus, averaging 3.4 percent. Its debt is equivalent to 0.1 percent of GDP.

Leftist orthodoxy would hold that the absence of a robust social safety net would result in widespread human suffering. But the opposite is true. Hong Kong, a city of comparable size to New York City, has a tiny homeless population of approximately 1,000, as opposed to New York, where nearly one of every 121 New Yorkers is currently homeless. Hong Kong’s poverty rate of 14.7 percent is among the lowest in the world.

In spite of a comparatively hands-off regulatory environment, market efficiencies make Hong Kong’s carbon footprint per citizen less than green-obsessed Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, and Luxembourg, to name a few examples. Indeed, its carbon footprint per citizen is only two-thirds of Norway’s (6.4 metric tons per capita versus 9.3) and less than half of Canada’s (15.2 metric tons). If the left really cared about the environment, it shouldn’t abandon the profit motive’s efficient resource management that has proven to be a more effective pollution reducer than central control.

Is Hong Kong’s education system suffering under its heartless capitalism? On the contrary, its education system is ranked third in the world, behind Finland and South Korea. The United States, with all of its massive “investments” in education, was ranked 17th on the list.

Bring the Hong Kong Freedom Revolution to U.S. Cities

Imagine a choice of two buttons. Pressing the first button results in lower taxes, better education, less unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, and a more efficient management of resources leading to lower pollution emissions (including greenhouse gases). The second button results in higher taxes, more homelessness, huge budget deficits, and ineffectual environmental and education policy.

Viewed in this light, wouldn’t you fight for access to the first button? In effect, the left has simply switched the labels both systems truly deserve. That’s the essence of virtue signaling. It doesn’t matter whether a proposal actually solves the problem so long as the proposal is delivered with a sufficiently emotive speech about the problem.

The protesters in Hong Kong aren’t just fighting for their own freedom. Hong Kong is perhaps the last island of market freedom in the world. We should be demanding our own leaders adopt lower and simpler taxes, fewer and simpler regulations, and less intervention in all of the voluntary transactions that solve everyday problems.

Hong Kong’s fight to preserve its freedom has come at a cost. The police have been brutal, leading the protesters to demand an investigation. As I write this, news broke that the Chinese have acceded to the protesters’ first demand, to withdraw the extradition bill that is credited with sparking the protests at the outset. Not good enough, protesters insist. As The New York Times noted, the list of protester demands “has grown to include an independent investigation into the police response, amnesty for arrested protesters and direct elections for all lawmakers and the chief executive.”

Speaking of The New York Times, why are its relatively underpaid journalists and opinion-makers content to tolerate crime and homelessness in their increasingly dirty and dangerous city? Forget virtue signaling and try some actual virtue. These influencers live with the awful consequences that left-wing policies provide. If they truly cared about their fellow citizens more than sucking up to the faux virtue of the American oligarchy, they would help re-label the buttons.

Think of all the misery that could be avoided if the Hong Kong freedom revolution spread to our beleaguered American cities. New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof recently wrote, “My heart is with the protesters. … So it’s impossible not to be inspired by up to two million brave Hong Kongers marching to gain rights that are taken for granted in so much of the world.”

Is he inspired enough to demand market freedoms in New York? He will if he truly cares more about the homeless than being invited to swanky cocktail parties by the “virtuous” elite.

"I Went To The ‘GOP Is Racist’ Rally In Baltimore, And This Is What I Saw","President Trump addressed House Republicans at the “House Republican Retreat” in Baltimore on Thursday, Sept. 12. The progressives of Baltimore hosted a “GOP is Racist” rally outside the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront hotel, where the retreat was taking place.

Sporting oversized glasses, a slicked back bun and a backpack, I tried to blend in with the progressive crowd to hear what they really thought about Trump. To my luck, the protesters were very keen on telling me about their disdain for the president.

Here’s what I saw:

Warning: some videos contain explicit language

1. ‘Trump Is The Real Rat’

During a spat with Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., Trump called Baltimore “rodent infested.” Protesters wore rat masks and hats and held signs that said, “Trump is the real rat.”

They also began chanting “Trump is the real rat,” and the chant was led by none other than the leader of “ICE out of Baltimore,” a group that calls for the elimination of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

https://youtu.be/UXHQdCRyj7k

2. Abolish ICE

An entire protest section was dedicated to calling for the abolishment of ICE. One woman in a CASA shirt said she wants to abolish ICE because this isn’t America’s land.

“For the ones we owe anything are the Native Americans who we stand in their land, not our own,” she said.

https://youtu.be/UbxEdNjZUcI

3. Protesters Were In Solidarity With Nicolás Maduro

Many of the protesters held signs that called for the United States to stop funding wars in Venezuela, Yemen, Iran, and Palestine.

One woman even wore a shirt that said, “Nicolas… the people support you.” Maduro is a socialist dictator that has economically destroyed the country of Venezuela.

4. The GOP Is Complicit In White Supremacy

I asked one woman standing off to the side of the protests whether she thought this rally was more aimed at Trump or the GOP.

“The GOP in particular, I think is very deliberately on the side of the gentry, the land of gentry, white supremacy, implicitly or explicitly. And they benefit from it whether they are explicit about it or not,” she said.

https://youtu.be/W4jm9Nws70A

One man went so far as to say Trump and the GOP are one and the same. “The GOP is now the party of Trump,” he said.

https://youtu.be/w9UqXj-wqwc

5. Trump Is A Bigot And A Racist, But Abortions Are Great

One woman told me she was at the protest because Trump is a “bigot racist,” who is also “arrogant,” all while she was wearing a shirt that proudly promoted abortion.

Her shirt read, “Don’t like abortion? Prevent pregnancy by f*cking yourself.”

https://youtu.be/DxtylS5nDBM

6. Babies In The Womb Are ‘Clumps Of Cells’

One young woman had a very aggressive “conversation” with a Trump supporter, telling him about the immigrants and black people dying in America.

He chimed in that innocent babies are dying, referring, of course, to abortion.

“Oh, innocent babies, I forgot how innocent clumps of cells are,” she responded. Her friends chimed in, saying, “I love those clumps of cells, you ever heard of ’em?”

https://youtu.be/lLYY1poecdI

7. We Have Concentration Camps At Our Southern Border

I saw one young woman with a sign that read “Never Again Means NOW,” with the Star of David inside the “o” in “now.” I asked her what the sign meant.

“As somebody who’s grown up in the United States, we are told constantly about the Nazi regime and the concentration camps that occurred in Germany at the time,” she said. “But when we need to step up for something like this, which we consider the ICE detention centers to be concentration camps, when we’re told to step up for this, there’s silence.”

I then asked her why she thought ICE detention centers at the border are concentration camps.

“We hear multiple accounts of children being mistreated. We hear multiple accounts of people of all ages being deprived of food, water, resources that all humans need,” she said.

Her view seems to be based completely on the rhetoric of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York Democrat who claims people are being forced to drink from toilets, when, in fact, the sinks they use for clean drinking water are located above the toilets.

Finally, I asked this woman if we had hit the point yet of being Nazi Germany.

“We have not. But if nobody takes a stand, it will happen,” she said.

https://youtu.be/tNOQIqdHLNk

8. It Was Proven That Trump Colluded With Russia

After the multiple failed attempts by Democrats to prove that Trump colluded with Russia in the 2016 election, progressives still insist it’s a fact.

“It was proven,” protesters yelled at a Trump supporter.

https://youtu.be/CxMnI0HuvHY

9. Trump Supporters Are Nazis

Protesters bombarded one man holding a Trump 2020 sign. Another man stopped to explain how being a Trump supporter made him a Nazi.

“You know what they call that in Germany? Historians have a name for people that sided with Hitler, but didn’t like the racism. Do you know what they called them? Nazis,” he said.

https://youtu.be/gCwo96jc0RU

10. The Police Are Racist For Blocking The Street Trump Would Drive Down

One woman was very upset by the fact that she couldn’t walk in the middle of the street. The police officers monitoring the protests had blocked off the road Trump’s motorcade would be driving down.

“You guys are racist too,” she yelled at a black police officer.

The Unbearable Whiteness Of Climate Protest,"Monday morning, a group of mainly white protesters, who apparently don’t have jobs, shut down streets in Washington, D.C., a city predominantly made up of people of color. Presumably, many people who do have jobs were prevented from getting to them. And this raises a question: Is this kind of a climate protest an example of white privilege? Is this form of protest on this particular issue something the protesters’ skin tone and economic privilege make possible?

This is an issue CNN contributor Bakari Sellers raised in an opinion piece last month. He writes: “Climate change should be a definitive issue for Black voters, but it isn’t. That is partly because environmental advocacy groups have not always looked like us, nor have they clarified what solutions mean for our communities. And few have articulated what real environmental justice looks like.”

There is a reason for this. For white progressives, climate change is a unique issue in which racial guilt plays little to no role. Other issues such as police brutality, income inequality, and even women’s rights and access to abortion are steeped in what they perceive as the racist foundation of our country. On these issues, white protesters in the post-Occupy age feel they bear no small amount of collective guilt. But on climate change, for once, they can be the victim, not just the ally.

And man, are they enjoying it. This is the moment for angry, young white people not only to be angry, but to actually be oppressed. It is their own future that they believe is being stripped from them by failure to accept that if we don’t act in the next eight minutes, all is lost. It is their lives that amorphous and evil global corporate and government powers are endangering.

Finally, they can express righteous indignation not just in support of the rights and lives of others, but to protect themselves. It is their Malcolm X in blue jeans moment, a thrilling opportunity to stick it to the man, whoever that might be. The poster child is not a murdered black youth, but a young girl from Sweden astride a solar-powered boat defending the future of lily-white protesters everywhere.

This is not to say that the supposed impact of climate change on black and brown people in far-flung exotic places plays no role in the mostly white climate protest movement. Protesters pay lip service to such concerns, with the traditional condemnation of the West that ignores, for example, China’s much greater role in the problem. But it’s a backseat issue. The real issue is that in a progressive movement dominated by identity and race, the white kids finally have their own hill to die on.

The irony, of course, is that cheap energy has done more to lift people all across the globe out of poverty than anything in human history. The clamp-down on carbon that these privileged college kids insist upon will do more to secure their economic dominance than anything a white supremacist could come up with in his mother’s basement. They want to slam the brakes on economic progress while they are on top. After all, once some future Democrat in the White House forgives their student debt, they’ll have plenty of money to pay $10 a gallon for gas.

There is perhaps one antecedent to this primarily white protest movement, and it is related. The violent anti-globalist protests of the late ’90s and early 2000s, specifically in the Pacific Northwest, gave birth to the American Antifa Black Bloc movement. As with climate change hysteria, it gave privileged, well-educated white kids the opportunity to play the victim. And today’s climate protesters are following that example with great aplomb, even if they aren’t throwing chairs through windows — yet.

This is the fight for the young white progressive, who maybe, just maybe, is feeling a little tired of having to take the backseat. On this issue, they get to move back to the front of the bus, lead, and bemoan their own oppression. Ah, to be oppressed, the golden ticket of progressive culture, the chance to shine. The moment when they can focus on themselves and accept the applause and grave approval of the progressive culture. Well, it was bound to happen. And they are truly making the most of it.

Videos Of Climate Protests Happening Around The World,"Environmental activists took to the streets of major world cities Friday to participate in a global climate strike urging policymakers to pass legislation to save the planet from climate change.

Protests took place around the world, including in Stockholm, Montreal, and Washington, D.C., where the protests interrupted traffic on Monday.

"One Year After Kavanaugh’s Confirmation, Protestors Gather Outside Supreme Court","One year ago, then Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court after facing unsubstantiated allegations of sexual assault and weeks of vicious Senate confirmation hearings. Although the hearings concluded, the smears against Kavanaugh’s character did not.

The New York Times promulgated a story that sparked calls for Kavanaugh’s impeachment. Nearly every 2020 Democratic candidate called for Justice Kavanaugh to be impeached amid media attention of more unsubstantiated allegations.

Marking the anniversary Kavanugh’s swearing in, angry protestors gathered at the Supreme Court on Monday. Julio Rosas, a senior writer at Townhall, documented the displays of insanity. Here’s what he saw:

Warning: explicit language displayed in signs below.

1. Women Dressed In ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ Outfits

This woman was holding a sign that read, “Impeach the Rapists!” Many women dressed in crimson robes and white hats, costumes from the “The Handmaid’s Tale,” a TV show based on a Margaret Atwood novel of the same name.

2. Protestors Copying Rashida Tlaib’s Comment

During the lead-up to the House election, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), coined the term “impeach the motherf****r.” Protestors made signs copying Tlaib’s comment.

3. The Women’s March Signs

The Women’s March provided signage for protestors to carry. Some of the signs read, “It’s still Kava-nope” and “Women are still watching.” At the bottom of each sign read the hashtags, #ReclaimTheCourt and #ImpeachKavanaugh.

4. “Abort tRump” Signs

Pro-choice protestors carried signs that read “Abort tRump.”

5. Protestors Have Not Forgotten Merrick Garland

One of the co-presidents of the Women’s March reminded protestors that she has not forgotten about Merrick Garland, President Obama’s nomination to the court. She claimed that the investigation into Kavanaugh was a “sham.”

Protesters Shut Down Trump Homeland Security Secretary At Georgetown,"This past Monday, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan attempted to deliver remarks but was unable to do so at an annual immigration law and policy conference, jointly hosted by the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, and Georgetown University Law Center (GULC). The event took place on GULC’s main campus.

McAleenan tried three times to speak to audiences but was interrupted by shouting protesters each time. Protesters stood up, loudly declaring, “When immigrants come under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back.”

Amidst the screaming, McAleenan sought to steer the conversation back to its intellectual nexus, asserting, “Lot to cover today, there’s some very serious issues that we can talk about today in candor, or we can continue to shout.” McAleenan continued by stating that he would “like to take the dialogue above the politics and the daily news cycle,” including an examination of “some of the fundamental issues we face with the current legal framework and its ability to address large-scale immigration flows.”

The protesters were a mix of activists, including some from leftist grassroots organizations such as CREDO, as well as others from the Georgetown Law student body. A representative of CREDO told the Hill that the purpose of the protest “was to prevent McAleenan from having a platform to normalizing Trump’s cruel immigration policies and spreading hatred.”

As an alumna of Middlebury College, I am no stranger to this type of manufactured, highly orchestrated disorder. One year after I graduated Middlebury College, the club of which I was a founding member had the audacity to invite Charles Murray to lecture on his 2012 book “Coming Apart,” a treatise on the growing divide between urban and rural America.

As the father of a 2007 Middlebury graduate, Murray had spoken before at the college, albeit to little fanfare. But prior to his 2016 visit, 18 pages of his 1994 hallmark tome “The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure” became hotly contested due to its discussion of racial variations in average IQ.

The Middlebury protests, mostly organized by self-appointed “Resistance” professors and buttressed by outside agitators, swiftly turned violent. The professor who interviewed Murray suffered a serious injury, while angry crowds surrounded Murray’s vehicle as he attempted to depart from the lecture, one person even throwing a stop sign with a heavy cement base in front of the vehicle. Campus safety described the event as a “very, very dangerous situation.”

Thankfully, McAleenan’s event did not devolve into violence. Yet, there’s still an inarguable grimness in the fact that we have approached an era in which spaces traditionally reserved for intellectual wrestling, such as academic conferences, are now shops of intellectual silencing. These events reveal the frustrating inability of some within the current generation of rising activists to engage with anyone whom they have deemed to be “evil.”

There is a reason the more outlandish figures on the left compared immigration centers at the U.S. border to concentration camps. It wasn’t for historical accuracy, for this analogy is highly offensive and wrong—it was to conjure the memory of something so horrible and horrific as to depict anyone who might try to have a reasonable debate on immigration as “intellectualizing” something akin to Nazism. Such an analogy, in all its terribleness, was designed to silence any discussion on how to address the situation at the border.

The protests at this particular conference represented a similar approach. Some of the protesters’ signs featured phrases, such as “My favorite season is the fall of white supremacy,” while others argued “No human being is illegal #ICEfreeGULC.” This isn’t about having a reasoned policy discussion on immigration, it’s about refracting the immigration issue through the prism of good and evil. And with enough reductionism, nebulous terms, and repeated euphemisms, it just might work.

But immigration is much more complicated than simply opening the border or closing the border. It’s also intellectually lazy to reduce immigration to a question of race. Rather, immigration represents the complex intersection of economic, social, and cultural issues that should be considered and addressed. I believe we strongly need immigration reform, one that respects both the humanity of individuals and the contours of our borders, and our current immigration system is not meeting that benchmark. However, reform cannot take place if one side is simply unwilling to appreciate the complexities of the issue.

As Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokeswoman for MPI, emphasized, “By drowning out the Secretary’s remarks, the protesters deprived immigration attorneys, service providers, journalists, advocates, business leaders, law students, and many others in the public who were in the audience from hearing his point of view and engaging in a meaningful dialogue.”

The Department of Homeland Security, like all administrative agencies, is imperfect. But the willingness of the acting secretary to attend this conference demonstrates that at least one party to the debate is willing to open the floor to conversation. Indeed, McAleenan’s event had a scheduled question and answer session, which never took place because protesters decided screaming “White supremacy!” was a more effective tool of change than engaging with actual decisionmakers head-on.

There is nothing wrong with protesting a speaker. One of the great features of American liberty is our right to protest. But to completely silence a speaker on the basis of disagreeing with his or her point of view (which, ironically, was never shared but merely assumed from his position in an executive agency under Trump) may lead to a dark road of intellectual suppression.

Following the botched event, Dean William Treanor sent a mass email, emphasizing that Georgetown was “deeply committed to freedom of speech” and that the school does “not limit speech—either on the content of the view or the person expressing the view.” In an era where activists are increasingly challenging this commitment by silencing (not protesting) speakers, it is evermore important that leaders highlight their determination to protect intellectual dialogue by refusing to coddle the American mind. As a Yiddish proverb states, “A nation’s treasure is its scholars.”

14 Times U.S. Companies Self-Censored Or Apologized To Appease China,"The recent controversy about China’s public censure of the NBA has opened American eyes to the longtime practice of many U.S. companies bending over backwards to appease the Chinese government, lest they face the financial cost of losing business in overseas markets.

When the NBA apologized on Monday for the Houston Rockets’ general manager’s pro-Hong Kong tweet, and China retaliated by prohibiting broadcasts of NBA preseason games played in the country, Americans on the left and the right were united in anger that a U.S. institution would abandon principles so quickly for the sake of their wallet. But in reality, American brands and institutions have been self-censoring and groveling in apologies to China for similar offenses for years.

Here are a few examples of American companies prioritizing profits over freedom.

1. ESPN Tells Anchors Not to Discuss Hong Kong Politics

The news director at ESPN, the cable channel that is always eager to discuss politics more than sports, sent a memo to staff this week forbidding shows to discuss the politics of Hong Kong protestors when reporting on the NBA-China story. Shows were instructed to stick to the basketball-related issues instead, Deadspin reported.

An unconfirmed but possible explanation of the network’s hesitation could be fear of upsetting Tencent, the giant Chinese digital publisher that ESPN made a broadcasting deal with in 2016.

2. Vans Removes Pro-Hong Kong Shoe Design

The skateboard apparel company Vans held an online, global shoe design competition, allowing anyone to submit designs for the public to vote on. When one participant submitted a design alluding to the protests in Hong Kong, Vans removed the design from the competition.

The design featured a red bauhinia, the flower on Hong Kong’s flag, and one of the yellow umbrellas synonymous with the city’s 2014 pro-democracy protest.

“As a brand that is open to everyone, we have never taken a political position and therefore review designs to ensure they are in line with our company’s long-held values of respect and tolerance,” the brand wrote in a Facebook post.

3. Paramount Removes Taiwanese Flag From ‘Top Gun’ Movie

A trailer released in July for the new “Top Gun” movie revealed that Tom Cruise’s character, Maverick, does not have the same flag patches on his jacket from the original movie. The jacket in the new film shows that the original film’s Japanese and Taiwanese flags commemorating a tour of the USS Galveston are now missing and replaced with generic, indistinguishable flags.

There’s a new Top Gun movie coming out. And Maverick is wearing the same leather jacket – only this time it’s Communist Party of China-approved, so the Japanese and Taiwanese flag patches are gone (screenshot on right is from the new trailer)… pic.twitter.com/gUxFNFNUKX — Mark MacKinnon (@markmackinnon) July 19, 2019

4. Nike Removes Houston Rockets Merchandise From Online Store In China

The Houston Rockets are the most popular NBA team in China, mostly thanks to the Rockets’ drafting of Chinese player Yao Ming in 2002. But after backlash against the Rockets in China escalated over General Manager Daryl Morey’s pro-Hong Kong tweet last week, Nike decided to yank Rockets merchandise from their web store in China. The existing link to the Rockets Chinese merchandise was active a few days ago, but no longer works.

5. MGM Changes Villain In ‘Red Dawn’ From China to North Korea

In 2011, when MGM produced a remake of the 1984 film “Red Dawn,” they originally filmed the movie with invading Chinese troops. But the Chinese were outraged, and with millions of dollars at the Chinese box offices on the line, the producers decided to digitally switch out the flags and uniforms to show national symbols of North Korea instead of China.

6. Apple Removes Emoji, Protest Map, and Data Agreements

Apple’s ties with China run deep. Their questionable business decisions in China go beyond offensive emojis, but include those too. In a recent software update, Apple removed the Taiwanese flag emoji from the keyboard for users in Hong Kong and Macau.

Apple’s region lock of ROC Taiwan flag 🇹🇼 extended beyond CN devices to HK and Macau’s in the iOS/iPadOS 13.1.1 rollout. Interestingly, the new lock only affects the keyboard, and has no problem displaying and is easy to bypass by switching region. https://t.co/RVRKNQyc1l pic.twitter.com/8eQXambiAQ — 王博源 Wang Boyuan (@thisboyuan) October 3, 2019

In another act of censorship on behalf of China, Apple blocked an app made by pro-democracy Hong Kong protestors to display a map of live protests and police activity. Developers of the app said Apple’s app store prohibited the app as promoting illegal activity, even though Waze provides similar information about law enforcement locations. After much outcry and criticism, Apple finally allowed the app on in the app store.

In 2018, Apple was criticized for moving its Chinese iCloud operations to a location in China, and hosting its encryption keys in China instead of the United States for the first time. The major concern is that the Chinese government could force Apple to give the regime access to its users’ iCloud data and encryption information.

7. 21 Brands Apologized For Disobeying The ‘One-China’ Principle

It began with an apology from brands like Gap and Coach in 2018, who made T-shirt designs with a map of China without Taiwan, but after the protests in Hong Kong broke out, users online and Chinese state media began a witch hunt. They demanded apologies from every luxury clothing brand that made “erroneous representations” of China on their website shipping options or their region or language menu options. Listing Taiwan or Hong Kong as separate countries from China is an immediate offense.

A host of hotel chains and airlines were also threatened by Chinese authorities to not list Taiwan as a country on their websites. Here are the brands that made changes or apologized for violating the “One-China” principle or damaging China’s “territorial integrity” :

ASICS

Gap

Zara

Calvin Klein

Versace (Apologized for a shirt listing Hong Kong and Macau as independent countries)

Givenchy

Fresh

Valentino

Swarovski

Samsung

Ray-Ban

Qantas

Air France

Air Canada

British Airways

Malaysia Airlines

Japan Airlines

American Airlines

Marriott

Medtronic

Global Blue (fired staff for calling Taiwan a country)

8. Google Deletes Game About Hong Kong Protests From App Store

Developers who created a game called “The Revolution of Our Times” about protests in Hong Kong were notified that their game was suspended from the Google Play store.

“We don’t allow apps that allow reasonable sensitivity towards or capitalize on a natural disaster, atrocity, conflict, death, or other tragic event,” Google wrote. A link to the game now goes to error page in the Google Play store.

9. Video Game Company Blizzard Suspends User For Saying ‘Liberate Hong Kong’

Activision Blizzard is a publicly traded video company based in Santa Monica, California. On Tuesday, Blizzard suspended one of its professional users, Chung “Blitzchung” Ng Wai, and rescinded $3,000 he won in a recent tournament. His offense? Expressing support for Hong Kong protestors. They also prohibited him from playing in their esports tournaments for a year.

“Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time,” Chung said while wearing ski goggles and gas mask like many Hong Kong protestors.

The thread by this Twitter user explains the effect of Chinese money in American video game companies.

10. Marvel Creates White Woman Character Instead Of Tibetan Monk In ‘Doctor Strange’

When Disney-owned Marvel made the movie adaptation of the comic book, “Doctor Strange,” writers chose to make the “Ancient One” a white woman played by Tilda Swinton instead of the comic’s original Tibetan monk character.

“He originates from Tibet,” said the movie’s screenwriter Robert Cargill on a podcast. “So if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he’s Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people who think that that’s bulls—t and risk the Chinese government going, ‘Hey, you know one of the biggest film-watching countries in the world? We’re not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.’”

11. Tiffany Takes Down Photo of Model Covering One Eye

Tiffany & Co. found itself blasted by Chinese consumers over an ad with a model wearing a Tiffany ring on her right hand as it covers her right eye. Apparently, Chinese consumers on social media thought the pose was the same one often used by protestors in Hong Kong demanding democracy.

After some of the first protestors were injured in the eye after fights with police, other protestors began covering one eye in solidarity. A Tiffany’s spokesman said the image was created several months before protests began and “in no way intended to be a political statement of any kind.”

“We regret that it may be perceived as such, and in turn have removed the image from our digital and social media channels and will discontinue its use effective immediately.”

12. Washington Post Takes Money to Print Chinese Propaganda

This isn’t an example of an apology or censorship, but of American businesses abandoning their principles in exchange for Chinese money.

As Mark Hemingway reports at The Federalist, several times a year the paper copy of The Washington Post is delivered wrapped in a section called China Watch. The fine print of the section reads, “This supplement, prepared by China Daily, People’s Republic of China, did not involve the news or editorial departments of the Washington Post.”

Ohhh boy! The same @WashingtonPost that’s lecturing about press freedom after one of their columnists was murdered by the Saudis is STILL running Chinese propaganda inserts. They’ll claim it’s just an “Advertising Supplement,” but they’d stop if they were serious. pic.twitter.com/hwWXhMYwom — Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) November 29, 2018

Here’s how China Daily cover the Hong Kong protests:

The protest, organized by several Hong Kong social groups, also condemned foreign entities for misleading young people in the city. Among these social groups was an alliance of more than 30 local political, business and legal dignitaries who support the proposed amendments to the SAR’s extradition law. They marched outside the US Consulate General in Hong Kong and Macao, calling on the US to stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs.

Chalking up the Hong Kong protests to U.S. interference and misleading young people is just one of the many lies Beijing has told the people of Hong Kong and mainland China. And this is the same variety of propaganda that the Washington Post is taking money to print and distribute in Washington, D.C.

13. Marriott Fires Employee For ‘Wrongfully Liking’ a Pro-Tibet Tweet

Marriott fired an employee who “liked” the tweet by a Friends of Tibet account.

“Due to the mistake of an individual employee, our official [Twitter] account wrongly ‘liked’ the tweet supporting Tibet independence and misled the public. [We] have now suspended this employee and dismissal proceedings are under way,” said Craig Smith, president and managing director of Asia-Pacific for Marriott International.

14. Mercedes-Benz Apologized For Quoting the Dalai Llama

Last year, Mercedes-Benz apologized for a benign Instagram post that featured a white car and a quote from the Dalai Llama. The car company faced backlash from Chinese Internet users who called the peace figure a “wolf in monk’s robes” who is seeking Tibetan independence through “spiritual terrorism.”

“Even though we deleted the related information as soon as possible, we know this has hurt the feelings of people of this country,” Mercedes said in a post on Chinese social media.

“Hurt the feelings of the Chinese people” is a phrase often used by Chinese government officials and their state-run media.

Hong Kong Protestors Fight Same Injustices As Founding Fathers Did,"One of the world’s most liberal economies faces one of the toughest threats to the limited self-governance it has left from a parent nation that looms as a global superpower. Demonstrators have taken to the streets for months of protests to revolt against the injustices encroaching on the little autonomy they have, objecting to extradition of the accused to the mainland and demanding greater democratic freedoms by disrupting business-as-usual with grand acts of defiance.

Sound familiar? That’s because it is. The Hong Kong protesters are fighting many of the same injustices that the American colonists fought more than 200 years ago leading up to the American founding.

Since the Hong Kong protests have no leader, the demonstrators throughout the city have no defined list of demands, but all have five goals in common: withdraw the extradition bill that would send accused offenders to mainland China, the resignation of Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam, an investigation into police brutality, the release of those arrested in the protests, and greater democratic freedom.

Hong Kong, similar to the original U.S. colonies, is a semi-self-governing territory that belongs to China but has its own currency, political structure, and cultural identity separate from its parent country. Many who live there see themselves as Hong Kongers rather than Chinese, as those in the colonies saw themselves as citizens of Delaware or Virginia instead of British subjects. Yet China has been increasingly assertive in flexing its rule over Hong Kong, now claiming “complete jurisdiction” of the region.

The protests began in March and came full-bloom in June after a controversial extradition bill was introduced that would have enabled individuals accused of crimes be sent to mainland China for trial. The bill at the center of the protests echoed grievances levied by the American colonists in the 18th century when many of the pre-revolutionary acts required violators to be tried in Great Britain.

Hong Kongers upset by the proposal were concerned that extradition to China would mean unfair trials against the accused, just as the American colonists argued in the 18th century. Critics also argued that the Chinese would use the law to come down on Hong Kong dissidents. The demonstrators scored a major victory just more than a month ago when the territory’s executive officially withdrew the measure.

While extradition of those on trial provoked this year’s protests, it is a movement for democracy that is at the heart of the demonstrations. As were the United States at one point, Hong Kong was a British colony 150 years ago that was turned over to Chinese rule in 1997. Operating under a “one country, two systems” principle, Hong Kong possesses a legal structure largely reflecting its days as a British colony, known as Hong Kong Basic Law. It guarantees citizens important rights not granted to those on the Chinese mainland.

These rights include fundamental American rights enshrined in the Bill of Rights, such as the right to peaceably assemble to petition one’s government, the right to a free press, the right to freely worship, and the freedom of speech. As Beijing strengthens its grip on the Hong Kong people, however, residents are rebelling in fear that these rights are in jeopardy, resulting in a political crisis for the Chinese government not seen in decades.

While Hong Kong maintains democratic freedoms absent in mainland China, the region still lacks the free and fair elections that exist in much of the western world. China always lobbies for a particular candidate who will govern in Beijing’s favor. Lam, Hong Kong’s current executive, won the territory’s top job with the backing of Beijing in 2017 despite running behind the number two candidate John Tsang in the polls. Lam is regarded by many as a puppet of the Chinese government, and protestors have demanded her resignation following the controversy over the extradition bill.

In August, the protesters seized the Hong Kong airport, conducting three days of protests and cancelling flights for at least two. The airport protests drew comparisons by some to the 1773 Boston Tea Party staged in Massachusetts when the colonists in an act of defiance dumped 342 chests of tea into the harbor.

Political analyst Jake Novak, who made the comparison for CNBC, points out that Hong Kong conducts much of Beijing’s accounting, legal, and financial services for China’s state-run and dominantly state-controlled businesses. Therefore the region’s workers see themselves driving the Chinese economy without the political autonomy they have been granted by a treaty China signed with the United Kingdom.

By taking over the airport, Novak argues, “The Hong Kong protestors are essentially saying: ‘no commerce without more autonomy!” “It doesn’t quite have the same ring as, ‘no taxation without representation,’ but the sentiments are very similar,’ Novak writes.

As the trade war between the United States and China rages onward, residents of Hong Kong are paying the price, just as the American colonists saw their economic output used by the British empire to fund costly wars and colonies abroad. The ensuing set-up, while not entirely Beijing’s fault, has added yet more fuel to the resentment many in Hong Kong feel, again mirroring that of the American founding fathers.

Perhaps one of the only differences between the Hong Kong demonstrators and America’s founding fathers is the geographic advantage the U.S. colonies had in going against an over-extended empire an entire ocean away. Hong Kong’s proximity to China offers its people no leverage against Chinese control, and Hong Kong has no real military of its own for self-defense.

While more than 200 years apart, the oppression sparking the Hong Kong protests contains many similarities to the injustices the colonists complained of at the time of the American founding. So as the NBA condemns actions supporting the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement, the basketball league is shaming the history and founding principles of its own country.

What Do U.S. Companies That Do China's Bidding Owe To America?,"In the middle of the night on Sunday, pro-democracy protesters hauled a ten-foot statue known as “Lady Liberty” to a mountaintop overlooking Hong Kong as protesters clashed with riot police in the city below. The statue depicts an injured young woman in goggles and a helmet, holding an umbrella in one hand and a black flag in the other and proclaiming the protesters’ rallying cry, “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.”

The Hong Kong protesters are fighting for liberty, but they’re also fighting for their lives as Beijing tightens its grip on the city. Videos of riot police chasing and beating protesters in the streets—including one viral video of a “de-arrest” featuring a protester’s flying high-kick on a police officer—circulated Sunday on Twitter.

The high-kick video was shared via WhatsApp, a messaging platform owned by Facebook, one of the few U.S.-based companies willing to stand up to the Chinese government as tensions rise in Hong Kong. Last month, the social media giant shut down an attempt by Chinese officials to use “hotlines” on WhatsApp to track and monitor Hong Kong protesters.

Police had planned to use the hotlines to let members of the public post photos and videos of protest activity, allowing police to gather intelligence on the protesters. After suspending the hotlines, Facebook issued a statement saying “WhatsApp is primarily designed for private messaging and we take action to prevent bulk and automated messaging.”

https://twitter.com/HighlandPaddyHK/status/1183285399424126976?s=20

Twitter has also been willing to push back against the Chinese state’s attempts to use its platform to undermine the protests. In August, Twitter said it had discovered a “significant state-backed information operation” designed to discredit the legitimacy of the pro-democracy protesters and spread disinformation. The company suspended nearly 1,000 accounts it said were being used in a coordinated manner by Beijing. Around the same time, after news reports that China’s official state news agency was promoting tweets attacking the protesters, Twitter announced it would no longer accept advertising from state-controlled media organizations.

Twitter and Facebook are the exceptions to a disturbing trend of U.S.-based companies bowing and scraping before the Chinese Communist Party. Witness the recent spectacle of the NBA censoring fans on American soil and shutting down questions from reporters asking players for comment on Hong Kong. It wasn’t enough to apologize for Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey’s tweet supporting the protesters. With billions invested in China, the NBA is apparently willing to import Beijing’s authoritarian methods to the United States.

Americans who love liberty—which is most of us, regardless of where we fall on the political spectrum—are appalled at this. The People’s Republic of China is an autocratic state under the pitiless rule of the Communist Party of China. It runs the world’s largest concentration-camp network, suppresses religious practice among Christians, Jews, and Muslims, runs a massive organ-harvesting operation among political prisoners and ethnic minorities, and is in the process of creating—with the help of U.S. technology firms—the largest surveillance state in human history.

Contrary to the idiotic blather of Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, there is no moral equivalence between the United States and China, and almost every American knows it. Most Americans also know that there is no moral difference between the Hong Kong protesters’ struggle for liberty and our own American Revolution. Their cause is so obviously just, so quintessentially American, it has united political figures as disparate as Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Time to Rethink Corporate Welfare

That’s why the behavior of these companies is so jarring. They clearly don’t share the allegiances or principles of the vast majority of the American people. They are concerned with other things, namely, making billions in China.

One might argue, so what? Companies, especially global companies, are supposed to make money, not play politics. Their only allegiance, as some libertarians like to point out, is to their shareholders.

Okay, fine. If these companies don’t owe allegiance to America and its founding principles, maybe it’s time to rethink what the American people owe them. If Delta airlines is going to affirm PRC territorial claims and adjust its corporate policies to appease the Chinese state, then maybe it shouldn’t receive tax subsidies from state governments and local economic development authorities.

Maybe the monopoly Delta enjoys at its regional hubs in Atlanta, Detroit, and Minneapolis should be up for negotiation. Maybe we should rethink the billions in federal subsidies that go to every major U.S. airline that kowtows to communist China.

Same goes for Apple, and Disney, and all the global firms that do the PRC’s bidding. If Apple’s Tim Cook, who a few years ago publicly defended his decision not to help the FBI’s investigation of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil, is going to pull apps Hong Kong protestors use to defy the state, maybe it’s time to stop giving Apple millions in sales tax subsidies every year.

In other words, if these companies don’t owe any allegiance to America, why should America owe allegiance to them? There’s more to the life of a nation than its commerce, and some things really are worth fighting for. The struggle for freedom in Hong Kong is one of them. If these companies can’t bring themselves to cast their lots openly with America and the Chinese people against the tyranny of the Chinese Communist Party, then we owe them nothing but contempt.

Three Days Among The Freedom Protesters In Hong Kong,"On a gray, humid day in June, a 35-year-old man named Marco Leung climbed atop a platform on elevated scaffolding outside the ritzy complex known as Pacific Place in the Admiralty district of Hong Kong, and announced he was tired of being ignored. He wore a bright yellow raincoat festooned with slogans — in the days to come, Hong Kong protesters would brand him “Raincoat Man” — and he unfurled a lengthy sign saying in English and Chinese: “No extradition to China, total withdrawal of the extradition bill, we are not rioters, release the students and injured, Carrie Lam step down, help Hong Kong.”

In the hours to come, police and firefighters would swarm the area. Negotiators attempted to convince him to come down, but he refused. Firefighters ended up confronting Leung, who, after climbing away from them outside the railings, fell about 60 feet to his death, missing an inflated police cushion. It was branded a suicide, the first of eight since the Hong Kong protests began, though the macabre footage doesn’t really bear that out.

Leung was no radical, at least until recently. He had previously indicated support of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, an establishment group, and backed establishment candidates on social media as recently as 2016. He backed Wong Kwok-hing, among others, who lost his seat to the more aggressively pro-democracy Roy Kwong — a Democracy Party legislator who was at Leung’s protest that day, urging him to come down safely. The police declined to let Kwong participate — so he crossed the road and used a loudspeaker instead, ultimately to no avail.

https://twitter.com/ray_slowbeat/status/1139916118804451328

After his death, Leung’s parents spoke out through a friend, urging on the young people of Hong Kong. “Every brave citizen who takes to the street is doing so because they love Hong Kong deeply. Only by protecting themselves and staying alive can young people continue to speak up bravely against social injustices.”

The location Leung chose indicates the way the Hong Kong protesters cut across lines of culture and class. While a “V for Vendetta” slogan is spray-painted a stone’s throw from where he hit the ground — “People shouldn’t be afraid of their government, governments should be afraid of their people” — this is no class uprising. It is instead a broad cross-section of Hong Kong’s 7 million citizens who are joining in: blue and white collar, those of wealth and middle class, sons and daughters delaying their college education to join in.

At the luxuriant lounge in the JW Marriott, housed within the Pacific Place complex, about a hundred American dollars buys entry to a buffet of endless caviar, seared foie gras, lobster thermidor, fresh langoustines, mussels, crab legs, shrimp dumplings, lamb pops, roasted beef and pork, roasted squab, sushi, fruits and cheeses of all manner, four kinds of aged ham, three kinds of smoked salmon, bespoke Asian noodle dishes, and bottomless wine and champagne. The tourists are mostly from the mainland: The men wear “Avengers” T-shirts and drawstring shorts with Nikes, while the women dress in shimmering summer blouses and flowing skirts with ankle boots.

Upper-middle-class people gorge while the middle class goes for an esteemed mother’s birthday. She loves her gift of Italian perfume from the mega complex beneath us, five floors of an adult playground of shopping and excess that rivals any high-end American mega mall. All the brands are there, though a group of college-aged girls express disappointed sounds outside the Celine store that is not yet open.

The doors are where you notice it first. The heavy metal door hangings are bound in multiple ways, M-shaped locks paired with chains and padlocks, plus sandbags and interlocked metal barriers at other entrances. It creates mazes where shoppers have to backtrack and ride the same escalator twice. When you do the circuit, it’s easy to spot the choke points. That’s where you’ll find men in suits who look tired and hold radios or have earbuds, wearing sunglasses, always watchful.

This is the same complex where just a few months ago, Leung would be the first death in a series of protests that would rock Hong Kong. Over the course of the past 19 weeks, protesters have taken to the streets all over the city. They have engaged in all manner of behavior. Several of them have died, all reportedly by suicide. Not all the protesters believe that’s the real reason. But others claim the despair is so great among the youths of the city that suicide is very predictable.

When you talk to the people who are behind the democracy movement, to the protesters and the organizers and the organizer-adjacent, you can view the motives that have animated the streets for the past 19-plus weeks as existing within a broader context of conflict over autonomy and self-determination. If you are a young Hong Konger, in your late 20s to early 30s, you remember the past before the handoff. You are mindful of the years when Hong Kong had a higher degree of autonomy that would presumably be protected. You see what you are losing in the current moment — and that’s what makes you take to the streets.

The current protests are being framed by the West as the first in Hong Kong in the era of comprehensive digital media and social communication that can bypass the restrictions of the state. That’s true to an extent — much of what’s happened in the past weeks here has focused on that audience. But what separates this from the past, such as the Umbrella Revolution, is that the whole city is all in on this, existentially, regardless of class divide. This despite the wishful thinking of the likes of Russia Today, the propaganda network of Vladimir Putin, which compared the protesters to classist uprisers from the film series “The Purge,” splicing clips together between the violent American movie and the acts of protesters in the city.

That level of deadly violence, as waged by the protesters, is absent, but there is violence nonetheless — petrol fire bombs, sharp objects, and vandalism abound. Graffiti is omnipresent, but painted over lazily, as if the cleaners know that they will be back to do the same task again the next morning. The city does not feel like a powder keg — more like a solid pot that looks safe and cool to the touch, but inside hides a roiling boil that will burn you in an instant.

Hawley’s Night with Hong Kong Protesters

The night one policeman’s neck was slashed, Sen. Josh Hawley, freshman Republican from Missouri, was in the streets with the protesters, bearing witness to their actions and the response of the police.

A white Kia emblazoned with graffiti, smashed and broken open with its contents spilled on the ground, was a short half-block from the main street. According to protesters, the occupant inside had presented himself as a journalist, but was in reality a cop embedded within the movement. Whether true or not, the protesters had exacted their revenge on his vehicle, cracking it open like an egg and feathering it with fliers and leaflets.

After a few minutes of press attention, clad in yellow jackets, streaming in a multitude of languages, holding up their various electronic devices in the spitting rain, came the sound of shouts that in any language reveal the the oncoming threat of Five-O. “Be Water” is the mantra of the protesters now — a reference to their own Bruce Lee, who said, “Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it.” Instead of seeking physical confrontation with the cops, now they flow away from the high ground in all directions, and regroup.

The cops roll in en masse, prompting a scurry of masked individuals from the scene. They run in all directions as bus after bus unloads masked police officers, clad in armor and bulky gear, wielding large shields and bellowing orders. They surround the scene and push back anyone in the area, blocking the nearby intersection. They carry tear gas guns and batons, with no identifying badge numbers, and if you try to take their picture even of their glaring eyes, they unleash a torrent of epilepsy-inducing strobe lights.

Hawley, a slim athletic man who looks more like a health nut executive than a senator, loped through the cross streets, standing head and shoulders above the crowd, talking variously with protesters and with press, taking pictures on his own phone to share with the Western world. His staff had to work to pull him away from the scene, even when the loudspeakers are ordering crowds to disperse.

The protesters and organizers know who Hawley is, and some even mention that he is the youngest senator. It is a funny thing to hear Hong Kong twentysomethings with a greater knowledge of American civics than the average U.S. voter — especially when they query about subcommittee hearings and unanimous consent. The interest of the protest-adjacent leadership is in the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act — authored originally by Marco Rubio, with more than 30 bipartisan co-sponsors. Whether it would result in meaningful impact on Hong Kong’s situation or not, it would be a signal to Hong Kong and Beijing and other nations as well about the way these protests are perceived.

An older woman, unmasked and barefoot, wearing a flowery orange and pink dress, stands on the corner of the intersection, letting the police have it. A call and response develops between the different corners as members of the press crowd around the woman. The protesters are not throwing anything at the police or engaging in physical action, but they are daring them to do what they have seen them do for weeks: to beat the citizens they are supposed to protect, not for doing anything wrong, but for the things they dare to say. Everyone is waiting for something to break.

This time, the cops hold back. They know the next 24 hours will potentially bring an even bigger demonstration, and don’t want to make another martyr on the eve of a public spectacle. They set about clearing the makeshift barricade protesters had arranged — a rather impressive mix of trash cans, traffic signs, concrete, and rebar. Well-dressed shopkeepers along the main drag peer through metal slats they bring down whenever the sirens draw near.

In between the stores and shops, the graffiti blanketing wooden barriers alternates between Cantonese and English, expressing all manner of viewpoints — but all anti-cop. Some words indicated the cops were working hand in glove with the local Triads criminal operation, something that has been accused multiple times. Others focused more blatantly on the mainland, including one saying, “Pooh is watching,” Winnie the Pooh being a stand-in for President Xi. Recently, a particularly enterprising protester set up a broadcast allowing for the “South Park” episode “Band in China” featuring just that reference to be displayed after it was, well, banned in China.

These are the types of tactics these young, technologically adept and passionate protesters are engaged in. A strobe light from an anonymous cop’s shoulder doesn’t really stand a chance against it. In the morning, Hawley will describe the scene in Hong Kong to the Western press as a “police state” — prompting Hong Kong’s chief politician Carrie Lam to disagree. It is hard to see how he is wrong.

I chose the words “police state” purposely – because that is exactly what Hong Kong is becoming. I saw it myself. If Carrie Lam wants to demonstrate otherwise, here’s an idea: resign https://t.co/sulX0v4KCv — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 15, 2019

American Response and Corporate Censorship

In recent weeks, this story took on new life in America and the West thanks to some odd flashpoints. For America, much of it was focused on the issue of the National Basketball Association. The NBA has an extreme foothold here — 17 percent of its revenue comes from China, and it had the misfortune this month to discover that this Hong Kong issue was creeping into the overall tour that was going on promoting the basketball association in China, featuring some of its biggest stars.

After Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey had the audacity to retweet an image meme supporting freedom in Hong Kong, the Chinese flipped, and Americans flipped even more when they saw how quickly various woke athletes and administrators in the NBA, who have made politics a centerpiece of their appeal in recent years, were willing to bend the knee to the Chinese communists. The most recent was LeBron James, whose cowardly comments trended on Twitter hours after the massive protests took over Hong Kong streets again.

James called for Morey to educate himself. Well, we’re all in need of a good re-education, from time to time.

This was the Top Tweet I saw as I switched from my burner after three days in Hong Kong among the protesters. Look into the eyes of a young Hong Konger who has seen her friends beaten and imprisoned and spout this bullshit. I have never hated LeBron until this instant. https://t.co/8kMSbtbqoj — Ben Domenech (@bdomenech) October 15, 2019

In the category of video games, an outburst from a gamer within the Blizzard universe led to crackdowns and apologies that rocketed around a world of advanced E-gamers who have become far more popular than ever before, even rivaling great physical athletes. Protesters also saw the bending of the knee from other corporations, such as Apple, which deleted the HKmap.live app being used by some protesters to track the activities of police in Hong Kong. But it was hardly their only app.

In Hong Kong, it’s understood that not everyone can take the black or wear a mask. For their part, the white-collar protesters are doing their best to hide. They are canceling their own social media accounts. They are trying to prevent themselves from being connected to their businesses for any political expressions. They are worried about the accountability and the enforcement mechanisms used by authoritarian regimes that can control the access to billions of potential customers. But they still are showing up to the protests, such as those on Monday that clogged the streets with peaceful demonstrators.

Meanwhile, the police union has asked for permission to fire at will on protesters who use various implements:

Authorities have already loosened guidelines on the use of force by police, according to documents seen by Reuters on Thursday, as they struggle to stamp out anti-government protests that have rocked Hong Kong for nearly four months. The loosening of restrictions on the use of force by police came into effect just before some of the most violent turmoil yet at protests on Tuesday, when a teenaged secondary school student was shot by an officer in the chest and wounded — the first time a demonstrator had been hit by live fire. … Local media Now TV and Cable TV reported the changes to the police procedures manual took effect on Sept. 30, the day before Tuesday’s violence at widespread protests on China’s National Day, during which the student was shot. … The updated guidelines also removed a line that said “officers will be accountable for their own actions”, stating only that “officers on the ground should exercise their own discretion to determine what level of force is justified in a given situation”.

Police have shot one protester already with live ammunition. The protesters expect there will be more. On the mainland, the focus has been on economic policy and welfare, and Carrie Lam would like to stick to that. But in reality, these protests are about a lot more than that. They are about the future of a Hong Kong that many people see as slipping away, one that young people in particular fear they are losing. The protests started with concerns that the extradition law would mean the end of Hong Kong as they know it. Now, it’s about something much bigger.

After multiple incidents where the cops are seen as having whitewashed the facts, they have lost the assumption among the citizenry that they are telling the truth. Already, political activists are fleeing to other countries. Elderly groups who attempt to protect the children have already incited police incidents. Religious freedom concerns are rising, particularly about the Chinese state wanting to set up boards to infiltrate and alter those assumptions of religious schools. The crackdown on free internet is constantly feared. A government official who was asked about this on the radio recently was quoted as saying, “Never say never.”

This Hong Kong Protest Is Different From the Past

This is not the first era of protest in Hong Kong since the handover in 1997. Previous protests, such as the Umbrella Revolution, were overwhelmingly peaceful, but there is now a feeling that a peaceful approach has not been entirely effective, particularly in an era in which police appear ready to engage in escalating levels of violence.

For years, pro-democracy advocates who feared that Beijing would crack down on the city system they know and love restrained themselves, participating almost exclusively in nonviolent protest. They would march with permits, organize under the existing law, and generally not buck the system they inhabit.

This feels different.

Joshua Wong, a student activist who was at the center of both Umbrella and other protests in the past, who was standing in jail when he saw the nearly 2 million people come out to protest peacefully in the streets back in July, is concerned that this is a moment in which Hong Kong could see its autonomy seriously slip away, based not just on its own situation but on the international priorities of President Xi.

These are the sorts of concerns echoed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Wearing all black in sympathy for the protesters, he visited key figures in Hong Kong this past week and spoke to the West on “Face the Nation.” A spokesman for Beijing reportedly said he would no longer be welcome in Hong Kong, something which Cruz may be likely to test in the future.

The use of excessive force is an underlying element of all of the protesters’ complaints. They say police remove gas masks from protesters who are trying to resist the tear gas the officers throw. They use water cannons, tear gas, and rubber bullets. They take gas masks even off journalists, and they arbitrarily arrest bystanders. During the Umbrella protests, there were only eight arrests of cops for use of excessive force, stemming from two incidents. And according to protester counts, in the past four months, the police in Hong Kong have deployed 3,000 gas canisters, compared to 89 during the entirety of the Umbrella protests.

The establishment on the island, made up of both politicians and tycoons who work within the financial sector, have largely favored what Beijing and the mainland has favored in recent years. But the threat of an extradition law that would have rolled back the authority of Hong Kong to adjudicate criminal matters regarding its citizens proved a bridge too far. Not wanting to displease the political authorities but wanting to maintain their authority, a few of these corporate citizens have broken from the rest of the herd.

Mainland China is not interested in such breakage. It is demanding more and more the kind of fealty one would expect from an authoritarian regime.

Hong Kong Protesters Have Big Demands

The protesters have five demands — a series of issues they want to be at the centerpiece of the conversation over the next week as the Legislative Council meets for the first time since these protests began. Carrie Lam, under siege politically and facing falling popularity, is set to give an agenda-setting speech, though it’s unclear whether security concerns will allow her to give it in person.

The mask ban is a key point of dispute here. It attracted international attention recently, designed to crack down on the ability of protesters to keep their identities secret. It was not a legislative action, but an executive one — a step undertaken outside the process. Protesters fear it is a sign of what will come.

Rather than being motivated by independence, the protesters in Hong Kong are focused on the issue of autonomy — a form of autonomy they have experienced for decades. They see within the expansion of President Xi’s power the threat to that existence and to the one country, two systems approach. These protests are more connected to other populist movements around the world, of the past and the present, than external observers have acknowledged. It took over a year of open combat before the Americans gave up on their original aim of self-governance under the crown and went for independence in the 1700s. Radicalization takes time, but when it comes, it comes in a torrent. All around the world, people are tired of being governed by leaders who do not care how they vote. Hong Kong is joining them in this.

The possibility that the Hong Kong authorities will use colonial powers to suspend habeas corpus, defy the public will, and crack down in violent fashion on these protests is very real. Wong predicts that protests will continue, regardless of what is done when the Legislative Council meets or when elections are held. The fear is that Hong Kong is being turned into a police state beholden to Beijing, where these crackdowns are viewed as necessary to keep up appearances to the outside world. But that is harder in an era of ever-present smartphones.

Beijing is primarily focused on containment. It does not want to see the kind of protest happening in Hong Kong spread to other key cities under its regime, but there are other schools of thought as well. If Beijing does let the unrest fester, it could be because Beijing sees the potential lesson for other citizens: Protests damage the economy, and it can say to others on the mainland, “See what happens when you want freedom and sovereignty?” At the moment, it is mostly the mid-tier industries affected by these protests, tourism and the like. This is a real problem. The malls are half-filled with the types of people who normally shop there. New deals only do so much to offset the ever-present reminders.

What the protesters are demanding is big. For one, universal suffrage: In the current system the powers that be, anointed by Beijing, are the ones who pick the candidates people can vote on. Real universal suffrage would include the people’s ability to pick their own candidates for key positions. For another, the rejection of the label “rioters,” one that carries with it a 10-year potential imprisonment. And it is unlikely any of the protests will dissipate absent an independent commission looking into the police response. For big demands like this, the peaceful protests of the past did not result in the kind of changes they wanted to achieve.

In July, almost a quarter of the island’s population came out to peacefully protest, and while that led to Carrie Lam’s decision to pull the extradition bill back, it did not lead to the kind of shifts those protesters really wanted to see, ones that would clearly indicate that the powerful had heard the complaints of the island citizenry over the encroaching reach of the mainland. Instead, protesters are left to appeal to the international community. Some are even hoping for the direction of sanctions under the Magnitsky Act, including severe economic sanctions against those found to have engaged in human rights abuses, freezing or seizing their assets and canceling their family visas to the West.

As the danger to autonomy increases, the response from Hong Kong’s citizenry becomes more strict and more aggressive. The differences between past protests are clear. This one is leaderless. Leaderless movements are better, the protesters tell me, because they cannot be shut down just by arresting one person.

The protesters who have engaged in more violent activity, including the throwing of petrol bombs and the like, damaging property, and setting up barricades, have been branded by the media as radical. But the protest activists call them brave.

This is a matter the activists believe has been an increasing problem for the police force in Hong Kong. The cops hide their badge numbers and their faces so they cannot be identified, and so even when protesters attempt to report the kind of brutality they readily experienced and for which there is a significant amount of video and photographic evidence, there is no way to attach those complaints to an actual officer. Protesters say this is the worst they’ve ever seen it, that the government tactics are escalating. They now risk violence eagerly and say the police complaint mechanism is broken, where anonymity prevents any useful accountability.

Protests are now being routinely redefined as inherently unlawful, where no permission is granted for the kind of peaceful exhibitions that had existed in the past, so there is no incentive to organize peacefully. The police have lost credibility, and Hong Kong now has no safety valve. In response, some within the protest movement have engaged in mob violence. “Take care of it ourselves” is the mantra, including vigilante justice against those individuals the mob believes have engaged in behavior that hurts their cause. It’s one thing when that means boycotting a shop. It’s another when it extends to beating up the shopkeeper.

Protesters Aren’t Giving Up

The Hong Kongers took the streets again on Monday night, with a specific focus on U.S. policy. There were hundreds of thousands of them, surrounding buildings, raising flags, singing songs. There was no violence. They were happy and optimistic, uninterested in violence. They were trying to send a message.

Much of the intelligent analysis of populist uprisings in recent years has understood the central nature of autonomy to the appeal, right and left, of such anti-elite movements. Hong Kong should be seen as part of this. This is not just a student revolt. It is not a class revolt. It is a revolt on behalf of citizens demanding individual accountability. They look to the lot of young people losing hope and the rise of suicide among those who see a loss to their freedom, and they want a path that is cordoned by the nostalgia for the past.

An upcoming election could prove significant in terms of the ability of the city to let off steam, but this is a long-term problem. The people of Hong Kong see a government that is increasingly beholden to Beijing and the interests of the mainland, as opposed to responsive to its citizens. They see a government that is pushing for cameras in the classrooms to monitor which students are wearing masks or all black in school, showing an affinity for the protesters. They see the punishment for corporate leaders summoned to Beijing after expressions of solidarity with the protesters, and they fear that if the situation spirals further, significant crackdowns away from the cameras and protests could be the result.

The Hong Kong Human Rights and Diplomacy Act is scheduled for hearing in the House of Representatives this week. The political freedom of Hong Kong depends on Beijing, and no act of Congress will change that. But the protest community is more hopeful, because they believe they are being heard — that by taking on this endeavor while their autonomy still hangs in the balance, before it is stolen away by the mainland, they can look to the economic freedom of Western business as a reason why all is not lost.

Others are less optimistic. But when a fourth of your population demands something, there is a serious consequence when nothing happens — when millions of normal, law-abiding people feel their own autonomy, and the autonomy of their children, is at risk.

"NBA Stands Behind Protest When It's Anti-American, Not When Anti-China","The NBA has received deserved criticism for caving to the demands of the Chinese government to preserve their business relationship. Much of that criticism has focused on the NBA’s perceived hypocrisy.

The NBA has long positioned itself as the “woke” league. Teams wore warm-ups that supported Eric Garner. Their commissioner Adam Silver said he wanted players to be political and speak up for social inequities, as CNN reported:

Silver said the ‘sense of an obligation, social responsibility, a desire to speak up directly about issues that are important’ is something that’s been passed down over the decades. It’s ‘part of being an NBA player.’ Silver said the league wants NBA players to ‘be multi-dimensional people and fully participate as citizens.’

But after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey’s tweet in favor of Hong Kong protesters jeopardized the NBA’s business dealings in China, it is hard to see how speaking up about important issues is part of being an NBA player — since no player spoke up in favor of democracy. James Harden certainly didn’t look like a multidimensional person when he stared into the camera and declared his unequivocal love of China, like he was in a weird cult in which, instead of sex, the cult leader controls his members via shoe contracts.

Days later, everyone in the NBA is saying exactly what China wants them to say. LeBron James claimed Morey “wasn’t educated” on the subject. After being called out by Trump for being too scared to criticize China, coaches Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr fought back, not by saying anything critical of China or supportive of the Hong Kong protesters, but by criticizing Trump and AR-15s.

The NBA’s embrace of Chinese censorship is understandably drawing comparisons to the NFL’s debacle with Colin Kaepernick, but such comparisons are unfair because what the NBA is doing is much worse for two reasons.

First, Kaepernick purposefully made his protests part of the games. By kneeling during the national anthem, his political views were made front and center during the NFL’s television product, and it dominated NFL media. The fact that liberal politics invaded a football game alienated many viewers who disagreed with his protest, as well as many viewers who agreed with Kaepernick but just wanted to watch a football game instead of receive a lecture on race.

Conversely, the entire NBA controversy centered around a singular tweet from an executive’s personal account. Watching a basketball game, you wouldn’t even know the tweet existed unless you sought it out. Not to mention that China blocks Twitter from its citizens, so the “offended” parties couldn’t even read it if they wanted to. With Kaepernick, the NFL tried to police the presentation and content of its product and brand, while with Morey, the NBA is now policing the off-the-court private speech of its employees.

The second major difference between the controversies is the party applying pressure on each league. While there have been allegations of collusion against Kaepernick, it seems likely that each NFL team just independently concluded that a backup quarterback is not worth losing fans over. It just doesn’t make business sense to anger 10 percent of your loyal customers to bring in a politically toxic non-starter, especially when someone like Josh McCown will gladly be your backup without any fanfare until he’s 50 years old.

But the NBA’s pandering to China has little to do with fan reaction. The issue is not that people in China will turn off the NBA if they see Morey’s team on their TV sets. The issue is that because someone in the NBA said something in favor of the protesters, Chinese state-run TV made it so that Chinese fans couldn’t even turn on the NBA games if they wanted to.

The NBA is not listening to the voice of its fans — it is taking direct orders from the Communist Party of China. It is like the NBA is voluntarily subjecting itself to China’s social credit system (wherein people can lose points if they are caught praying) by allowing China to dictate what is said on each and every one of its employee’s personal social media feeds.

In the end, the difference between the leagues boils down to the fact that the NFL adhered to one of the classic tenets of capitalism: When you’re in the store, the customer is always right. Unfortunately, with its complete cowardice on China, the NBA adhered to a classic tenant of communism: No matter the time, place, or situation, Xi Jinping is always right.

"Climate Change Extremism Isn’t Popular, And It Never Will Be","If you think most people are willing to make drastic changes to their lives because of climate change, let alone restructure the entire economy and do away with fossil fuels and capitalism, think again.

A viral video of London commuters dragging a pair of climate change protesters off the top of a train Thursday morning perfectly captures this disconnect between environmentalist doomsayers and ordinary working people.

The activists, part of a climate change group called Extinction Rebellion that’s been staging protests throughout the city since last Monday, shut down the tube when they climbed atop a train in London’s Canning Town station in the middle of the morning rush hour to display a banner that read “Business as usual = death.”

Initially, commuters on the crowded platform waited patiently. A few of them hurled insults at the activists. One woman shouted, “The world is not coming to an end!”

Extinction Rebellion begin their planned disruption of the tube on the Jubilee Line at Canning Town 👇🏽 pic.twitter.com/oN8LDO1G0o — Holly Mahon (Collins) (@HollyJoMahon) October 17, 2019

But eventually the crowd grew restless—no doubt because most of them were trying to get to work—and forcefully pulled the activists off the train. One of protesters appeared to be kicked and beaten after he was dragged off the train into a throng of bystanders.

There were similar disruptions at other stations throughout the city, where some activists glued themselves to a train, just as protesters had glued themselves to the ground earlier this week at Trafalgar Square as police tried to clear the area.

Extinction Rebellion vows to “peacefully occupy the centres of power and shut them down.” The group, which promised similar demonstrations in other cities across the world, began staging Occupy-style protests in London last week, and by Monday more than 1,400 had been arrested. Authorities have issued a blanket ban on Extinction Rebellion protests and on Thursday London Mayor Sadiq Khan condemned the group for disrupting public transportation.

Let’s Get Realistic About Climate Change

So far, the protests have been extremely unpopular. A YouGov poll on Thursday found 63 percent sympathized with the commuters who pulled the protesters off the train. Just 13 percent said they support the protesters.

It’s easy to see why. Even if one believes in catastrophic man-made climate change and supports policies to limit or reverse it, there’s only so much the average person is going to do. Skipping work to indulge extremists demonstrating on top of a train simply isn’t an option for most people. Neither is going without electricity or forgoing air travel.

In fact, most people are increasingly of two minds about climate change. On the one hand, they fear it and want something to be done. On the other hand, they’re not willing to do anything extreme. That’s what a recent poll by The Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation found.

The vast majority of Americans — about 8 in 10 — said climate change is man-made, about half said urgent action is needed, and nearly 4 in 10 said it’s a crisis. At the same time, fewer than 4 in 10 said they were willing to make to make “major sacrifices” or pay for it out of their own pockets.

In that sense, the scene at that train station in London on Thursday morning is really the entire climate change debate in microcosm. When extremist climate change ideology conflicts with the facts of everyday life, like commuters needing to get to work, most people choose the latter.

If people aren’t willing to give up relatively minor things, they’ll never support the radical emissions cuts and structural changes to the economy espoused by advocates of the Green New Deal like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Maybe that’s because most people know these changes would wreak economic devastation across the world and condemn millions of people to poverty.

Consider the aims of the group behind the London protests. Extinction Rebellion wants the U.K. government to declare a climate emergency, reduce carbon emission to net zero in six years, and form a citizen assembly to oversee the changes. Whether the group will admit it or not, reducing carbon emissions to net zero in six years would devastate the economy of the United Kingdom and plunge it into a pre-industrial dystopia. Simply put, most people aren’t on board with that.

Climate Change Hysteria Is an Insult to Working People

The visceral reaction of these London commuters exemplified one other aspect of the climate change debate, which is the disdain environmentalist elites have for ordinary people, especially for the world’s poor. The protesters believed, implicitly, that the commuters should suffer what they must for the sake of raising awareness about climate change—and they should have no say in the matter.

Here again, the scene at the train station was the climate change debate in microcosm. Those people were going to get on that train, climate activism be damned. In the same way, people without electricity in China and India and the Middle East will do anything to get it. They don’t care whether it contributes to global carbon emissions, their priority is being able to turn on the lights.

Indeed, the only way to reduce emissions on a scale that will appease climate change ideologues is if poor people stay poor. Not only that, but plenty of working and middle class people will have to become poor, whether they like it or not.

No wonder they pulled those guys off the train.

"Sen. Josh Hawley Calls On NBA, U.S. Corporations To ‘Show A Little Backbone’","In today’s Senate Session, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., delivered a resounding speech on the Senate floor where he called vociferously for the application of global Magnitsky sanctions “on individuals and business entities that abet Beijing and its oppression of the freedoms of speech and assembly that rightfully belong to the people of Hong Kong.” He also offered a full-throated and much needed condemnation of American corporations that continue to bend the knee to Beijing out of fear of losing their market shares in the Chinese market.

Earlier this month, Sen. Hawley traveled to Hong Kong, where protests have been percolating for nearly 20 weeks as result of an extradition bill Hong Kong authorities proposed in response to pressure from mainland China. The bill, formally withdrawn earlier today by Hong Kong’s legislature, would have allowed for Beijing to adjudicate criminal disputes between Hong Kong citizens by allowing for the extradition of criminal suspects to regions with which Hong Kong does not currently have extradition treaties, including mainland China, Taiwan, and Macau.

Though Hong Kong is under the sovereignty of Beijing, it is entirely unique in that it possesses its own customs territory, separate from China, as well as its own economic infrastructure. While Hong Kong remained under British rule intermittently for roughly a century and a half, the United Kingdom forfeited final control of the city to China in 1997.

Hawley’s speech offered a loud condemnation of what he alleged to be Hong Kong’s slide towards totalitarianism under the auspices (and urging) of the Chinese government. Indeed, many demonstrators in Hong Kong have begun to see the city leader Carrie Lam, favored by the Chinese government during Hong Kong’s 2017 Chief Executive elections, as ultimately a “puppet” of Beijing.

“Hong Kong is sliding towards becoming a police state… Make no mistake, Beijing wants to impose its will on Hong Kong.” Hawley likened China’s desire to pressure Hong Kong into submission to its larger expansionist aims. “[Beijing] wants to steamroll Hong Kong, just as it wants to steamroll all of its neighbors in the region, just as it wants to control the region, and just as it wants ultimately to control the entire international system.”

Hawley details China’s tactics in the United States as evidence of Beijing’s nefarious aims, citing “stolen” American jobs and technology, and reaching the conclusion that Beijing’s goals “are not compatible with the security or the prosperity of this country.”

Hawley describes the political events that preceded the protests, listing the various “rights” once promised to the people of Hong Kong in 1984 by the Chinese government but now placed in steep jeopardy, rights many of us would recognize as fundamental to our conception of Western democracy – the right to assemble, the right to peaceful protest, the right to choose one’s own government. Hawley understands the protesters as individuals “seeking to vindicate their rights.”

Hawley detailed attempts on the part of the Hong Kong government to silence the protests, which Hawley alleges are “no doubt” coming from Beijing. Proposed measures have included the possible instatement of a curfew, as well as the denial of the right of protesters to cover their faces, which otherwise would have allowed protesters to maintain some anonymity, despite the surveillance capabilities of the Chinese state.

Some demonstrators have referred to the protests as the “Water Movement,” a tribute to Hong Kong’s own Brue Lee, who once stated, “Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it.” Hawley commends the protesters for matching this description, emphasizing that “their courage and bravery under pressure is really something to behold.” Indeed, he identifies their resolve as an “inspiration,” and their “love of liberty” as “something really extraordinary.”

Hawley isn’t shy about making a larger philosophical statement on modern democracy. “We strive for democracy because democracy strives for freedom and equality and universal love.” He continues by defining the parameters of political liberty. “Political freedom is more than loyalty to a state. Political freedom professes human dignity.” Hawley rousingly declares, “It is time to stand with the people of Hong Kong and send a signal to the world that the United States will stand with freedom-loving peoples.”

However, undoubtedly, the most climactic portion of Hawley’s speech was his condemnation of American multi-national corporations that have bowed down to Beijing for the sake of retaining their outsized stakes in the Chinese market, as we’ve witnessed in a sort of catatonic awe over the past several weeks. He unabashedly frames portions of his criticism in the second-person.

“I would just say to those corporations doing business in China, to those multinational corporate entities and organizations like the NBA that it is time for you to take a stand as well. It is time for you show a little backbone…You may be multinational corporations who do business everywhere in the world, but remember that you are based here in this country…These companies need to remember that they are American entities, and time to show a little American independence.”

Hawley pulls no punches in warning corporations to resist becoming “part of the Chinese Communist Party’s propaganda arm.” Indeed, his clarity on this matter offers a refreshing response to the otherwise intellectually jumbled defenses offered by those in the NBA, which range from outright dismissal of legitimate concerns relating to Chinese repression to cheap claims of moral relativism.

Hawley’s speech, though hovering around a mere fifteen minutes, traces the intricacies of the Hong Kong protests, intimately conveying the desires of said protesters in a language freedom-lovers of the West can readily understand. He identifies the unique ideological kinship that unites Americans and Hong Kongers, despite the two populations being separated by several continents.

To those in the NBA who have assured us America isn’t so great, it seems Hawley, paraphrasing our nation’s sixth president John Quincy Adams, may have a message. “Wherever the standard of freedom is unfurled, there will be America’s prayers. There will be America’s benedictions. There will be America’s heart. And today, Mr. President, there needs to be America’s voice.”

Despite the hopelessness of the political fracas that has dominated our news cycle, Hawley’s speech serves as a stunning reminder of all that makes America truly and wonderfully exceptional.

Why The Left Loves Ta-Nehisi Coates,"Ta-Nehisi Coates’ new novel, “The Water Dancer,” has topped The New York Times bestseller list. I can’t remember ever seeing so much fanfare for a literary novel, particularly a debut one. Coates has been on all the talk shows, including a special edition of Oprah Winfrey’s Book Club. Now, that’s access.

Of course, Coates had to pay his dues first as a journalist. He started off in 1998 writing occasional articles for the Washington Post on hip-hop. In 2008, Coates began writing for The Atlantic, and rode the black Bourgeois Obama wave to professional stardom.

Coates’ success has been a hot topic among black intellectuals. Coates has expressed shock that white people are so interested in his work, since this was not his intent. But regardless of intent, affluent white liberals have become Coates’ most important audience and fan base. White liberals turn to Coates when they want to understand “the black experience.”

Coates’ rise to fame has many factors. His most famous article and first cover story for The Atlantic, “The Case for Reparations,” is a perfect example of making the most of opportunities presented. Coates is an eloquent and experienced writer, with a strong and passionate point-of-view. But there is more to this story.

Blacks in the American Two-Party System

The United States has a two-party system. Each party has a political coalition with disparate interest groups to form a majority governing coalition. In his classic, “The Emerging Republican Majority,” Kevin Phillips demonstrates the surprising consistency of these interest group coalitions over centuries, even if the party in which they are seated changes.

After the Civil War, blacks allied themselves politically with the Republican Party, which at that time was the party of the Union, Abraham Lincoln, and the “Eastern Establishment.” In opposition was the Democratic Party. At the heart of this coalition were white Southerners and white ethnic Northerners, particularly Catholics. While there has been fluctuation over time, and interest groups have changed parties, these same political coalitions more or less remain in the 21st century.

In today’s Democratic Party, blacks play a role as “junior partners” to the Eastern Establishment. Their primary duty is to vote for Democrats. In contrast, the Eastern Establishment is responsible for the financing, the “big ideas,” policy-making, foreign and domestic, and for constructing the “intellectual models” on which the Democratic Party’s ideology and policy are based. Within this large domain of responsibilities, a small section is set aside for black intellectuals and politicos to discuss “race matters.”

Many white Americans wonder why black pundits and intellectuals seem to always talk about “racism.” No doubt racial bigotry is real, and perhaps these folks have a bit of a morbid obsession, but it also arises from the role that they are pressed into playing by the Eastern Establishment. Many black intellectuals would like to be involved in creating the “big ideas,” policy objectives, and intellectual models, but there is strong pressure from the Eastern Establishment for black intellectuals to stick to their lane: “race matters.”

Moreover, the manner in which black intellectuals discuss “race matters” must be consistent with the intellectual model that the Eastern Establishment creates. They must not stray from the de facto ideology. This is easily enforced, because the Eastern Establishment has substantial control over the life chances of black intellectuals and pundits. They largely decide who will be funded and promoted, whether they will be published and where, whether they will be celebrated and given awards, and whether they will be on television.

Coates is very much a product of this system, and has thrived in it, to his credit. One can view Coates’ success from different perspectives, but I will spend the remainder of this essay looking at Coates’ work from the point-of-view of the function it serves in “The Great White Culture War.”

Coates at his heart is a “cultural warrior.” He has in part earned his literary status by demonstrating that he is more useful to the Eastern Establishment’s side of the The Great White Culture War than any black intellectual of his generation. In fact, if you look at the black intellectuals being promoted today by the Eastern Establishment, they are generally battle-hardened cultural warriors.

Black Intellectuals’ Role in ‘The Great White Culture War’

Pat Buchanan’s “culture war” speech at the 1992 Republican Convention was divisive, but prophetic. The Cold War with the Soviet Union had come to an end, but a domestic Cold War within the United States, a “cultural war,” was on the rise. Today, that “Great White Culture War” is ripping the American republic apart.

This culture war exists within white America. There is no culture war in black America. There are not violent debates about immigration, abortion, feminism, or LGBTQ rights tearing black America apart. These are peripheral political concerns for the black demos. Yet intellectuals and pundits of color are able to make careers out of fighting on one side or the other of this Great White Culture War as “mercenary soldiers,” or sometimes a more important role.

Black intellectuals and activists serve two basic functions on the left side of the Great White Culture War. One, they are tasked with “exposing” the “logical contradictions,” “moral hypocrisy,” and hidden “violence” and “domination” that underlies traditional Anglo-Protestant culture, thus discrediting it. It’s a task to which they are extremely well-suited.

Second, they are the “keepers of the legacy” of Martin Luther King Jr., the civil rights movement, and the tremendous moral authority that movement carries. Consequently, they can “loan out” the moral authority of the civil rights movement to contemporary left-leaning political movements, which are aiming to gain political legitimacy.

The problem is that these roles that black intellectuals play in the Great White Culture War tend to undermine each other. This is particularly clear with the LGBTQ movement. Let me explain.

From the ‘Protestant Ethic’ to ‘Post-Structuralism’

Both the abolitionist movement of the 19th century and the civil rights movement of the 20th century were rooted in what might be called the “Protestant ethic.” King’s April 1963 “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” meant as an appeal to white Christian ministers across denominations, gives one a sense of the moral consensus of the day.

Ultimately, these movements were ideologically based in an American version of the Pauline doctrine of human equality: blacks and whites are equal, because they can both become Christians, and thus achieve eternal salvation. It is important to note that political movements for racial equality have only been successful in this country when rooted in some such Christian ideology and theology.

Political movements for racial equality have only been successful in this country when rooted in some such Christian ideology and theology.

The success of the black revolution that MLK led spawned many imitators. Notably, that includes the sexual revolution, which gave rise to two political movements, which are pillars of today’s cultural left: “third wave feminism” and “gay liberation,” today called LGBTQ. These movements sought to imitate the success and draw moral authority from the historical example of the civil rights movement. They adopted its language as much as possible.

But they wholly rejected the ideological basis for MLK’s movement, the Protestant ethic. In fact, these movements saw Christianity as “the enemy,” as one of the central institutions that had caused their historic “oppression.” Consequently, they looked for a new philosophical model, and they found it in Paris, France. It has many names, but we will call it “post-structuralism,” and its most important exponent was the late Michel Foucault.

After World War II, what might be called “structuralism” dominated Parisian intellectual life, a school of thought rooted in the idea that human phenomena can and must be understood with respect to a well-defined and permanent “structure” that underlies human life and society. The most fashionable school of structuralism was Marxism. Alexandre Kojeve and Jean Paul Sartre reigned supreme.

Note that “structuralism” is an attempt to provide a model of human life and society without referencing any fixed concept of “human nature.” In fact, Karl Marx denied the existence of a permanent “human nature,” but instead teaches that what we call “human nature” has in fact been historically constructed by “human work” over time.

Structuralism is an attempt to provide a model of human life and society without referencing any fixed concept of human nature.

Foucault was of a younger generation, and while he initially was a dedicated Maoist, he eventually turned to a new radical intellectual pose in the form of what we are calling “post-structuralism.” He maintained his disdain for French “bourgeois” norms, but instead of advocating for proletarian revolution, his attacks turned to French bourgeois morality and ethics, utilizing a clever critique of French institutions to discredit them.

Influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger, he developed an historical or “archaeological” method, conducting a series of “studies” on a variety of topics: madness, the medical profession, the prison system, the human sciences, and human sexuality.

Like Marx, Foucault teaches that human nature is historically constructed, but he turns the discussion in a different direction. He looks at how “men of science” have historically constructed the “concept of human nature” over time. He sees a “will to power” within the scientific project to impose the concept of a fixed “human nature” on society, historically enforcing its intellectual model through the “violence” and “domination” of society’s powerful institutions.

One of Foucault’s main themes is debunking the notion that modern bourgeois French society has made moral or ethical “progress” in its practices and institutions. For Foucault, we may perceive our institutions and practices to have become more humane over time, but we are in fact simply blind to the hidden “violence” and “domination” within them. We have not made moral or ethical progress. We are just better at hiding the “violence” and “domination” from public view and public consciousness.

What’s Wrong with Foucault

No doubt, Foucault has some interesting ideas. But as Noam Chomsky notes, the problem with Foucault’s work is that he “throws the baby out with the bath water.” Just because there are logical contradictions, moral hypocrisy, and even outright bigotry in institutions does not in itself discredit these institutions, nor their overall doctrine, methods, and mission. It doesn’t take away from the overall benefits they have brought to human society. Internal reforms simply need to be made.

Chomsky gives the example of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Most scientists are men. Some in the scientific profession have acted in bigotry towards women. And power dynamics do play an important role in determining which scientific projects are pursued. But this in no way discredits MIT or other major scientific institutions as pillars of our material progress and prosperity, not to mention our physical health and national defense. It in no way discredits the “scientific method.” Internal reforms simply need to be made.

Just because there are logical contradictions, moral hypocrisy, and even outright bigotry in institutions does not in itself discredit these institutions.

Today’s LGBTQ movement’s critique of American Christianity, which takes its inspiration from Foucault, is similarly bankrupt. While it is undeniable that Christian institutions, doctrine, and methods have historically been wrought with logical contradictions, moral hypocrisy, and outright bigotry, this in no way discredits their important role in the progress of our society. It in no way discredits their important role in the progress of humanity. Internal reforms simply need to be made.

The post-structuralist model is the current fashion of the intellectuals of the American Eastern Establishment today. Consequently, if a black intellectual wants to get ahead, he must adopt it in some fashion, consciously or unconsciously. He must interpret the civil rights and abolitionist movements through a post-structuralist lens, so that their moral authority may be seamlessly leant to other “liberation movements,” like the LGBTQ movement, which uses this model. This is the price of entry to the black intellectual elite.

This is a steep price. The moral authority of both the abolitionist and civil rights movements rests in the American Protestant ethic, and the Pauline doctrine of human equality. To reinterpret these movements and ground them instead in some kind of post-structuralist ideology undermines their moral credibility—especially since this ideology is hostile to the American Protestant ethic.

Here we see the special value of Coates to the left-side of The Great White Culture War. For Coates, Anglo-American civilization is entirely discredited because of African chattel slavery. This is nothing new or original.

But what Coates also contributes is his doctrine that African-American Christianity is also entirely discredited because of its central role in African chattel slavery. This puts his work wholly in line with the cultural left. No other preeminent contemporary black intellectual has so strongly dissociated American Christianity from the successful acquisition of equal rights for black Americans. This is why Coates is a perfect black cultural warrior for the Eastern Establishment.

Federalist Society Drowns Out Protesters With Applause For Kavanaugh,"On Thursday, thousands of guests gathered in Union Station to kick off the Federalist Society’s annual conference in an event famously coined the “Scalia Dinner,” a thoughtful nod to the late Supreme Court justice whose writings have served as the foundation of modern conservative jurisprudence.

But this year’s dinner was different from recent iterations. In addition to marking the inception of the National Lawyer’s Conference, it featured the first public speaking engagement of Justice Brett Kavanaugh since his contentious confirmation hearings last fall.

At the start of his speech, the screeching of protesters, along with loud whistles, could be heard outside. Activists had stationed themselves by the entrance of the gala, positioning a large screen in the center of the roundabout outside Union Station that replayed Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony for gala-goers as they entered the venue. Since I was seated inside, I cannot tell you how long they played the testimony on loop.

The centrality of Kavanaugh to the event was undoubtedly a deliberate choice and a good one. Conservatives, and by proxy the Federalist Society, refuse to indulge the “Burn the Witch” rhetoric that has become all-consuming on the left.

Kavanaugh’s speech, which spoke overwhelmingly of his gratitude for various people who helped him and his family to weather the storm of the confirmation hearings, also offered another message: one of supreme fearlessness. A Roman Catholic, he spoke warmly of the hymn “Be Not Afraid,” a song he learned in school as a child but had not come to fully appreciate until adulthood—and perhaps, until the past year.

The applause was frequent and energetic, demarcating each line of his speech as if it were an isolated statement. The liveliness of the audience’s support proved invaluable later, as the spirited clapping managed to drown out the whistles of the protesters that cut through the walls of Union Station.

Indeed, there was a distinct threshold moment at which the applause could have died down but instead grew bolder and louder. Amidst a crescendo of whistles, audiences stood, staring at Kavanaugh, cheering in unison, having reached an unspoken consensus that the only way to silence the protesters was to be louder than them. In that moment, there was a powerful and unmistakable unity. In a way, it felt as if we were doing what we felt constantly necessary in the face of the left’s baseless and vulgar hysteria—we were defending him.

When many warned that the left’s destructive approach to the Kavanaugh confirmation would bring conservatives together, they were mostly correct. Kavanaugh’s speech, nay the experience of Kavanaugh’s speech—as well as the Federalist Society’s National Lawyers Convention as a whole—provided a healthy reminder of what lies at stake in the battle over the nation’s judiciary. As a hint, it’s not solely the judiciary.

As Attorney General William Barr noted at the convention on Friday, “in waging a scorched earth, no-holds-barred war of ‘Resistance’ against this Administration, it is the Left that is engaged in the systematic shredding of norms and the undermining of the rule of law.” For many on the left, opposing Kavanaugh had fit comfortably into the larger mission of rabidly derailing the entirety of President Trump’s agenda. But as often goes with scorched-earth campaigns, the valuable elements—in this case, the judicial norms we cherish—become collateral damage, sacrificed on the altar of unflinching progressivism.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell echoed a similar sentiment in his Thursday evening speech at the Scalia Dinner, noting that the Federalist Society wasn’t about upping the ante on some political scorecard but about promoting the “rule of law” as our Framers understood it and as Constitution’s text itself communicates. At a time when the left routinely advocates for dramatic transformations to society and with the hope of employing the judiciary to enforce it (should a Democrat win in 2020 and either pack the courts or appoint several living constitutionalists), the notion of a non-partisan, properly cabined judiciary is something to aspire to.

For years, the left has been labeling the Federalist Society a “right-wing conspiracy,” with some Democratic senators even portraying the organization as a cast of shady and subversive characters. If anything, the latest protests outside Union Station, in all their theatric glory, reveal that the Federalist Society has become the latest boogeyman of the self-anointed Resistance.

Despite the left’s best attempts to “expose” the Federalist Society as some secret scheme as opposed to an academic and professional endeavor, they foolishly miss the mark by a mile. The Federalist Society scares the left, partly because the organization envisions an ideal judiciary as entirely non-legislative and as wholly confined to the text before it. In the world of the Federalist Society, a “living” Constitution invites an undoing of our democratic principles by subverting the will of the people to the predilections of an unelected judiciary.

As asserted by McConnell on Thursday and as is frequently stressed by Fed Soc-ers, the responsibility of the judiciary is “to say what the law is, not what it should be.” There’s a disturbing trend on the left to refashion society into what they have determined it should be, even if that means upending democratic norms and self-government itself to do. As Barr stated on Friday, “Their [the Left’s] holy mission is to use the coercive power of the State to remake man and society in their own image, according to an abstract ideal of perfection. Whatever means they use are therefore justified because, by definition, they are a pursing a deific end.”

Although one could reduce and demonize the Federalist Society mission into one devoted to securing “Republican” seats on the Supreme Court, this attitude is far from the truth. Justice Scalia, a championed thinker in Federalist Society circles, spoke openly and frequently about the dangers of a politicized Supreme Court. For the Federalist Society, it’s about cultivating a culture that appreciates the thoughtfully designed contours of our democratic republic.

Nothing typifies this sentiment more than the speech given by Professor Richard Epstein on Thursday evening. For those unfamiliar, Epstein is an intellectual giant, a staggeringly prolific author, and deeply insightful thinker who has never held political office or sought to court partisan favor.

To a packed hall on Thursday night, Epstein reminded McConnell of the importance of nurturing genuinely smart legal discourse — that, though the Federalist Society couldn’t have been as effective without the assistance of the senator, McConnell also could not have been nearly as successful had Epstein and others not fostered and encouraged such a profoundly intellectual movement. From that vantage point, Fed Soc is indeed a conspiracy — a conspiracy of strong thinkers who, in the words of Justice Kavanaugh, should be not afraid.

Senate Unanimously Passes Hong Kong Bill Backing Protestors,"The U.S. Senate unanimously passed a bill in support of pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong on Tuesday evening. If signed into law, the legislation would empower the Trump administration to sanction Chinese officials who violate human rights.

The bill will now go to the House of Representatives, which approved a similar version last month, and then on to President Trump’s desk for consideration.

Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a co-sponsor of the bill and outspoken critic of China, said the bill is a message that the United States stands with the people of Hong Kong, and that, “The Chinese Communist Party’s quest for power across the region is a direct threat to America’s security and prosperity.”

Protestors began flooding the streets of Hong Kong in June when a controversial extradition bill, which would have allowed for criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China, was introduced in the Hong Kong legislature. The bill has since been scrapped, but the protests have spiraled into an ongoing, wider pro-democracy movement.

“The people of Hong Kong see what’s coming – they see the steady effort to erode the autonomy and their freedoms,” said Republican Sen. Marco Rubio on the Senate floor.

Under the Senate bill, the U.S. secretary of State is required to certify, at least once a year, that Hong Kong retains enough autonomy of its government’s decisions to qualify for trade special considerations.

Officials in both Beijing and Hong Kong angrily condemned the the passage of the bill. A statement from Hong Kong said they expressed “deep regret” about the legislation, and commented that “foreign legislatures shouldn’t interfere with its internal affairs.”

Both protestor demonstrations and police response to demonstrations escalated this weekend as fires broke out on a university campus. Police in riot gear threatened the use of lethal force against protestors who have begun stockpiling weapons including Molotov cocktails. On Monday, a video surfaced and sparked fear online, appearing to show Hong Kong protesters being loaded onto a train near the Chinese border.

Students Interrupt Harvard-Yale Football Game To Protest Climate Change,"Students interrupted the 136th Harvard and Yale football game hosted at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut on Nov. 23 to protest climate change.

The Harvard-Yale football game has been delayed due to students protesting climate change in the middle of the field. pic.twitter.com/uY9Kc3Mn32 — ESPN College Football (@ESPNCFB) November 23, 2019

“Nobody wins. Yale & Harvard are complicit in climate injustice,” read a banner on the field held by student protesters.

According to CNN, the game was delayed for a half hour before the students were led off the field by the authorities. Harvard was up 15 to 3 when the protest began just before halftime came to an end.

The protesters are urging both universities to forgo endowments stemming from investments in fossil fuels. Protesters are also calling on the schools to apply pressure on hedge fund managers to write off any debt from Puerto Rico, an island territory of the United States ravaged by massive hurricanes that many have blamed on climate change.

“Harvard and Yale claim their goal is to create student leaders who can strive toward a more ‘just, fair, and promising world’ by ‘improving the world today and for future generations,’” the three student groups organizing the protest said in a joint statement, including Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, Fossil Free Yale, and Yale Endowment Justice Coalition. “Yet by continuing to invest in industries that mislead the public, smear academics, and deny reality, Harvard and Yale are complicit in tearing down that future.”

The game ultimately ended in darkness as the delay, compounded with the game going into double overtime, pushed past sunset in New Haven, where Yale defeated Harvard 50 to 43.

In a statement, Yale labeled the protests launched by demonstrators as “regrettable,” and wrote that while the institution “stands firmly for the right to free expression,” it does “not allow disruption of university events.”

According to ESPN, players were stretching and warming up on the field in anticipation of halftime being over when the protests began, which drew fans from the crowd to the field and even a few boos.

“Hey, hey, ho, ho, fossil fuels have got to go,” protestors chanted during the demonstration.

Hong Kong Pro-Democracy Movement Crushes Beijing At The Ballot Box,"Sunday, Hong Kongers delivered Beijing another powerful blow, not by force or violence, but by exercising their rights at the ballot box.

More than 3 million Hong Kongers, a historical record high, cast votes in last weekend’s local district elections. After the 2015 election, all district councils were under the control of pro-Beijing candidates. This time, the pro-democracy side gained a majority in at least 17 of the 18 district councils, taking 347 seats, while the pro-Beijing camp took only 60 seats, and the remaining 45 went to independent candidates.

Early reports show young, pro-democracy candidates, many of whom were protesting against the government just days ago, overwhelmingly won their elections. These candidates received wide support from the public, winning “in poor and rich neighborhoods, in both protest-prone and non-protest-afflicted districts and, in downtown areas as well as the suburbs.”

District council elections in the past haven’t received much attention, and voter turnout is usually low because elected council members have only the authority to handle neighborhood issues such as trash collection. They do not have any legislative power and are not part of the LegCo, Hong Kong’s 1,200-member legislative body that can pass laws and “elect” Hong Kong’s chief.

This year’s election, however, has gained outsize political importance because it has been considered one of the few nonviolent options for Hong Kongers to have a referendum on their government, to express their dissatisfaction with the Hong Kong authorities and to exercise their rights.

How Hong Kong Protests Influenced the Election

Leading up to the election, we saw images and images of the once-serene campus of Hong Kong Polytechnic University become a fire-lit war zone. Police in full riot gear fired tear gas, rubber bullets, and sometimes even live ammunition against overwhelmed protesters, who fought back with only bricks and bows and arrows. Many protesters are teens or in their early 20s. Police sealed all campus exits, trapping the protesters in despite pleas from parents and volunteers to let the young people go.

Since June, Hong Kong police have arrested more that 5,000 protesters and have been widely condemned for their brutal tactics.

Hong Kong has been quiet the past two days. Protesters wisely took extraordinary steps to ensure the election would go smoothly without interruption. One of the pro-Beijing councilwomen, Chow Ping-tim, who lost her seat, told a reporter from the South China Morning Post that her loss had nothing to do with her record, but she was paying a political price because “the administration’s governance has given rise to so many public grievances.” The person who defeated her, Lester Shum, an active participant in the last six months’ pro-democracy protest, said in response, “The government must respond to our five demands as soon as possible. We can be happy for tonight and take a rest tomorrow, but we will need to keep up our fight the day after for the future of Hong Kong.”

For months, Beijing has insisted that Hong Kong protesters are nothing but a small group of “rioters” who like to cause trouble and have no public support. The resounding victory of pro-democracy candidates discredits Beijing’s claim. It’s a great humiliation for Hong Kong Chief Carrie Lam and especially for Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Hong Kongers just showed him they have something much more powerful than tanks, live ammunition, tear gas, and soldiers.

Carrie Lam Should Compromise

The question everyone is asking after the pro-democracy movement’s landslide victory at the ballot box is: now what? The sensible option is for Lam to meet with representatives of the pro-democracy movement and compromise on their five demands:

Withdraw the extradition bill (which she has belatedly done)

Establish an independent inquiry into police conduct

Stop characterizing protesters as rioters

Release arrested protesters

Lam resign and grant Hong Kongers universal suffrage

As we have seen, however, Lam isn’t about being sensible. She recently repeated that she wouldn’t consider protesters’ demands. After delivering such a humiliating defeat for Beijing, Lam’s job is on the line. Beijing may have to replace her in order to save face.

Will Xi Jinping Double Down?

China’s leader Xi also has a choice to make. Anthony Cheung, former secretary of transport and housing, suggested, “Sensible Beijing officials should have a good grasp of public sentiment in Hong Kong after the election results.” He recommended Beijing adjust its policies in the wake of the election result and at least appoint an independent commission to investigate police brutality, as a start.

However, I doubt Xi will be this sensible. Internal party factions are already complaining about his trade war with the U.S. and his inability to get the Hong Kong unrest under control. The latest Hong Kong election defeat may embolden someone inside the Communist Party to question his leadership. Xi may choose to deepen Hong Kong’s political crisis by refusing to allow Hong Kong authorities to compromise. He may take such a hard-line approach in order to suppress any internal opposition.

No matter what Lam and Xi decide to do today and the days ahead, in the battle between freedom and tyranny, freedom won this round — thanks to freedom-loving Hong Kongers.

"In Iran, Trump Admin Has A Chance To Get Right What Obama Got Wrong","As the Iranian regime restores internet connectivity to vast swaths of the country following a government-imposed shutdown, new images are emerging from the week-long blackout that shed light on the severity of the tensions between the Iranian people and their repressive regime.

Naturally, the media has characterized the protests as stemming from economic distress resulting from sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. These narrative-building, myopic portrayals (more here and here) minimize the long-term concerns of the Iranian people, likely for the sake of salvaging the supposed crown jewel of Obama’s foreign policy legacy—the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) or more simply, the “Iran Deal.”

Less than two weeks ago, protests were sparked nationwide in dozens of cities and towns after the Iranian regime hiked gasoline prices by up to 200 percent, sending the already teetering economy into tumult. Although the government heavily subsidizes gasoline, the price jump still came as a shock to the Iranian economy, which is already buckling under high inflation and unemployment.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani alleged that the increased funds from the sale of gasoline would be used to fund welfare programs, whose costs have allegedly ballooned due to U.S. sanctions crippling the economy. But, unlike Western media outlets, the Iranian people remain wary of the regime’s attempts to assuage their economic frustrations, many treating the protests as an opportunity to challenge the legitimacy of the government as a whole, whose unpopularity continues to grow.

“One year into the U.S. unilateral sanctions campaign against Iran – which have been more effective than the past decade of multilateral sanctions – Iranians are pouring out onto the streets and pointing a finger at their own leaders, not Washington, for their shortcomings,” asserts Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.

According to Amnesty International, at least 143 protesters have been killed in confrontations with the regime’s security forces, while reports from U.S.-based nonprofit Center for Human Rights in Iran allege that almost 3,000 others have been arrested. Due the internet blackout intentionally orchestrated by the Iranian regime to isolate dissidents and prevent the spread of information about the protests, the violent nature of the clashes between protesters and regime security forces is only coming to light now.

As Amnesty reports, “Verified videos show security forces deliberately shooting unarmed protesters from a short distance. In some cases, protesters were shot while they were running away.” Other videos reveal images of security forces shooting at protesters from rooftops. Across the country, tens of gasoline pumps, police stations, and banks have been razed to the ground.

The recent protests, which Western media will likely go through great lengths to pin on the Trump administration’s decision to renew sanctions on Iran, have torpedoed parts of the country into chaos. But this interpretation is inaccurate and short-sighted. “To say the protests are therefore Washington’s ‘fault’ is not only far off the mark, it lets the regime off the hook for its budget decisions forced upon its leadership because of their preference for a revolutionary foreign policy,” argues Taleblu.

Hearkening back to the inception of the Islamic Revolution, the Iranian government and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) have perennially sought to establish hegemony over Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, using the large Shi’ite populations in each region as an “in.”

As Hanin Ghaddar wrote in The Tower back in 2016, “From the very beginning, Iran’s goal has been the establishment of a Shi’ite Arab territory that physically links Iran to southern Lebanon via Iraq and Syria.” But fulfilling this behemoth mission has translated into the Iranian regime allocating funds to, among other things, the development of missile technologies and a burgeoning nuclear program, as well as resulted in the funneling of billions of dollars to various regimes (like Bashar al-Assad’s in Syria) and to terrorist proxies (such as Hezbollah and Hamas).

With Iran’s budget, transparency is a pipe dream, but some have attempted to crunch the numbers. It’s rumored that Assad received roughly $15 billion in aid from the Iranian regime in 2015. Meanwhile, Hezbollah, the terrorist group effectively seeking to run Lebanon, allegedly receives $700 million from Iranian coffers each year.

“Washington’s non-kinetic (peaceful) pressure policy is robbing the regime of revenues, forcing it to choose between ‘guns and butter.’” Taleblu evokes the classic economic model used to explain production choices in a given country when parsing down the regime’s economic preferences. “As [Iran] chooses guns, it risks increasing domestic ire from its own population for its choices.” Indeed, the protests represent the ultimate manifestation of that ire.

But there is hope for the Iranian people seeking to end the repressive tactics of the current regime, and U.S. policy moving forward may be able to play a not-insignificant role in that effort. However, media outlets are likely to be less-than-thrilled to cover what amounts to full-throated rejection of Obama-era appeasement tactics.

“Washington desperately needs an Iran protest policy playbook,” Taleblu asserts. “It cannot afford to miss opportunities to stand with those whose aspirations are in concert both with American values and strategy in the Middle East.”

Taleblu outlines what he regards as a possible plan of action for the Trump administration in the coming months as protests unfold. “Washington must make sure that Iranians can both communicate freely and can access the internet when its being filtered or blacked out altogether.” In the latest rounds of protests, the regime’s ability to shut down the country’s internet amounted to an effective strategy of containment, siphoning off protesters from forming potential allies in the global community.

In addition to an effective sanction campaign for identifying and shaming those who violate Iranian human rights, Taleblu also argues that the situation would benefit from the U.S. offering “rhetorical support, quickly and decisively, for when Iranians take to the streets to use every single crisis – social, political, economic – to express their dissatisfaction with the regime.”

Taleblu’s strategies represent a powerful means of supporting freedom-seeking people without immediately resorting to military tactics to do so. They also indicate that the Trump administration has the power to strike an effective deal with a group of individuals, even if informal in some capacities. Unlike the Obama administration, let’s hope it’s with the right ones.

What To Do About The Increasingly Vicious Anti-Jew Campus Protests,"On November 20 in Toronto, Canada, York University’s Students Against Israeli Apartheid (SAIA) tried to shut down a school-approved event featuring a panel of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) veterans from Reservists on Duty, a group that travels to college campuses to provide facts about antisemitism and the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel.

SAIA attracted around 600 protesters representing students as well as entities outside the school. According to Reservists on Duty CEO Amit Deri, this was the first protest where the group encountered “a BDS and Antifa collaboration.” What resulted was antisemitic violence colored with calls for genocide as protestors attempted to intimidate, demonize, and disenfranchise Israelis, Zionists, and Jews.

The presence of Toronto Police and private security personnel did not keep protestors and attendees from intermingling. One video shows individuals shoving and trying to punch one another in a packed stairwell. A pro-Palestine protestor claims he was punched by a pro-Israel attendee. Reservists on Duty stated protestors “assaulted a few Jewish students.” One person was injured during the protest.

Several videos show protestors inside the event space disrupting the panel by shouting and waving images, which were likely similar to those SAIA distributed in advance of the event in which an IDF soldier was Photoshopped to appear to strangle a Palestinian child.

Outside the event space, large groups gathered, banging on doors and chanting over loudspeakers. According to the Jerusalem Post, several protestors told event organizers to “go back to the ovens.” Numerous videos show protestors chanting “Viva, Viva Intifada,” referencing deadly periods of Palestinian attacks on Israelis.

Per the Anti-Defamation League, during the Intifada of 1987 to 1990, “masses of civilians attacked Israeli troops with stones, axes, Molotov cocktails, hand grenades, and firearms.” The Second Intifada of 2000 was a “campaign of deadly terrorism targeting Israeli civilians on buses, restaurants and on city streets,” killing over 1,000 Israelis, and wounding thousands more.

In the days following the well-covered antisemitic protests, Canadian politicians Roman Baber, the York Centre Member of Provincial Parliament, Doug Ford, the Ontario premier, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned protestors’ violence and hate.

York University has begun reviewing its methods for handling free speech about the conflicts in the Middle East. Toronto Police are investigating whether hate crimes occurred. Public outcry, coupled with the measured responses of administrators and police, will be important in finding ways to stem the growth of dangerous antisemitism on college campuses without quashing free speech.

Vassar President Reacts to Campus Antisemitism

Anti-Israel sentiment has long been problematic on college campuses, where groups often cloak antisemitism in social justice language. Allegiance to such movements, as well as events involving Israel on the world stage, led to numerous problematic displays of antisemitism, terror support, and misleading anti-Zionism at the University of Toronto, Michigan State University, Oberlin College, Butler University, and McGill University in recent weeks.

Other instances of on-campus antisemitism have received the attention of those who can make a difference.

On November 14, former IDF humanitarian officer Hen Mazzig spoke before students and faculty at New York’s Vassar College. A group of 25 to 30 members of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) disrupted his presentation by chanting outside the event space. For around 15 minutes, the noise was so loud that Mazzig could not speak. Among SJP’s chants was “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” which has historically been a call for the annihilation of the Jewish state of Israel.

Mazzig’s talk centered around his experience as a Mizrahi Jew, a descendant of the “850,000 Jewish refugees who were expelled from Arab and Muslim countries between 1941 and 1972.” As he explains in a guest column in The College Fix, he and other Mizrahi Jews are “breathing proof that Israel has saved…not only white lives, but also those of people of color.”

“In an attempt to advocate for the marginalized, these students shouted down the gay son of refugees,” Mazzig wrote. “In an effort to stand up for minority rights, they denigrated a Jew of color. In the pursuit of peace, they – perhaps unknowingly – made public calls for the death of my family.” SJP subsequently took to Facebook to call deadly intifadas “popular uprisings” and states it “does not believe Zionism should have a platform [at Vassar].”

Several days later, SJP member Ezra Mead wrote an op-ed in The Forward, claiming Mazzig “uses” his gay identity and intersectionality, and explaining the group protested because members “believed [Mazzig’s] talk would be little more than pro-Israel propaganda.” In closing, Mead indicated Mazzig should be disposessed of his right to free speech because there can be “no ‘free exchange of ideas’…about the forced dispossession and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.”

SJP’s equivocations revealed the hatred and bigotry underlying their social justice message.

Department of Ed Investigating New York University

Administrators at another school, New York University (NYU), failed to protect Jewish students from a “hostile atmosphere” of antisemitism that developed on its campus in 2018.

In spring 2018, 53 of the school’s 360 student clubs agreed to boycott NYU’s two pro-Israel groups, which led to passage of an anti-Israel resolution, circulation of a “threatening” flier, and a week of protests. At an April 2018 rally for Israel, members of SJP and Jewish Voice for Peace set fire to an Israeli flag, and grabbed a student singing the Israeli national anthem. These events left Jewish students at NYU in fear of displaying symbols of their religion.

“The administration essentially told me that they were supportive of the Jewish community, but no concrete actions would be taken against SJP,” Adela Cojab, former president of pro-Israel campus group NYU Realize Israel, told Fox News. The school advised her “not to post on social media and to lower [her] own presence and the presence of [her] community.”

A year later, in April 2019, SJP won the President’s Service Award for its positive effects on the NYU community.

In June, Cojab brought her concerns to the Department of Education. On November 13, the Department’s Office for Civil Rights announced it had begun “a full-scale investigation” into the environment of antisemitism at NYU.

Should the Department of Education decide NYU’s campus environment is harmful, the school will be required to “create a set of remedial steps to address anti-Semitism on campus.” If it fails to do so, its federal funding may be at risk.

Make a Difference

Institutions of higher learning are increasingly in thrall to anti-Israel groups that disguise bigotry and antisemitism behind flowery manipulations of the truth.

As these groups instigate violence and promote an atmosphere of hostility and misinformation, there are hopeful reminders of how each person has the power to make a difference. Graduates of affected institutions may be able to initiate change by reaching out to alumni officers about their rationale for withholding donations.

Responsive administrators like Vassar College President Elizabeth Bradley can make an important impact. The Department of Education’s investigation at NYU proves students have options when administrations fail.

Although they may seem the most hopeless, events at York University demonstrate the power of public outcry to put a cold spotlight on antisemitic behaviors and the violence they spawn. Jews and gentiles alike can help ensure campuses are safe for Jewish students in the wake of rising antisemitism. We also must secure freedom of expression in such environments.

In this battle, the freedom to speak is the greatest weapon. Those whose arguments and facts are weak are attempting to supplant free speech rather than engage in dialogue. When we allow those who hate Israel and Judaism to speak freely, their words become their undoing.

The way we amplify the actions and alarming speech of antisemitism, and the words we choose for ourselves, are especially important. It is only by using our voices to spread truth that we can conquer hate and promote dialogues that create solutions rather than rancor.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/12/06/what-to-do-about-the-increasingly-vicious-anti-jew-campus-protests/,2019-12-06
The Person Of The Year Is Not Greta Thunberg. It’s The Hong Kong Protester,"TIME magazine has named its Person of the Year, a teenager who skipped school to travel around the world telling people that they are horrible and the planet is doomed. It’s a living. Perhaps her Malthusian visions will be fulfilled by future experience. But it’s not very likely.

In fact, her position is at odds with what we know: that a more responsible approach to climate requires action from China and India, not the West. But that makes for less convenient judgmental events, what with having to ride a catamaran across the Pacific instead of the Atlantic. She sticks to challenges with less risk, like speaking to groups of people who entirely agree with her.

Henry Luce’s 1920s prospectus for TIME magazine included this “list of prejudices”:

-A belief that the world is round and an admiration of the statesman’s view of all the world.

-A general distrust of the present tendency toward increasing interference by government.

-A prejudice against the rising cost of government.

-Faith in the things which money cannot buy.

-A respect for the old, particularly in manners.

-An interest in the new, particularly in ideas.

In keeping with that mission, the Person of the Year we ought to hail is the protester in Hong Kong.

In defiance of the most powerful authoritarian regime in the modern world, the protester in Hong Kong has stood against the authority of Red China with courage and dedication.

They have not bowed to the brutality of the police, who have murdered, raped, and abused them. They have not run from the tear gas or the hoses. They have refused to back down. And because of that, their message has been heard.

It is a protest that cuts across the lines of age and class. While the protesters are younger, they are supported by their parents’ generation, which feels guilt over not asserting themselves earlier. So their mantra is: Be water.

Hong Kong has enjoyed freedoms never present in mainland China. They see those freedoms slipping away. And rather than bow to that inexorable betrayal, the thuggish assertion of the murderous state, they stood, and they fight.

There is no bigger fight. And so, the Hong Kong protester is the Person of the Year.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/12/11/the-person-of-the-year-is-not-greta-thunberg-its-the-hong-kong-protester/,2019-12-11
Why Didn't Time Award Hong Kong Protesters 'Person Of The Year'?,"As Time magazine announced that Greta Thunberg had won the coveted title of “Person of the Year,” few on the either the right or the left side of the aisle were shocked. The teenage Swedish climate activist rose to international elitist acclaim over the last year and a half, addressing heads of state at the U.N., meeting with the pope, and spearheading the world’s largest global climate strike. But there may be more pernicious reasons time shied from awarding the title to some other worthy contenders.

In fact, Time conducted a “Person of the Year” reader poll, and the Hong Kong protesters won—but the editors chose differently. Why?

The leftist bias within corporate media has become so garish and absurd that there is little anticipation it won’t use any opportunity to puff up the left agenda. While Thunberg was certainly a strong contender for “Person of the Year,” a few people noted that Time had missed a sound opportunity to voice unequivocal support for various groups of people around the world who have been tirelessly–and at the risk of life and limb–protesting their oppressive regimes.

Time could have given the award to the protesters in Iran, who, spurred by a rise in oil prices, took to the streets to protest the corruption of the Iranian regime, which continues to spend hundreds of millions each year funding terrorist proxies in the hopes of expanding Iranian hegemony in the region. Or they could have given the award to the reader-chosen Hong Kong protesters, who have spent months opposing an extradition bill that had come to symbolize the tightening of Beijing’s control over the democratic beacon of Asia.

A little sleuthing on the Twitter feed of Stephen Miller, host of “Versus Media” podcast, and some digging amongst the annals of Federalist articles reveals that the latest purchaser of Time magazine is none other than Marc Benioff, the SalesForce tycoon who made waves for pulling business out of Indiana after the state passed religious liberty protections akin to those offered on a federal level. As Mollie Hemingway of The Federalist noted at the time, 18 other states had similar protections in place at the time. No word from Benioff on refusing to do business with them, or nationally due to the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

Benioff’s patronage is relevant here because SalesForce announced this past summer that it would be partnering the world’s largest e-commerce company, Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. Alibaba is based in China and offers SalesForce an entry into the Chinese software market. Back in July, Alibaba announced in a blog post that it would be “the exclusive provider of Salesforce to customers in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, and Salesforce will become the exclusive enterprise CRM product suite sold by Alibaba.”

Thus, given Benioff’s newfound ties to the Chinese tech giant, the decision not to award the title of “Person of the Year” to the Hong Kong protesters makes perfect sense. As Christopher Ashley Ford, assistant secretary of the U.S. State Department’s bureau of international security and nonproliferation, noted at a Washington conference back in September, “Whether de facto or de jure, such [tech] giants can in some important respects or for some purposes act as arms of the state—or, more precisely, the Chinese Communist Party, to which the Chinese state apparatus is itself subordinate.”

Back in 2015, Benoiff waxed poetic against Indiana’s decision to pass RFRA-like protections on a state level. It seems that on the freedom of Hong Kongers, he may be similarly indifferent—or worse, spiteful. Time had a chance to make a strong statement on the freedom-fighting endeavors of the Hong Kong protesters –a job made significantly easier by the fact that the Hong Kong protesters won the reader poll prettily handily.

Although we’d like to believe there are corners of the media that remain uncorrupted by bias or personal interest, this is one corner where that may no longer be the case. The decision not to honor the Hong Kong protesters pairs quite neatly with Benioff’s recent NYT op-ed in which he declared, “Capitalism, as we know, is dead.” It may be for him, but not for Hong Kongers, who continue to fight China’s communist regime.

Why Is The Western Left So Quiet About Hong Kong?,"The ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong have won the support of broad swathes of American society, with the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act passing the House and Senate with nearly unanimous support.

This bill requires the president to identify human rights violators in Hong Kong and sanction them, and to annually certify that Hong Kong’s democratic system, guaranteed under China’s “One Country, Two Systems” framework, remains a reality. If it isn’t (i.e., if Beijing intervenes too much in Hong Kong), Hong Kong could lose its special access to U.S. trade and finance.

Thus far, the protestors have won several significant contests: the extradition bill was withdrawn, the police have once again begun to allow peaceful assemblies, and the opposition parties dominated the recent local elections.

Why Is Rubio Doing More than Democrats?

Sen. Marco Rubio has led the legislative efforts to defend Hong Kong’s democracy, prompting the leftist magazine The Nation to ask, “Why is Marco Rubio doing more than the Democratic Party for the people of Hong Kong?” The Federalist’s own Ben Domenech came to Hong Kong and attended several protests.

GOP Sen. Josh Hawley visited Hong Kong during the protests, while the socialists at Jacobin magazine just got around to explaining why the left should support Hong Kong a week ago, after more than 25 continuous weeks of protest. Their earlier coverage was mixed with tsk-tsk-ing about the lack of labor activism in the Hong Kong protests, and the presence of “Hong Kong localists.”

Even before the protests, Hong Kong opinionmakers recognized that American conservatives have close ties to Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. This is not to diminish the sincere support of many Democrats and progressives, but the enthusiasm gap is real.

Meanwhile, in the kulturkampf that seems to accompany all politics nowadays, progressive cultural figures have come off poorly. During the Houston Rockets/Daryl Morey blowup, the NBA institutionally defended the right to free speech, but dozens of players, and in particular many players with outspoken domestic political opinions like Lebron James, condemned the tweet.

Corporate titans of woke capital, including Apple, Blizzard, and others, were either silent or actively opposed the Hong Kong protests. When Pope Francis was asked about Hong Kong during his visit to Japan, his response was, “I would like to go to Beijing; I love China.” The pope has not hesitated to critique Western Catholic leaders on many issues, yet held his progressive fire on Hong Kong.

Where Have All the Lefty Westerners Gone?

Meanwhile, within Hong Kong, leftists have grown increasingly frustrated, and are publicly wondering why they have been spurned by the international left. Many U.S. conservatives, like Solomon Yue, a minor Republican Party official, have been very outspoken on behalf of Hong Kong. As a result, they get widely shared on Hong Kong social media.

In fact, many conservative news outlets, including The Federalist, have been widely shared among Hong Kongers. Whereas in 2014 Hong Kong’s “Umbrella Revolution” protestors felt kinship with the leftist Black Lives Matter movement, today’s Hong Kongers are burning Lebron James jerseys.

This hard pivot has given many Western-connected leftist observers whiplash. Particularly among non-Chinese leftists who live in Hong Kong, or American-educated Hong Kongers, there’s been a scramble to try to police which Western media Hong Kongers read.

Whether circulating “do not reshare” lists trying to tell Hong Kongers not to retweet American conservatives (even if those conservatives are actively support Hong Kong), or alleging that U.S. conservative support is phony, or mocking American conservative patriotism, the progressives who dominate the English-language media environment in Hong Kong have been driven into fits explaining why Republicans are the bad guys, even though Republicans are working overtime to support Hong Kong. Some Western-connected leftists simply cannot decide whether they want to support Hong Kong, and if they do support Hong Kong, they definitely don’t want to accidentally agree with Rubio.

Mostly, Hong Kongers have ignored this effort to rewrite their movement along Western progressive lines. Hong Kongers who decided to work with America, and especially with American conservatives, got actual legislation passed. China’s government noticed this success, and banned activist Joshua Wong from going to Italy to testify before Italy’s Senate. But that just irritated the Italians even more, and now populist-led Italy has passed legislation supporting Hong Kong too.

What’s Really Going On

It would be all too easy to take gratuitous potshots at this confusion on the left, but it’s vital not to overstate the case: the vast majority of people on the political left do support Hong Kong, as evinced by bipartisan backing for legislation supporting Hong Kong.

The reason Western minders have to keep policing what articles Hong Kong protestors share is not because Western leftists don’t support Hong Kong, but because of a more general American and Western tendency: imposing our political beliefs on foreign countries. They’re annoyed that Hong Kongers aren’t turning out to be the left-revolutionaries that Western observers want them to be.

Yes, somewhere between 10 percent and a third of the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement is made up of “localists” who want to restrict immigration, privilege the Cantonese language, and encourage a “Hong Kong for Hong Kong people” mentality. While Western conservatives and progressives may see something like Western nationalism in this, the localist movement also generally supports generous social services, is supported by local community groups in poor neighborhoods, and advocates for more progressive social values.

Caveating support for Hong Kong because Hong Kong localists believe the same things anti-colonialists have believed in every country is really strange, but it’s a symptom of the left’s increasingly deep commitment to multiculturalism. The rhetoric of communal liberation and peoplehood is increasingly hard for some (especially white) activists on the left to grasp.

Yes, Hong Kong protestors wave American flags at rallies. While Western progressives may like to burn American flags as a protest symbol, for many people around the world, the American promise still means something. In a country where burning the flag gets you a jail sentence, waving the flag of a place where flag-burning (and speech generally) is uncensored is a politically sophisticated testament to faith in limited, constitutional, and representative government. There’s no need to tut-tut the stars and stripes.

Yes, Hong Kong protestors share memes of an over-muscled Trump. So what? The Swedes gave President Obama a Nobel Peace Prize right before he started bombing Yemenis and one to Aung San Suu Kyi right before she initiated a genocidal campaign against the Rohingya, and Kosovars still see Bill Clinton as a great figure of national liberation and progress.

Foreigners always have oversimplified views of any country’s politics. If a group of protestors whose specific demand is for the right to vote for their chief executive want to wave some silly pictures of the most powerful elected leader in the world, who are Western progressives to gainsay them?

Stop Imposing Your Ideas on Other Countries

It’s worth noting here that the impulse to impose American political conflicts onto other countries at the expense of truly national interests or values is not unique to the left. I’ve criticized Steve King on similar grounds. But left or right, the tendency to try to force foreign politics to fit American molds is bad, and today in Hong Kong, leftists are guiltier of this ideological imposition.

This behavior isn’t just bad, it’s dangerous. I worried about writing this article because there’s nothing Hong Kong’s opponents would love so much as to see foreigners treat Hong Kong as a partisan issue. But it isn’t. While conservatives have indeed led the way on the issue, the vast majority of people on the political left have done their part too.

The noisy, woke, and Very Online voices of those who would set up an opposition between American values or conservative values and the advance of democracy should be ignored. For all our divisions, Americans across the political spectrum remain deeply committed to liberty and self-government.

Yes, we will rip each other apart arguing about how to apply these principles to bathrooms or healthcare or ID cards or any number of other issues. And yes, there are a few people on the left whose reticence to support Hong Kong should be a quite literal red flag to even their fellow activists on the left. But on the most fundamental questions of the human right to self-government, every reasonable voice in America has spoken up to say: 香港人, 加油 (Hong Kong people, add oil).

The Killing Of Soleimani Sends A Powerful Message To Iranian Dissidents,"By all accounts the reason that that President Trump ordered the killing of Iranian Revolutionary Guard terrorist leader Qasem Soleimani was the recent prevarications of the Iranian regime towards America. Most recently, these included the killing of an American contractor and the organization of an attack on the US embassy in Baghdad. But there is another important aspect of the timing of this strike that should not go unnoticed: the deepening protests inside Iran against its government.

According to the New York Times on December 1 of last year, “Iran is experiencing its deadliest political unrest since the Islamic Revolution 40 years ago, with at least 180 people killed — and possibly hundreds more — as angry protests have been smothered in a government crackdown of unbridled force.”

The root of the protests late last year was a spike in gasoline prices, no doubt influenced by the United States’ maximum pressure campaign of sanctions and other economic sticks. But the protests grew to be about more than just filling the gas tank, they became about the future of Iran itself, and a terrified Iranian regime did it was does best, its killed its own citizens for daring to speak up.

In one incident, Soleimani’s own Revolutionary Guard massacred over 100 unarmed protesters, simply opening fire on them in a marsh where they sought refuge. Such extreme measures on the part of the brutal theocracy are a sure tell that Tehran not only takes these uprisings seriously, they view them as an existential threat, as well they should.

Authoritarian regimes draw their power from a sense of inevitability. In order to thrive they must create an illusion that they are unstoppable and untouchable, that no amount of protest or pressure could ever wrest the levers of power from them. If there is any figure in Iran who seemed untouchable it was Soleimani. While some American outlets decided to refer to him as a “revered leader,” he was also reviled by many in his own nation. His death sends a powerful message that Iran’s regime is neither inevitable, nor untouchable.

Under the Obama administration the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, better known as the Iran Deal was meant to curb the rogue nation’s nuclear ambitions. But in so doing it not only provided Iran’s regime with the economic relief it needed to stay in power, but also with an air of legitimacy gained by successful negation with the world’s greatest super power.

In the wake of the Iran deal, what must those in Iran who detest the murderous regime and wish to fight it have thought? Essentially Barack Obama gave the Ayatollah Khomeini a lifeline and the keys to maintain power indefinitely. If the United States would not be on the side of Iranian dissidents, who would? Thankfully president Trump got us out of the Iran deal, in a move decried by all Democrats and most of our allies.

It was in the wake of this more aggressive stance that Iranian protests grew. It gave courage to those who would stand up for their rights. The killing of Soleimani does exactly the same thing, arguably in a more powerful and direct way. Those who terrorize their own people, their own region, and America, will not find comfort in pallets full of unmarked dollar bills, but force raining down them from the storm of American military might.

Those who oppose president Trump’s bold decision fear Iranian retaliation, they claim Trump is escalating the situation and making war with Iran a real possibility. But it is Iran who has been escalating tensions through their actions since the JPCOA was abandoned. Last year, after they took down an American drone, Trump considered military action but demurred, reportedly because no lives had been lost.

That changed when the American contractor was killed, and when American diplomats in our embassy had their lives threatened. Where once Trump had shown restraint, he now chose force. But it is important to remember that Iran’s escalation of tensions with America is not a sign of strength, but of weakness. Increasingly that weakness appears to exist within its own borders.

Things will not change over night for brave Iranians willing to risk their lives fighting for freedom in their own country. But last night they saw that even the highest officials of that brutal state are not safe, they are not bulletproof, and maybe, just maybe, they can be overthrown.

No 2020 Democratic Contender Has Commented on Iranian Protests,"This weekend, Iran erupted in protests over the downing of Ukrainian Airlines Flight 752 on Wednesday morning, which claimed the lives of 176 people. Initially, the Iranian regime had denied any wrongdoing in the plane’s suspicious crash, but Tehran has since admitted that it its military mistakenly shot down the plane with an antiaircraft missile. As a result of the confession, hundreds of Iranians took to the street in protest on Saturday, demanding that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei step down.

Videos circulating Twitter feature Iranian students gathered outside Amir Kabir University in Tehran, shouting “Commander-in-Chief resign, resign,” referring to Khamenei, whose regime has faced accusations of corruption and terrorism for months. Late last year, Reuters reported 1,500 Iranians were killed in less than two weeks, following the eruption of protests after a surprise spike in oil prices.

Late afternoon on Saturday, President Trump tweeted in Farsi in support of the protesters, the tweet roughly translating to “To the brave, long-suffering people of Iran: I’ve stood with you since the beginning of my Presidency, and my Administration will continue to stand with you. We are following your protests closely, and are inspired by your courage.” According to Saeed Ghasseminejad, a senior advisor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, President Trump’s Farsi tweet was the most-liked Persian tweet in Twitter’s history.

Since President Trump entered office, his administration has shown unequivocal support for those opposing the mullahs’ repressive regime, from partially withdrawing from the Iran Deal to empowering those opposed to Iranian hegemony in the region. Indeed, President Trump’s series of tweets in Farsi represent not an aberration but a doubling down on the stance his administration has held for the entirety of his presidency.

Meanwhile, not one 2020 Democratic contender has offered comments on the current protests in Iran, where dissenters are risking life and limb to voice their overwhelming dissatisfaction and frustration with the Iranian regime. This silence marks a startling pivot from the frequent mention of Iran we witnessed prior to the eruption of the protests. What changed?

Whether it’s antisemitism or the oppression of the Iranian people, the left has no interest in drawing attention to any issue unless the problem can be attributed to President Trump. Furthermore, those on the left likely feel uneasy about the protests in Iran, as they are left scrambling to explain how President Obama’s crowning foreign policy achievement known as the Iran Deal could have possibly devolved into such a chaotic and murderous mess.

Admitting the righteousness of the Iranian demonstrators means admitting the wholesale malignancy of the very actors President Obama empowered. And given the partisan hackery that has infected most corners of the political realm, such a statement would be deeply uncomfortable.

Nothing showcases the gap in moral clarity between the American left and the Iranian people more than the attribution gymnastics Democrats and the media engaged in when addressing Flight 752. As I noted here, various prominent figures on the left and in the media have rushed to blame President Trump for the plane crash, desperately seizing on any opportunity to pin Trump. Meanwhile, protesters in Iran, despite limited access to information beyond state-controlled outlets, continue to offer a full-throated condemnation of the Iranian regime, laying blame for the crash squarely (and rightfully) on Khomeini. A recent video here shows university students in Tehran refusing to walk on the American and Israeli flags.

As noted earlier, these protests have been unfolding for months, and Trump has an opportunity to get right what Obama got so inexorably wrong. As our media and the larger left parrot Tehran talking points about the regime’s violence in the region, I encourage readers to question the “reporting” and “analysis” of U,S. national security elites, who have become infected with an insatiable need to protect Obama’s legacy at all costs.

These aren’t serious individuals. As their grandstanding over the past few weeks, masked as “concern” for the future of Iran, has demonstrated, they aren’t interested in providing any semblance of moral clarity. They’re just obsessed with Trump.

Ocasio-Cortez Calls The Democratic Party ‘Center-Conservative’,"During Blackout for Human Rights’ fifth annual MLK Now event, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said the Democratic Party is a “center-conservative” party. She cited the inability of Congress to vote on “Medicare for All” as the sole reason for this claim.

“The Democratic Party is not a left party, the Democratic Party is a center, or center-conservative party,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “We can’t even get a floor vote on ‘Medicare for All,’ not even a floor vote that gets voted down. We can’t even get a vote on it, so this is not a left party. There are left members inside the Democratic Party that are working to try to make that shift happen.”

Ocasio-Cortez continued her speech by contrasting the gun rights protest in Richmond, Virginia, with protests against the killings of Freddie Gray and Eric Garner, insinuating police officers are racist because when people protested the death of Freddie Gray and Eric Garner, officers were present in riot gear. During the gun rights protest, however, she said there were almost no police officers.

“Here are all of these people, flying Confederate flags with semi-automatic weapons, and there’s almost no police officers,” Ocasio-Cortez said.

Ocasio-Cortez is wrong on both counts. The Democratic Party is not “conservative,” and the gun rights protest was not a free-for-all for gun-toting white supremacists.

The current Democratic Party stands for far left-leaning ideas. Every single 2020 Democratic candidate is running on some form of expanded government-issued insurance, whether “Medicare for All” by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, “Medicare for all who want it” by Pete Buttigieg, or expanding Obamacare, as Joe Biden suggests.

These Democrats are also running on removing remaining abortion restrictions, canceling existing student debt, and attempting to establish free college for everyone. These radical proposals are the epitome of far-left ideologies. The Democratic Party isn’t “conservative” in any sense.

Ocasio-Cortez suggesting the gun rights protest was a racist free-for-all was also false. Journalists who actually attended the rally, instead of virtue-signaling like Ocasio-Cortez, found the protest to be quite diverse and safe.

Townhall’s Julio Rosas pointed out the diverse crowd at the rally, also noting the safe atmosphere. “With the #VirginiaRally coming to a close, I can definitively say that I had zero concern for my safety once I got there. Had zero problems with the protesters and they were quite nice. Can’t say the same when I covered protests in Portland,” Rosas said.

The Federalist’s Tristan Justice also covered the rally and pointed out the real race problem in Virginia: It isn’t the protesters standing up for their Second Amendment right, but rather Gov. Ralph Northam’s wearing blackface and being reelected solely because he’s a Democrat.

Later in the event, Ocasio-Cortez equated Jeff Bezos and the Amazon business model to “modern-day slavery.”

“You didn’t make those widgets. You sat on a couch while thousands of people were paid modern day slave wages, and in some cases real modern-day slavery. … You made that money off the backs of undocumented people, you made that money off of the backs of black and brown people paid under a living wage,” Ocasio-Cortez said.

Finally, Ocasio-Cortez suggested the Jeff Bezos turn Amazon into a workers cooperative.

“If Jeff Bezos wanted to be a good person, he’d turn Amazon into a worker cooperative,” she said.

Ocasio-Cortez’s assumption that the gun rights protest was racist in its police presence was as incorrect as her baseless claim that the Democratic Party is “center-conservative,” or that Amazon’s business model is a form of modern-day slavery.

Thousands March For Gun Rights Peacefully In Virginia Despite Riot Fears,"RICHMOND, Virginia – More than 22,000 gun-rights activists descended on the Virginia State Capitol Monday to peacefully protest new gun laws making their way through the Democrat-controlled legislature.

Contrary to Democrat-fueled media fearmongering of a white supremacist rally threatening to erupt into chaos, as occurred in Charlottesville three years ago, a sea of gun owners flooded the capitol grounds and surrounding areas in a peaceful day of protest.

The demonstration, organized by the Virginia Citizens Defense League, was supposed to be a lobbying day for the gun rights group, focused on new gun legislation on a path to Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam’s desk. The bundle of new gun laws includes universal background checks on gun sales and expanded authority for local governments to prohibit firearms in public places. The Virginia Legislature is also considering “red flag” laws that would allow the government to strip firearms from people deemed too dangerous either to themselves or others.

Democratic lawmakers, however, were absent from the statehouse as thousands of gun advocates, many of whom were armed, marched in opposition.

“I was trying to meet with my legislator, and I don’t see any legislators available to actually meet with, which is pretty frustrating,” said Charles Howard, a Virginia gun-owner standing feet away from the capitol steps.

In the weeks leading up to the organization’s day of action, the protest became a nationwide rallying cry for gun-rights activists, who flew across the country to attend one of the largest pro-gun rallies in recent memory.

Scores of protesters had arrived as early as 7 a.m. in 25-degree weather before the sun began to rise.

By the time the protest ended about 2 p.m., there had been no fights, no violence, no rioting, no vandalism, and one arrest, according to officials.

Northam, however, had declared a “state of emergency” ahead of the event after announcing that authorities had discovered credible “threats of violence” from out-of-state militias and hate groups, reminiscent of the state’s nightmare demonstrations in Charlottesville three years prior. Northam also banned weapons from the statehouse grounds and put up fencing around the capitol building with tight security to enforce the firearm prohibition.

“Three years ago, Virginia and the nation watched horrified as civil protest was marred by violence and hate,” Northam said in his declaration. “We must take all precautions to prevent that from ever happening again.”

Those threats, however, failed to surface Monday as the pro-gun demonstrations proceeded without conflict.

Philip Van Cleave told reporters in a press gaggle that the governor’s fearmongering tactics were partially motivated by Democrats’ desire to suppress turnout. He said the Virginia Citizens Defense League had fully cooperated with law enforcement to discourage violence from breaking out.

“They’ve done one thing after another to discourage people showing up,” Van Cleave said of Democrats. “It didn’t work. People are determined to be here to make sure their voices are heard, and it’s wonderful to see that kind of determination.”

It’s easy to see why Northam and Virginia Democrats were concerned about a large turnout. Chants to expel Northam rang out throughout downtown Richmond as angry protesters voiced their frustration with Virginia Democrats pushing through unpopular laws infringing on their Second Amendment rights.

Dozens of protesters throughout the rally were sure to remind the public that Northam wore blackface, carrying signs of the Virginia governor’s infamous high school yearbook photo showcasing Democrats’ double-standard regarding racism.

Contrary to claims that the rally was a haven for far-right neo-Nazi groups to express their anger toward minorities, the demonstration consisted of diverse people standing up for their right to bear arms, calling out the false narrative depicting the protesters as racists.

Many protesters said it was unfair to conflate Monday’s pro-gun rally with the neo-Nazi demonstrations in Charlottesville in the summer of 2017.

“This has nothing to do with people of color saying that they’re better than another color,” said Joe Tinsley, a Richmond native speaking of the day’s protests. “[In Charlottesville], you’re talking about 200 people, not thousands of people here because this is a constitutional right, whether you’re black, green, Puerto Rican.”

The “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville was explicitly a white supremacist, neo-Nazi demonstration that sprung out of opposition to removing Confederate statues. The protests turned violent in a clash with counterprotesters, ending in 11 people arrested and one person killed, sparking national outrage.

In Richmond, however, counterprotesters were absent, and a significant presence of white nationalists remained to be seen, if any showed up at all, while minority gun-owners paraded through the streets carrying their firearms.

Women also turned out at the pro-gun rally in high numbers.

One woman by the name of Elizabeth Warren, not to be confused with the senator and 2020 contender, came to the rally from Fairfax, Virginia, and held a sign reading “gun rights are women’s rights,” outside the statehouse. When asked whether she attended the 2020 Women’s March on Saturday, Warren said she “wouldn’t be within 10 miles of them.”

“They don’t represent me. I’m pro-life. I’m pro-gun,” Warren said. As The Federalist’s Erielle Davidson wrote after covering Saturday’s march in Washington, D.C., the women’s protest has indeed become more about hatred for President Donald Trump than about women’s rights.

Supreme Court To Decide If Atheism Keeps Its Monopoly On K-12 Schools,"Today the U.S. Supreme Court hears a case that could determine whether parents and taxpayers have any choices about the kind of religion American children are taught with taxpayer funds. Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue concerns whether private donations may support schools that make their religious beliefs explicit. It could also undo a century of U.S. court and legislative decisions that used animus between Protestants and Catholics to attack the faith of both kinds of Christians’ children over the last century.

Five years ago, Montana’s legislature enacted a tiny school choice program that allows residents to deduct up to $150 on state taxes for their donations to private school scholarships. Eighteen states offer similar charitable opportunities, which fund private schools using private money. Montana’s taxation agency, however, banned religious schools from accessing these private donations, on the grounds that would violate the state constitution’s ban on using public funds for “sectarian” schools.

Since these school choice programs employ private funds, instead of direct taxpayer support such as through vouchers, they have been less successfully challenged in courts on the grounds Montana’s bureaucracy employed. Thirty-seven states include some variation of this prohibition in their constitutions, and several run programs similar to Montana’s, often with courts’ approval. Now the Supreme Court will deal with the discrepancy.

It is expected to use the occasion to consider anti-religious constitutional provisions like Montana’s, known as Blaine amendments, after the 19th century politician James Blaine. During Blaine’s crusade to enact these policies, the word “sectarian” was understood to mean specifically “Roman Catholic.”

That’s because it was then the norm, since the American founding, for tax funds to support openly religious schools. In the first three-quarters of the United States’ existence, many American schools were directly funded by tax dollars and run by local churches, and sometimes even taught by local ministers (often the most educated person in a town).

So until Supreme Court and legislative changes in the mid-1900s, U.S. public schools were usually overtly Christian: “In the 1800s, the country was predominantly Protestant, and public schools taught a generic Protestantism. Teachers led students in daily prayer, sang religious hymns, extolled Protestant ideals, read from the King James Bible, and taught from anti-Catholic textbooks.”

During the height of Catholic immigration to the United States, however, many Protestants didn’t want to allow Catholics equal access to local public funding for the schools their churches ran. They thus created barriers to public support for religious schooling, such as Blaine Amendments, that at first affected only Catholics, but eventually also turned on Protestants.

These barriers and others lawmakers and courts added ultimately drove Christianity from publicly supported U.S. K-12 education. They helped lay the legal and cultural groundwork for eventually substituting atheism for Christianity as the religion of U.S. schooling. It’s a sneaky move, because atheism and secularism are easier to falsely view as “neutral,” when they are in fact a competing religious understanding of the ultimate questions every faith seeks to answer.

The truth is that there is no neutrality about religion. To not believe in God is a religous belief, just as believing in God is a religious belief. To include the Bible in curricula is a religious decision, just like not including the Bible in curricula is a religious decision.

To pray or not to pray: both are religious questions. Both teach something about the importance, existence, and nature of religion, as does every other decision about a school’s instruction, teaching methods, and priorities. Instruction techniques must change based on whether one holds the religious view that humans are by nature sinful or the competing religious view that humans are born perfect and corrupted by institutions.

Yet for a century or more, we’ve accepted the dangerous fiction that it is possible for law and public institutions to be neutral on religious questions. This has had the effect of making secular atheism the dominant religion of American public life, all while pretending it wasn’t happening.

On that basis, in 1962 the Supreme Court held that the U.S. Constitution’s requirement that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion” required U.S. public schools to ban prayer. In 1962, the court banned public schools from Bible readings as part of instruction. In 1971, it banned states from funding nonreligious instruction in private religious schools. In 1985, it banned schools from allowing one minute for silent prayer or meditation, and in 2000 banned students from voluntarily leading prayers at football games.

While the Supreme Court repeatedly took a sledgehammer to American Christians’ ability to pass on their faith using their own tax dollars and supposedly locally controlled institutions, our politicians have refused to redress the bigotry against religion this entails. For if it is bigotry for Protestants to have banned Roman Catholics from equal access to public education funds solely on account of their religion, it is also bigotry for atheists to have effectively banned Protestants and Catholics from equal access to public education funds solely on account of their religion.

Either we all are allowed to educate our children according to our religious beliefs, or some get to impose their religious beliefs on others. There are no two ways about it. There is no such thing as a school that does not teach religion. There is only such a thing as a school that teaches that religion is unimportant, false, foolhardy, a side matter, unrelated to “real life,” a private matter, or not worth considering. These are all religious teachings — or antireligious teachings. Whatever you call them, they are not religiously neutral. They are religiously biased.

U.S. public schools impose religious beliefs on children. According to young Americans who have abandoned their family’s faith, they did so on average before leaving high school. One of their top reasons for abandoning the faith is the scientism they are taught in their schools. The other top reason are the sexual relativism they are taught in their schools.

The majority of young Americans believe the point of an education is to be able to buy stuff to make themselves happy, which directly contradicts religious teachings that the point of life is to love God and serve our neighbors. Thanks to Obergefell v. Hodges, public schools are now bound to take sides on the deeply religious question of what constitutes a marriage and proper relations between the sexes. Increasingly, public schools preach identity politics’ religious beliefs, such as the idea that sins like racism accrue based on skin color (intersectionalism) and can be solved through collective political action rather than individual repentance.

The Supreme Court has spent a century attacking religion under the guise of neutrality. Its decision on this case could reverse more than a century of injustice that the court has until now pushed apace.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/22/supreme-court-to-decide-if-atheism-can-keep-its-monopoly-on-k-12-schools/,2020-01-22
GQ Declares Nonviolent Richmond Gun Protest Violent After Admitting It Was Nonviolent,"Mainstream media outlets are desperate to turn what was a peaceful protest against new gun laws in Virginia into a white supremacist neo-Nazi riot, reminiscent of the Charlottesville “Unite the Right,” rally three years that resulted in 11 arrests and one death.

Monday’s pro-gun demonstrations in Richmond, Virginia however, could not have been more calm, possessing all the elements and fanfare of a Fourth of July celebration.

Sure, a Fourth of July holiday with guns can sound quite alien to urban elites who have never laid a finger on a firearm, but for thousands across the country, guns are a part of everyday life.

It’s no wonder then, that many in the media stoked fears of violence fed by Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam who declared a “state of emergency” in the days leading up to the rally.

Despite the lack of violence at the 22,000-person second amendment rally, the magazine GQ decided to declare the protest violent anyway.

“That Pro-Gun Rally in Virginia Wasn’t Exactly ‘Peaceful,’” titled a piece in GQ on Wednesday.

After the author, Talia Lavin, admitted the protest ended peacefully, Lavin argues that the real violence stemming from the protest came from the arrests made prior to the demonstration, the ripple effects of the government’s declaration, and her imaginary consequences of what is to come if the Virginia state legislature defies the demands of the massive crowd.

“There was, it was true, an absence of immediate bloodshed,” Lavin conceded. “But what abounded, in that armed and insurrectionist sea of humanity, was the promise that bloodshed might happen at any time, should the will of the mob be thwarted.”

In other words, the Brooklyn-based writer argues that the armed citizens protesting in Richmond were violent by, in her words, threatening an all-out civil war if the state passed restrictive gun laws. On Monday however, there were no calls to shoot up the Democratic state legislature or the state governor, but there sure were calls to use the power of the ballot box to throw out government officials infringing on their constitutional rights.

“Northam Out!” chants break out at the statehouse pic.twitter.com/Vus1tp5X5x — Tristan Justice (@JusticeTristan) January 20, 2020

Lavin also pointed out that Northam’s “state of emergency” declaration prompted the cancellation of dozens of events and led many to flee the city out of fear of what the media portrayed as another Charlottesville threatening to erupt. If people leaving town to avoid the gun rally qualifies as violence, which it doesn’t, that’s on Northam for perpetuating gun-hysteria, not the peaceful demonstrators.

Lavin argues that protestors were heeded to because America has an “exceptional tolerance towards armed white gunmen,” that oppresses minority gun ownership.

“In America, if you are white, you can wear a mask and carry a gun and hang a governor in effigy, and go home quietly at the end of the day, unmolested,” Lavin wrote, never mind that the Richmond crowd was an extraordinarily diverse group celebrating individual rights to self-defense. This kind of racist stereotyping however, has become the norm among many urban elites.

Of course, her narrative that only armed white men would have the privilege of protesting was busted by a number of non-white gun owners in attendance.

In another double-standard deployed among urban media types, Lavin omitted that Northam wore blackface, while characterizing the Richmond gun crowd as racist white men. Good thing the crowd reminded the public of Northam’s infamous yearbook photo sporting Northam’s high school costume.

Lavin also accurately notes that three individuals arrested before the event were allegedly part of a white supremacist group who were planning to inject chaos by spraying bullets into the crowd. While no one can be certain of the arrested individuals’ intentions, the potential perpetrators wouldn’t have gotten far surrounded by a crowd of highly armed firearms enthusiasts ready to protect themselves. It’s almost as if guns make lives safer.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/23/gq-declares-nonviolent-richmond-gun-protest-violent-after-admitting-it-was-nonviolent/,2020-01-23
"Impeachment Advocates Can't Win By The Rules, So They #SwarmTheSenate","“A massive crowd has filled the Hart Senate Atrium to demand witnesses, documents, and justice in the Senate removal trial of Donald Trump,” reads the Remove Trump #SwarmTheSenate Twitter page. The feed includes a video of hundreds quietly milling around the marble floors of the Senate office building. They hold no signs, presumably for security reasons, but many wear anti-Trump shirts, hats, and orange “Out Now” stickers.

The protest was made up of a coalition of leftist advocacy groups, aiming to pressure senators into allowing witnesses in the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump. The Center for Popular Democracy Action, Public Citizen, the Poor People’s Campaign, Women’s March, and other activist groups organized the event, according to CommonDreams.org.

CPD Action posted photos of the swarm and tweeted, “Incredible images out of DC where thousands are demanding [an] end to the Senate’s sham trial and a beginning to what every trial must include: witnesses and documents.”

After the groups swarmed the Hart Senate building, they made their way to the Capitol. There the protest went from silent to raucous. Protesters wielded signs and banners, megaphones, drums, and guitars. Some wore masks or costumes, and one man was even on stilts.

Forty-one protesters were arrested, some after sitting on the Capitol steps in an act of civil disobedience, The Hill reported. A witness at the event said the protesters had been warned the steps were off limits, but she believed this was an unreasonable restriction.

“The Republicans are rigging this trial, and the one force that could actually change this equation is the power of the people coming out in the streets and demanding witnesses, demanding evidence, and demanding conviction and removal,” Rafael Kadaris, a protester with RefuseFacism.org, stated.

Democrats Won’t Be Satisfied With Docs and Witnesses

Even if the Senate calls witnesses, would that satisfy the protesters who swarmed the Senate Jan. 29? Are witnesses and documents what they really want? Most know the answer is no. Trump’s detractors will only be happy with his removal. No trial could be fair, just, or long enough to convince activists on the left of Trump’s innocence.

The Heritage Foundation’s Thomas Jipping points out there are plenty of documents and witnesses already on the record. At the beginning of the Senate trial, the entire House record, which runs more than 25,000 pages, was entered into evidence.

Even if the Senate chooses not to call additional witnesses, senators have the option of combing through “the House’s 107-page trial brief and statement of material facts; Trump’s 110-page trial memorandum; 45 pages of opinions from the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel; nearly 40 hours of presentation by the House managers and Trump’s team; and the answers of both parties to senators’ questions,” Jipping says.

As for those witnesses who refused to testify, the House can try to compel that testimony, and they chose not to. They could have gone to the courts to get their subpoenas enforced, but instead they let the matter go and in one case even withdrew the subpoena. Why? They were in a hurry.

According to The Guardian, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered articles of impeachment to be drafted after only two months of investigating. Yet at the time, no leftist activists were claiming the proceedings were a sham or that a cover-up was underfoot.

Chris Gagin recently wrote in The Hill, “Without any witnesses, the president and Senate Republicans up for reelection become vulnerable to claims of a sham trial or, even far worse, an orchestrated cover-up rooted in a fear of the truth.” While this might be true, even if the Senate votes for witnesses, Democrats and activists will still make these claims.

Corruption Means We’re Not Getting Our Way

Let’s not forget that giving in to demands to re-open Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing and then to open another FBI investigation into allegations of sexual assault did not satisfy his detractors. The demands for “witnesses and documents” on Wednesday are reminiscent of demands for the same in Kavanaugh’s hearing.

According to Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino in their book “Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court,” the Senate Judiciary Committee was provided millions of pages of documents relating to Kavanaugh’s career. By comparison, Justice Elena Kagan only provided 173,000 pages of paperwork, and Justice Neil Gorsuch provided 182,000 pages.

Kavanaugh’s detractors didn’t really care about paperwork, and neither do Trump’s. These demands are a means of delay, distraction, and dissension. The left can’t win by the rules of the game, an election in Trump’s case or a confirmation hearing in Kavanaugh’s, so they complain about the process to convince their supporters that the outcome is illegitimate.

As one protester with Refuse Fascism said at the rally in front of the Capitol, “If you think you can solve this in 2020 with the elections, wake up. … [Trump’s] not going to respect the electoral process. … Let’s never forget he lost the last election and he’s still in power. You have to deal with the racist Electoral College. … Banking on 2020 is an illusion.”

As Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court was a foregone conclusion, so is Trump’s acquittal in the Senate. For this reason, the left is using every weapon in its arsenal to convince its base that the process itself is corrupt, that Republican senators are running a cover-up. This is why protesters swarmed the Senate.

Trump’s Impeachment Is Similar to the Kavanaugh Debacle

In a Washington Post article titled, “Impeachment feels a lot like Kavanaugh 2.0,” the author points out that like in the Kavanaugh confirmation hearing, Trump critics “have long been searching desperately for something, anything, with which to take down the designated victim.”

The author of this article, Ruth Marcus, does not believe the motives of Trump’s accusers or prosecutors should matter if Trump indeed abused his power. Understanding one’s motivations, however, is often important in understanding their actions. In this case, the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board sees through the Democrats’ call for witnesses and documents:

[H]aving failed to make an adequate case to remove Mr. Trump, Democrats are trying to drag out impeachment to further tarnish his reputation and mousetrap Senate Republicans running for re-election. She demands what she calls a ‘fair trial’ after preventing a fair impeachment probe in the House. This is an abuse of the impeachment power.

Whether or not John Bolton testifies, whether the White House turns over every document that mentions Ukraine, Biden, or Burisma, it won’t matter to those on the left who want to see Trump thrown out of office. To them, this is an existential crisis.

Their entire identity is wrapped up in their hatred for Trump. As long as Trump remains president, activists will continue to disrupt normal political processes, swarming buildings and storming hearings, claiming the system is corrupt, that there is a cover-up, and that the other side is cheating.

Impeachment Protestors Call For Revolution To End U.S. ‘Fascism’,"A lot of the people who have gathered day in and day out to protest against the Trump administration don’t just hate Donald Trump, they hate America. It is unclear whether they hate America because almost half of the population voted for Trump or if they hate Trump because he loves America. The most offensive words to them are “America first” or “Make America Great Again,” because they don’t believe America was ever great or ever can be.

On January 31, the Senate voted 49-51 not to call additional witnesses, effectively spelling out the end of the Senate’s impeachment trial. Outside of the Capitol Building 150-200 protestors assembled despite the rain. While some protestors called for a “fair trial,” others called for a destruction of our entire system of government. All were angry.

As senators began to vote on witnesses, about 45 police officers formed a wall between the protesters and the Capitol Building. When the Senate’s decision was announced, the protestors moved towards the wall of officers as if one unit. They shouted, “Shame, shame, shame.” They were so loud that the chant reverberated off of the East side of the Capital Building and echoed back at the crowd.

After the initial shock of defeat, a few protestors stood silent, tears in their eyes. One young woman began singing into a megaphone, “Can you hear the people sing, singing the song of angry men,” others ranted at senators, and one silver-haired woman froze for several moments with her middle finger up in the air and her face raised towards the sky.

Refuse Fascism With…Communism and Anarchy

After several minutes of chanting, “This is a cover-up,” members from the group Refuse Fascism picked up a megaphone and began preaching. What they said, I’d heard before. This group is dedicated. They have been at every rally and protest I’ve covered for the past month, from the Women’s March and the March for Life to daily impeachment protests at the Senate buildings and the Capitol.

Group members told me they are primarily a grassroots organization. None could name a leader, although I noticed three people consistently running their events. The group seems to be funded via donations. One young woman quit her job in California to attend impeachment protests in D.C. To support herself, she set up a GoFundMe page.

Another protester said she also quit her job and is staying in a youth hostel. A retired woman walked around with a container around her neck, collecting donations and email addresses. She informed me that I could contribute online. One man said he drove from Indiana to join the protests. He said that he hadn’t slept in two days and had barely eaten. He shared that he walked away from his life to join the movement.

One member of the group named Chantel, who I’d seen at the Women’s March as well as several impeachment protests, said Refuse Fascism began right before Trump’s inauguration with a call to action by the Revolutionary Communist Party. Chantel said that although the group doesn’t support particular policies, they are collectively against fascism, which she described as a different form of rule, a rule that is openly nationalistic, xenophobic, militaristic, and antagonistic to dissent.

According to the group’s website, they are concerned with a “re-institution of oppressive ‘traditional values’” and with the elimination of “traditional democratic rights.” One example the group points to of Trump’s fascist tendencies is his treatment of the media and his use of the term “fake news” as well as his habit of calling people names.

The group’s primary goal, Chantel explained, is to drive Trump and his fascist allies out of office through mass mobilization. She said the group’s models are the protest movements in Lebanon, Chile, Hong Kong, and Puerto Rico. She does not believe that impeachment is the complete answer, because that would leave Vice President Mike Pence in the White House. She believes he is a Christian fascist, threatening the separation of church and state.

RefuseFascism.org states, “[O]ur single, non-negotiable demand must be that the entire regime – Trump, Pence and all their henchmen (Bannon, Sessions, Mattis, Devos, Pruitt, etc.) – must be driven out.” The group has been organizing protests in cities around the nation since Trump’s inauguration. They repeatedly call for people to “get off the couch.” I heard several themes from Refuse Fascism protestors.

Calling the Electoral Process into Question

“On Tuesday when the Senate Trial begins, we need to be there to bring the power of the people,” hundreds of Women’s March protestors repeated after a woman holding a megaphone and wearing an orange “Out Now- Refuse Fascism” T-shirt. The woman’s name is Sunsara Taylor. According to her Twitter page, she writes for revcom.us and is an activist working with RefuseFacism.org.

Taylor said to the crowd, “We cannot rely on the Democrats, we cannot rely on the election, we cannot rely on the normal channels, because Donald Trump is a fascist who does not respect the normal channels.” I heard this assertion at every protest I attended with Refuse Fascism members in attendance.

At Friday night’s protest, a man who ran the megaphone said to the crowd, “You can’t rely on the elections that they are rigging.” After the announcement of no witnesses, he led the crowd in the chant, “Donald Trump is guilty, the whole system is guilty…Republicans are fascist collaborators…”

One woman said to the crowd, “We have to cast aside the illusion that the normal processes are going to take care of this… it was through the elections [with its] racist electoral college and gerrymandering, that Donald Trump came into power.”

RefuseFacism.org states, “We recognize that the Trump/Pence Regime is illegitimate because it is fascist, that fascism must be stopped before it is too late, and that this means that the masses of people in their millions must be led to rise up and drive it from power.” The protestors gave mixed messages, one minute claiming that the electoral system was corrupt and the next telling people to get off the couch and vote or volunteer to register voters.

Many of the protestors talked about a communist constitution written by Bob Avakian, leader of the Revolutionist Communist Party. This constitution would form a new nation called The New Socialist Republic in North America. Its legislators would be elected by popular vote, and a majority of votes in the nation’s single legislature could pass laws. Members of this legislature would serve as an executive council. Notice there are no separation of powers, something many of the protestors complained Trump was eviscerating.

America Is Racist

Another theme was America’s innate racism. A young African American woman said at Friday night’s protest, “Not that long ago 20,000 armed white supremacists marched in the capitol of the confederacy and Donald Trump… is on the path to being acquitted, what does this say about this house, a white house, built by enslaved people, what does this say about this country that parades around as a land of so called freedom and democracy? I want people to confront the truth: America was never great.”

Standing across the street from the Supreme Court, one Refuse Fascism protester yelled at March for Life participants. He said, “Hey, MAGA, when was America actually great — when they dropped bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, when there was slavery? America was never great.”

In an impeachment protest on Jan. 29, Taylor said, “We are living in a country… ruled right now by a fascist regime. Donald Trump and his regime are intensifying the horrors that this country was founded on, white supremacy [and] the genocidal extermination of the native peoples… There is a direct line between the Confederacy and the fascism [of] today. Donald Trump is… doing damage to the democratic and civil rights we’ve been told we have.”

The Avakian solution to racism in America is two-fold. All discrimination would be outlawed (if only it were that easy). Secondly, African-Americans would be given the opportunity to decide whether to form autonomous territories, something akin to Indian reservations. The same is true for Hispanics in the Southeast. Alternatively, the new government may consider giving Mexico back the land taken by the “Imperialist United States” in the Mexican American war.

Christianity Is Fascist

Several protestors mentioned the fascist nature of people like Pence and Betsy Devos, whom they claim take the Bible literally and thus advocate for teaching creationism and persecuting homosexuals. Many were very concerned that policies have been enacted by the Trump administration that have weakened the separation of church and state.

One young protestor named Christian spoke against pro-life policies: “This is 1984 sh-t, this is Handmaid’s Tale sh-t,” he said. A protestor with the mustache commented that the March for Life was really a march for female enslavement.

In Avakian’s constitution, freedom of religion is protected just like freedom of speech. There is also a strict separation of church and state, meaning there are to be no religious symbols or ceremonies within government. Further, religion would receive no special exceptions or exemptions under the law.

In this new communist paradise all education would be centrally administered by the state and mandatory. The educational system would be dedicated to teaching “the dialectical materialist understanding that all of reality consists of matter in motion… and nothing else.” The cultural and historical effects of religion may be discussed, but that is it.

Further, the state would “vigorously propagate” the “communist worldview” founded on the idea of historical materialism. Part of this involves promoting atheism, the socialist constitution says.

Lastly, the right to an abortion and to contraception would be constitutionally protected. There are no religious exemptions, so Christian doctors would either be forced to perform abortions against their conscience or to quit.

America’s Relation to the Rest of the World Is Fascist

“What part of this world does the military not have a base terrorizing people in Yemen, Syria, and Iran?” asked one young protestor. She argued that America is a system whose function is to cause terror to black people, immigrants, and women all over the world. She said she believed imperialism, capitalism, and fascism go hand in hand.

The protestors conveyed that America is an international bully and that countries around the world are its victims. I heard sympathy and even admiration for countries like Iran and Cuba. Protestors derided America for the wars in North Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq.

Further, the Trump administration and those in agreement with its immigration policies were criticized for believing in borders. Instead this group believes the nation state has outworn its welcome. “We can get to a world without borders…The bridge to that world is an overthrow of this system,” one protestor said.

The group’s pledge that they often say with firsts raised starts with, “In the name of humanity, we refuse to accept a fascist America.” One girl who spoke at the Jan. 29 rally said she considers herself more of a member of humanity than an American. As the Avakian constitution states, “The orientation and principles of this state, as embodied in this Constitution, are internationalist…” The Avakian constitution says its goal is the spread of communism throughout the world and thus domestic policies must keep that goal in mind.

Decrying Capitalism in Favor of Communism

Most of the leaders I heard speak lauded Avakian’s constitution. Of this constitution, one protestor said, “There is a constitution for a new socialist republic of North America… A blue-print of how we can rebuild society on a better foundation.”

The constitution states: “In order to bring this new socialist state into being, it would be necessary to thoroughly defeat, dismantle and abolish the capitalist-imperialist state of the USA; and this in turn would only become possible with the development of a profound and acute crisis in society and the emergence of a revolutionary people, in the millions and millions, who have the leadership of a revolutionary communist vanguard and are conscious of the need for revolutionary change and determined to fight for it.”

Chantel said not everyone in Refuse Fascism is a revolutionary or an Avakian supporter, although all three people who appeared to lead the protests called for mass non-violent revolution to overturn our system of government.

This Doesn’t Make a Lot of Sense

There are many contradictions in the ideology of Refuse fascism. The group simultaneously rejects fascism while embracing communism, a system of government that has often devolved into fascism. Although different ideologies, they often produce the same results: oppression, poverty, and ultimately massive loss of life.

Refuse Fascism claims to want an American Spring, but they talk little of how the Arab Spring turned out for many countries in the Middle East. They point to Hong Kong as an example of a political uprising they’d like to emulate, but don’t mention that the people of Hong Kong are fighting against a communist government, the same type of centrally controlled government their hero Avakian wants to implement.

They decry capitalism because it oppresses the poor, but don’t consider the millions capitalism has lifted out of poverty. They naively turn a blind eye to the horrors communism wrought in Russia, China, and Cambodia, convinced they can do it better. One minute they decry Trump as fascist because he calls people names, and the next they shout over a megaphone “F-ck Trump.”

Further they can’t point to a single piece of U.S. legislation that has actually curbed anyone’s freedom of speech, forced a single child to learn creationism, or prohibited any journalist, much less all journalists, from criticizing Trump as much as they please.

Groups like Refuse Fascism act like the entire country is simultaneously living under 1960s era Jim Crowe and an Atwood-esque dystopian nightmare. In reality, things in America are pretty good. For example, black unemployment is at an all-time low and the number of black women in the workplace has increased, reports CNN.

Facts like these are very inconvenient for those who want to claim the sky is falling. After all, who would agree to a communist revolution if capitalism is working out just fine?

Protestors Scream At Tunnel Outside Capitol During Impeachment Vote,"Anti-Trump protestors gathered outside the Capitol building Wednesday urging senators to convict President Donald Trump in the impeachment vote by screaming through a grate.

As the senators prepared to cast their votes on whether to remove the president from office, several attempted to reach the senators by screaming through an electrical conduit tunnel east of the Senate building.

One protestor even chanted through a megaphone aimed down the tunnel.

A capitol hill security officer at the site said there was no way anybody in the Senate building could actually hear the protestors through the tunnel, which is actually a security system that was installed post-9/11 to repel a possible airborne chemical attack.

According to Elliot Carter, who is the author of a digital history project documenting the underground environment of Capitol Hill, the tunnels that the protestors were screaming through is a three-story shaft that ventilates the Capitol Visitor’s Center and protects occupants from a terrorist attack in the form of a chemical or biological weapon.

“It’s 50 feet down, through sophisticated air filtration equipment, before finally opening into the Capitol at the lowest service level of the underground Senate expansion space,” Carter told The Federalist.

In other words, the protestors were screaming into a giant fan.

Carter said plans for the project had been in the works since the 1970s but was catalyzed to completion by the September 2001 terrorist attacks. The new security system contributed an additional $38.5 million to the final costs of the Capitol Visitor’s Center’s completion.

Approximately 100 people showed up Wednesday afternoon to protest as the Senate voted to acquit Trump of the charges lodged against him in two articles of impeachment passed by the House of Representatives over a month ago.

Protestors sported signs demanding Trump’s removal as the Senate voted 52-48 to acquit Trump of the charges for “abuse of power” and “obstruction of Congress.”

There was only one counter-protestor on site.

The impeachment proceedings were kicked off last fall following an anonymous whistleblower complain alleging Trump conspired with the Ukrainian president to interfere in the upcoming U.S. presidential election.

The complaint centered on a July 25th phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, where Trump allegedly tied nearly $400 million in withheld military aid to investigations into the Biden family in an apparent quid pro quo.

The contents of the call were soon declassified and released after reports of the complaint surfaced in the media. The transcript however, showed no such arrangement, though Democrats helped by a compliant media promoted a false narrative that Trump was maliciously abusing the power of the Oval Office for political gain.

After months of partisan proceedings in the House run by Democrats using Democratic rules, Democrat witnesses, and the Democratic calendar, the House voted to impeach Trump without any Republican support.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi then withheld the passed articles of impeachment from the Senate to delay the trial in an effort to extract concessions from Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky on how the process would play out in the upper chamber. Pelosi ultimately caved having any leverage on the issue and transmitted the articles without a single pledge from McConnell of Pelosi’s demands to call new witnesses.

On Wednesday, the Senate finally concluded the trial with a 52-48 vote on the “abuse of power” charge with Utah Sen. Mitt Romney being the only Republican voting with Democrats, and 53-47 along party lines on the “obstruction of Congress,” charge falling short of the two-thirds majority required for removal.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/05/protestors-scream-at-senators-through-grate-outside-the-capitol-during-impeachment-vote/,2020-02-05
Recovering The Religious Liberty Of The Founders,"The state of religious liberty in America is increasingly disconcerting, and two recent books bring a great deal of light to our current cultural moment.

Free to Believe: The Battle Over Religious Liberty in America is by Luke Goodrich, an attorney with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, where he represented and won significant Supreme Court victories for the Little Sisters of the Poor and Hobby Lobby. Did America Have a Christian Founding?: Separating Modern Myth from Historical Truth is by Mark David Hall, the Herbert Hoover distinguished professor of politics and faculty fellow in the William Penn Honors Program at George Fox University.

The answer Hall gives to his title-question is a resounding yes. And Goodrich demonstrates that despite many recent setbacks there is still a great deal of freedom in our land to believe.

The Founders’ Attitudes Toward Religion

Hall presents a refreshing overview of the faith of the founding fathers in a highly accessible format. Thoroughly refuting common claims that most of the founders were deists and heavily influenced by the Enlightenment, Hall systematically walks through the distinctively biblical and Christian commitments, principles, and references littered throughout the founding documents and structures.

Turning to the lives of perhaps the most unorthodox of the founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, Hall deflates the typical secular fanboy fervor handily by demonstrating that even Jefferson and Madison were not nearly as militant against Christianity or religion as modern secularists wish. Even as jumpy or perhaps as heretical as those two men were regarding official tenets of Christianity, they still involved themselves in calls to Christian prayer, support of Christian chaplains, and other general encouragements of Christian worship and education as elected officials.

In fact, this becomes something of a theme: The founding fathers, including Jefferson and Madison, repeatedly “recommend” attending Christian worship and issue invitations to join in prayers of supplication for wisdom and blessing and confession of sin to the Christian God.

Hall is at his best when exposing the ridiculous judicial path our courts have chosen over the last 75 years, relying heavily on unofficial correspondence from Jefferson and Madison, while studiously avoiding the many other men who played just as significant a role (and sometimes more) in the founding, who were clearly orthodox and robust in their Christian faith. Jefferson wasn’t even involved in drafting the First Amendment, and Hall proves that Madison’s influence is frequently exaggerated. The selective and preferential treatment of Jefferson and Madison with virtually no historical defense for doing so is really quite astonishing.

The courts have frequently relied on rather random lines of informal or unpublished communication from these two founders, while almost universally ignoring the input, involvement, and vast paper trail of many other members of the founding congresses and congressional committees, particularly in their interpretation of the First Amendment. Perhaps the most glaring omission is the work of Roger Sherman, the only founding father to have been involved in every single one of the most significant documents related to the birth of our nation.

Finally, Hall explains the distinction between disestablishment and encouraging or promoting Christian faith and practice in general. Most of the founding fathers were opposed to an established Christian church at the federal level, but those same founding fathers robustly encouraged the Christian faith formally and informally. The founders resisted the establishment of churches primarily out of concern that establishments tended to hurt churches and pastors rather than actually help them. Thus, even the determination to not have an established church was almost universally rooted in the concern for the health and integrity of churches.

An established church at the federal level would have also been incredibly divisive since nine of the 13 states had established churches when the Constitution was ratified – proving that the First Amendment did not say anything at all about states having established churches. Hall demonstrates that the deeper philosophical skepticism toward establishment was actually rooted in explicitly Christian premises, committed to the “sacred right of conscience” found at the heart of religious liberty. Moreover, Hall traces the Protestant distinctives of Sola Scriptura and the priesthood of all believers as playing just as heavily in the constitutional conventions, if not more, than John Locke’s social compact theory.

The Golden Rule

Whereas Mark David Hall’s work is primarily historical, only finally landing in the modern-day debates in his last chapter, Luke Goodrich is concerned to bring modern Christians up to speed on the current legal lay of the land. Goodrich shows his cards early in the book, distinguishing between three dominant views of Christian involvement in the public square.

He labels these viewpoints as “pilgrims” (America is a Christian nation in some sense), “martyrs” (Christians should not be particularly concerned with politics and should expect persecution), and “beginners” (people who care about religious freedom but are unsure what to think). Goodrich then offers what he calls “a better way,” a view he suggests is rooted in the nature of God and man, and therefore primarily seeks to protect religious freedom without government coercion.

Goodrich plunges into the center of the issues modern Christians face. He begins with an overview of scriptural themes and principles, while arguing that Christians are most persuasive to non-believers when they avail themselves of arguments drawn from natural law, history, constitutional law, and common sense.

What is particularly helpful about Goodrich’s book is how he weaves together political theory and practical questions with actual court cases he is very familiar with or has been personally involved in. It can be easy for enthusiastic bloggers to issue all manner of pronouncements about what they would do if they were king, a supreme court justice, governor, or the president for a day.

But reality is almost always more complicated. At the very least, if Christians are to speak intelligently into the public square and into public policy, they ought to do so with an accurate grasp of where we actually are.

Most conservative Christians are aware of Roe v. Wade, claiming the right to abortion, and the more recent Obergefell v. Hodges decision, claiming to legalize homosexual marriage, but these two appalling decisions did not happen in a vacuum. However, many other pieces of legislation and court decisions have affected the current state of religious liberty.

Goodrich insightfully educates his readers on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), reviews the impact and subsequent history of the Civil Rights Act, as well as the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, while walking through various court decisions, surrounding questions of hiring/firing practices, zoning laws, abortion, homosexuality, service industries (bakers/florists/photographers), and how Christians should view Islam politically.

Goodrich demonstrates the real and present threats to modern Christians, without drama or hysterics. He ultimately argues that what Christians should be working for is compromise on all of these issues, freedom to believe and educate and live by Christian principles according to the dictates of our consciences, while leaving secular America free to do whatever they want.

He writes, “My thesis is simple. The government shouldn’t promote religion in the public square. Neither should it scrub religion from the public square. Instead, it should treat religion as a natural part of the public square” (emphasis original). Elsewhere, he gives an example of what he means: “In short, in a society that is deeply divided over human sexuality, the abortion model does the best job of respecting both sides. Same-sex couples are free to live according to their views; religious people are free to live according to theirs. The government doesn’t force either side to violate their deeply held beliefs about human sexuality. Why would anyone object to this kind of compromise?”

Before offering an answer to Goodrich’s question, let me return to Hall just to demonstrate that he lands roughly in the same place as Goodrich on this question. After walking through examples from early American public life, which trended toward granting religious exemptions on oaths and military service, he cites modern examples of religious exemptions with Jehovah’s Witnesses, Muslim prisoners, a New Mexico cult, and Amish families.

He concludes, “The argument here is not that America’s founders would have protected each of these minorities in these cases. It is that protecting the religious liberty of all citizens whenever possible is the logical application of their commitment to religious liberty… The moment we start picking which convictions we choose to protect and which we do not, is the moment we abandon the founders’ commitment to defending ‘the sacred rights of conscience.’”

What Goodrich argues for throughout his book and what Hall concludes in his final chapter is what many would call a principled pluralism. It attempts to not grant any privilege to one religion or another or any religion at all, but it seeks to guard the principle of freedom of conscience.

And freedom of conscience inherently rejects all coercion. It cannot be a free conscience that is required to pay homage to any particular god or virtue or philosophy. A significant part of the argument is that whatever can be coerced from one perspective can be coerced from another. Don’t do to others what you wouldn’t have them do to you, golden rule and all that.

Acknowledging Protestant Particulars

In answer to Goodrich’s question about why anyone would object to the kind of compromise he suggests, my own answer keys off of Hall’s admission that what he is arguing for is not exactly what the founders would have argued for, but what he believes is the outworking of their logic.

Hall quotes from another of his books in passing, arguing that the founders understood that at least at the federal level, lack of an explicitly Christian oath meant their system could “permit ‘a Papist or Infidel’ or ‘pagan, deists, and Mahometans’” to participate in the American system, but Hall does not develop that claim in any detail. Following Hall’s scholarly lead, I would want to know which founding fathers granted that and what their thinking was.

Regardless, while much of what Hall and Goodrich offer us is extremely valuable, and Goodrich’s legal work has no doubt done tremendous good in slowing the hemorrhaging of religious liberty, I maintain that both fall short of the founding fathers’ vision. Put simply, the argument that Hall puts forth is so convincing that it undermines where he and Goodrich want to land.

Moreover, I specifically question what he says is the “logic” of the founders. Rather, the robust Protestantism that undergirded the principles of religious freedom and freedom of conscience are, as Hall himself even grants, present in the Constitution, even lacking a requirement for elected officials to affirm a Christian oath. The Constitution recognizes Sunday as a day of Christian sabbath by granting the president the day off from considering bills presented to him by Congress, and the Constitution somewhat elaborately dates the founding of our nation from the birth of “Our Lord.”

Far from being a principled pluralistic document, the Constitution itself was a principled Protestant document. Precisely because that is the case, the principles it embodied protected the freedom of conscience and God-given freedoms of every man, across the Christian denominational landscape, and even those of non-Christians and non-believers. The problem with where Hall and Goodrich land (and other conservative Christians like them) is that they want certain benefits that only a Protestant Christianity will grant but without acknowledging any explicit dependence on Protestant Christianity.

Protestant Christianity, while far from perfect, is the movement that most earnestly urged religious freedom on the world. From the Peace of Westphalia to the Elizabethan settlement to the American experiment, Protestantism – failures, flaws, and all – called for the freedom of conscience. But it did so in the name of Jesus, under the authority of Scripture, recognizing man’s fallen nature and propensity to tyranny and oppression.

While I happily grant that the category Goodrich calls “pilgrims” have sometimes made overwrought claims and overreacted to encroachments, Hall decisively proves that America did have a Christian founding, and an overwhelmingly Reformed and Protestant founding at that. While many practical and pressing questions remain, the path of the founding fathers seems wise.

An established church is indeed unhelpful, unpractical, and tends toward coercion. However, a return to openly acknowledging the Triune God in the public square, as well as encouraging and commending worship and prayer in His name is the only lasting moral foundation for a truly liberal order that protects all religious freedom.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/04/10/recovering-the-religious-liberty-of-the-founders/,2020-04-10
"Police Shut Down ReOpenNC Protesters, Claim It's 'Non-Essential Activity'","On Tuesday morning, the Raleigh Police Department shut down approximately 100 protesters with the libertarian group #ReOpenNC. The majority of protesters were demonstrating from their cars, abiding by North Carolina’s social distancing guidelines.

The group gathered to protest Gov. Roy Cooper’s executive order shutting down the state until further notice. While many governors have given constituents an end date to shelter-in-place orders, Cooper signed North Carolina’s order until he decides to rescind it.

“This Executive Order is effective immediately and shall remain in effect until rescinded,” it reads.

The #ReOpenNC protesters claim Cooper’s shelter-in-place order is an unconstitutional overreach that will kill small businesses. The group has a following of approximately 30,000 members and is compromised of many small business owners.

Ashley Smith, the co-founder of #ReOpenNC, told The Federalist she couldn’t sit there and watch small businesses and personal liberties be taken away by a prolonged shelter-in-place order.

“Our rights and our liberties and our lives are just being destroyed right before our very eyes,” Smith said. “None of us are going to stand up and do anything about it? No.”

Smith described the communal aspect of #ReOpenNC and shared stories about friends who had weddings cancelled, mothers dying alone, and one individual who watched a life-long partner die through a small window in a hospital door.

“It feels so personal now,” the mother of four said.

Smith said the group’s co-founders called the Wake Forest Sheriff’s Department and the Raleigh Police Department to ask for permission to protest. She said the group was given permission and told they did not need a permit.

According to Jonah Kaplan at ABC News, the protesters were met by the Raleigh Police Department along with the Wake Forest Sheriff’s prison transport. The majority of protesters demonstrated from their cars to abide by social distancing guidelines. The group honked their horns in unison every 15 minutes.

The Raleigh Police Department warned protesters who exited their cars and eventually those inside their cars. Monica Ussery, 51, was arrested and charged with violating Cooper’s executive order for walking through the parking lot.

Smith described the police garb as “just short of riot gear.”

The police issued three warnings before cars and people started to disperse.

When group members questioned what part of the executive order they weren’t abiding by, the Raleigh police said on Twitter that “protesting is a non-essential activity.”

https://twitter.com/raleighpolice/status/1250111779574894594

“I think [this] is absolutely ridiculous and I think the North Carolina State Constitution says otherwise,” Smith said.

Smith said there has been emotional and political gaslighting towards her efforts to mitigate the quarantine. She explained to The Federalist that her efforts are not to hinder those who are immunocompromised, but to allow companies and individuals to make choices for themselves. Smith also noted the national correlation between suicide rates and unemployment.

“We don’t need a nanny state,” Smith said. “This is what I’ve heard from our collective voice of almost 30,000 members… What they’re saying over and over again is, look I’ve been immunocompromised for years and no one’s ever had to come along and force me to do these things. I know how to protect myself.”

Facebook Isn't Colluding With States But It's Still Removing Protest Posts,"Experiencing a pandemic on the scale of the Wuhan coronavirus in the age of Big Tech is a journey into uncharted territory, making the industry’s often cozy relationship with the political class a recipe for new abuses of personal data and speech policing. Facebook didn’t provide much confidence in its ability to navigate these waters on Monday.

At first, the company seemed to be bragging about its work with state governments to remove posts promoting protests of lockdown guidelines. After state governments disputed that characterization, Facebook said it had only consulted the local officials for information on the scope of their guidelines.

On Monday evening, a Facebook company spokesperson clarified the platform’s approach to The Federalist. “Unless government prohibits the event during this time, we allow it to be organized on Facebook,” they said. “For this same reason, events that defy government’s guidance on social distancing aren’t allowed on Facebook.”

Speaking on background, the Facebook source added, “We review content about the protests against our policies and whether the protest calls for social distancing where that is required. We require protests to make calls for social distancing clear in their event in states where that is required for protests.”

“State officials can contact us to inform us on their guidance as it relates to social distancing in their state,” they continued. “We reached out to state officials to understand the scope of their orders, not about removing specific protests on Facebook.”

Several news outlets reported early Monday that a Facebook spokesperson sent a statement claiming the company removed posts that promoted quarantine protests from its website at the direction of state governments.

Here’s what ABC News reported: “A Facebook spokesperson says that the company has taken action to remove anti-quarantine events promoted on the website in California, Nebraska and New Jersey after consultation with state governments who said the events violate their respective state stay-at-home orders, ABC News’ Alexander Mallin reports.” (Emphasis added.)

Here’s what Politico reported: “The world’s largest social network has already removed protest messages in California, New Jersey and Nebraska from its site at the urging of state governments who say those events are prohibited by stay-at-home orders, a company spokesperson said.”

Politico’s original headline, captured by the Wayback Machine, was explicit: “Facebook shuts down anti-quarantine protests at states’ request.”

State officials disputed the assertion they “urg[ed]” Facebook to take down the posts. Facebook did not argue. To the contrary, Andy Stone, the Facebook spokesperson quoted in the original reports, tweeted “to clarify that Facebook reached out to state officials to understand the scope of their stay-at-home orders, not about removing any specific protest events from Facebook.”

Just want to clarify that Facebook reached out to state officials to understand the scope of their stay-at-home orders, not about removing any specific protest events from Facebook. — Andy Stone (@andymstone) April 20, 2020

As the day unfolded, officials from the governor’s offices in New Jersey and Nebraska confirmed they cooperated with Facebook’s request for information about their state’s guidelines but strongly denied asking for any posts to be removed. That comports with the clarification Facebook offered later on Monday.

So what happened? This could be a case of an innocuously misleading statement fueling confusion with unclear wording. It could be a case of Facebook deliberately misleading the public in order to provide some cover for a controversial decision. It could be a case of sloppy reporting.

The answer lies in Stone’s original statement to media, the full text of which The Federalist has requested from the company, but has not received by publication time. It seems unlikely that several outlets would contemporaneously run stories explicitly based on the same misinterpretation of Facebook’s statement. Even if that were the case, Facebook would almost certainly be eager to provide its original statement and shed the blame.

It’s reasonable to assume, then, that Facebook’s statement mislead the media about its conversations with state governments, grossly overstating the states’ involvement in their decision, perhaps to legitimize a controversial move. That assumption is supported by Stone’s retweet of a CNN reporter who said the company removed event posts “after consultation with state governments,” which would be a strange move if the post grossly misinterpreted his statement.

Of course, it’s good news that Facebook isn’t colluding with the government to determine the boundaries of acceptable speech on its platform. But Facebook either thought it was doing that, or wanted people to think it was—and neither of those possibilities is great.

In a softball interview with George Stephanopoulos on Monday’s edition of “Good Morning America,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was taking down posts about protests that qualified as “misinformation” if the content claimed “social distancing is not effective to help limit the spread of coronavirus.”

But protests of state guidelines are not necessarily predicated on the claim that social distancing is ineffective in limiting the spread of coronavirus. Protesters may believe social distancing is generally effective, but their state guidelines are overly restrictive, unconstitutional, or no longer worth the tragic economic costs. They are not necessarily arguments against the efficacy of social distancing. If you’re a tech company hoping to quell complaints from the corporate media and the left, however, such a generalization provides cover to remove problematic posts.

There are two problems to disentangle here. The first is that Facebook seemed to think colluding with state governments to remove posts promoting lockdown protests, which are reactions to the grave financial distress so many workers are now experiencing, was an action worth promoting.

The second is that Facebook is removing those posts, instead of allowing open debate within reasonable parameters, even if that debate involves arguments it finds distasteful. That’s how we sort fact from fiction, and good arguments from bad ones. Censorship, by the way, often fuels conspiracies to greater heights.

Misinformation is dangerous. There’s no way around that. Social media makes the problem worse. But Facebook is again demonstrating its tenuous ability to police speech fairly and helpfully.

Supreme Court’s Error Is Worse Than Michigan’s Rifle-Carrying Protestors,"It is for defense against tyranny that the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms and, as the late Jeff Cooper observed in The Art Of The Rifle, “a citizenry armed with rifles simply cannot be tyrannized.” Cooper wrote, “there are more good men than evil, and while the latter cannot be persuaded to the path of righteousness by propaganda, they can certainly be corrected by good men with rifles.” Cooper, a Marine who, as a civilian, developed the modern technique of defensive pistol shooting, knew the difference between a rifle and a handgun.

Not everyone does. On April 30th, among the hundreds who protested in Lansing against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s lockdown order related to the most recent virus from communist China, a few carried rifles. They did so prematurely. Whatever may be said about Whitmer’s order, it does not constitute tyranny, as indicated by the facts that people were able to protest freely, Whitmer’s order is being challenged in court, and an effort to recall Whitmer is underway.

Nor does Whitmer’s order threaten to render people defenseless against tyranny, as did General Gage’s effort of April 19, 1775, as do semi-automatic firearm bans imposed by Democrats in several states, as did the Canadian Liberal Party’s recent ban on 1,400 makes and models of firearms, and as the Supreme Court’s decision in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) may, for reasons explained herein.

The late baseball legend Yogi Berra once said “you can observe a lot by just watching.” Had the rifle-carriers remembered that wisdom, they would have noticed that the proverbial 99.9 percent of protestors—some of whom likely carried concealed handguns for self-defense as they would any other day—left their rifles at home.

Holding the solution inherent in the Second Amendment in reserve, the majority of protestors exercised rights protected by the U.S. constitution’s First Amendment and by the Michigan constitution’s analogous provision, “The people have the right peaceably to assemble, to consult for the common good, to instruct their representatives and to petition the government for redress of grievances.”

The majority of protestors understood intuitively what the Framers of our Bill of Rights did in part because of their familiarity with William Blackstone’s Commentaries On The Laws Of England, of which the section pertinent in this instance reads: “To vindicate (the “absolute” rights of personal security, personal liberty, and private property), when actually violated or attacked, the subjects of England are entitled, in the first place, to the regular administration and free course of justice in the courts of law; next, to the right of petitioning the king and parliament for redress of grievances; and, lastly, to the right of having and using arms for self-preservation and defence.”

Emphasis on the word “lastly.” The right to arms, protected by U.S. and Michigan constitutions, is the right that protects all other rights. However, it is to be exercised for that purpose as a last resort or in the most egregious of acute circumstances, not when there is no threat to life or serious threat to liberty, and certainly not when a lesser threat—such as a temporary lockdown order—can be dealt with through the normal political and legal processes.

Semi-Automatic Rifles Are Not ‘Dangerous And Unusual’

Though the few who carried rifles at the Lansing protest did so prematurely, they did not, as one TV talk show host claimed, threaten law enforcement officers or anyone else. An armed threat is illegal and would have resulted in an arrest, and no such arrest has been reported. The distinction between merely possessing a firearm and using it in a threatening manner should be obvious to everyone. However, in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) the Supreme Court ignored the distinction to justify banning one type of firearm, a mistake Democrats hope the Court will repeat when it hears a case challenging a ban on semi-automatics.

Heller correctly observed that the Second Amendment protects an entirely fundamental, individual right “to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation,” including “all instruments that constitute bearable arms,” and concluded, therefore, that the District’s ban on the possession of handguns was unconstitutional. However, as I explained here and here, the Court additionally opined, contradictorily and incorrectly, that the right to arms is limited to those that are “in common use” and, therefore, the federal law that prohibits the private possession of a fully-automatic firearm manufactured after May 19, 1986—an arguably uncommon type of firearm, in part because of that law—is not unconstitutional.

The Court arrived at that conclusion by mischaracterizing its decision in U.S. v. Miller (1939) and by claiming that the ban on fully-automatic firearms “is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of ‘dangerous and unusual weapons.’”

However, as America’s leading Second Amendment historian, attorney Stephen Halbrook, explained in “Going Armed With Dangerous And Unusual Weapons To The Terror Of The People: How The Common Law Distinguished The Peaceable Keeping And Bearing Of Arms,” weapons have not generally been considered “dangerous and unusual” in and of themselves, nor if they have been carried in a peaceable manner, but rather if they have been carried in a manner apt to terrify people. As an early example, Halbrook noted, “it was an offense under the (English) Statute of Northampton (1328) to go or ride armed in a manner that creates an affray or terror to the (King’s) subjects. It was not an offense simply to carry arms in a peaceable manner.”

Courts in this country have held essentially the same view. For example, in State v. Huntley (1843), the Supreme Court of North Carolina explained, “the carrying of a gun, per se, constitutes no offense. For any lawful purpose . . . the citizen is at perfect liberty to carry his gun. It is the wicked purpose, and the mischievous result, which essentially constitute the crime. He shall not carry about this or any other weapon of death to terrify and alarm, and in such manner as naturally will terrify and alarm a peaceful people.”

Cases challenging state bans on semi-automatic firearms have been appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, and Democrats working toward civilian disarmament hope to prevail in part by characterizing semi-automatics as “dangerous and unusual” even when they are kept and borne in a peaceful manner, and even though they are owned by millions of Americans.

In reviewing those bans, the Court should heed Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s recent suggestion that its errant rulings may warrant correction when they are “egregiously wrong” and have had “real-world effects on the citizenry.” Heller’s “dangerous and unusual” error surely fits that description.

Minnesota Protests Show Some Things Are More Important Than ‘Stopping The Spread’,"Over the past two months Americans have been ordered not attend mass gatherings for fear of spreading the Chinese virus. For the most part people have complied. Our ball fields, churches, bars and concert halls sit empty. When some have flaunted the rules as recently happened at a massive pool party in Missouri, they have been severely chastised. So how should politicians and the media handle protests throughout the country that break the large gathering rules?

For those who believe that reopening the country too fast will cause the virus to spike, this is a complicated situation. Pool parties are an easy call, the first Amendment protected right to protest the government is not, at least not this time. What we are faced with here is the need to balance competing legitimate concerns; the right to protest and the potential loss of life.

But here’s the thing. This has always been about balancing legitimate competing concerns. On the one hand, again, spread of the virus, on the other profound economic devastation and loss of life caused by the lockdown itself. But for two months arguing that a balance had to be struck got people called selfish grandma killers who only care about the stock market. It was made absolutely clear, the number one priority, the only priority was to save lives.

Then the protests started. You have to feel bad for progressives caught in this situation. In order to maintain their position that stopping the spread is paramount, they must tell black people with an incredibly good reason to be outraged in the killing of George Floyd that they may not avail themselves of traditional forms of political protest.

For the most part, of course, this has not happened. Few if any people are hurling abuse at the protestors and insisting they are literally killing people. This is despite warnings from health officials in Minnesota. So there is something specific about this protest that makes it different from protests to reopen the economy that were roundly condemned.

The difference of course is the racial dynamic, which is a progressive trump card when legitimate competing interests arise. There is no way under the rules of intersectionality that the black protestors can come under attack for spreading the virus. And this is a very, very important thing to note because it is the first time that it has happened.

Stopping the spread has been more important than every other “nonessential” gathering thus far, even in the face of joblessness, hunger, suicide, and depression. People who wanted to go to church were selfish, those who want to attend sporting events and weddings were selfish, even those who were engaged in the wrong kind of political protest were selfish, but not these protestors.

This is something to be thankful for. Finally there is an admission that some things really are more important than stopping the spread. It should open the door to a more nuanced conversation about the cost benefit analysis of social distancing and lock downs. The answer is now no longer, “just don’t have large gatherings,” it’s don’t have large gatherings unless it’s important.

But funerals are important, graduations are important, kids being in school and going to museums is important. What we are not hearing is why these protests, as opposed to anything else, draws little criticism from the media. This would be a really good discussion to have, but it is being ignored. Instead of arguing why the protests should occur despite the virus, which is true, the virus is basically just being ignored in the story.

That is a shame. But regardless, we now have a point on the map. We now have something we can point to and say, this is worth the potential spread of the virus, and the deaths that may come with it. There are things that matter more than listening to public health experts. It should not have taken us so long realize this, but at least we are here now.

Celebrities Bail Out Rioters In Virtueless Virtue Signaling,"Hollywood celebrities love to virtue signal, and even in a world gone mad, Hollywood remains no different.

After engaging in pointless passive progressivism for years featuring corporate wokesters slipping in the occasional lesbian kiss scene here and there to celebrate themselves as champions of cultural acceptance, Hollywood elites are now actively encouraging the destruction of the nation’s burning cities.

Last week, a series of prominent American movie stars declared they would be donating to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, a non-profit organizing cash bail payments for Minneapolis protestors arrested amid the carnage of the restless riots.

The fund has now drawn the support of the Sadfie brothers, a pair of movie critically-acclaimed movie directors whose work includes the production of the Uncut Gems in 2019.

Other Hollywood figures to pledge donations to the fund include Seth Rogan, Steve Carell, and Ben Schwartz among others.

On Saturday, Chrissy Teigen announced she would donate $100,000 to bail out locked up rioters after President Donald Trump said it was “MAGA Night.”

“In celebration of whatever the f*** maga night is, I am committed to donating $100,000 to the bail outs of protestors across the country,” Teigen wrote on Twitter, before following up with another tweet doubling the amount she planned to spend to $200,000.

Ooo they might need more money then. Make it $200,000 https://t.co/axuJnazJkU — chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) May 30, 2020

While these brave Hollywood celebrities might try to justify their donations made to violent protestors as taking a bold stand against racism from the comfort of their multi-million dollar mansions on Twitter, here’s what they are actually encouraging in the name of social justice, including the wide-spread destruction of minority-owned businesses:

Pictures: A Peaceful Protest Between Riots In D.C.,"WASHINGTON, D.C.—There were two sounds outside the White House on Sunday afternoon, the sound of a peaceful protest, and the sound of riot repair. Demonstrators chanted against the backdrop of buzzing drills.

At 6:31 a.m., the Washington Post’s popular weather blog predicted the day would be a 10/10. “Now this is what spring is all about,” said the Capital Weather Gang. In Washington, meteorologists are often the media’s most accurate forecasters.

And so it was, Sunday’s demonstration, part of the nation’s ongoing reaction to the sickening death of George Floyd, unfolded amid the anticipated “springtime bliss,” drawing thousands to H Street NW, the closest Secret Service would allow anyone to the White House. Officers congregated beyond the barricades in Lafayette Park and on Pennsylvania Avenue, prepared in case anyone tried to move in. That would come later.

In the daylight, demonstrators gathered calmly, carrying cardboard signs, toting children, and chanting “Black lives matter!” Volunteers passed out water and snacks. As the protest grew, a white man outfitted in black pants and black boots strategized with his friend—they wanted to make sure everyone had a mask. That wasn’t much of an issue, most people were covered, although masks were the only reminder a pandemic had kept the city shut down since March.

The crowd was packed as densely as the entrance to Nats Park five minutes before game time. Many of the city’s white young professionals mingled with black protestors, young and old. In Washington, black patients accounted for 47 percent of COVID diagnoses and 80 percent of deaths as of May 6. Social distancing was all but impossible in the thick of the protest.

Police were everywhere, and the officers were mostly minorities, as were the men tending to the broken glass and graffiti. Repairmen went about their work almost like extras in a movie, drilling and hammering in the background, an afterthought. The cops kept streets closed to traffic, talked amongst themselves, and chatted calmly when engaged by protesters, guarding blocks tagged with phrases like “F-ck cops” and people carrying signs like “Defund the police.”

One sign depicted Colin Kaepernick kneeling. “Ready to listen now?” it asked. Others said, “Am I Next?” “I Can’t Breathe,” “F-ck White Supremacy,” and “Eat The Rich.” Someone had spray painted “R.I.P. George Floyd” onto the entrance to Joe’s Stone Crab, a popular destination for D.C. powerbrokers, and “F-ck Cops” onto the exterior of Capital Hilton. A window at the Department of Veteran’s Affairs had been shattered.

The historic Decatur House, one block from the White House, entered “a new and meaningful chapter” in its history, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation and White House Historical Association. The structure functioned originally as slave quarters, and serves today as the Center for White House History. On Saturday night, vandals graffitied its exterior, writing, “F-ck the cops,” “George Floyd,” “You have blood on your hands,” “Capitalism is murder,” and, most prominently, “Why do we have to keep telling you black lives matter?” Protestors posed against the wall for pictures.

“The juxtaposition of history, place, and current events is poignant and powerful,” said the presidents of the National Trust and White House Historical Association in a statement, reflecting on the vandalism. Graffiti on the side of the Treasury building read, “I like my bacon crispy.”

What seemed like the calm after the storm turned out to be the calm before it. Springtime bliss followed day into night. Peace did not. Rioters repeated their looting and burning and smashing and tagging. After a night of wailing sirens, the sun rose on the month of June and on more beautiful weather, “another winner” of a day, as predicted by Capital Weather Gang. It’s like the city is stuck in a pattern of incongruity, beautiful weather and somber protests, a virus and dense crowds, peace and violence.

Do The Protestors Need To Be Quarantined?,"A week ago, or seven years ago in Chinese virus time, outrage struck much of America as partiers gathered in a giant pool in the Ozarks. Video of the hundreds of people frolicking, with seemingly no care about the disease produced no small amount of scolding, but also produced something else. The County of St. Louis Missouri called on attendees to quarantine for two weeks or get a Covid-19 test.

Over the past several days and nights, tens of thousands of Americans have gathered in violation of social distancing rules and prohibitions on mass gatherings to protest the brutal killing of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police. Few if any people are against the protesters, the peaceful ones anyway, and their message. But will the gatherings have potentially deadly public health costs?

Up until a few days ago it would have been obvious to many that these gatherings represent a threat that needed to be addressed. This is after all why we can’t go to baseball games, church, and Broadway shows even in masks. It is certainly true that combating police violence is a worthy cause, but as we have heard ad nauseam during the lockdown, the virus is a threat like no other and must be treated as such.

If the coronavirus is still such a threat to our public health and safety that restaurants in New York City cannot open even at limited capacity then don’t we need a public health response to these protests and riots? Shouldn’t the message be that we understand how important and morally right this fight for justice is, but that still doesn’t justify putting the vulnerable at risk by allowing the protesters to go without quarantine?

Furthermore, how will these incidents impact the contact tracing that we have been assured is the secret to a safe reopening of the economy? The idea was to keep everyone separated, get everyone tested, and then trace the contacts of people who test positive. A contact in this case is exposure to someone in close quarters for over 10 minutes. How does that work now? What happens when they say, “I was in a massive crowd of tens of thousands?”

Even if many protesters are unlikely to comply with quarantine, shouldn’t we be asking them to? If it saves one life, and all that? And don’t people who made the reasonable decision that the protests were worth the risks have a responsibility to understand the risk they created and help mitigate it?

There is one other possibility, but it is one that the progressive leadership in the cities under siege will be loath to admit. Maybe, as I called for back in May in the NY Post, the lockdown and self distancing regulations are not as important as they were made out to be and should end for everyone, not just protestors and looters.

The double standards in cities like New York have been glaring. Religious Jews continue to be hassled for breaking the rules while protestors get what amounts to a total pass. Small business owners are seeing their life’s work destroyed as looters reap billions in stolen merchandise. And yes, it’s unfair, but that isn’t really the point. The point is that we are either still engaged in a public health crisis or we aren’t. And if we aren’t, then open the cities, already.

What is now is obvious to all but our political leadership class is that the lockdown is over; the protests ended them. There is no justification for our cities to exempt huge swaths of people from what they claim are life saving shut down measures because they like the political statement being made. The virus doesn’t care about politics, remember?

If the harsh regulations on operating businesses and gathering in the cities are really still needed then obviously we quickly need a plan to address the possibility of a spike in cases from these large gatherings. If not, then let us all get back to our normal lives.

If no serious measures are taken to confront the danger of potential viral spread from the protests then Americans should simply stop obeying the lockdown and open their businesses. Here’s an idea. They can do so as a political protest. Because apparently political protests are perfectly fine.

Media Falsely Claimed Violent Riots Were Peaceful And That Tear Gas Was Used Against Rioters,"Following days of violent riots and looting in cities across the country, Washington, D.C., announced a 7 p.m. curfew on Monday night. About the same time, President Donald Trump addressed the nation from the Rose Garden. Afterward, he walked through Lafayette Park to St. John’s Episcopal Church, which rioters had set on fire the night before. Standing before the church sign, which reads “All are welcome,” President Trump, who previously said he’d be paying his respects to a very special place, held up a Bible.

The speech announcing the country would return to rule of law and protection of civil liberties, the walk through a park that the night before had been given over to rioters, and the visit to the vandalized historic church where every president has worshiped since James Madison, were reassuring to many in the country.

For the media, however, these actions were further proof that Orange Man Bad is literally the worst, restoring rule of law is criminal, and standing in front of a church holding a Bible is an assault on the American conscience. They focused on how the Park Police had cleared the area ahead of the city-wide curfew declared by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser.

Facts were no barrier to their narrative. They spun a tale of violent, jack-booted cops running rampant through the streets over innocent docile protesters, using tear gas to clear the area. It turns out none of that was true.

Every single major media outlet falsely reported that Park Police were unprovoked when they used “tear gas” to clear the area. If any of that were true, it might mark the first time in history that cops without gas masks launched tear gas in an area that the president of the United States easily walked through minutes later.

After thousands of false tweets, print stories, and broadcast stories to the contrary, local journalist Neal Augenstein of WTOP reported that a Park Police source said “tear gas was never used — instead smoke canisters were deployed, which don’t have an uncomfortable irritant in them.” Further, the source said the crowd was dispersed because of projectiles being thrown by the “peaceful protesters” at the Park Police and because “peaceful protesters” had climbed on top of a structure in Lafayette Park that had been burned the prior night.

Sgt. Eduardo Delgado, the public information officer for the Park Police, confirmed the agency did not use tear gas. And later this afternoon, United States Park Police acting Chief Gregory T. Monahan exploded the entire false narrative:

On Monday, June 1, the USPP worked with the United States Secret Service to have temporary fencing installed inside Lafayette Park. At approximately 6:33 pm, violent protestors on H Street NW began throwing projectiles including bricks, frozen water bottles and caustic liquids. The protestors also climbed onto a historic building at the north end of Lafayette Park that was destroyed by arson days prior. Intelligence had revealed calls for violence against the police, and officers found caches of glass bottles, baseball bats and metal poles hidden along the street.



To curtail the violence that was underway, the USPP, following established policy, issued three warnings over a loudspeaker to alert demonstrators on H Street to evacuate the area. Horse mounted patrol, Civil Disturbance Units and additional personnel were used to clear the area. As many of the protestors became more combative, continued to throw projectiles, and attempted to grab officers’ weapons, officers then employed the use of smoke canisters and pepper balls. No tear gas was used by USPP officers or other assisting law enforcement partners to close the area at Lafayette Park. Subsequently, the fence was installed.

Prior to getting the actual facts, nearly every major media outlet falsely reported that canisters of tear gas, not smoke canisters, were used against peaceful protesters. The false story spread internationally despite its lack of evidence. Here are just a few of the uncountable examples.

Reuters published a video it claimed showed U.S. Park Police using tear gas. The video did not show any such thing.

A Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter tweeted out an NPR piece headlined “Park Police Tear Gas Peaceful Protesters To Clear Way For Trump Church Photo-Op.”

PBS’s Yamiche Alcindor reported erroneously that she was “still processing that I saw peaceful protesters teargassed outside the White House so Pres Trump could walk to St. John’s Episcopal Church.”

The Washington Post ran an article falsely headlined, “Inside the push to tear-gas protesters ahead of a Trump photo op,” authored by Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, and Rebecca Tan. Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson claimed Tan “was tear-gassed in reporting this story.” Gender and family issues reporter Samantha Schmidt retweeted that claim, adding, “There were five of us Post reporters — all young women — near Lafayette Square when federal officers started spraying gas and rubber bullets.”

The New York Times falsely headlined its article, “Tear Gas Clears Path for Trump to Visit Church.” An accompanying video showing the result of smoke canisters was falsely headlined:

“His walk came after riot police and National Guard troops used tear gas and flash grenades to clear a path through a peaceful protest in a city park,” the New York Times falsely reported about both the use of tear gas and whether the protests were peaceful. They were not.

In response to Augenstein, Garrett Haake claimed, “Tear gas was definitely used, and park police can’t 🤷🏼‍♂️that.” Asked what made him sure about his claim, he cited his “experience. the burning sensation it caused in my lungs, & my retired marine security.”

Here is a video of the effects of actual tear gas used in training.

MSNBC falsely reported, “Trump Visits Church After Police Clear Protesters With Tear Gas.”

ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos reported the doubly false “Police use tear gas, push back peaceful protesters for Trump church visit.”

The Washington Post’s dramatic Philip Rucker falsely claimed in a tweet that “Military police fire tear gas at peaceful protesters to clear street in front of St. John’s.”

Peter Baker of the New York Times falsely reported on the security threats and how they were removed, saying, “police and troops have moved against peaceful protesters with tear gas and flash bangs.”

Here the New York Times falsely claimed the protesters were peaceful and that tear gas was used against them:

Brett LoGiurato, the senior editor of Wharton Press peddled the tear gas lie and instructed his political allies to censor the news:

Maggie Haberman of the New York Times also peddled the lies about tear gas and peaceful protesters:

NPR hit a trifecta by falsely reporting about tear gas, falsely reporting about peaceful protesting, and as a bonus downplaying the arson against the church:

Religion News Service’s Jack Jenkins got the story wrong.

The Daily Beast/CNN’s Jackie Kucinich also falsely reported about peaceful protests and tear gas. She wrote, “This was a peaceful protest. And they are using tear gas. In the United States. In front of the White House. They tear gassed peacefully protesting and shot rubber bullets at people so President Trump could walk across the park to St. Johns on television. Correction …he had protesters tear gassed to walk to St. Johns, hold up a Bible in front of the church, usher in advisors for the photo-op. And then … walk home.” Whatever the previous sentences of fact-free emoting are, they’re not journalism.

Jonathan Swan of Axios claimed an anonymous “senior White House official told Axios that when they saw the tear gas clearing the crowd for Trump to walk to the church with his entourage: ‘I’ve never been more ashamed. I’m really honestly disgusted. I’m sick to my stomach. And they’re all celebrating it. They’re very very proud of themselves.’” To state the obvious: this source seems extremely poorly informed and not worth granting anonymity to.

Former Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Fox News contributor Jonah Goldberg both fell for and used the false reporting as a means of critiquing former Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin for complimenting Trump’s visit to St. John’s. Former Obama ambassador Michael McFaul, who has repeatedly spread false stories related to the Russia collusion hoax, also fell for this story.

The entire narrative the media glommed onto in lockstep was that Trump was a monster who tear-gassed peaceful protesters to do something meaningless. None of that was true. But it took a day of reporting to get the truth out, long after the lie took hold.

At times it seems as if there is nothing that many in the media won’t lie about to accomplish their political goals.

"Source Says Only Smoke Canisters, Not Tear Gas, Used On Protestors Before Trump’s Arrival At Burned Church","President Trump’s visit to St. John’s Episcopal Church last night was met with heavy social media backlash after reports by many news outlets were publicized suggesting that peaceful protestors were forced from the area using tear gas. According to reporting by Neil Augenstein for WTOPnews, however, there were only smoke canisters.

“A source says tear gas was never used — instead smoke cannisters were deployed, which don’t have an uncomfortable irritant in them,” tweeted Augenstein. “And, the source says Park Police didn’t know President Trump would be walking across the park several minutes later.”

Augenstein says the source also suggested that the crowd began to grow rowdy even before the president’s arrival, which is why police used force.

“…the reason the crowd was disbursed with smoke cannisters [sic] is that at that moment, officers were being pelted with water bottles. Another factor was that protesters had climbed on top of the structure at the north end of Lafayette Square that had been burned the day before,” he continued in the Twitter thread.

Although he acknowledges the fact that tear gas could have been used on the protestors by groups other than the Park Police, Augenstein points out the fact that the media continued to perpetuate and spread a narrative about tear gas that may not have been entirely true.

“In theory it’s possible another agency used tear gas, in addition to Park Police using smoke cannisters [sic], but my source was on the scene, got a dose of smoke, but didn’t feel the irritants of tear gas. Clearly, the phrase “tear gas” has been used widely in the reporting…,” Augenstein states.

According to WTOP, the use of force against DC protestors was not limited to the area Trump visited, but was widely enforced across the city.

“Police used smoke canisters, rubber bullets and low-flying helicopters to break up the marchers as the city imposed a curfew to tamp down any potential violence and vandalism,” said an article published early Tuesday morning.

Tucker Carlson: This Is How Nations Collapse,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson delivered a 30 minute address Monday night, documenting the terror and destruction across the the country, and calling out both the Left and the Right for their their lack of leadership. Watch Carlson’s monologue here, or read the transcript below.

Watch the latest video at foxnews.com

“The nation went up in flames this weekend. No one in charge stood up to save America. Our leaders dithered. They cowered. They openly sided with the destroyers. In many cases, they egged them on.

Later, they will deny doing any of this. They are denying it now. But you know the truth because you saw it happen.

This is how nations collapse. When no one in authority keeps the order, and when someone in our professional class encourage violence, American citizens are forced to defend themselves. They have no choice. No one else is going to defend them — they know that now.

It’s possible that more people will be hurt in coming days — that would be a tragedy. But in an environment like this, more violence could very well lead to a cascade of new tragedies, to something far bigger and more destructive than anything we have seen so far.

So, this isn’t over. It might simply be the beginning. We pray it isn’t.

It’s hard to think clearly about anything that’s going on right now. The chaos, the destruction, the relentless lying from above — it’s all too much. Americans are bewildered, and they are afraid. But most of all, they are filled with rage, angrier than they have ever been.

The worst people in our society have taken control. They did nothing to build this country. Now, they are tearing it down. They are rushing us toward mass suicide.

So, how do we respond? We must protect ourselves and our families. Once again, we have no choice, but to do that. But we cannot allow ourselves to become like they are.

We are not animals, we are Americans. In the face of such indecency, we must resolve to be decent. We believe this country has a future. We intend for our children to live and thrive here. That is what we are defending.

All our leaders do is set us against each other. They stage a never-ending national cockfight for their profit and amusement.

But we’re not going to play along. We will love our neighbors relentlessly in spite of all of it, not because they look like us or share our political views. But we love them because they are human beings, and they are Americans. Those are the bonds that tie us together — the bonds our leaders seek to destroy. We can’t let them.

We should start by being unsparingly honest about what is happening right now. Truth is our defense, and it’s our country’s last hope.

We plan to use this hour to create a record of this moment right now, to show you what’s really going on in your country. We feel an obligation to do that before the facts are spun into propaganda by the liars or the images are pulled off the internet forever, as many of them inevitably will be.

We’re going to begin with where my family lives and has lived for 35 years, in the northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C. This is called Mac Market. It’s on MacArthur Boulevard, which is named after General MacArthur during the war. It’s our neighborhood store; it’s walking distance from my house.

People meet there every morning for coffee. Kids come after school for candy. It’s as close to a community gathering spot as we have.

The market is run by the Kim family. The Kims are immigrants from Korea. They are revered in our neighborhood for their decency and their hard work. When they lost their son several years ago, the neighbors grieved for them.

The Kims are not political. They’ve never hurt anyone. They only make things better. But last night, the mob came for their store. At 1:00 a.m. Monday morning, Mr. Kim was kneeling alone on the sidewalk trying to salvage what he has spent his life building.

Scenes like this played out in hundreds of neighborhoods across this country, maybe yours.

Here are a few. In Columbia, S.C., a man called the police when things began to fall apart. Rioters saw him call. They surrounded that man, and they beat him. Onlookers laughed as he was pummeled.

In Rochester, N.Y., a group of eight men smashed the windows of a jewelry store. The couple who lived above the shop emerged to confront them. Both of them were viciously beaten with a ladder and a two-by-four.

In Dallas, a man armed with what appeared to be a sword did his best to defend a business from looters. The mob bashed him in the head with a rock and a skateboard. It’s hard to watch.

In San Jose, riders with crowbar stormed the highway and attacked vehicles, trying to pull drivers from their cars. In Birmingham, Ala., a local reporter called Stephen Quinn was beaten, and then he was robbed on live television as he tried to cover the looting.

In Portland, Ore., a man was beaten apparently for daring to carry an American flag in public. He never released the flag, by the way.

How many of these people died? How many were murdered by the rioters? We don’t know yet. At the least, some are likely disabled for life. They were beaten that badly.

And then there was the mass stealing. It seemed to be everywhere over the weekend.

In Buckhead, an upscale part of Atlanta, rioters stole a Tesla from a dealership and drove it through an indoor mall just to underscore how completely out of control things were. In Portland, Oregon, mobs looted Louis Vuitton, Apple and Chase Bank among many others. They often set fires as they left. In Chicago, protesters fought systemic racism by running through a Nike store stealing shoes.

And in Washington, D.C., a federal city surrounded by military bases and protected at all times by the single highest concentration of law enforcement in the world, criminals operated with apparent impunity in the streets. They looted Georgetown. They smashed the windows in federal buildings. They desecrated virtually every war memorial in the city a week after Memorial Day.

And then, as you likely know, Sunday night they set fire to St. John’s Episcopal Church, a 200-year-old building that has welcomed every American president since James Madison. It is right across the street from the White House.

For people stuck inside anywhere during this insanity — the sick, the elderly, the powerless — the experience was terrifying. Listen to this woman from Minneapolis.

Reporter: How was last night?

Unidentified woman: Scary. They went straight to Office Max, the Dollar Store and every store over here that I go to. I have nowhere to go now. I have no way to get there because the buses aren’t running.

So, that’s what’s happening in America right now. We didn’t play all of the tape we have. There’s a lot of it. Some of the tape is too shocking, and honestly, it’s too incendiary. We understand that television is an emotional medium, and we don’t want to make things worse. We’re not going to, but you get the point.

The point is, this is a national emergency. It’s a profound national emergency. But you would never know that from listening to our elected leaders. Almost all of them pretend this is not really happening or if it is happening, it is just part of America’s long tradition of vigorous political discourse.

Politicians on both sides tell us that this is all about the death of a man in police custody in Minneapolis last week. The people burning down our country are “protesters”. They’re engaged in a legitimate “protest.”

Okay, what exactly are those protesters’ demands? What are they asking for? If Congress agreed to enact their program, what would the program be?

Not a single person even hints the answer because there is not an answer. No one has bothered to pull the guys beating up old ladies on the street or looting Gucci, but you’ve got to wonder how many of them have ever even heard of George Floyd. And if they have heard of him, what difference would it make? Violence and looting are not forms of political expression.

If you were killed tomorrow, how many buildings would you want burned to the ground in your memory? How many old women smashed in the face on the street in your name? None, we hope, because you’re not a vicious psychopath, like the people you’ve just watched.

In fact, what we’re watching is not a political protest. It’s the opposite of a political protest. It is an attack on the idea of politics. The rioters you have seen are trying to topple our political system.

That system is how we resolve our differences without using violence. But these people want a new system, one that is governed by force. Do what we say or we will hurt you.

You know this. You can see it for yourself on television; you have. But our leaders continue to lie. They tell us that’s not true. This isn’t happening. It’s just a protest.

Some Democrats have openly embraced what is happening. Really they don’t have much of a choice. These are their voters cleaning out the Rolex store. These riots effectively are the largest Joe Biden for President rally on record.

In gratitude for that, more than a dozen Joe Biden for President campaign staffers donated money to the rioters in Minneapolis, and then they bragged about it on Twitter.

No Democratic leader can directly criticize what is happening right now. And in fact, some have joined in. Over the weekend, the Democratic Party of Fairfax, Virginia, which is an important Democratic organization, released the following statement on Twitter: “Riots are an integral part of this country’s march towards progress.”

Progress. Burning buildings, teargas, dead bodies, the screaming injured, criminal anarchy — to the Democratic Party of Fairfax, that is called progress.

Celebrity after celebrity has weighed in to agree on social media. From his fortified compound, basketball star LeBron James has used his accounts to encourage more rioting. Bernie Sanders surrogate Shaun King has done the same. So has Black Lives Matter leader, DeRay Mckesson.

Colin Kaepernick openly calls for violence. Here’s a quote: “The cries for peace will rain down and when they do, they will land on deaf ears,” he says approvingly.

Imagine shouting fire in a crowded theater, a theater with 325 million people in it called our country. That’s what they’ve been doing and have been doing for days.

When the violence began, what we needed more than anything was clarity in the middle of this. It’s hard to see when the tear gas starts. Someone in America needed to tell the truth to the country. Instead, almost all of our so-called conservative leaders joined the left’s chorus, as if on cue.

On Friday, as American cities were being destroyed by mobs, the vice president United States refused to say anything specific about the riots we were watching on television. Instead, Mike Pence scolded America for its racism.

Carly Fiorina, once a leading Republican presidential candidate tweeted that — and we’re quoting, “It’s white America that now must see the truth, speak the truth and act on the truth.”

Meanwhile, Kay Coles James, who is the president of the Heritage Foundation — that’s the largest conservative think tank in the country. You may have sent them money, hopefully for the last time. Kay Coles James wrote a long scream denouncing America as an irredeemably racist nation: “How many times will protests have to occur?”

Got that? “Have to occur.” Like the rest of us caused this by our sinfulness.

The message from our leaders on the right, as on the left, was unambiguous: Don’t complain. You deserve what’s happening to you.

No one jumped in more forcefully or seemed angrier in America than former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. “Tonight I turned on the news and I am heartbroken,” Haley wrote. “It’s important to understand that the death of George Ford was personal and painful for many. In order to heal, it needs to be personal and painful for everyone.”

But wait a second, you may be wondering, how am I “personally responsible” for the behavior of a Minneapolis police officer? I’ve never even been to Minneapolis, you may think to yourself. And why is some politician telling me I’m required to be upset about it?

Those are all good questions. Nikki Haley did not answer those questions explaining. It is not her strong suit — that would require thinking.

What Nikki Haley does best is moral blackmail. During the 2016 campaign, she compared Donald Trump to the racist mass murderer, Dylann Roof. How is Donald Trump similar to a serial killer? Nikki Haley never explained that. She wasn’t trying to educate anyone.

Her only goal was political advantage. Nikki Haley is exceptionally good at getting what she wants. She is happy to denounce you as a racist in order to get it. She just did.

In this case, Nikki Haley’s wish came true. The riots were indeed “personal and painful” for everyone. And then the pain kept increasing. Two days after she wrote that, dozens of American cities had been thoroughly trashed, some destroyed.

A country already on the brink of recession suddenly faced economic collapse. An already fearful population locked down for months because of the coronavirus had been thoroughly and completely terrorized.

Mission accomplished. Let’s hope Nikki Haley is pleased. We’ve now atoned.

How did the Trump administration respond to the horrors going on around us? Well, Sunday morning, the country’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, did a live interview from the White House lawn. Here’s how it began:

Robert O’Brien, U.S. National Security Adviser: First thing I want to say, on behalf of the president –he said this to the family — but our hearts and prayers are going out to the Floyd family. We mourn with them and we grieve with them and what happened there was horrific and I can’t even imagine what that poor family is going through as his videos are played over and over again. That should have never happened in America and it’s a tragic thing.

The president said that from the start, and we’re with the family and as the President said, we’re with the peaceful protesters.

“We’re with the peaceful protesters,” O’Brien announced.

Really? Can you be more specific about that? Who are you talking about exactly? Is it the people spitting foam as they scream, “F the police”? Is it the one standing next to the arsonist doing nothing as they set fire to buildings? Is it the kids laughing as they film the looting and the beatings on their iPhones?

Maybe it’s the famous people in L.A. who are raising money online to support the rioters? They’re all just peaceful protesters. Yes, we support that. It’s who we are.

What about the president? Where is he during all of this?

Well, on Friday night, after the show, Leland Vitter and a cameraman headed to Lafayette Square in Washington to cover what was happening outside the White House. Here’s what happened next.

Reporter: A Fox News reporter is getting chased out by these — by the George Floyd protesters here in front of — at Lafayette Park.

Look, there’s water being thrown on the reporter here. This is just — they took his mic. The just threw the mic at the reporter here. As you see guys, things are spiraling here quick at the protest.

That was in Lafayette Square in the center of our capital city. The tape raised a troubling question: If you can’t keep a Fox News correspondent from getting attacked directly across the street from your house, how can you protect my family? How are you going to protect the country? How hard are you trying?

On Twitter the next morning, the president reassured America that he and his family were just fine. The federally funded bodyguards had kept them safe. He did not mention protecting the rest of the nation, much of which was then on fire. He seemed aware only of himself.

For people who like Donald Trump, who voted for Donald Trump, who support his policies, who have defended him for years and years against the most absurd kinds of slander, this was a distressing moment.

The first requirement of leadership is that you watch over the people in your care. That’s what soldiers want from their officers. It’s what families need from their fathers. It’s what voters demand from their presidents.

People will put up with almost anything if you do that. You can regularly say embarrassing things on television. You can hire Omarosa to work at the White House. All of that will be forgiven if you protect your people.

But if you do not protect them — or worse than that, if you seem like you can’t be bothered to protect them — then you’re done. It’s over. People will not forgive weakness. That’s the one thing, by the way, that is not a partisan point. It is human nature.

Nero is the only Roman emperor whose name most people still remember. Why? Because he abandoned his nation in a time of crisis. And 2,000 years later, we still don’t forgive him.

Donald Trump’s response to these riots, which is ongoing, is the singular test of his presidency. About an hour ago, the president announced that he’s going to marshal all available forces — military and civilian — to stop these riots.

President Donald Trump: If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.

Good for him.

Immediately after that address, the president walked over to St. John’s, which, we just told you, was burning fewer than 24 hours ago, and that provided a powerful symbolic gesture. It was a declaration that this country — our national symbols, our oldest institutions — will not be desecrated and defeated by nihilistic destruction. We fervently hope this all works.

What Americans want most right now is an end to this chaos. They want their cities to be saved. They want this to stop immediately. If the commander-in-chief cannot stop it, he will lose in November. The left will blame him for the atrocities they encouraged, and some voters will agree.

Donald Trump is the president. Presidents save countries. That’s their job. That’s why we hire them. It’s that simple.

Some key advisers around the president don’t seem to understand this or the gravity of the moment. No matter what happens, they’ll tell you, our voters aren’t going anywhere. The trailer parks are rock solid. What choice do they have? They’ve got to vote for us.

Jared Kushner, for one, has made that point out loud. No one has more contempt for Donald Trump’s voters than Jared Kushner does, and no one expresses it more frequently.

In 2016, Donald Trump ran as a law and order candidate because he meant it, and his views remain fundamentally unchanged today. But the president’s famously sharp instincts, the ones that won him the presidency almost four years ago, have been since subverted at every level by Jared Kushner. This is true on immigration, on foreign policy, and especially on law enforcement.

As crime in this country continues to rise, Jared Kushner has led a highly aggressive effort to let more criminals out of prison and back on to the streets. This is reckless. At this moment in time, it is insane. It continues to happen.

The president seems to sense this. At times he seems aware he is being led in the wrong direction. He often derides Kushner as a liberal and that’s correct, Kushner is. But Kushner has convinced the president that throwing open the prisons is the key to winning African-American votes in the fall and that those votes are essential to his reelection.

Several times over the past few days, the president has signaled that he would very much like to crack down on rioters — that is his instinct. If you’ve watched him, you’ll believe it. But every time he has been talked out of it by Jared Kushner and by aides that Kushner has hired and controls.

Kushner’s assumption, apparently, is that African-American voters like looting. That is wrong. Normal Americans of all colors hate looting, obviously. Why wouldn’t they hate looting? They are decent people.

So one of the lessons of all that we have seen and we’ve seen so much over the past five days is America is going to change because of this — that is certain. What can we learn from it? What should we demand going forward?

The first thing to know is that we can no longer accept race-baiting from our leaders. Never. That has become so common now that we barely notice it. But it is dividing and destroying this country. We should make them stop.

On Sunday, for example, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle tweeted this: “I want to acknowledge that much of the violence and destruction both here in Seattle and across the country has been instigated and perpetrated by white men.”

Is that factually true? Who knows? Who cares? The skin color of criminals is totally irrelevant to how we prosecute them for the crimes they commit. It must be irrelevant. Otherwise, we’re committing the bigotry we claim to abhor.

Yet everywhere on television and social media, prominent people are now talking exactly like this. Not just a few crackpots — thousands of people, well-known people. They are amplifying race hatred at exactly the moment that we need at least at the moment when it’s the most dangerous.

This is Art Acevedo. Acevedo with the police chief of Houston. Houston is the fourth biggest city in this country.

Acevedo’s job, his sworn duty, is to enforce the law fairly and evenly regardless of the ethnicity of the suspect. Watch this and tell us if you think he is capable of doing that. Do you think he’s even interested?

Art Acevedo, chief of the Houston Police department: People for — as an immigrant, we are raised like this. But you know what? We built this country … We have got news for them. We ain’t going nowhere. We ain’t going nowhere. I think the ship has sailed.

So if you’ve got hate in your heart for people of color, get over it, because this city is a minority-majority city.

“My people.” If a police chief of any color — any color — said that, we would attack him instantly, and we would mean it. It is wrong.

When you run a law enforcement agency, you don’t get to consider “my people” much less claim your people deserve some kind of special consideration because they “built this country.” No. Your obligation is not to consider your people, but all people and consider them equally. Period.

Art Acevedo is not even trying to do that. Imagine being arrested by this creep. Think you’d get a fair shake?

There’s almost nothing that hurts America more than this. If you are worried about the rise of extremism here — and honestly, you should be worried — this kind of insanity is absolutely certain to cause it.

And let’s be clear, when we say extremism, we’re not talking about unconventional views that get you bounced off Twitter or scolded by the corporate HR department. We mean actual extremism where people espouse violence against other people, where large groups come to believe their racial identity is the most important thing about them.

Now, at this moment, no matter what they’re telling you, no matter what they claim for political advantage, there’s not a huge amount of that in this country, thank God. Most people still think of themselves as Americans and want to. But if the left keeps talking like this, there definitely will be and very soon. And you don’t want to live here when that happens. We should demand they stop immediately.

Enforcing the law is not white supremacy. Insisting that everyone in the country follow the same rules is not racism. In fact, it’s the answer to racism. It is equality — equality under the law. It is the one thing we must defend, and if we don’t, it’s over. Things fall apart.

Weakness invites aggression. That is true in nature and it’s every bit as true in human society. Our leaders are weak. Predators know it. That’s why this is happening.

If you let people spray paint obscenities in City Hall, pretty soon they are overturning cop cars. If you put up with that, they’ll come right to the front door of the police precinct, and they will burn it down.

The next thing you know, they are beating people to death in shopping malls. And then what? What happens the next time the mob doesn’t like something? What will the mob demand next?

Let’s hope we never find out because we are close.”

Adapted from Tucker Carlson’s monologue from “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on June 1, 2020.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/02/tucker-carlson-this-is-how-nations-collapse/,2020-06-02
"After Falsely Claiming Tear Gas Use, Media Now Trying To Pretend Tear Gas And Pepper Spray Are Identical","After the media reported that Park Police deployed tear gas, an aerosolized version of the synthetic compound 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile also referred to as “CS gas,” to disperse protesters in front of the White House, Park Police explicitly denied the charge:

To curtail the violence that was underway, the USPP, following established policy, issued three warnings over a loudspeaker to alert demonstrators on H Street to evacuate the area. Horse mounted patrol, Civil Disturbance Units and additional personnel were used to clear the area. As many of the protestors became more combative, continued to throw projectiles, and attempted to grab officers’ weapons, officers then employed the use of smoke canisters and pepper balls. No tear gas was used by USPP officers or other assisting law enforcement partners to close the area at Lafayette Park. Subsequently, the fence was installed.

So it was smoke canisters, not tear gas. And pepper balls explained the irritating effect that some protesters reported.

This directly contradicted thousands of tweets, print articles, and broadcast stories. President Donald Trump lambasted the media, highlighting a story this writer published yesterday. That article has some of the headlines from prominent media that falsely claimed “tear gas” was used against “peaceful” protesters.

His campaign requested corrections for the rampant publishing of false news. The media believe admitting error is a display of weakness, a belief Trump shares, so they didn’t admit the error or correct their stories. Instead, they claimed that they were essentially correct. Clinging to a CDC information sheet that ambiguously said “sometimes” (but not other times) a variety of things are called “tear gas,” they defiantly announced they would refuse to correct their erroneous stories.

In response to New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman saying tear gas and pepper spray are kind of the same thing, if looked at in a particular way, one Twitter user responded with screen shots of four New York Times headlines, adding “48 hours ago the @nytimes seemed to think they were different enough to mention separately in the headline…:”

It wasn’t just the New York Times. Until the precise moment that Trump wanted a correction, media had always separated tear gas from pepper spray.

Of the hundreds of Washington Post stories that mention pepper spray separately from tear gas, some were published in recent days. Samantha Schmidt, Rebecca Tan, Rachel Chason and Paul Schwartzman separated the riot control measures on May 31 as “law enforcement officers deployed tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets to move the crowd back…” Similarly, a May 31 video from the Post is headlined, “In U.S. cities, police use pepper spray, stun guns and tear gas on protesters.” There are hundreds of other examples.

Media told people that they could “see” the tear gas canisters with their own eyes, but now they must concede that those were in fact smoke canisters. So then they said that the irritant from pepper balls are the same thing as tear gas.

If tear gas and pepper spray are identical and interchangeable, as media now assert, then why were they so hell-bent on exclusively using the term “tear gas”? The answer is obvious. Pepper spray is a common device regularly carried by civilians, often women, to protect themselves from potential predators. You can easily buy it at the store or online. “Tear gas” has a far more incendiary connotation, as it is rarely used by anyone other than authorized law enforcement. The two chemicals are wildly different, though, which is why you will never see law enforcement use tear gas without gas masks because of its debilitating effects on the lungs. Tear gas uses an aerosolized synthetic compound to irritate the lungs and make breathing difficult. Pepper spray and pepper balls, on the other hand, are made from capsicum, the oil that gives vegetable peppers their distinctive flavor.

The effects of pepper spray can be quickly mitigated by milk, which neutralizes the oils that irritate the eyes. Milk has no effect on tear gas. Footage of what happened in Lafayette Park, to eyes trained to see facts rather than narratives, made clear that tear gas was never used. Police wore no masks. A protester was seen pouring milk on his face. Law enforcement walked through the smoke and fog, which media claimed was tear gas, with no ill effects whatsoever.

Even just hours ago the media were admitting the specific difference between tear gas and pepper balls as it relates to Monday’s protest. MSNBC reporter Garrett Haake, who led the charge regarding tear gas, was insistent that the police had used “tear gas (CS)” and not just “pepper balls and less lethal projectiles.” He was specifically asked about why he was so sure about tear gas, and not just pepper balls, and he said it was because of his experience. See here:

Of course both tear gas and pepper spray can and are used by police to disperse rioters, both can be abused by police against innocent civilians, and both are painful. Still, the media knew the distinction was important enough yesterday. Now they claim it’s no matter at all.

Why care about getting this particular fact correct? It’s worth taking a step back and reviewing the larger situation of how small errors become uncontrollably false political narratives.

On Monday night, protesters in front of White House grounds were cleared just before a 7 p.m. curfew. Some protesters in the area had torched a building on White House grounds and a nearby historic church the night prior.

The Park Police say that they removed the protesters because they had found caches of weapons on the street and that some protesters were “violent” and had begun throwing “bricks, frozen water bottles and caustic liquids,” and climbing a building on White House grounds that had previously been destroyed by arson. Attorney General Bill Barr reportedly authorized the removal so a temporary security fence that had begun to be installed that day could be completed.

As the area was being cleared, President Donald Trump delivered remarks from the Rose Garden about the need for rule of law over the chaos of violent riots. After, he walked through the cleared area to St. John’s Church, which had been set on fire by protesters hours earlier, and held up a Bible.

The power of the imagery being impossible to ignore, almost immediately the media began reading off of shared talking points: Park Police had used “tear gas,” an aerosolized version of the synthetic compound 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile also referred to as “CS gas,” to disperse uniformly peaceful protesters for nothing more than a grotesque photo op. We live in a time of information warfare, where the media are more brazenly advocating for political positions against millions of Americans including the President himself.

The media wanted to hammer their political talking point home until it replaced the image of President Trump walking through an area that the night before had been given over to lawless mobs. So repeat they did: Tear gas, peaceful, photo op. Tear gas, peaceful, photo op. Tear gas, peaceful, photo op.

They would repeat it as much as necessary to replace the images of the buildings on fire, the rampant looting, the physical assaults — and a political leader walking through these areas to say the mobs would not triumph over Americans and rule of law.

There were elements of truth hidden among the deception. It was of course a “photo op,” in the same way that nearly all public things politicians do are photo ops. It is a common trope, in fact, for politicians to ride subways after accidents, or fly over areas devastated by hurricanes, or walk through areas beset by violence. Trump didn’t invent this common political maneuver and it’s not usually considered bad for politicians to not just speak but show what they intend to convey.

And there were of course peaceful protesters, even if everyone knows that the peaceful protests have been beset by horrific violence across much of the country. That some police were injured on Monday night in Lafayette Park from bricks and rocks being thrown doesn’t mean everyone was throwing bricks and rocks at police or planning more violent attacks with caches of weapons police said they found on the street. That some people were grabbing for their weapons, according to the Park Police, doesn’t mean everyone was threatening the peace that way.

Only a media that willfully downplayed the violence across American cities, that has led to death, injuries, widespread property destruction, fires, looting, and more, would claim that the police sound crazy to be discussing the violence they faced on Monday because some other group of people on the street were peaceful.

And even with the completely false claim of tear gas being used, it wasn’t invented out of whole cloth. Smoke canisters were clearly deployed, and pepper balls were also used. Pepper balls can be quite irritating.

But “public display” doesn’t sound as nefarious and dismissive as “photo op” does. “Partially violent” doesn’t sound as sympathetic as “peaceful” does. And “irritant” doesn’t pack the powerful punch that “tear gas” does.

The media chose political messaging over factual reporting. And it’s not nitpicking to demand precision on these things from an industry that claims to report accurately. Each falsehood by the media was used in a direction that was hostile to those Americans who don’t share the dominant media position that America is irredeemably evil.

For people who are adamant that the violent riot portion of protests be downplayed or ignored, even pepper balls are an egregious violation. But for those who see how millions of mistruths pile upon each other to create false narratives that always go in the same political direction, facts still matter and are worth fighting for.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/03/after-falsely-claiming-tear-gas-use-media-now-trying-to-pretend-tear-gas-and-pepper-spray-are-identical/,2020-06-03
Mass Text Sent From Women's March Says Trump Encourages Police to 'Beat & Kill' Protestors,"According to a tweet from The Daily Caller author Mary Margaret Olohan, The Women’s March alert system texted a message this afternoon to its subscribers claiming that President Trump gave “the green light to beat & kill protestors.”

The text gave no further information about the claim, but merely directed supporters of their cause to join them and The Movement for Black Lives and sign a virtual petition demanding Trump’s resignation.

“We are all in danger,” the text read.

When asked by The Federalist to provide evidence for the baseless claim, and about how many people received the false text message, the Women’s March did not respond.

Just last week, a PBS NewsHour White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor came under scrutiny for her comments that there was “no evidence” that any of the protests of George Floyd’s death were the results of “anarchists” as President Trump previously claimed.

“These people are anarchists,” President Trump says without providing any evidence. https://t.co/P7HGwsbKWD — Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) May 31, 2020

"The Media Are Lying To You About Everything, Including The Riots","It seems no great event or upheaval in our national life can pass now without the media lying to our faces about it.

They lied about the Trump campaign colluding with Russia in 2016. They lied about the Mueller probe and Brett Kavanaugh and former national security adviser Mike Flynn. They lied about Trump’s phone call with the Ukrainian president and the impeachment farce that ensued. They lied about the coronavirus and the lockdowns and the White House response. And now they’re lying about the riots.

In recent days we’ve heard a steady drumbeat of lies, distortions, and disingenuousness from the mainstream media about almost every aspect of the unrest now gripping American cities. The deceit is almost too pervasive and amorphous to describe, but I’m going to try anyway.

Over the weekend we were told, for example, that the looting and violence was being instigated not by left-wing anarchists and antifa groups but by the media’s favorite villains: white supremacists. CNN, whose Atlanta offices were vandalized Friday, went on and on—without a shred of evidence to back it up—about how white supremacists might be infiltrating the protests and stirring up trouble. The New York Times, in a report that even quoted a senior police official in New York City saying outside anarchist groups were coordinating mayhem before the protests began, nevertheless veered into a long aside about how far-right “accelerationists” were hoping the unrest would bring about a long-sought second civil war.

By Monday, no one was talking about the white supremacist agitators anymore. The media had moved on to better, more plausible lies.

Here’s Matthew Yglesias of Vox, disingenuously comparing the rioters and looters to pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. His snarky tweet is meant to suggest Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton is a hypocrite for supporting the Hong Kong protesters but calling for the restoration of order at home.

https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1267514411914342404?s=20

No one should have to point out to Yglesias—or anyone else with a large media platform—that the looters of Minneapolis and the rioters in Philadelphia have nothing in common with the people fighting against an actual communist dictatorship in Hong Kong. Yet here we are.

This kind of disconnect—what can only be described, at best, as a willful misunderstanding of reality—has been disturbingly commonplace among media pundits and reporters since all this began.

Here’s NBC News’s Carl Quintanilla doing the same thing, comparing Trump’s positive comments about the peaceful protests of draconian coronavirus lockdown orders in Michigan on May 1 to his comments on Monday to state governors that they need to make arrests and restore order.

Again, it should go without saying that the Michigan protests last month went off without any looting, rioting, or violence. No one was arrested because no one broke the law. There’s no valid comparison between those Michigan protests and the mass riots over the weekend. Surely Quintanilla knows this, which makes his commentary not just idiotic but deeply dishonest. He doesn’t care about accuracy and genuine insight, he cares about plaudits from woke Twitter—and he got them.

At every turn we see different iterations of media dishonesty. PBS Newshour’s White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor on Sunday complained that Trump had called the rioters anarchists “without providing any evidence.”

“These people are anarchists,” President Trump says without providing any evidence. https://t.co/P7HGwsbKWD — Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) May 31, 2020

Had she opened her eyes, Alcindor might have seen the same evidence Trump and everyone else saw: news footage and cell phone videos circulating on social media of black-clad rioters burning and looting shops, attacking shop owners and motorists, and in some cases spray-painting actual anarchist symbols on public property.

Of course, Alcindor knows full well what the president meant by calling the rioters anarchists. She knows that many of them are indeed anarchists and left-wing provocateurs. We all know it. As mentioned above, the New York Times even reported on it.

Alcindor’s posture here is part of a broader pattern of opposition to Trump that the media has maintained for years, that whatever might be happening in the country, whether a global pandemic or mass rioting, the most important part of the story is always that Trump is behaving badly—that he’s lying, misleading, undermining democratic norms, tweeting mean things, whatever. Nothing, not even nationwide riots, are more important than pushing that narrative.

You see the media’s obsession with this narrative everywhere, no matter what the actual facts of a story might be. In Columbia, South Carolina, a man trying to protect his business was attacked and beaten senseless by an angry mob because he dared to call the cops. Yet Maggie Haberman of the New York Times thinks the big takeaway is that the man was described as “white” in a video of the attack that Trump posted about.

“White general manager” is the description of the person who was attacked in video the president tweeted about https://t.co/2XfUwgDaIX — Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) June 2, 2020

After Trump’s Monday night walk through Lafayette Park to St. John’s Episcopal Church, the media breathlessly reported stories about violent Park Police clearing peaceful protestors with tear gas. After nearly 24 hours of endless tweets, articles, and cable news stories claiming protestors were tear-gassed for Trump’s “photo op,” the Park Police information officer disproved all prior reports confirming, “No tear gas was used by USPP officers or other assisting law enforcement partners.”

The Media Are Playing A Dangerous Game

One could go on and on with examples like this. Get on Twitter right now and you’re bound to find fresh examples posting every hour as reporters and pundits lie about events that are unfolding in real time.

Every once in a while, you get a pundit who’s so bad at lying, so unconvincing in his role as a serious newsman, the mask slips. Often, that pundit is CNN’s Don Lemon, a not-very-bright man with a penchant for letting his mask slip—like when he lost it on-air laughing at a stupid joke about how Trump supporters are ignorant rubes.

On Sunday, as American cities were burning and looters were rampaging through the streets, Lemon implored America, “Open your eyes. We are teetering on a dictatorship.” He didn’t mean a dictatorship of the mob, which would have actually made sense given the facts. No, for Lemon and his CNN colleagues the real threat is Trump, who had the audacity to declare that if mayors and governors couldn’t get their cities under control, he would.

“Is the president declaring war on America? What is happening here?” asked Lemon, later declaring that Trump is “playing a very dangerous game, because this will backfire.”

To answer Lemon’s question, what’s happening here is the same thing that’s been happening for years now: the media, not Trump, have declared war on America, they are indeed playing a dangerous game, and it will most certainly backfire.

The Nation Has Gone Mad,"In case you had any doubt, yes, the nation has gone mad.

Last week, the death of a Minnesota black man named George Floyd ignited the worst outbreak of civil disobedience in recent history plunging a nation already under lockdown stress further into anarchy as angry rioters take to the streets terrorizing American cities in the name of social justice.

Floyd’s death at the knees of a Minneapolis police officer caught on tape was clearly unjust, rightfully setting off a wave of anger over the killing of a black civilian who appeared to be no threat. As the protests got underway however, demonstrations quickly took a darker turn in a nation grappling with record levels of unemployment and an ongoing public health pandemic. With more than 40 million unemployed Americans roaming the streets of a country fatigued under 10-week lockdowns, a nation that has been increasingly convinced by a Left-wing movement that it is irredeemably racist and full of white supremacists was primed for the storm of civil unrest it is now suffering.

The current moment has fully exposed the extent to which ugly divides have gone mainstream, illustrating the lunacy of our new woke-obsessed culture and the incompetency of our leaders.

“This is how nations collapse,” Fox News’ Tucker Carlson observed Monday night in a 32-minute monologue that will go down as a defining moment in prime time cable television.

Rioters claiming to be obsessed with racial injustice are committing gross racial injustices themselves, exerting their ruthless fury on their own. For the sake of black progress, protestors are destroying minority businesses, leaving poor neighborhoods devastated and ruining the livelihoods of those who barely emerged alive after two months of pandemic lockdowns. An estimated 100,000 small businesses had already permanently gone under.

Minorities are even being targeted themselves amid the chaos.

David Dorn was 77. He spent four decades protecting people as a police officer in St Louis and then came out of retirement to keep serving as Moline Acres' police chief.

Didn’t Officer David Dorn’s life matter?

Antifascists have also trashed literal antifascists by defacing the World War II Memorial, and D.C. rioters have taken to vandalizing monuments of historic Civil Rights heroes, including that of President Abraham Lincoln who brought the emancipation of slaves.

Yet reporters seeking to justify the violence and discredit the need for the restoration of a law and order to a nation gone mad are calling the military protection of the Lincoln Memorial “disturbing.”

This photo by @MarthaRaddatz at the Lincoln Memorial is deeply disturbing. pic.twitter.com/4cUgxQKh2p — Eli Clifton (@EliClifton) June 2, 2020

After lying about Russia, lying about the Mueller probe, lying about Brett Kavanaugh, lying about Ukraine, and lying about the lockdowns, the media are now lying about the riots.

NBC News allegedly told its reporters to not even use the term “riot” in its coverage of the protests that ended in spontaneous combustion of buildings and widespread looting.

PBS News White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor also tried to fact-check Trump on calling the rioters burning the nation’s cities to the ground as “anarchists.”

“These people are anarchists,” President Trump says without providing any evidence. https://t.co/P7HGwsbKWD — Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) May 31, 2020

CNBC’s Carl Quintanilla tried to draw a contradiction between Trump supporting protests calling for an end to draconian lockdowns to screaming at state governors doing nothing to control the mobs.

While there is a contradiction in behavior to be made, it has nothing to do with the president and everything to do with the media. When Americans protested to bring an end to state lockdowns, the media said that they were reckless, suicidal, selfish, racist because they could spread the virus to black people, that they didn’t deserve medical attention, irresponsibly spreading the virus, and that they were dangerous.

But when it comes to rioting however, the absence of social distancing now appears totally fine.

In fact, the violence from rioters seem to be justified.

“Please, show me where it says protests are supposed to be polite and peaceful,” said CNN’s Chris Cuomo Tuesday night.

Cuomo might be surprised to read the text of the First Amendment specifying “the right of the people peaceably to assemble.”

Meanwhile, the Pulitzer Prize winning writer at the New York Times who won the award for an essay that had to be corrected leading the paper’s anti-American 1619 Project said the violence was totally fine because property can be replaced.

“Violence is when an agent of the state kneels on a man’s neck until all of the life is leached out of his body,” Nikole Hannah-Jones said on CBS News. “Destroying property, which can be replaced, is not violence.”

One would think any reasonable interviewer would have followed up with a hypothetical on whether she would adhere to the same philosophy if her own home became the target of the protests. Considering the rioters’ record of attacking minority businesses, it’s not too far outside the realm of possibility.

Instead, all Vladimir Duthiers said was, “It’s a great point that you make, Nikole.”

On Monday, the Raleigh Police Chief seemed to agree with Hannah-Jones and rendering his department pointless.

Protect property? Everyone knows the job of the police is to make sure no one goes to church or a park. https://t.co/HqP5vwdBtJ — David Harsanyi (@davidharsanyi) June 1, 2020

And Hollywood celebrities, unsurprisingly, are promoting the lawlessness by pledging bail money to those arrested in the demonstrations.

As the media remains focused on protecting the rioters, every major outlet leaped to demonize Trump for declaring to restore law and order to a broken land and chastised the president for employing tear gas on protesters by the White House to make way for the emperor. Police however, did no such thing. On Tuesday, the United States Parks Police provided a report for what actually happened, which included no such fairytale of a peaceful gathering being disbursed by an irritating chemical.

“Violent protestors on H Street NW began throwing projectiles including bricks, frozen water bottles and caustic liquids,” said Park Police Chief Gregory Monahan. “As many of the protestors became more combative, continued to throw projectiles, and attempted to grab officers’ weapons, officers then employed the use of smoke canisters and pepper balls. No tear gas was used by USPP officers or other assisting law enforcement partners.

In our new era of white guilt for ancestral crimes, everything is now racist if it wasn’t already before. The list of lunacy in the new world order knows no bounds.

On Tuesday, an NBC announcer was fired for saying “all lives matter.” On the same day, a “Law and Order” writer was fired for pledging to protect law and order at his own home. On Monday, Hannah-Jones erroneously claimed that the Second Amendment is racist. Considering that the right to bear arms’ biggest champions were opponents to slavery, that’s quite a take. Also on Monday, dozens of public health experts signed an open letter in support for the protests blaming rampant white supremacy for society’s ills.

“White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,” the letter read.

The philosophy is really starting to take its grip.

White people are now willfully bowing down to atone for the sins of past generations while the Left’s broader war on redefining American society as one wholly built on racist institutions run by scores of white supremacists go mainstream.

Protesters in Bethesda attend a woke sermon to cry about their white guilt. Note that not a single one of them is social distancing. Two weeks ago, the media would've called them terrorists. https://t.co/rOJCsmPs9v — Ian Miles Cheong @ stillgray.substack.com (@stillgray) June 2, 2020

Bill De Blasio Is A Cowardly Tyrant Fueling New York’s Demise,"The grave injustice inflicted upon one person is now being compounded into a grave injustice for millions of New Yorkers.

It took decades to bring New York City back from the brink — facing crime, squalor, and bankruptcy — to the peace and prosperity that has marked it since Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s tenure. Today, Mayor Bill de Blasio seems intent on sending the city back to the bad old days, threatening to undo decades of progress while operating under the banner of “progressivism.”

The twin crises of the Chinese coronavirus and the present rioting and looting have created the perfect storm for the city’s demise. In response to the Wuhan virus, New York City committed willful economic suicide, and in response to the current lawlessness, NYC called for curfews it failed to impose, encouraging its descent into chaos.

While the crippling coronavirus shutdown can perhaps best be attributed to incompetence, there is no such excuse for permitting New York’s streets to become a war zone. The latter represents a failure of the most basic duty of our elected officials to protect our lives, liberty, and property.

The Mayor Has Failed His Most Basic Tasks

De Blasio’s failure is either a function of ideology, cynicism, cowardice, or a combination of the three. If ideology, it dictates the proper response to aggression is appeasement. If cynicism, it is born of a belief that tolerating mob rule will win the mayor plaudits. If cowardice, it is rooted in a fear of upsetting some by upholding justice for all.

Regardless of de Blasio’s rationale, by encouraging “restraint” in the face of rampant criminality, he has signaled to the mob that its actions will be tolerated, in effect legitimizing them. This will only invite more mob acts, in a city in which people have steadily acted with greater and greater impunity against authorities during his tenure. As with de Blasio’s general anti-cop program, he is only further endangering the most vulnerable, those law-abiding citizens residing in the city’s least-safe neighborhoods.

While New York City has overcome all manner of hardships in its history, it is not immune to the consequences of de Blasio’s bad ideas. These ideas were best illustrated in a June 2 exchange between the mayor and a reporter.

“While you recommended that protesters stay home, for others in the city you’ve enforced gathering bans, not recommendations,” a reporter said to the mayor. “The retail store owner who’s been closed for two months and is experiencing financial ruin has been banned from opening his store. People for whom attending houses of worship are a regular part of life have been banned from doing so with more than 10 people. Yet you’ve expressed solidarity with this particular protest cause. Is that why it’s been given dispensation to [sic] this regard … [over] pandemic guidelines?” the reporter asked.

He summarized his question as follows: “Are we in a pandemic or not, and do we have one set of rules for protesters and another for everyone else?”

De Blasio proceeded to pat himself on the back for the coronavirus response, before getting to the crux of his answer:

Before Thursday [when protesters began taking to the streets] … we were doing one thing, one thing only: Fighting back this disease for everyone’s benefit. … When you see a nation, an entire nation, simultaneously grappling with an extraordinary crisis seated in 400 years of American racism, I’m sorry that is not the same question as the understandably aggrieved store owner, or the devout religious person who wants to get back to services. … This is a powerful, painful, historical moment. … We’re not gonna treat it like it’s just any other day.

In other words, yes, there is one set of rules for protesters — and the rioters and anarchists embedded among them — and another for everyone else. And the mayor gets to dictate them.

De Blasio Makes up His Own Set of Rules

With de Blasio at the helm, New York City subscribes to a different Bill of Rights than the rest of the country. Those rights are conditional. They can be selectively applied depending upon the circumstances and parties involved.

In de Blasio’s Bill of Rights, during a pandemic, rioters have a right to non-peaceable assembly. Conversely, law-abiding religious believers have no right to peaceably assemble, nor to engage in the free exercise of their religion. That is, hooligans can light cop cars on fire and loot Nikes and Rolexes, but religious Jews cannot mourn the deaths of their loved ones.

While de Blasio fiddles, permitting anarchy on the streets, law-abiding citizens are left largely defenseless, their Second Amendment rights curtailed. Law enforcement will not defend us, and we cannot defend ourselves, including against those pilfering the businesses we are not allowed to operate.

This is to say nothing of de Blasio’s implied ahistorical “1619 Project” reading of American history, or the value judgments he is openly making. For our freedoms are accorded to all, and they are inalienable, not subject to the whims of the former Sandinista-supporting mayor proving in real time this was no youthful indiscretion.

De Blasio has been content to deprive people of their most basic freedoms during the coronavirus pandemic. Now he allows some to attack the most basic freedoms of others without defense, or recourse.

The American ideal is a society in which all people are treated equally under the law, regardless of skin color, in which all people enjoy the same rights, and none are afforded special privileges. Those letting their cities burn, like de Blasio, explicitly reject this view. They impose their identity politics on society under the guise of faux morality and virtue.

We all pay the price.

Protests Expose Lockdowns And Social Distancing Shaming As A Farce,"It was just more than a week ago that crowds gathered at Missouri’s Lake of the Ozarks to enjoy the Memorial Day weekend. With the celebrations however, came sharp criticism over the lack of social distancing featuring fearmongering elites shaming those relishing the springtime sunshine.

Former Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill was among those quick to demonize the apparent selfish behavior as “embarrassing” for her home state.

“Hope none of them have parents fighting cancer, grandparents with diabetes, aunts and uncles with serious heart conditions. Because clearly they could care less,” McCaskill wrote on Twitter.

Embarrassing for my state. Hope none of them have parents fighting cancer, grandparents with diabetes, aunts and uncles with serious heart conditions. Because clearly they could care less. https://t.co/2e8XXur3iN — Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) May 24, 2020

When it comes to the massive protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death in police custody however, McCaskill is cheering them on, retweeting somber images of the demonstrations and calling Missouri’s decision to deploy the National Guard to Washington D.C. after days of rioting as “disgusting.”

Oh come on. Missourians please. Why? Why? Other than to waste their time and your money groveling at the ankles of Donald Trump. Disgusting. Get mad. https://t.co/7aLIEBRzW2 — Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) June 4, 2020

The densely crowded protests would soon draw the attendance of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, both over the age of 65 putting them at higher risk of serious complications from the Chinese virus.

The sudden disregard for social distancing from avid lockdowners expose the extreme measures that tanked the nation’s economy and destroyed the nation’s psyche to be nothing more than deeply unserious methods to combat a virus that poses nearly no danger to low-risk groups.

More than 40 million Americans have now filed for unemployment. An estimated 100,000 small businesses have already permanently shut down. About 1 in 3 Americans are experiencing signs of clinical anxiety and depression. Thousands of others have put off critical health procedures so hospitals could build adequate capacity for an overwhelming surge in cases that never came in most of the country.

Yet while thousands gather in protest against police brutality across the country, no one seems to care about the ongoing public health pandemic after chastising those who dared break social distancing rules to reopen their states and reclaim their livelihoods.

In today’s America, churches can’t host socially distanced sermons including more than ten people but a violent mob can burn it down in the name of social justice. States had already made their priorities clear providing bars and casinos with greater freedom than houses of worship it deems nonessential, illustrating just how far we’ve strayed from faith even as millions of Americans desperately need it.

Floyd’s funeral is slated to take place in Houston on June 9 and is expected to draw an attendance of thousands, including prominent figures such as former Vice President Joe Biden. Many in the rest of the country however, were barred from properly saying their goodbyes to lost loved ones because the government declared it too dangerous, even this week and in the coming days.

We were told we couldn’t have more than 10 people at an outdoor graveside service in Maine literally 10 days ago. People were afraid to come see my family. https://t.co/kXh951js5j — Christine Rousselle (@crousselle) June 2, 2020

But the media doesn’t care. Before downplaying the violence from days of lawless anarchy terrorizing a dystopian nation because the message fit their own progressive agenda, legacy media painted the anti-lockdown protestors as heartless grandma killing rubes. These Americans, the media said, were reckless, selfish, dangerous, suicidal, racist because they could spread the virus to black people, and didn’t deserve medical attention. One would be hard pressed to find that kind of reporting on even larger protests today, because it doesn’t exist.

If nothing else is clear in the aftermath of these time-defining protests, it’s past time to end the lockdowns. Shut down the nursing homes, insulate the at-risk population and move on.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/04/protests-expose-lockdowns-and-social-distancing-shaming-as-a-farce/,2020-06-04
Public Health Experts Just Exposed An Infuriating And Dangerous Double Standard,"A group of 1,000+ public health experts from prestigious medical schools like Harvard to powerful groups like the National Institutes of Health recently signed an open letter making the case that mass protests over the killing of George Floyd are “vital to the national public health and to the threatened health specifically of Black people in the United States.” The letter illuminates an infuriating double standard, one that plunged the country into economic despair, mass unemployment, surging domestic violence, spiking suicides, and increased addictions.

At the end of their smug missive, these experts insist, “This should not be confused with a permissive stance on all gatherings, particularly protests against stay-home orders. Those actions not only oppose public health interventions, but are also rooted in white nationalism and run contrary to respect for Black lives.”

The argument is not only that white supremacy renders the protests a reasonable exception to their suggested shutdowns, but also that protests against those shutdowns are racist. Coming from the experts behind a shutdown that hit the black community especially hard, this is insulting and ludicrous. The New York Times covered that disparity just days ago, reporting, “Black Americans have been slightly more likely to lose jobs or income in the recession that took root as states locked down their economies,” further explaining why the community’s recovery will be especially difficult.

The experts’ argument is explicitly that mass gatherings in protest of racial inequality are worth the risk to public health because they help fight inequality, while mass gatherings and even less risky gatherings are not. The ban on those mass gatherings and much smaller gatherings—think hair salons and restaurants—has devastated the economy in our collective campaign to “stop the spread,” which those experts told us was necessary. They told us anything beyond a strict home quarantine, with exceptions made for essential workers, was intolerably dangerous. That’s before those activities were organized under the banner of a leftist cause.

By these experts’ logic, the spread is worth the risk when the public gathering is in service of a political movement with which they agree. This, of course, is ridiculous because the shutdowns themselves have particularly harmed the black community, and because the bans on much less risky gatherings have left people jobless, financially ruined, and confined to their homes, with drugs and alcohol and pornography to numb the pain.

If we needed to shut down the economy by keeping people away from each other to stop the spread, encouraging people to gather in close quarters in the service of a leftist cause does not mitigate that physical risk, and people are smart enough to know it.

Having covered the White House protests, I can say the demonstrations are packed as densely as Nats Park would be this time of year, which currently remains closed, leaving many working class Washingtonians without income.

We don’t yet conclusively know whether the shutdowns were “worth it” or not. But as soon as the protests proliferated last week, it was clear the public health concerns that have been raised in equally or less risky cases would be downplayed by ideologically supportive experts in media, government, and academia. This letter is an explicit and shameless expression of that shameful perspective.

The sentiment it articulates will leave a deep and lasting scar on the public’s already cratering trust in institutions. It should also prompt serious self-reflection from the expert class, but it won’t.

"While Defending Rioters, The Media Ignores Slain Black Police Officers","Two terrible things just happened only days apart. In Oakland, during anti-police protests outside of a federal courthouse, federal protective service officer Dave Patrick Underwood was killed in a drive-by shooting that was targeted at the police. Another officer was shot but survived.

The killing of Underwood, a black American, has only appeared in a few national outlets—one of which was the Wall Street Journal. Cable news outlets CNN and MSNBC, meanwhile, appear to have completely ignored Underwood’s killing. At best, they glossed over it.

In Minnesota, just two days later, protestors gathered on an interstate highway bridge they believed to be closed. In a stunning video, they were almost run over by a semi-truck. Fortunately, the driver braked and drove in the middle of the road to make it possible for people to get out of the way. It is amazing that no one was injured. Well, aside from the driver, who was pulled out of his truck and beaten.

The trucker, Bogdan Vechirko, was later released without charges after it was determined that he wasn’t targeting the protesters. As it turns out, the real culprits were state officials, who closed the interstate without putting up a blockade or properly warning drivers.

The media ran videos of the truck moving into the crowd over and over. Admittedly, it was a stunning scene. But they left out the part where the trucker was beaten. There was also little to no national coverage after it was determined Vechirko wasn’t targeting the protestors. And some of the media that did cover the lack of charges made it seem like an injustice was being done.

A quick Google search reveals oodles of national coverage of the initial incident—much more than the killing of Underwood received.

Violence Directed Against Cops Is Being Ignored

Two days after the semi-truck incident, a retired St. Louis police captain, David Dorn, was shot and killed while protecting a friend’s store from rioters and looters. A shocking video, live-streamed on Facebook, shows the 77-year-old black American lying in a pool of blood.

Yet Dorn’s death also appeared in only a few corporate media articles and was hardly covered on cable news at all.

In Alabama, a white American cop was killed, although it is unclear if the killing was related to the George Floyd “protests.” The officer, Stephen Williams, was known for bridging divides in the community.

In Atlanta, a black American officer named Max Brewer is in intensive care after he was run over during protests.

All over the country, police have been run over, shot, or bludgeoned by bricks and other blunt objects. Police officers were hit by cars in the cities of Buffalo and New York. In Florida, an officer had his neck slashed.

While one Las Vegas police officer shot in the head could hang on and survive, he may never be the same again. Officers have also been shot in Virginia, Iowa, and Missouri. Including the 50 secret service officers injured in D.C. by Molotov cocktails, nearly 300 police officers have been killed or injured in the last week.

Do These Black Lives Matter?

At least three other black Americans have been killed aside from Underwood and Dorn. One was Italia Marie Kelly, who was killed in a shooting in Iowa when the crowd of “protestors” became unruly. Chris Beaty was a football star and a real estate broker. He saw thugs stealing purses and tried to stop them. “You don’t need to do this,” he pleaded, “there’s a better way.” Then they shot him.

David McAtee ran a popular outdoor eatery in Louisville. He was shot by police after, at least according to surveillance footage, he appeared to fire on officers. Only McAtee’s death was covered by the national corporate media, and the articles emphasized his barbeque business, not the fact that he had likely fired on police before they returned fire.

These are likely not the only black Americans killed in the aftermath of Floyd’s killing. The race of many dead Americans has not been revealed in the media, and some of the deaths have resulted from recklessness. In Philadelphia, a man died after trying to blow up an ATM. In Minneapolis, a looter was shot by a pawn shop owner.

So many innocent people have died. In Detroit, a man was shot and killed during protests by a drive-by shooter. In Minneapolis and St. Paul, aside from the pawnshop killing, three others are dead. Last week, a man’s body was found in an area that saw rioting and no police presence the night before. A woman’s body was found in the backseat of a car. Her body had suffered “visible trauma,” and the car was in an area “overrun with violence in the overnight hours.” And this week, another woman’s body was found in a car, this time riddled with bullet holes.

The Media Ignores the Lights in the Dark

The national media seems incapable of covering any of the uplifting stories during the chaos. In Minneapolis, people of all colors are coming out during the day to clean up their neighborhoods. Americans—in the absence of police protection—have defended their land, businesses, and families using the utmost restraint.

There’s also been plenty of positive instances of Americans bridging racial divides, and of protestors standing up to looters. In one video, mostly black protestors form a chain to keep looters out of a Target store. In another, thugs dressed in Antifa’s “black bloc” uniform, vandalize and loot while black onlookers yell at them to stop. In a set of pictures from Kentucky, black American men intervened to protect a caucasian police officer who was separated from his squad.

The media is intent on dividing us. They repeat the toxic narrative that police officers are targeting and killing black men when the hard data doesn’t come close to backing up their claims. They are willfully blind when “protestors” commit bad acts—like in Virginia, where firetrucks were blocked from going to a burning house that had a young child inside.

When mob violence is shown, they justify it. When the overall damage is too much to bear, they repeat the total fabrication that the carnage is being carried out by “white supremacists.” They gloss over or ignore Antifa’s role in the chaos, even defending the organization.

The Media Must Start Covering All Innocent Victims

Ultimately, the violence we’ve witnessed has been carried out by criminals of all ethnicities and races. It has, however, occurred disproportionately in Democrat-run states and minority neighborhoods. Yet progressive Democrats like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio have allowed violence to take place. In Minneapolis, cops were ordered to withdraw from areas that became lawless, directly resulting in death. Frey even let the Third Precinct Police Station in his city to be burned without permitting the police to defend it.

Progressive politicians allowed this because they take this part of their base for granted. It was a small but vocal element of their base who was rioting, and their supporters who have a voice (and dollars to donate) don’t live in these neighborhoods. Even so, many leftists from the suburbs or untouched upper-scale pockets of the city took to cable news or posted on social media about how the violence was justified. Frey, whose estimated net worth is $9 million, is a member of that elite.

The anguish of Stephanie Wilford, from Minneapolis, an older black woman who can be seen sobbing while she talks to a local reporter about the destruction in her neighborhood, is part of their “progress.” Unfortunately, she and others like her will never be shown on CNN.

The next logical question is this: Can a democratic-republic function when its media is so dishonest, it’s elite so corrupt, and when one of its major political parties allows street violence? The answer is probably not. God help us.

How Iran Is Hijacking Racial Tensions In America For Its Own Gain,"The tragic death of George Floyd created a beautiful moment of international solidarity. From Idlib, Syria to Berlin, Germany, protesters have expressed empathy and support for Black Americans fighting racial injustice. But while it is important to recognize this solidarity, we also cannot overlook the hypocritical attempts by authoritarian regimes to hijack the movement for their own gain.

The opportunistic mullahs in Iran have quickly jumped on growing social animosity in the United States to shape their own political narratives back in Iran. As Americans grieve over Floyd’s death, the Iranian regime has—in brazen, disgusting fashion—taken advantage of racial tensions to paint itself as a beacon of civil rights.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is usually busy tweeting about the destruction of Israel, took a break from casual threats of genocide to share a video about the history of civil rights within America, tweeting “If you’re dark-skinned walking in the US, you can’t be sure you’ll be alive in the next few minutes,” along with the hashtags #ICantBreathe and #BlackLivesMatter.

A similar sentiment was echoed by Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, who condemned “silence” over “brutality against protesters” and “military crackdown.”

This faux humanitarianism is an insult to the Iranian people, in particular, the 1,500 men and women who were mercilessly murdered by security forces during the anti-government protests in November 2019.

Where was the regime’s compassion towards the oppressed when innocent and peaceful Iranians—among them, children—were shot at point-blank range for demanding basic, essential human rights?

Any regime that tortures dissidents, represses ethnic and religious minorities and treats women as second-class citizens has no business claiming any solidarity for civil rights or for protest movements—Iran least of all.

When nationwide protests broke out in Iran last November, the regime and its network in the West slandered and delegitimized the Iranian people.

Sina Toosi of the National Iranian-American Council (NIAC), the regime’s political lobby in America, said “some powerful force seemingly has an interest in escalating the situation,” sharing a video of rocks being thrown on a bridge that implied foreign influence was guiding the protests. This type of rhetoric dismisses the ever-present struggle of the Iranian people as a sort of “foreign interference” in Iranian affairs.

Contrast this with Toosi’s commentary on the George Floyd protests, which has based its line of argumentation around the claim that President Trump has “declared war” on protesters. It is quite maddening to see NIAC remain quiet when the Iranian regime shoots and bombs protesters in Iran, Syria, and Iraq, only to turn around and label U.S. law enforcement attempts to stop rioting as akin to fascist militarism.

Speaking out against police brutality is important, but it is unprincipled and hypocritical to criticize it in America while whitewashing and ignoring it in Iran or any other country.

Iran’s rhetoric surrounding Floyd’s murder isn’t coming from a place of sympathy. It stems from a systematic attempt to draw a false equivalency between the American and Iranian governments with the purpose of delegitimizing American criticisms of past, present, and future Iranian crimes. This effort became quite evident when Foreign Minister Javad Zarif posted a picture of a statement by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo regarding Iranian suppression of protesters with “Iran” replaced with “America.”

It is similarly concerning and disheartening when the comments of some leftist activists in America provide fodder for those who would love to make comparisons between America and Iran. When the Trump administration’s comments and responses regarding riots are labeled as “authoritarian”; when it is claimed that he is trying to kill protesters, it is an insult to people who actually have the misfortune to live under regimes that are truly authoritarian.

Attempting to place the United States on the same moral level as authoritarian states like Iran dilutes the meaning and reality of authoritarian brutality.

It is possible to be critical of police in the United States or to engage in a peaceful protest for change without undermining the struggles faced every day by the people of Iran and those live in genuinely oppressive nations.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/06/iran-hijacking-racial-tensions-america-own-gain/,2020-06-06
Barr Says 'Peaceful Protestors' Are One Of The Big Lies From The Media,"U.S. Attorney General William Barr rebuked the false narrative perpetuated by legacy media Sunday that protestors cleared near the White House last week were gathering in peaceful demonstrations. On Monday, protestors were dispersed by park police by pepper balls as the city neared at 7 p.m. curfew by Barr’s orders moments before President Donald Trump walked across the street to observe the damage done to the historic St. John’s Church.

“They were not peaceful protestors,” Barr said on CBS’ Face the Nation. “That’s one of the big lies that the media is⁠—seems to be perpetuating at this point.”

CBS’ Margaret Brennan pushed back citing several of the network’s reporters who were present.

“Three of my CBS colleagues were there. We talked to them,” Brennan said. “They did not hear warnings.”

Barr explained:

There were three warnings given. But let’s get back to why we took that action. On Friday, Saturday and Sunday, OK, there were violent riots in Lafayette Park where the park police were under constant attack at the, behind the bike rack fences. On Sunday, things reached a crescendo. The officers were pummeled with bricks, crowbars were used to pry up the pavers at the park and they were hurled at police. There were fires set in not only St. John’s Church, but a historic building at Lafayette was burned down.

Brennan tried to brush off the violence as simply “looters,” a characterization that Barr immediately disputed.

“Not looters, these were⁠—there were the the violent rioters who dominated Lafayette Park,” Barr said, noting that they broke into the nearby Treasury Department and were attacking police with projectiles. “This has been totally obscured by the media.”

Barr explained that the decision to expand the perimeter surrounding Lafayette Park was an order he gave to the park police Monday afternoon, with no connection to the president’s visit to St. John’s Church.

“The park police was facing what they considered to be a very rowdy and non-compliant crowd. And there were projectiles being hurled at the police,” Barr said.

Brennan once again cited reporting from her colleagues who observed no such behavior.

“I was there. They were thrown. I saw them thrown,” Barr said.

“And you believe that what the police did using tear gas and projectiles was appropriate?” Brennan asked, posing the same false charge that tear gas was employed at the park that day repeated by every major news outlet.

“This was not an operation to respond to that particular crowd. It was an operation to move the perimeter one block,” Barr asserted. “They announced three times. They didn’t move. By the way, there was no tear gas used. The tear gas was used Sunday when they had to clear H Street to allow the fire department to come in to save St. John’s Church. That’s when tear gas was used.”

Barr continued with criticism of how the media reported on Monday’s events:

All I heard was comments about how peaceful protesters were. I didn’t hear about the fact that there were 150 law enforcement officers injured and many taken to the hospital with concussions. So it wasn’t a peaceful protest. We had to get control of Lafayette Park, and we had to do it as soon as we were able to do that.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/07/barr-says-peaceful-protestors-are-one-of-the-big-lies-media-are-perpetuating/,2020-06-07
Follow The Science: Riots Don’t Work,"On his nightly soapbox, CNN’s Chris Cuomo requested, “Please, show me where it says protesters are supposed to be polite and peaceful.”

Of course, you won’t find these instructions written in the protester’s handbook anywhere, but they are reflected in common sense and a new study.

The study, which conducted six experiments with 3,399 participants, was published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. In sum, it concludes Americans stop caring about causes when protesters riot.

Using a handful of conservative and liberal causes, including the Black Lives Matter movement, animal rights, and the pro-life movement, researchers examined how different protest actions influence support for the various movements. (In their report, they refer to the pro-life movement as the “anti-abortion movement,” suggesting the authors are not conservative.)

Across the board, researchers found “protest behaviors perceived to be harmful to others, highly disruptive, or both — typically reduce support for social movements.” They also concluded that “these effects were largely independent of individuals’ prior ideology or views on the issue.”

The results are no surprise. When protesters cross the line from peaceful to obnoxious — or worse, when demonstrators block firefighters from reaching a burning building with a child inside or murder a small-town former police chief — Americans lose their emotional connection for the cause.

Worse, researchers found that highly disruptive and extreme behavior at protests backfires, increasing support for the opposite cause.

“We found extreme anti-Trump protest actions actually led people to not only dislike the movement and support the cause less, but to be willing to support Trump more,” said Matthew Feinberg, the corresponding author of the study and an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the University of Toronto. “It was almost like a backlash.”

As our cities light up in flames from protests that broke out in response to George Floyd’s unjust death, the science on the psychological effects is important to hear. Science, after all, is often what people on the political left say undergirds their positions and arguments.

When lawmakers, activists, Hollywood, and the media excuse violence and destruction as “the language of the unheard,” Americans are turned off to the cause, diminishing opportunities for important conversation and policy solutions. Moral compasses go on high alert, noting the difference between wrong and right. No amount of media gaslighting will change that, as rioting is so obviously wrong.

The study explains the recent poll that found 58 percent of registered voters, nearly half of whom are Democrats and 37 percent of whom are black, now say they would support cities using military force to address the recent protests. It’s the exact opposite of what protesters and the media want.

Peaceful protests and demonstrations are an American tradition. Hysterical meltdowns and violence are not. If the current protesters, media, and their celebrity supporters care about having conversations and finding policy solutions, they’d demand the violence stop. Yes, many have, but not enough, as riots continue in our streets.

The study’s authors describe their conclusion as “an activist’s dilemma.”

“Taken together with prior research showing that extreme protest actions can be effective for applying pressure to institutions and raising awareness of movements, these findings suggest an activist’s dilemma, in which the same protest actions that may offer certain benefits are also likely to undermine popular support for social movements.”

In a democracy, there’s no dilemma. Institutions don’t change themselves — people do. In order to do that, protesters must convince enough Americans to get behind their cause. Then they must convince them to vote.

To go back to Cuomo’s original question, protesters aren’t required to be “polite and peaceful,” but science says they probably should be if they want to be effective at drawing support to their cause.

Perhaps some people rioting and protesting don’t want to change minds. If their only goal is to sow division and hate, then science says they’re doing it exactly right.

Hawley Calls For DOJ Investigation Into First Amendment Violations Against Religious Gatherings,"Sen. Josh Hawley sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr Tuesday calling for a civil rights investigation, alleging a constitutional violation of the First Amendment regarding restricting religious gatherings.

The Missouri senator argued that, as the government has failed to enforce social distancing guidelines at the recent protests, it cannot single out religious gatherings.

Hawley encouraged Barr to conduct the investigation into violations by state officials who are still, given the recent mass gatherings, restricting religious gatherings. He wrote that giving preference to one form of speech or gathering over another violates the First Amendment.

“State officials have determined that the message behind the current protests is worth saying. But state officials cannot block religious speech while allowing protests simply because the states think the protest speech is more valuable,” Hawley wrote.

This comes after months of restricted religious gatherings across the nation. In a White House press briefing May 22, President Trump urged states to allow citizens to attend religious services in person.

“The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important, essential places of faith to open right now for this weekend,” he said.

After the CDC released non-binding guidelines for places of worship to follow in the case they reopen, they still encouraged those places to comply with state authorities. And while some states such as Florida have lead the way in opening back up, certain states are still prohibiting gatherings.

Hawley thanked Barr for his involvement in ensuring religious rights are upheld, including the May 19 letter Barr wrote to California Gov. Gavin Newsom on allowing the reopening of religious services. California still has considerable restrictions that the Supreme Court upheld in a 5-4 vote May 30. This type of restriction during unregulated protests, Hawley wrote, is wrong.

“Many jurisdictions across the nation are imposing extraordinarily strict caps on religious gatherings—such as restricting religious gatherings to 10 or fewer people—even as those jurisdictions allow thousands of people to gather closely in protests,” he said. “States cannot allow one but prohibit the other.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/09/hawley-calls-for-doj-investigation-into-first-amendment-violations-against-religious-gatherings/,2020-06-09
Protests Confirm Kavanaugh's Dissent: Church Restrictions Were Always Arbitrary,"Some justices on the Supreme Court apparently did not get the memo: Contrary to their recent, controversial 5-4 opinion regarding South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, which ruled in favor of state-mandated COVID-19 restrictions that didn’t allow churches to open to the same capacity as businesses, it now looks like the state’s guidelines were arbitrary. Given the massive protests around the country, it would appear religious communities can gather if they do so for a politically correct purpose, such as a George Floyd memorial, like these Jewish children did recently.

That the five justices who ruled against the church reopening would use the exact same logic that has now been flipped around and utilized to excuse massive and often lawless protests is unfortunate. In fact, it proves Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s dissent — he would have granted the church’s request to stop the state from enforcing the inequitable mandate — underscoring the importance of the First Amendment’s authority over state’s rights.

Roberts Defers to States, Accuses Kavanaugh of Judicial Activism

Chief Justice John Roberts and the four more liberal justices — Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer — disagreed with Kavanaugh. Roberts’ opinion has surprised and disappointed many on the right, even as this reassures the left he might turn out to be the swing vote they can occasionally count on.

Roberts wasted no time making his case for why he would deny the church’s request for “injunctive relief.” He essentially said California’s restrictions are in fact equitable, so they don’t violate churchgoers’ First Amendment rights. Roberts said California has imposed severe restrictions on places where folks linger, such as church, concerts, movie theaters, and spectator sports, while loosening restrictions on places people move through more quickly, such as grocery stores (which have always been essential businesses, so that doesn’t hold up).

This logic didn’t quite make sense to Kavanaugh and the remaining more originalist judges, but it especially sounds flawed now in light of protests taking place in large cities, where angry mobs have gathered in crowds of hundreds or thousands of people for hours at a time.

Roberts argued his decision is based on deferring to what state officials say: “Our Constitution principally entrusts ‘[t]he safety and the health of the people’ to the politically accountable officials of the States ‘to guard and protect.’” As Reason’s Damon Linker says, Roberts even went so far as to essentially accuse “Kavanaugh and the other dissenters of judicial activism”:

When those officials “undertake[ ] to act in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties,” their latitude “must be especially broad.” … Where those broad limits are not exceeded, they should not be subject to second-guessing by an “unelected federal judiciary,” which lacks the background, competence, and expertise to assess public health and is not accountable to the people.

Kavanaugh Deferred First to the Constitution

Of course, our government is set up to defer to state officials when it comes to these exact issues. As far as legal documents show, the church was doing exactly that to a point. But as things have evolved, the church saw a gross inequity. So it took it upon itself to petition the court and point out that these particular state executive orders violated its First Amendment rights, which supersede any state mandates, especially in this very specific case where it appeared the church was not being treated equally to businesses.

Kavanaugh concurred with this logic and dissented from Roberts’ majority opinion, along with Neil Gorsuch, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas. Writing separately, he said, “California’s discrimination against religious worship services contravenes the Constitution.”

Kavanaugh actually took the time in his dissent to target the primary issue of the case, which is not federalism, state’s rights, or even judicial activism, but the obvious difference between the way the church and secular businesses are being treated:

What California needs is a compelling justification for distinguishing between (i) religious worship services and (ii) the litany of other secular businesses that are not subject to an occupancy cap. California has not shown such a justification. The Church has agreed to abide by the State’s rules that apply to comparable secular businesses. That raises important questions: “Assuming all of the same precautions are taken, why can someone safely walk down a grocery store aisle but not a pew? And why can someone safely interact with a brave deliverywoman but not with a stoic minister?”

Roberts Deflects and Projects

If anything, it actually looks like by accusing Kavanaugh and company of judicial activism, in his extremely stoic chief justice kind of way, Roberts deflected from the exact compelling argument Kavanaugh made in his dissent and projected his own penchant for often being called an activist judge himself. (His vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, which upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, comes to mind.)

Roberts famously does not want his court to be one known for political activism, and this is as important as it is admirable. Yet since when is identifying the way an executive order treats businesses and churches differently judicial activism? If anything, it’s the opposite. To label Kavanaugh as such seems a bit overwrought, even for him.

Of course, Kavanaugh is second-guessing the unconstitutional mandate. It came to the court precisely for that reason. The justices had to look at it again through the lens of the Constitution. Kavanaugh simply found that the order did violate the church’s rights, and Roberts didn’t think it was his business to step in. A compelling case can be made for both arguments, but there’s no compelling case for the chief to talk down to his fellow justices and label them meddlers and activists.

The decision appears especially unfortunate in light of what now appears to be extremely arbitrary state mandates that closed down businesses and churches, then reopened some businesses, but kept churches shuttered while mass protesters gathered without receiving even the slightest rebuke.

National Anthem Kneeling Controversy Is Once Again A Political Football,"Four years later, it’s 2016 all over again. No, we’re not talking about an election but rather the NFL. The national movement sparked by the death of George Floyd has rekindled a fight that seemed to have abated long ago: Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling protest during the national anthem.

Saints quarterback Drew Brees re-upped the controversy when talking to Yahoo Finance last week, saying, “I will never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag.”

Context be damned, Brees’ good character was dragged through the mud by current players and former players, not to mention the most famous athlete on the planet, LeBron James, and the media. Saints safety Malcolm Jenkins told Brees to “shut the f-ck up,” and Hall of Fame tight end Shannon Sharpe suggested Brees retire. The ultimate indignity was revealed by Brees’ wife, who acknowledged on Instagram the couple had received death threats.

We can set aside for a moment that Brees helped lift the spirits of a majority-black city, devastated by Hurricane Katrina, when his team inspired New Orleans with a Super Bowl victory. He also helped rebuild parks, schools, and athletic facilities after the disaster. Forget about the $5 million donation he and his foundation made to New Orleans after COVID-19 ravaged the black community.

None of that mattered, nor did the fact that Brees’ respect for the flag is due to his two grandfathers’ service in the U.S. military during World War II. The 41–year-old made a heartfelt apology, saying his remarks were “insensitive and completely missed the mark on the issues we are facing right now as a country.”

President Donald Trump then took the ball and ran with it, tweeting that Brees “should not have taken back his original stance on honoring our magnificent American Flag…NO KNEELING!”

The QB fired back at Trump on Instagram, saying, “We can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities.”

From there, the battle elevated from field- to suite-level, with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell re-entering the fray. Goodell had long been maligned for squashing the “take a knee” protest and for what some people felt was his blackballing Kaepernick from the league.

This time, Goodell dramatically shifted the NFL’s stance. In a video from the league’s Twitter feed, 61-year-old Goodell said, “We, the National Football League, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all players to speak out and peacefully protest. We, the National Football League, believe that black lives matter.”

The league’s owners must remember the considerable decline in TV ratings that was largely attributed to the national anthem protest. Why is the league now supporting that very gesture? Will it welcome Kaepernick back?

Certainly, the world’s most powerful football fan will look to seize on either move to fire up his base ahead of November. Trump, however, isn’t waiting for fall. The president tweeted Sunday: “Could it be even remotely possible that in Roger Goodell’s rather interesting statement of peace and reconciliation, he was intimating that it would now be O.K. for the players to KNEEL, or not to stand, for the National Anthem, thereby disrespecting our Country & our Flag?” Unlike last time around, when the flag flap played out in San Francisco, it now appears to be headed to the president’s backyard.

Washington Redskins running back Adrian Peterson left no ambiguity about what’s going to play out, telling the Houston Chronicle over the weekend, “[N]ow we’re all getting ready to take a knee together going into this season, without a doubt.”

While it’s not yet clear when the NFL season will start or if fans will be there to witness it, one thing is certain: If and when play resumes, the fiery debate over systemic discrimination, police brutality, and the American flag will return.

Democrats’ Gross Lockdown Hypocrisy Threatens Their Chances In 2020,"Democrats took aggressive social distancing action to combat coronavirus, but they’re throwing their arguments out the window when it comes to rioting and protesting. That contradiction is growing and is increasingly dangerous to them. The longer the protests continue, the more opportunity for Middle America and moderate voters to make that connection and turn on Democrats.

As coronavirus entered America, state and local governments responded with an unprecedented lockdown of society and the economy, leaving almost 43 million people to file for unemployment in the past three months. In the first quarter, the economy shrank 5 percent, and the Atlanta Fed projects it may shrink as much as 54 percent in Q2.

Recovery could take years for many and might never fully happen for some. The effects of lockdowns have been highly regressive, falling hardest on those least able to withstand them: those with the least capital and savings. Amazingly though, despite obvious pain, Americans obeyed the diktats and endured.

In contrast, when protests and riots broke out following George Floyd’s death, government response has often been muted. Looting, arson, property destruction, violent attacks, and killings have all occurred. Yet police, even when targeted, have been “stood down,” and National Guards mobilized belatedly, if at all. Again, the costs have fallen hardest on those least able to afford them. This is to say nothing of the tyrannical authorities’ sudden silence on mass gatherings.

Just as there has been a clear contradiction between responses, there has also been a clear correlation. Democratic governments, the most hands-on when it came to coronavirus, have been the most hands-off when it came to rioting.

According to a May 21 Wall Street Journal report, when the country was slowly reopening, 19 states retained comprehensive or some restrictions on business and travel. Fifteen of these had Democratic governors. Of the four that did not, three had Democrat-controlled legislatures. Only one state, Ohio, had a Republican trifecta.

Of the five states with comprehensive restrictions, Democrats controlled both the governorship and legislature. The bluer the state, the harsher the shutdown.

In contrast to this coronavirus stringency, there has been laxity in response to rioting. The cities with the most severe and prolonged riots — New York, Minneapolis, Chicago, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Seattle — are all Democratic bastions, often in Democrat-controlled states.

In Minneapolis, where Floyd died and the riots started, the mayor, city council, and police chief are all Democrats. In Minnesota, the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general are Democrats. Blue jurisdictions have had lax responses.

There is also a qualitative disconnection in the government response.

With coronavirus, government has been aggressive to excessive. When business owners have attempted to reopen ahead of government timelines, many have faced harsh responses. Government actions and reactions have been aimed at normal activities by otherwise law-abiding citizens.

Meanwhile, government has been permissive to passive (at least initially) with protests. Here, government action has not been taken against people gathering en masse in violation of health orders, even when some of those protests turned to violent riots, with actors breaking the law in the most egregious fashion.

The danger Democrats increasingly face is that Middle America and moderate voters will see these increasingly stark juxtapositions too. People like them — law-abiding business owners and their customers — adhered to onerous government restrictions to shut down normal operations, and after weeks and months of financial hardship, people have been jailed for trying to resume it.

In contrast, people who do not share moderate voters’ values can riot seemingly at will. This most egregious of illegal activity is ignored or condoned.

The repercussions of such a voter recognition could devastate Democrats in November.

Middle America provided Donald Trump his upset win over Hillary Clinton in 2016. From 2012, Trump flipped Michigan, Ohio, Florida, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania — a total of 99 electoral votes, well over a third of the 270 needed to win. Moderate voters accounted for 39 percent of all voters in 2016 and broke 52-40 percent for Clinton — and she still lost. Democrats must flip Middle America and hold moderates to win in November.

Democrats’ recent contradictions accord with the left’s growing ascendancy in the party. For well over a year, contenders in the Democrats’ crowded presidential field have fought their way left, self-consciously away from the center, to appeal to their dominant wing.

When most people call 911, they hope the police come, not Antifa. People also need to know that when government can’t make exceptions for businesses to open and churches to gather, allegedly because of public health concerns, authorities won’t then encourage giant protests.

For this reason, Democrats need protests to end now — yesterday actually. The longer they last, the worse Democrats look, and the greater the likelihood that Middle America and moderate voters make a connection from current chaos, to coronavirus, to leftward campaign content — and break with Democrats.

Meet The Italian Immigrant Whose Statue Of Columbus Protesters Just Destroyed,"Wednesday night in the Minnesota capital of St. Paul, protestors demolished their city’s Christopher Columbus statue. In destroying the statue, which had nothing to do with the tragic death of George Floyd, rioters also destroyed immigrant art, Italian-American history, and a symbol of American unity.

Protesters across the nation have been defacing public statues that they deem a symbol of racial injustice, vandalizing statues of Italian explorer Christopher Columbus in cities ranging from Boston to Houston in their pursuit.

The St. Paul statue, however, represents more than just Columbus’ discoveries. The statue’s artist was Italian-American immigrant Carlo Brioschi who created a number of sculptures for cities across America. He sculpted the Columbus statue, originally conceived in 1927 by the Italian Progressive Club of Duluth, as a gift from Italian-Americans in Minneapolis to the city, dedicated by a crowd of onlookers and a brass band in 1931.

Brioschi himself was a famous Italian-American sculptor in the Twin Cities area. He received his training at the Academy of Fine Arts in Milan, Italy before bringing his talents to the U.S. He opened Brioschi-Minuti, an ornamental plaster and sculpture showroom, with fellow Italian-American immigrant Adolphi Minuti.

Brioschi’s work through his firm left a lasting legacy in major cities, beginning with the firm’s inception in New York. His work involved working on Grand Central Station in New York City, the Christopher Columbus statue in downtown Chicago, and multiple universities.



He and Minuti brought their legacy to Minnesota when their firm moved to St. Paul in 1909. From there, Brioschi was able to work on the University of Minnesota’s Northrup Auditorium, the Hotel St. Paul, and the Christopher Columbus statue that survived nearly a century before being torn down.

Calls for the statue’s removal began in recent years with the growing controversy around honoring controversial historical figures. On Indigenous People’s Day in 2018, Minneapolis writers Peter and Mattie Harper published an article titled, “Minnesota, we need to talk about our Columbus monument.”

“For the state officials present, the memorial represented a symbolic acceptance of Italian immigrants as Americans,” they wrote.

They discounted the immigrants’ efforts, however, as a disgusting attempt to be “viewed as ‘white.’” Through their assimilation and celebration of American togetherness, they alleged the monument stomped on Native American history.

“By proclaiming Columbus the ‘first American’ and making no mention of Indigenous people, either nationally or locally, the memorial association perpetuated the myth of Indians as ‘savages,’” they wrote. “In fact, Native American history was deliberately erased and the violent histories of colonialism and genocide perpetrated by Columbus were not acknowledged.”

Now protesters have had the final word. They succeeded in the effort to destroy a monument that stood as a symbol of embracing American immigrants.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/11/meet-the-italian-immigrant-whose-statue-of-columbus-protesters-just-destroyed/,2020-06-11
The Protests Prove That Public Health Demands For Mail-In Elections Are A Lie,"For months, the media and politicians have reported that lockdowns, and the surrender of public life with them, are a necessary sacrifice for public health. To disagree with the extent of these lockdowns was to be anti-science. One of the most extreme of these requirements was the call for mail in-elections.

Presumptive Presidential nominee Joe Biden was just one of many politicians who echoed the call for no in-person voting at all.

This argument worked a month ago. Today however, tens of thousands of Americans march in the streets, and have been doing so for the better part of the month. Many are not following social distancing guidelines, and despite initially attacking reopenings, blue states have broadly begun ending lockdowns just as red states have. It’s been possible to visit a barber in California for weeks now. And with Democratic politicians urging people to join the packed protests, Americans have a right to ask why elections alone just can’t be held in person.

A (strained) argument can be made that businesses should remain shut but demonstrating is too important to stop. You can’t, however, argue that protest is a necessary civic duty, but voting isn’t. And you certainly can’t argue that barbershops and dentists are safe to reopen but not voting booths.

So why, despite cognitive dissonance on every level, have some politicians stood by demands that elections can’t be held in person? The answer is because it’s been on the wish list for a long time. Mail-in elections are a long time Democratic goal, with many politicians and media outlets alike believing they boost both voter turnout and political wins. While the research behind this idea is less straightforward than they realize, there’s no question that the DNC wants mail-in voting regardless of Covid-19.

The current protests have exposed the “public health concerns” surrounding voting for what they are- a political strategy. Voting is certainly as important as demonstrating is, and with the proper precautions it can be much safer too. If you want to argue for mail-in votes, there’s a cause to be made. But don’t claim the pandemic has anything to do with it.

These 8 Blue State Governors And Mayors Broke Their Own Lockdown Orders,"State and local-mandated lockdowns meant businesses were closed, livelihoods were destroyed, and mental health plummeted, but our elected officials assured us that this was all in our best interests, and breaking these stay-at-home orders was both immoral and punishable by arrest. Yet several politicians proved that the rules are not the same for the governors as for the governed. Below are eight politicians who flouted their own stay-at-home orders.

1. Gov. Phil Murphy, New Jersey

New Jersey is one of the final hold outs for the stay-at-home orders, which were just announced to be ending earlier this week. Before then, outdoor gatherings were limited to a maximum of 25 people, with proper social distancing being required. The rules Gov. Murphy put in place didn’t stop him from a large Black Lives Matter protest in Hillside, NJ, which certainly involved more than 25 people, highlighting the march with pictures on his twitter account.

Today, in Hillside, we marched for justice. For George Floyd and for the many before him – who lost their lives for being Black. We march because we will not accept systemic racism and bias as just part of our national condition. Black Lives Matter. pic.twitter.com/JGe00Xa1qS — Governor Phil Murphy (@GovMurphy) June 7, 2020

2. Gov. Ralph Northam, Virginia

Ralph Northam has had a hard time following his own mask regulations in Virginia. The current rules in Virginia state that cloth face coverings, be it face masks or bandanas, are required in public settings. Northam was photographed on Virginia Beach boardwalk, not wearing a mask and standing well within six feet of other people, just one day after suggesting he’d make wearing masks mandatory for Virginians.

https://twitter.com/DRCUSALiberty/status/1264338100102270976

3. Gov.Gretchen Whitmer, Michigan

Governor Whitmer became very unpopular with draconian and arbitrary rules for stay-at-home orders. The state is still under lockdown, one of the last states to continue with the measures.

Over Memorial Day weekend, intrastate travel was strongly discouraged, with Whitmer imploring Michigan residents to not take the recent decrease in restrictions as a cause to travel. However, her husband was caught attempting to have their boat taken out of storage in Traverse City, a lakeside city three hours away from her home in Lansing. When told he was unable to get his boat out that weekend, he asked if his wife being the governor would make a difference.

While no one really knows whether the Whitmers actually were able to travel that weekend, or whether the trip was intended for just her husband, it is clear that the governor’s family believes a different set of rules apply to them compared to the rest of Michigan. Whitmer claims her husband planned to “rake leaves” at the lake that holiday weekend.

4. Gov. Tom Wolf, Pennsylvania

In Pennsylvania, much of the state is under “yellow phase'” restrictions, in which large gatherings of more than 25 people are prohibited. One of those counties is Dauphin, which houses the city of Harrisburg. Interestingly, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and substantially more than 24 others marched in protest of gun violence and racism in Harrisburg last week. Wolf even posted about it on twitter.

I’m at today’s March Against Injustice and Gun Violence 2020 in Harrisburg in solidarity with our community. Black lives matter. Racism must end. I am here to listen. pic.twitter.com/MoTYi7AtuW — Governor Tom Wolf (@GovernorTomWolf) June 3, 2020

5. Mayor Steve Adler, Austin, Texas

Despite a restrictive stay-at-home order, Black Lives Matter protests have erupted all over Austin, Texas. One of the marchers was Mayor Steve Adler. Interestingly, the city has allowed limited interactions between members of the same household and at essential businesses, but nothing more. Further, large public gatherings are expressly forbidden by the city, such as a crowded protest.

Looks to me like someone violated his own stay at home order. https://t.co/ieWLkvQ9oq — Mackenzie Kelly ❗️ (@mkelly007) June 8, 2020

6. Mayor Eric Garcetti, Los Angeles, California

Like many liberal politicians, LA Mayor Eric Garcetti took to the streets with Black Lives Matter protestors. He was photographed kneeling down among the crowd just days ago, without wearing a mask. LA County asks residents to cover their nose and mouth with a mask (or alternate form of cloth face covering) when in public near other people, while maintaining the social distance of 6 feet when at all possible and avoiding places where large groups are congregated together. Garcetti and other LA County politicians ask their residents to report their neighbors for the behavior exhibited by their mayor.

7. Mayor Ted Wheeler, Portland, Oregon

Oregon has been under a limited lockdown since May 15, which limits gatherings to 25 people. Like so many other cities with similar restrictions, the black lives matter protests have ignored those limits. Among the protesters in Portland is Mayor Ted Wheeler, who even spoke at the large Portland protest.

8. Mayor Riley Hill, Ontario, Oregon

Like his fellow mayor in Portland, Ontario Mayor Riley Hill participated the Black Lives Matter protests in his city, joining crowds in the hundreds. That’s certainly more than the legally permitted 25 people.

For many Democrats, it appears stay-at-home rules apply to thee, but not for me.

How The Slow Spread Of Radicalism Turned Portland Ungovernable,"Some violent protests, starting in Minneapolis and rapidly expanding to cities all over North America and abroad, have challenged local governments’ ability to keep the peace over the past two weeks. It was unsurprising that chaos erupted in Portland, Oregon.

How did Portland, a smallish Pacific-Northwest city in a state that was once known for its moderate politicians, become an epicenter of radical activism and inadequate governance?

Starting with the Wobblies in the early 20th century, a thread of radicalism began in the city. John Reed, a journalist and activist who became the leader of the Communist Labor Party, was born in Portland. Speeches were hosted in Portland in the 1920s by such luminaries as “Mother” Bloor, a temperance advocate and socialist feminist, and Trotskyist James Cannon.

The situation we see today, however, began in earnest in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as Portland was transitioning from a late-stage timber town to a high-tech and professional services center. Frequent anti-capitalism protests in the downtown area that had previously been mostly small groups walking down sidewalks, only occasionally crossing against traffic signals, grew larger and more organized.

Mark Kroeker’s Effect on Portland Police Practices

On May 1, 2000, a large May Day street demonstration was met with a forceful response from the Portland Police Bureau. The chief of police was at that time a man named Mark Kroeker, a veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department and a conservative Christian.

In Los Angeles, as deputy chief, he had been at the forefront of introducing community policing into the force after the 1992 riots, winning him widespread praise. However, after what seemed to be overly aggressive tactics against protesters, he quickly became a target for Portland’s increasingly influential activists.

In a fairly early example of cancel culture, an alternative newspaper, the Portland Alliance, located several decade-old audio tapes in which Kroeker had, in some addresses to a Christian police organization, made disparaging comments about homosexuality and promoted several other socially conservative views from a religious perspective. This sparked outrage in local media, and was the beginning of the end for Kroeker’s tenure in Portland.

In 2002, Kroeker gave medals to two officers who were involved in the fatal shooting of a patient at a psychiatric hospital. The patient had experienced an epileptic seizure on a bus, but had been misdiagnosed.

Also in 2002, another large protest broke out — this one anti-George W. Bush — in which participants were met with pepper spray and rubber bullets. A young African American woman was shot and killed in a stop to arrest another person for outstanding warrants. The woman had jumped from the back seat into the driver’s seat, and the officer said he felt the car move while he was partially inside. Kroeker suspended, but did not fire, the officer.

It was all finally too much, and Mayor Vera Katz finally accepted Kroeker’s resignation. She denied having asked for it.

Whatever the validity of the complaints against Kroeker, it was clear future chiefs would have to pass an intense examination and be continually challenged by the media and community watchdogs. Few can withstand the scrutiny for long. Portland is now on its ninth chief of police since Kroeker’s resignation in 2003, including three women and three African Americans.

Why Unlawful Actors Run Wild

Community activists have since kept up the pressure, no doubt emboldened by successfully running Kroeker out of town. The political environment has grown increasingly hostile to the Police Bureau, in part likely due to migration of like-minded people from across the country due to Portland’s reputation as an ideological haven for leftist activism.

Under Portland’s unusual city commission form of government, the mayor directly oversees the Police Bureau. Policing tactics and procedures, as a result of that mayoral oversight, have continually been scaled back in aggressiveness.

While few would argue with the need to be sure deadly or overwhelming physical force be used only when absolutely necessary, this environment has also resulted in a hesitancy to use almost any force to protect people and property against violent protesters.

This means un-permitted protests are simply contained, even when illegal activity occurs, such as blocking streets, vandalizing property, or even street fighting. The role of the police is mostly limited to minimizing violence, which often results in increased policing against non-protesters to keep them from “provoking” protesters by doing things like walking or driving nearby.

By 2016, these demonstrations became more and more destructive. In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, downtown rioters caused at least $1 million in damage over several days. The mayor at the time, Charlie Hales, cautioned protesters that walking onto freeways and blocking light rail lines is dangerous.

Also that year, during a “Don’t Shoot Portland” march, which opposed police using deadly force, blogger and photojournalist Michael Strickland pulled out his pistol when advanced on by several protesters, but did not shoot anyone. He was convicted of 20 gun charges (based on the number of protesters), sentenced to 40 days in jail, banned from owning firearms, and banned from video reporting for nearly a year.

In 2018, protesters camped out in front of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility just south of downtown, blocking Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees from entering. Mayor Ted Wheeler refused to allow Portland police to arrest or remove the protesters, who remained for eight days, until federal agents arrested nine of them and cleared the area.

This year, Wheeler, who has upheld the recent tradition of treating protesters with kid gloves despite vandalism, looting, and repeated violent outbursts from Antifa and local right-wing counterparts, is running for reelection. Because he did not get 50 percent of the vote in the May primary election, he will face off against the second-place finisher, Sarah Iannarone, who is perhaps best known for proclaiming “I am Antifa.”

Don’t expect changes any time soon.

If Only Our Christian Leaders Had The Fiery Devotion Of The Protesters,"American Christians saw something these past two weeks we’re not used to: People standing for their beliefs in the face of coronavirus.

In cities and towns nationwide, millions crowded streets and parks, marching, singing and for some after dark, rioting. Many had been sheltered in place for nearly three months, carefully avoiding their neighbors, watching Netflix, wearing pajamas, and when outside, fleeing into traffic for fear of unmasked joggers.

But this — this was something they could get behind. It was too important not to. The collapse of the economy, sacrifice of small business owners, suspension of free assembly, delay of elections, censorship of scientific dissent, and strong-armed banning of public worship were necessary for public health, and those who conscientiously objected were murderously evil. Protesting for social justice alone, we’ve learned, maintained the status of an enshrined American right.

And the people in the streets weren’t alone. On Monday, the archbishop of Washington, D.C. called the city’s clergy and the Knights of Columbus to join him in Lafayette Park, the home of the White House and the historic Christian church that rioters set on fire the week before. “Clergy and religious,” his letter reads, “please wear cassock, habit or black clericals.” The participation of the Catholic Church would be bold.

God-fearing laymen, women, and clergy joined him, some making beautiful points and showing a happy religious presence in the public square. Much of what was ordered was made good.

Of course, it didn’t actually take much courage to be there: Almost the entire city is politically aligned with the protests. But more to the point, the mayor has made clear she stands with protesters against the president, and would do anything in her power to protect the kind of mass gatherings she had cracked down on just days before.

A number of mayors and governors across the country have genuflected before the sacred American right to protest, with some of the harshest enforcers of mandatory lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders, like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmore and New Jersey’s Phil Murphy, joining in the festivities. The last failed Republican candidate for president, Mitt Romney, joined marchers as well.

Corporate media, long a stronghold of secular, liberal values, and since March a shrill and accusatory voice against shutdown restraint, applauded it all.

As Sunday’s sun set and the Feast of the Holy Trinity drew to a close, however, public Mass, along with other Christian worship services in the capital, remained forbidden. As another Sunday approaches, there is no sign to expect any change in this. In the face of “the scientific consensus,” Christians, who have fought wars including the American Revolution to enshrine our right to worship how we see fit have acquiesced over and over again to the demands of civil authorities who are openly hostile to our beliefs.

Christian leaders who were quick to break social distancing guidelines to stand with Black Lives Matter protesters appear loathe to fight back against the ban on church services. The Sacraments — a necessity for salvation; gifts from God administered by his church — take a back seat to popular social justice. And while it is a sacred duty of Christians to fight for peace, truth, and justice, and to pray for the souls of the departed, it is also true that we must fight for our bedrock beliefs when it isn’t easy — when our secular leaders and their allies in the media are against us. Taking the unpopular line is a constant demand today just as it was at the beginning.

But for the faithful, the ease with which the protests went off is beside the point. While the civil authorities sanctioned these actions and they were popular with the media, is there much doubt the true believers would have gathered regardless? Had the mayor said you cannot protest the murder of George Floyd until coronavirus was over, would people have stayed home? Had CNN accused them of putting the country in danger, would they have listened?

It’s clear they would not have. While a number of those joining the protests were there because it was easy and popular, a good deal have a zealous commitment to their movement — and are willing to stand for it, to fight for it, and to take great risks for it. They are on fire with the righteousness of their cause.

As a faithful sinner, I find myself wishing our leaders had the same fire. But as I and my neighbors remain barred from the Holy Eucharist by our mayor, I fear that they do not.

Welcome To Your New World Order: A Rundown Of Woke Insanity,"America is in the midst of a new cultural civil war that for years has been brewing under the surface as left-wing academics breed aggressively woke children now permeating throughout the nation’s mainstream institutions.

Since the killing of George Floyd at the knees of a Minneapolis police officer sparked the worst outbreak of civil unrest in decades, protests that grew out of demanding justice for Floyd morphed into a dark operation to fundamentally transform the nation’s psyche, convincing the people of their own inherent evil from ancestral wrongs.

Battle lines are clearly being drawn, where the radical left has offered Americans a binary choice in a false dichotomy between total submission or unrelenting exile with those opposed to the new woke world order cast out of society as unrepentant racists refusing to atone for past generations’ sins. No justice, no peace. Silence is violence. You’re either with us, or against us. There is no middle ground. Which side of history are you on?

Of course in reality, (and sanity), it’s clearly not that black and white, but if recent events show us anything, they expose that this mentality is no longer one of a fringe left-wing movement but a central tenet of our mainstream culture of what it means to make “progress.” America, according to the now only acceptable narrative, is an irredeemably racist society that was built for the sole purpose to oppress. It has never been great. Anyone who thinks otherwise, is as guilty as the slaveholders who lived more than 150 years ago.

For as long as the nation continues to go mad, purging books, movies, statues and history in its own cultural revolution launched by woke elites, The Federalist will be chronicling its destruction, updating this list with each new event in its collapse. The Federalist will also be keeping tally of those fired from lack of allegiance to the new woke overlords found here.

Immigrant-Owned Louisville Restaurant Gets Demands Letter From BLM To Improve Diversity

An immigrant-owned business in Louisville, Ky., saw protestors gather in support of the restaurant in early August after a Black Lives Matter group sent them a letter with a list of demands that included filling at least 23 percent of positions with black employees and ensuring at least 23 percent of inventory came from black retailers while providing diversity training at least twice a year.

According to the Courier-Journal, demonstrators told the restaurant owner Fernando Martinez that he “better put [the list of demands] on the door so your business is not f–d with.”

“How can I be called a bigot and a racist when my family is black? When my son is gay?” Martinez said to a crowd of supportive protestors. “I’m the proud father of a gay son, and I’m gonna fight for him against anybody.”

You Must Now Explain Why You Stand For The Anthem

Kneeling for the national anthem at sporting events to protest America as an evil and racist empire was once something a few players did on occasion. Now, it appears those who stand in respect for the nation must explain themselves.

AOC Condemns Sainted Catholic Priest As White Supremacist

Freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York complained about the presence of a statue commemorating Hawaii’s Father Damien in the halls of Capitol Hill as celebrating white supremacy.

“This is what patriarchy and white supremacist culture looks like!” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on a story posted to Instagram story. “It’s not radical or crazy to understand the influence white supremacist culture has historically had in our overall culture & how it impacts the present day.”

Father Damien however, voluntarily spent years caring for exiled patients dying of leprosy until dying of the disease himself.

What about all the black-on-black crime that’s happening in the community?”

Democratic Senator: We Need To Consider Destroying The Nation’s Founder

Illinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth said people need to keep an open mind when it comes to desecrating the memory of the nation’s most prominent founding father, George Washington.

Chris Cillizza Isn’t Actually Following American Politics

In an attempt to discredit President Trump’s patriotic parlance at a pillar of American pride near the peak of Mount Rushmore, CNN’s political editor-at-large, Chris Cillizza went line-by-line of the address and titled his piece, “The 28 most outrageous lines from Donald Trump’s Mount Rushmore speech.”

Among the lines Cillizza took issue with, was of Trump pledging to protect the iconic monument.

“I am here as your President to proclaim before the country and before the world, this monument will never be desecrated,” Trump said.

“Uh, was there some sort of movement to tear down Mount Rushmore I was unaware of or…?”

In fact, monuments to the four presidents enshrined on the mountain have been desecrated or destroyed across the country, and 44 percent of self-identifying liberals have voiced support for blowing up the mountain, an idea seemingly embraced by the Democratic Party.

“President Trump delivered a dark and divisive speech at Mount Rushmore, leaning into the culture wars and barely mentioning the pandemic,” the New York Times pushed out in a breaking news update moments after the prime time address.

Coronavirus Is Woke-Sensitive

On June 1, dozens of public health experts signed an open letter blaming white supremacy on societal illnesses applauding the protesters for combating the true pandemic without regard for the novel Wuhan coronavirus that shut down the nation causing irreparable damage in the process.

“As public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risk for COVID-19 transmission… This should not be confused with a permissive stance on all gatherings, particularly protests against stay-home orders,” they wrote.

In other words, protests are fine as long as they remain in the name of social justice. Any other form of expression however, must be banned, for public health that is. Surely that’s a convincing message to the millions of Americans forced down to food pantries because the government deemed their life’s work as non-essential, or to the families unable to say goodbye to loved ones because funerals of more than 10 people were too dangerous.

So it turns out viruses are woke-sensitive. If you are protesting against racism, you won’t get Covid-19 or spread it to others. However, If you are protesting the lockdown so you can work or open your business, you are a murderer who is selfishly spreading Covid. #science pic.twitter.com/0McBofRGtr — Rachel Campos-Duffy (@RCamposDuffy) June 7, 2020

NYC Instructed Contact Tracing Team To Ignore Protests,"As public health officials warn of a new surge in coronavirus cases following mass protests in densely populated cities, the New York City mayor’s office has instructed its contact tracing team not to ask tested individuals if they participated in the crowded demonstrations.

“No person will be asked proactively if they attended a protest,” Avery Cohen, a spokesperson for Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office told The City newspaper.

Contact tracers will instead ask whether those tested are able to “recall ‘contacts’ and individuals they may have exposed,” Cohen told the paper, while also requesting information on “close contacts” including anyone within 6 feet for more than 10 minutes. Even though this definition includes the hundreds of people an infected person likely crossed paths with during the crowded Black Lives Matter protests in recent weeks, contact tracers will not be inquiring about their involvement.

“Any person has the opportunity to share this info over the course of their interview with a tracer,” Cohen wrote in a tweet sent to The Federalist when asked for comment. “Large anonymous environments where you may not be able to recall a close contact pose a natural challenge to tracing, which is why we’re urging all NYers to get tested.”

1. Any person has the opportunity to share this info over the course of their interview with a tracer. 2. Large, anonymous environments where you may not be able to recall a close contact pose a natural challenge to tracing, which is why we’re urging all NYers to get tested. — Avery Cohen (@CohenAvery) June 15, 2020

While the anonymous environment the protests presented might make it difficult to identify those who could have been exposed, excluding questions on protest participation hinder the ability of public health officials to conclude whether the massive demonstrations played a role in spreading the virus.

As families across the country were prohibited from properly saying goodbye to dying or deceased loved ones because the government deemed it too dangerous, enormous protests violating social distancing guidelines were able to proceed even featuring public officials ordering the rest of their constituents to stay home.

After two weeks of protesting in the nation’s capital, Washington D.C. reported a new spike in cases over the weekend under phase one of reopening announcing that its new surge would delay the district’s calendar for moving on to phase two.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/15/new-york-city-instructed-contact-tracing-team-not-to-ask-about-protest-participation/,2020-06-15
Contact Tracing Is A Fiasco Rejected By Most Americans,"There were supposed to be armies. Grand armies of contact tracers crisscrossing every county in the country on the hunt for the Chinese virus. This was the key we were told to a safe reopening, they have been telling us this since back when they still told us not to wear masks. Soldiers in this army would interview anyone who tested positive and track down the people they spent time with.

Supposedly serious people with TV shows and everything said with straight faces that we might need 100,000 contact tracers, maybe more, maybe everyone needs to be a contact tracer. In New York, Michael Bloomberg stepped out of ubiquitous presidential ads (remember that?) right into being charged with leading the new public health Manhattan Project. The result looks more like a middling 4th grade science fair entry.

Oregon reported last week that that the state has no idea how many contact tracers it has in the field. In New York, several upstate counties are opting out of the program because their own local policies work better for them. Meanwhile in Gotham, Mayor Bill de Blasio betrayed the deeply unserious nature of his tracing efforts by telling his tracers not to ask if people who test positive had been at a political protest.

The rationale used by the most unpopular mayor in the history of cities was basically that its too many people trace anyway. So, first of all, most people don’t attend protests all by themselves, many go in groups, why on earth would a contact tracer not need to know about those people? Is this another case where social justice provides immunity to the virus? The upshot is that everyone has to tell the state everyone they come in contact with, unless you went to a protest, then you’re good.

So the brick and mortar, pavement-crunching approach to contact tracing is off to a horrible start. Lo and behold people aren’t nuts about public officials coming to their house to grill them on their associations. Good. But, could there be another way? Could technology come to the rescue as it has begun to do in other countries? No.

Last week a poll showed that 7 in 10 Americans would decline to install a contact-tracing app on their phone. This at a time in American life when you can’t get 7 in 10 Americans to agree that people drink coffee in the morning. But the best part of the poll is the other 3.

The 3 who are apoplectic in their indignation. They ask so little, “it’s just an app, and if it saves one life.” There are limits to what the American people will do for safety, having the state track all our movements blows past those limits into the next town.

What has dawned on the American people but has yet to be reflected on by most of our political leaders is that until there is a vaccine we have to accept risk, understand that lives will be lost, and get the country back to normal. The protests proved this beyond any doubt. New York Gov. Cuomo can’t logically tell people not to mingle with drinks on the street and de Blasio can’t tell Jews to get the hell out of the playground while they both celebrate massive protests.

Contact tracing is the road trip to San Francisco that every Gen Xer never took. You’d stay up late, rip some bong hits, plan it all out, where to stop, who to visit, but it never actually happened. Instead you went back to your normal life. Which is exactly what Americans need to do right now.

Those who insist America cannot fully reopen without robust contact tracing are holding the country hostage to a pipe dream. There is a reason why it was America that sparked the protests that destroyed the lockdown all across the world. It is because we are not a very compliant people. Whether in Michigan or in Minnesota and for a variety of reasons, Americans will protest and fight for their basic rights.

If government and scientists want to experiment with contact tracing to learn more about the spread of the virus through volunteers, great, why not. But if they try to make reopening conditional on their vision of complete enough tracing then they are putting roller-skates on a goalpost and keeping us in the dark about when the lights come back on. No more excuses. Open the country.

Americans Should Never Again Comply With Pandemic Lockdown Orders,"We’re told a second wave of coronavirus infections is coming. As businesses open back up and states relax lockdown orders, the number of new cases is ticking up in a handful of states. We’ve heard warnings in recent days from the Centers for Disease Control and various public health experts and elected officials that a new series of lockdowns might be necessary.

What these experts and officials don’t seem to realize is that Americans will never comply with their lockdown orders again. They have burned their credibility to the ground, and they no longer have the moral authority to tell us what to do.

Simply put, the people in charge have shown themselves to be rank hypocrites who care more about politics than science. For months, we were told that large gatherings were deadly because of the coronavirus, but when protests broke out in late May, large gatherings were suddenly okay.

The exact day the experts lost their credibility was June 4, when more than 1,000 public health workers signed a letter claiming the protests were “vital to the national public health and to the threatened health specifically of black people in the United States.” The woke corporate press scrambled to assure us this wasn’t hypocritical at all, and that “health is about more than simply remaining free of coronavirus infection,” as a pair of epidemiologists put it in The Atlantic.

That’s a curious argument to make after forced business closures and lockdown orders destroyed tens of millions of American jobs, ruined countless businesses and livelihoods, and caused a sharp uptick in suicides, drug overdoses, and domestic abuse. Never mind the compelling research showing that lockdowns are overall much worse for public health than the coronavirus.

But if public health experts cared about more than just steering clear of the coronavirus at any cost, you wouldn’t have known it based on their pandemic policies—that is, until the George Floyd protests and Black Lives Matter (BLM) rallies came along. Here at last was something more important than stopping the virus.

And it wasn’t just public health experts. Elected officials were all too willing to use their power to promote ideology at the expense of public health—and then turn around and punish disfavored groups in the name of public health.

Witness the appalling double standard of men like New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio. On Monday, city workers welded shut the gates of a Brooklyn playground frequented by members of the Hasidic Jewish community in Williamsburg. They claimed it was necessary to stop the spread of the coronavirus. But this happened one day after the city allowed a massive “Black Trans Lives Matter” rally in Brooklyn’s Grand Army Plaza that attracted thousands of protesters packed together in close quarters.

Officially, large gatherings are still banned in New York as part of the city’s pandemic response. So are playgrounds, including the one whose gates were welded shut Monday, because the city “found a lack of regard for social distancing” at the parks, according to a de Blasio spokeswoman.

There are two only possible conclusions here. Either de Blasio somehow believes that catching COVID-19 isn’t a risk if you’re at a BLM rally, or he doesn’t actually care about preventing the spread of the virus and wants to use the pandemic to exercise arbitrary power over New Yorkers, punishing those who defy him and indulging those who share his political views.

Either way, no one should take anything de Blasio says about the pandemic seriously, and no New Yorker should ever again obey a lockdown order issued from his office.

Their Hypocrisy Knows No Bounds

The same story is playing out all over the country. Mayors who did nothing to prevent mass protests in recent weeks—and in some cases joined protesters, in violation of their own lockdown orders—have maintained draconian restrictions on other types of gatherings, stricktly limiting the number of people who can congregate in restaurants, shops, gyms, and houses of worship.

In Washington, D.C., which has seen days on end of massive BLM protests, some numbering in the hundreds of thousands, Mayor Muriel Bowser on Wednesday announced the city would begin “phase 2” of its reopening next week. For restaurants, that means no more than 50 percent capacity, tables six feet apart, and all diners must be seated at the tables.

Same thing in Los Angeles, where thousands converged on Hollywood Boulevard Sunday for a Black Trans Lives Matter rally. Video footage of the event showed attendees packed tightly together on the street, with no possibility of social distancing. According to news reports, there were no police present at the rally, and the city made no effort to stop it or limit attendance.

But like D.C. and other cities, Los Angeles still has strict pandemic policies for businesses, churches, and just about everything else. For houses of worship, the city has issued elaborate guidelines for reopening, including a limit to the total number of people, clergy, and parishioners combined, who can attend a service: 25 percent of building capacity or 100 people, whichever is lower.

Why these restrictions should apply to churches but not to massive political protests, the city does not say. It’s all very confusing.

BLM Rallies Are Safe, Trump Rallies Are Not?

The starkest contradiction of all might be the reactions to President Trump’s rally planned for Saturday in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Local health officials are warning it could become a disastrous “super spreader” event—a term media outlets like The New York Times have been eager to repeat under headlines warning, “Trump’s rally in Tulsa Could Spread Virus,” using language they would never use to describe any of the large-scale protests, rallies, and riots nationwide.

Some media pundits make no apologies for this obvious double standard. Tuesday on ABC’s “The View,” Joy Behar claimed Trump doesn’t care about his supporters’ health and safety because he’s willing to hold a rally amid the pandemic, and that his rally is more risky than the protests because it’ll be indoors, whereas the protests are mostly outdoors. Okay, Joy.

Public officials in Tulsa have also adopted this double standard. The mayor and a cadre of other officials have publicly implored Trump not to go ahead with the rally, citing concerns about COVID-19. But these same officials dared not say a word against recent BLM rallies held in the city and suburbs, including a large one that got out of control and spilled onto a busy highway, where several protesters were injured.

The double standard is everywhere and undeniable, and the message is clear: the experts and the people in charge only care about the pandemic when it’s politically convenient. They’re guided by the science, they tell us, but only if the science doesn’t get in the way of their virtue-signaling about Black Lives Matter.

They care about public health, but only up to a point. They care much more about being woke. And if you want to go to a big rally, it’s only safe if it’s the right kind of rally.

Enough of this. Americans should never listen to these people again.

Capitol Hill Organized Protest: Vegan Utopia Or Urban Anarchy?,"One week ago, a police precinct and six blocks of downtown Seattle’s Capitol Hill district were taken over by Antifa and Black Lives Matter rioters. The area, formally known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ), has now officially been renamed the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP), but will this clever rebrand be enough to put a more positive spin on the neighborhood takeover?

Allies in the media aided in spinning the image of anarchist squatters into harmless “protesters,” but social media footage tells another story. Namely, forcibly removing the police, erecting border fencing, and most ironically for a group demanding open borders in the US, creating organized checkpoints for entry to their “protest”.

Despite reports of violence and looting in CHOP, CNN and Politico maintain that CHOP is “peaceful,” with some outlets even contending we need more places in America like CHOP. The mayor of Seattle has referred to CHOP as a harmless “block party” and predicted the coming months in CHOP would be “the summer of love”. Meanwhile, in the absence of law enforcement, armed citizens are policing the streets. However, when it comes to security in CHOP, there doesn’t seem to be a consensus, with some residents believing it should be a ‘no cop co-op‘ while others menacingly tote AK-47s declaring, “We are the police now!”

So, is CHOP a vegan utopia, a safe, cop-free space for millennial artists and slam poets? Or is it an insane experiment in urban anarchy? Let’s take a look.



Here, a “citizen of the autonomous zone” gets a taste of policing in “police-less” CHOP:

Media Raises Hysteria Over Trump Tulsa Rally After Celebrating Protests,"The mainstream media suddenly cares about social distancing again.

On Saturday, President Donald Trump announced plans to hold his first major campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma since the start of the novel Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. The event was originally planned for June 19 but was rescheduled to June 20 as not to conflict with the holiday on “Juneteenth.”

As Tulsa prepares for the rally, the Trump campaign announced it had received more than 1 million requests for tickets in an early sign that a silent majority backing the president surely exists, even as his poll numbers decline under nationwide social unrest.

The media however, is spiking fears that the large gathering will be a deadly “super-spreader” for COVID-19 even after celebrating the mass protests that took over the nation’s cities and even drew participation from woke politicians.

“Trump’s Tulsa rally raises concerns over exacerbating racial tensions, becoming a coronavirus ‘super-spreader’ event,” warned a headline in The Hill.

“Why Trump’s Tulsa rally could become a COVID-19 superspreading event,” read another in Vox.

“Trump’s Rally in Tulsa Could Spread Virus,” one headline in the New York Times read plainly.

Several Tulsa attorneys even sued to stop the “super-spreader” event, which a judge promptly denied.

When it came to recent weeks of mass demonstrations in the nation’s cities however, protestors were celebrated while the violence from the riots was downplayed, even as millions of Americans remained banned from properly saying goodbye to loved ones because the government deemed it too dangerous.

There was little to no social distancing shaming from the press on the account of the protestors, and when concerns were raised over spreading the novel coronavirus, it was almost always framed in the form a question.

“Will the protests cause a spike in COVID-19 cases? Wait two weeks,” headlined the Philadelphia Inquirer.

“Will the protests be super-spreader events for the coronavirus? Experts say it’s too soon to tell,” read one in Fortune.

“Why protests aren’t as dangerous for spreading coronavirus as you might think,” explained The Guardian. If that were true – and it might be – one would think in a sane world that everything outdoors would be open. Even as Trump’s Tulsa rally is slated to take place indoors, the media made no qualms about the indoor memorial services for Floyd, who was rightly put to rest surrounded by loved ones in a luxury unavailable to the rest of the country.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/19/media-raises-hysteria-over-trump-tulsa-rally-after-celebrating-mass-protests/,2020-06-19
Protestors Topple George Washington In Portland,"It doesn’t matter if he was the first U.S. president who led the nation through the American War of Independence, George Washington is cancelled too.

Protestors in Portland late Thursday night continued the great purge of the 21st century woke revolution in an all-out progressive effort to radically rewrite American history by wiping out the nation’s legacy leaders. After social justice warriors targeted real social justice warriors, activists have now focused their fury on the father of the country: George Washington.

The outrage over George Washington stems from the first president’s engagement with slavery, the nation’s darkest sin, though if progressive wokesters were being consistent in their rage, other historical racists such as Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Betty Friedan would warrant relentless cancellation too among others.

In Tennessee, the elite all-girls school Harpeth Hall near Nashville, which boasts famous alumni including actress Reese Witherspoon and singer Amy Grant declared Thursday that it would no longer hold its annual George Washington Celebration because it’s not “relevant” to the institution’s historical curriculum. Jess Hill, the head of the school told the Tennessee Star that the expensive institution decided to discontinue the celebration for three primary reasons:

“It is not consistent with or relevant to the way that we teach history today.” “It does not demonstrate the significant role that women, people of color, and other underrepresented groups play in our nation’s history.” “A growing number of students, faculty, staff, and alumnae are expressing their discomfort with this tradition.”

Further north in Chicago, protestors also defaced a monument to George Washington in the city’s Washington Park.

My Kids’ Public School Held A Workshop Teaching The Police Are Racists,"For years, conservatives have been sounding the alarm about anti-American indoctrination in public schools. They’ve pointed out the dangers of mainstreaming of Howard Zinn’s A People’s History of the United States. They’ve exposed the racialism of the 1619 Project. Unfortunately, however, the situation in public schools is far worse than the mere presence of propaganda.

Theoretically, parents can resist the dominant paradigm by explaining that it’s just the teacher’s opinion, and providing a counter-narrative at home. But once teachers demand performative activism from their students and tell them how to feel and what to do, an entirely different level of child manipulation and scholastic depravity is reached.

I recently tuned into a Zoom workshop taught by Oakland-based educational consultants Soul Shoppe. The class, attended by more than 300 families, was advertised through our school districts as a way for elementary school kids to “share what’s in your emotional balloon.” According to the promotional email distributed by Soul Shoppe, “we all have feelings about the racism, protests, and violence that are occurring in our world at the moment.”

Soul Shoppe reasoned it’s particularly important to talk to kids about racism because “Young children are hard-wired in their brains to notice difference and to categorize it…So it is vital during early childhood to put some context around making sense of differences.” What I saw on Zoom, however, was the hardening of preexisting prejudices.

The Children of the Woke

With the school year over, this class was held on a volunteer basis, and participants were likely — as I like to call them — the “children of the woke.” Yet because the nonprofit does a variety of anti-bullying presentations in schools around East Bay, we can expect this workshop replicated in brick and mortar classrooms come fall.

During the workshop, the predominantly white, elementary school-age kids were asked how they feel about racism. Several responded with “sadness, fear, and anger.” An adult employee of Soul Shoppe agreed that racism makes her feel “afraid, sad, and angry, and lonely.” The workshop leader agreed, stating, “Right now so many of us feel sad, angry, and left out…because of the color of our skin,” later adding, “Right now people like me and Mr. A [a co-host] are getting hurt because of the color of our skin.”

Just what he meant by “getting hurt” was never specified. One of the middle age co-hosts, Mr. Arek, did mention getting mistakenly stopped by police when they were looking for someone else, and being denied service at a café. He also mentioned a black boy who cried after being told that he couldn’t be an astronaut because of the color of his skin.

The big unmentionable in that Zoom meeting was George Floyd. I don’t think it’s appropriate to show children the video of his death, but I don’t think that the general details are too awful to mention and don’t need to be masked with euphemisms like “getting hurt.” I sensed the presumption that the underage participants share the prevailing narrative spread in the aftermath of his death, namely, that black Americans are routinely hunted down by Caucasian cops.

After the brief discussion of how one ought to feel about the unmentionable event, the children were instructed to grab somebody near them to say, “That’s a lot of feelings!” During the hour, the minors were also instructed to chant “I want to be an ally” — the word Arek defined, incorrectly, as “an upstander” — and “We have to protest! We have to fight for what’s right!”

Because at no point were the youngsters asked to pledge anything else, the logical conclusion is that the entire point of the exercise was not so much to talk about feelings but to have the K-5 students commit to a certain type of political activity.

It’s About Cultivating Anger

Children were asked if they know how to protest, and one boy volunteered a ditty he’s been practicing: “No justice, no peace / No racist police.” Unsurprisingly, the workshop leaders didn’t object to this characterization of law enforcement, though Arek did suggest taking a deep breath before a march to avoid getting carried away with anger.

But as much as feelings were allowed in the meeting, cultivating anger loomed large. Growing up Jewish in the Soviet Union, I have been on the receiving end of multiple racist incidents. While I had many feelings about that, I don’t think anger was one of them, at least not at the time. Soul Shoppe, on the other hand, affirmed something the kids already learned from parents and the media: Anger is the natural reaction to racism.

It’s probably better to feel angry than to internalize it, but convincing an average seven-year-old that anger is a good emotion is likely to be damaging in the long run. If the goal is to explain away violence, rioting, and sadomasochist rituals taking place at the Floyd marches, and to possibly get the kids to participate in this type of activism in the future, then teaching them that racially charged anger is righteous — even if it results in destruction and death — seems like a logical choice. At the very least, anger can help to boost turnout at the marches.

That said, I didn’t get an angry vibe from the participants who, as expected from that age group, were eager to please parents and teachers. Yet there was a clear consensus that they ought to be angry and “prove it” by turning out for street-level political action.

The children of woke on that Zoom meeting seemed to be deliberately misled about key information about the experiences of black Americans with police. Floyd’s death is an extreme outlier incident, and there was never any doubt that the cop who is alleged to have murdered him will be brought to justice. The vast majority of interactions between blacks and police are amicable. Moreover, it’s far from clear that the white cop who allegedly killed Floyd was animated by racism. If adults want children to get angry on their behalf, the least they can do is be honest.

This is not the first time I had to deal with calls to protest and performative activism in American public schools. The most egregious case was last school year when my seventh grader’s English teacher informed class that raised fist, the Black Panther salute, means “solidarity,” and that the students in her classroom would be raising their fists in place of the “quiet coyote” sign. Requiring that sort of display of political activism is exactly like something one would have witnessed in the Soviet Union, so I pulled her out of that class.

The Next Level of Indoctrination

It’s one thing to saturate a child in lies about the country, and another to require him to act on the brainwashing, practice protesting, and feign feelings. In effect, my child’s teacher was rehearsing protests, so if her students ever find themselves at a real one, they will know what to do.

Why should parents be concerned with schools churning out social justice mobs? Although a few might later become the “tenured radicals,” most youthful protesters don’t do well in life. At a protest, a young person surrenders his individuality to the crowd. He is engulfed by the ecstasy of belonging to the mob, and many find the feeling simply too thrilling to return to normal life.

There are teenagers in this country who had the last three months of school waived, and after being cooped up and deprived of social interaction, are now roaming the streets, at best clenching their fists and chanting something about “racist cops,” and at worst looting and destroying art. After imagining themselves as revolutionaries, are they going to go back to algebra in August?

Despite our past sins — slavery being the worst one — we have a rich tradition of anti-racism in America. If that’s what we want to teach, teachers can read Mark Twain with students, and help them understand difficult passages. If, however, the goal is to produce cogs for the political mob machine, we can continue telling children to be angry while depriving them of education, factual information about current events, and demanding action.

Scenes From The 'Autonomous Zone' Outside The White House,"WASHINGTON, D.C.—I arrived a little late and wondered if I left too early. By the time I made it to Lafayette Square, Andrew Jackson’s statue seemed safe, yet mounting tensions suggested there was more to come.

I ran from my apartment to the White House after seeing videos of the crowd’s attempt to topple Jackson, and got there just as they had been pushed back to 16th and H Street, an intersection that has seen little rest from demonstrations in the month since George Floyd’s killing. People were being treated for chemical irritants by the group’s medics.

https://www.instagram.com/tv/CBwfVDtloDM/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link

Park police in riot gear blocked off Lafayette Square, holding a steady line on H. Demonstrators screamed obscenities in their faces. One man with a bullhorn shouted that he was going to “f-ck” a particular officer’s wife. A white man called a black officer a “traitor to his people.”

A few protesters stood in front of the police and blew marijuana smoke in their direction, saying they were blowing back a “gas” of their own. One man in a a bandana asked for whom I was reporting, promptly telling me I was not welcome upon hearing my answer.

Little was said about Donald Trump, although he was the subject of signs. Angry outbursts were directed more frequently at Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser.

A couple hundred protesters milled about in the humidity and drizzling rain, having established a “Black House Autonomous Zone” outside the vandalized St. John’s Episcopal Church, spray painting “BHAZ” on the historic columns, and pitching a small tent village around its perimeter. They hung homemade posters from street signs and trees. Tents were stocked with medical supplies.

The crowd was young, mostly people in their twenties and thirties, with many dressed in Antifa-like gear that suggested they came ready for a clash: goggles, helmets, full face masks. Speaking of face masks, with the pandemic ongoing, some demonstrators kept masks fastened over their mouths, but social distancing was impossible, and plenty of protestors were shouting loudly into the crowd.

Agitators lingered near the police line, using their proximity to verbally berate the officers. Black cops seemed to bear the brunt of the harassment, repeatedly being shamed for their career choice.

Some protestors asked each officer to identify him- or herself. At one point around 9:00 p.m., a scuffle flared up on H Street, sending the crowd (myself included) sprinting away from the police as a few loud pops could be heard at the scene of the conflict, although there appeared to be no major injuries.

Very tense scene outside the White House. Scuffle at the line of police on H St about five minutes ago. pic.twitter.com/dPLC4Vfu1c — Emily Jashinsky (@emilyjashinsky) June 23, 2020

A fire lit in the middle of H Street illuminated the group’s tactical disagreements. There seemed to be widespread agreement among the protesters that it should be put out. The flames were extinguished shortly after they were lit, with one man assuring police it had been taken care of.

Some protesters pleaded with others to stop throwing objects at police from the back of the group because it led to the people up front getting teargassed; others disputed that protesters were throwing anything. A rumor reached the front of the protest that demonstrators were telling on their overly aggressive peers. Seasoned veterans shouted that transgressors should be corrected, not exposed.

If any clashes broke out, the protest’s ostensible leaders wanted to make sure they could claim officers were in the wrong, lashing out disproportionately at supposedly peaceful demonstrators. It was a chaotic scene, but had an underlying sense of organization, suggesting the group is intentional and plans to keep the area formally dubbed “Black Lives Matter Plaza” occupied, setting the stage for more conflict right on the president’s doorstep.

"Brett Favre Is Crazy To Equate Pat Tillman, Colin Kaepernick's Patriotism","Celebrities, corporations, and politicians have rushed in to preemptively absolve themselves of racism accusations by pandering to the Black Lives Matter movement’s narrative. Most recently, legendary Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre’s interview with TMZ Sports demonstrated that any and all sense of decency, reality, and perspective has been abandoned for this narrative.

While discussing the former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick — who became the pre-eminent “taking a knee” activist when he began kneeling during the national anthem at football games to protest racial injustice — Favre made a comparison so absurd and offensive that NFL medics should reconsider their policies regarding brain injuries. According to TMZ Sports, Favre “believes Kaepernick will go down as a legend for what he’s done to combat systemic racism.”

“It’s not easy for a guy his age — black or white, Hispanic, whatever — to stop something that you’ve always dreamed of doing, and put it on hold, maybe forever, for something that you believe in,” Favre said. “I can only think of — right off the top of my head — Pat Tillman is another guy that did something similar. And we regard him as a hero. So I’d assume that hero status will be stamped with Kaepernick as well.”

Pat Tillman was a NFL player who turned down a multimillion-dollar contract with the Arizona Cardinals in 2002 to enlist in the U.S. Army in the aftermath of 9/11. Tillman joined the Army Rangers and served several tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. On April 22, 2004, Tillman was killed in the line of duty. Tillman is an American hero who sacrificed both his sporting career and his life in service of his country.

Conversely, Kaepernick is a former NFL player whose activism began from the bench as his career declined, resulting in him going unsigned as a free agent.

“To blame Kaepernick’s unemployment on his protest is to misread the way NFL teams make personnel decisions,” said Kevin Seifert, an NFL writer for ESPN. “Teams are swayed first by a player’s potential (or lack thereof) to help them win. Protest or not, Kaepernick would be under contract now if he had played demonstrably better in recent years.”

Despite his waning abilities as a quarterback and inflammatory acts of protest, including wearing socks depicting police officers as pigs, Kaepernick has benefited from the profitable business of professional activism, netting an endorsement deal with Nike with the infamous phrase “Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything. #JustDoIt.”

Tillman believed in something and sacrificed everything. Kaepernick believes in something, but has sacrificed little to nothing. Indeed, the only things Kaepernick has sacrificed are the repeated opportunities the NFL gavee him to reignite his career, despite his average performance as a player. Why, when offered a private training session in 2019, did Kaepernick decide not to attend? Perhaps because the theory of victimhood is more powerful than the reality of sporting inability.

The issue here is not Kaepernick’s right to protest, his methods of protest, or even his petulant demand to play in the NFL while making it clear he prefers to remain an activist. The issue is the disrespect to Tillman’s memory by likening his sacrifice to Kaepernick’s pursuit of fame and financial success.

To compare Tillman’s ultimate heroism to Kaepernick’s lucrative activism is as absurd as comparing Favre’s prowess on the football field to Kaepernick’s average career. Tillman gave his life for his beliefs. Kaepernick has become a millionaire for his. Tillman is a hero. Kaepernick is not.

"Wisconsin Mobs Beat Up Gay Lawmaker, Set Fire To Home, Invade Offices","MADISON — Wisconsin’s two largest cities were awash in violence Tuesday and into early Wednesday morning as “peaceful” Black Lives Matter protesters in Madison toppled iconic, progressive statues and beat up an openly gay state senator, while a Milwaukee mob set fire to a home and injured several police and a firefighter.

Wisconsin is out of control, and it is reaping the lawless fruit that pandering liberals have sown.

Long after the carnage quieted and state Sen. Tim Carpenter (D-Milwaukee) was recovering from his many injuries by the mob that badly beat him, the feckless Gov. Tony Evers “warned” he would send in the National Guard to protect state buildings. Too late.

By the time Tony decided he might get tough, protesters had torn down and destroyed the two legendary statues that have long guarded the State Capitol. They ripped down and soiled the famous, seven-foot Forward statue, a proud symbol of progress created by a Wisconsin female artist nearly 130 years ago.

Then they proceeded to drag down and decapitate a statue of Hans Christian Heg, a Union colonel who fought and died in the Civil War in large part because he abhorred slavery. They dumped what was left of the statue in Lake Monona. All in the name of “social justice”?

The trouble began when police dared to arrest a Black Lives Matter “activist” who decided to charge into a downtown Madison restaurant with a baseball bat and a bullhorn screaming at white patrons and accusing them of being racist.

“Devonere Johnson, 28, was arrested after causing a disturbance in a restaurant on the Capitol Square, according to Madison police and video of the incident. Videos of the arrest — some circulating on social media and others provided by the Madison Police Department — show as many as five officers taking Johnson to the sidewalk and carrying him to a police squad car after Johnson initially resisted arrest,” the Wisconsin State Journal reported.

Johnson, a black man who identifies as Yeshua Musa, has been a constant presence at the disorderly and, at times, violent protests against police brutality, racism, capitalism, and whatever else the radical left anarchists feel like protesting.

Soon after Johnson’s arrest, protesters assembled outside the Dane County Jail demanding the suspect be released. The State Journal reported some 300 protesters blocked traffic, yelled at drivers, and demanded they join the demonstration. Apparently one man was injured when a few drivers attempted to pass through the crowd. They apparently could not be drafted into the protest — and the bedlam that was to come.

Protesters quickly disabused the media and liberal Madison of the quaint notion that the radical movement was “peaceful.”

“This is not a peaceful protest, so if you came out here for a peaceful protest, you missed it,” one organizer said, according the State Journal “We’re done being peaceful. Now we demanding justice.”

Apparently “justice” means tearing down iconic progressive statues, setting city buildings on fire and beating the hell out of a gay liberal senator. Carpenter was attacked by several protesters because he attempted to film the destruction. He posted an 11-second clip on Twitter early this morning.

“I took this pic (and) it got me assaulted and beat up,” said the senator, who has been a leading proponent of the Black Lives Matter movement. He said eight to 10 people punched and kicked him in the head, neck, and ribs.

The newspaper reported that protesters set a small fire on one of the windows of the City-County Building Downtown, which also houses the Madison Police Department’s Downtown station. A group shattered the front entrance windows of the Tommy G. Thompson Center on Public Leadership, which houses several state offices, and others knocked down street cameras or spray painted over the lenses, the State Journal reported.

The demonstrators washed down their night of violence with a Molotov cocktail thrown into the city engineering office, a city council member told the State Journal. They attempted to break into the Capitol, according to multiple reports, before law enforcement officials showed up in riot gear and warned the group to leave or face arrest. Some still chanted “Free Yeshua” between screaming obscenities at police.

In Milwaukee, a mob burned down the house of man they suspected of sex trafficking. Liberal leaders, including state Rep. Jonathan Brostoff (D-Milwaukee) attempted to defuse the situation, according to Urban Milwaukee. The crowd wanted blood. Community members believed two missing teenage girls were inside.

They threw bricks at police as they intervened, injuring at least seven law enforcement officials, according to the Milwaukee Police Department.

“Three victims were shot during this event, none by police,,” Milwaukee Police Chief Alfonso Morales said at a press conference. “We cannot allow an unruly crowd to determine what that investigation is,” he said. “What you had today was vigilantism.”

But the liberal mayors and city councils in Madison and Milwaukee have often excused the unruly crowds, pandering to radical activists who have made clear they will use whatever means necessary to make their point — whatever that may be. Evers has done the same.

Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau) criticized the Democrat this morning for failing to protect the public and public property.

“Enough is enough. Governor Evers has all of the tools at his disposal to stop this. He commands the State Patrol. He commands the Capitol Police. He commands the National Guard. The governor must step up and immediately put an end to this violence. He cannot allow this to continue,” Fitzgerald said.

Watch BLM Protesters Insult And Attack Black Cops,"After police thwarted their attempt to topple the Andrew Jackson statue in Lafayette Square, using chemical irritants to push the crowd back, Black Lives Matter demonstrators spent the rainy night of June 23 agitating outside the White House, screaming obscenities at officers, setting fires, and more.

Law enforcement later removed the “Black House Autonomous Zone” encampment from St. John’s Church, where antifascists and others had set up tents and attempted to recreate the CHAZ territory in Seattle.

Protesters in Black Lives Matter Plaza, a strip of 16th Street just north of the White House, clashed with police again the next day, returning to taunt and shout at them, sometimes with a face mask, sometimes not. A white woman in Lululemon leggings mocked a black female police officer. A black office stood stoically for minutes while protesters yelled directly in his face.

This is a compilation of footage I captured while covering the events over the course of those two days.

Judge Rules New York May Not Enforce Double-Standard Restrictions On Religious Gatherings,"New York may no longer restrict religious gatherings to 25 percent capacity while other businesses can operate at 50 percent, according to a preliminary injunction issued by a federal judge on Friday. U.S. District Judge Gary Sharpe ruled that New York could not limit socially-distanced, outdoor religious services while it allowed outdoor graduation ceremonies in excess of 100 people.

Sharpe barred New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Attorney General Letitia James, and NYC Mayor Bill DeBlasio from enforcing any restrictions on houses of worship that are greater than restrictions on Phase Two businesses. Businesses on the Phase Two list, including barbershops, retail stores, and professional services, may operate at 50 percent capacity if they are social distancing. Houses of worship under Phase Two, however, were limited to 25 percent capacity by Cuomo’s Executive Order 202.38, in an apparently arbitrary restriction on religious freedom.

Catholic priests Steven Soos and Nicholas Stamos, along with Orthodox Jews Daniel Schonbrun, Elchanan Perr, and Mayer Mayerfeld, filed for injunctive relief against the restrictions. For Soos and Stamos and their congregations in upstate New York, the restrictions kept parishioners from taking the sacraments of communion, a required ritual for adherents to the Catholic faith.

Schonbrun, Perr, and Mayerfeld attend synagogues in Brooklyn, New York. At Schonbrun’s synagogue in March, police arrived to break up an outdoor prayer gathering of eight people who were all at least 20 feet apart. Perr and Mayerfeld have also experienced hostility toward their religious gatherings. Perr was attending a socially-distanced funeral when police arrived and broke up the service, and Mayerfeld reported being harassed by his neighbors when he was driven to holding religious services in his own backyard.

On March 23, 2020, Cuomo banned “nonessential gatherings of individuals of any size for any reason,” including religious gatherings. Two months later, on May 21, he added a provision to allow socially-distanced religious gatherings of up to 10 people. Outdoor, drive-in services were also permitted, but congregants could not leave their cars.

At the end of May, Cuomo issued another executive order that allowed businesses on a list of “Phase Two” non-essential businesses to open, including retail shops, hair salons, professional services, real estate offices, car dealerships, and information technology companies. These businesses were welcome to operate at 50 percent capacity, according to guidance from the governor’s office.

Another week passed before Cuomo addressed houses of worship. On June 6, he permitted religious gatherings under Phase Two, but restricted them to 25 percent capacity, half that of stores and barbershops.

At the same time, Cuomo and de Blasio have encouraged the mass protests sweeping New York in the wake of George Floyd’s death. Answering a question about whether protests should be discouraged, Cuomo said, “No, I think you can protest…you can do many things now as long as you’re smart about it.” A few minutes later, he thanked protesters for their actions.

De Blasio went further, even speaking at a George Floyd protest without a mask. When asked about the plight of religious congregants who have been banned from gathering, he insisted “that is not the same question.”

De Blasio’s shows of support for mass protests “clearly undermine the legitimacy” of his reasons for restricting religious congregations, Sharpe said in the court order. “By acting as they did, Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio sent a clear message that mass protests are deserving of preferential treatment.” As a result, the restrictions on religious gatherings may no longer be enforced.

Planned Parenthood Members Don Handmaid's Tale Costumes And Burn Flag,"Members of the Tennessee chapter of Planned Parenthood burned the American flag in public protest of the recent passing of a state bill banning abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected.

An activist wearing the mask of the state’s Republican Gov. Bill Lee lit the flag on fire in the back of a pickup truck and placed it in a trash can while others who appear to be in Handmaid’s Tale costumes chanted and looked on before extinguishing the fire.

One member, who was dressed as Lady Liberty, then waved a new white-and-red striped flag, distinguishable from the American flag by its lack of stars. She announced that the destruction of the old would lead to the creation of a “new world order.” She then led a chant, asking, “What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now.” A 200-car caravan audience echoed her sentiments.

Gov. Bill Lee has disrespected our constitution and practically lit the flag on fire by banning abortion. But we won’t stop until we live in a new America that respects the rights of pregnant people. Full stop. pic.twitter.com/yhGT1HQacp — Tennessee Advocates for Planned Parenthood (@TNAdvocatesPP) June 25, 2020

The event took place outside Lee’s residence. The state house passed his bill June 19, and since Lee introduced the legislation, he is expected to sign it into law soon.

While it outlaws abortions after the detection of a heartbeat, which is typically around six weeks, it exempts mothers who are at risk for health complications. It also prevents abortions on the basis of a baby’s race, sex, or disability diagnosis. An ultrasound will be required prior to every abortion to ensure a heartbeat cannot be detected.

“One of the most important things we can do to be pro-family is to protect the rights of the most vulnerable in our state, and there is none more vulnerable than the unborn,” Lee said. “We have passed the strongest pro-life law in our state’s history.”

Planned Parenthood joined the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights in filing a lawsuit against the bill in federal court in Nashville only hours after its passing.

Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, announced after the bill passed that the law takes advantage of the COVID-19 crisis and disproportionately affects black Tennesseans.

“This opportunistic attack on our reproductive rights, passed in the middle of the night under the cover of darkness, will disproportionately impact Black Tennesseans due to systemic oppression and concerted efforts to stifle their most basic rights and freedoms,” Johnson said. “We won’t stand for this, and we are going to do everything possible to fight back against this extremely harmful law.”

With protests over racial injustice emerging nationwide within the last month in the wake of George Floyd’s death, Republican Senate candidate Bill Hagerty said this flag-burning demonstration is just another example of far-left radicalism. The liberal mob, he said, has now officially arrived in Tennessee.

“This behavior disrespects America and those who have been willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for our precious freedom,” he said. “What we need now, more than ever, is law and order.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/26/planned-parenthood-members-don-handmaids-tale-costumes-and-burn-flag-in-abortion-bill-protest/,2020-06-26
Black Community Elders Shutdown And Shame Anti-Statue Protest,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Blazing sun and high humidity met hundreds of protesters, counter-protesters, neighborhood residents, police officers, and reporters Friday evening at Capitol Hill’s Lincoln Park. The protest, planned Tuesday, hoped to tear the monument of Abraham Lincoln with one hand on the Emancipation Proclamation freeing a slave, modeled by freedman Archer Alexander. It was paid for by local black residents and black Union veterans and dedicated by Frederick Douglass.

(Protesters, neighbors, reporters, undercover cops and private security gather)

After a Tuesday rally promised to return to tear the statue down on Thursday, Park Police surrounded the monument with fencing re-enforced by Jersey barriers and stood guard night and day. Tension in the usually busy community park had been building since then, broken by short moments of music and happy protest.

(Radicals complaining there is no destruction yet)

The rally began slow, upsetting gathered bicycle Antifa supporters in masks and football helmets with their “centrist liberal bullshit,” but quickly broke into yelling when Don Folden, owner of Capital Buddy Tours took the microphone in his uniform. “Y’all young people don’t know shit!” he hollered into the crowd, beginning what would become a counter-protest within.

(Radicals distribute masks for pepper spray.)

While Black Lives Matters activists tried to chant them down, reenactors dressed as freed slaves of Capitol Hill and Frederick Douglass gave an abridged version of the dedication speech. When the organizer told the crowd that the older generation had failed them and had nothing to teach them, a black man in a “New York City” shirt followed, raising his voice to tell the crowd his great-great-grandfather is that slave (depicted in the memorial), and “this young upstarts” better show some respect for the suffering of their people.

(A reenactor abridges Douglass’s dedication speech.)

“Do you even know the history of that statue?” Folden demanded, holding court after a fiery speech.

(A pro-statue reenactor and an anti-statue protest organizer argue with a radical looking for violence.)

“These people are talking just because we have to respect our seniors,” a teenage, freckled white girl complained to her friends, “which is disgusting.”

(A white activist went from police officer to police officer calling them “p*ssies” and “cowards.”)

After sunset, conservative activist Jack Posobiec and a friend were physically attacked. By 8:30 p.m., the crowd had disbursed, marching toward the Capitol, and the Emancipation Memorial stood another day.

"In First Weekend, Looting Damage In 20 Big Cities Exceeded $400 Million","Looting costs in America’s 20 largest metropolitan areas exceeded $400 million from the first weekend of rioting, according to a new report from the Anderson Economic Group.

“This includes property damage, lost inventory, cleanup and reconstruction costs, and closure-related lost wages,” the report stated. “[The study] did not assign any costs to peaceful protests or demonstrations.”

The report, published June 5, used “news publications to identify where looting occurred…and estimate the total costs of looting between May 29 and June 3.” The report authors say this value could be severely underestimated.

“Our estimates are based on observed patterns of looting in the 20 largest metropolitan areas across the country. We did not estimate costs in smaller metro areas that may have also experienced looting,” stated Brian Peterson, the firm’s director of public policy and economic analysis. “Furthermore, our estimates do not include costs to state or local governments that experienced property damage or incurred increased emergency service costs.”

According to an approximation given to Market Watch by Property Claim Services, damage incurred by riots in just Minnesota could total more than $25 million.

“We hope that those businesses that experienced looting and damage will be able to bounce back, but we know that some will not make it,” said Peterson. “That means empty storefronts and the loss of jobs at those businesses, which ultimately hurts local communities.”

The corporate media, however, has downplayed the violence and destruction, claiming protests around the nation have been misrepresented as not peaceful. Despite the clear mob mentality of many of the recent riots, one article in The New York Times claimed “Mr. Trump and his allies have tried to discredit the protests by focusing on some isolated incidents of violence.”

One MSNBC anchor also shared a company directive ordering reporters to label violence as “protests.”

“While the situation on the ground in Minneapolis is fluid, and there has been violence, it is most accurate at this time to describe what is happening there as “protests”–not riots.”

This will guide our reporting in MN. “While the situation on the ground in Minneapolis is fluid, and there has been violence, it is most accurate at this time to describe what is happening there as ""protests""–not riots.” — Craig Melvin (@craigmelvin) May 28, 2020

While most news sites focused on coverage of the “protests,” many failed to report on events such as Seattle’s Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, a violent vigilante takeover of private and public property, until long after it was established.

“CNN only mentioned ‘Seattle’ once on Wednesday when discussing general unrest in major cities, according to a search of transcripts, while MSNBC didn’t cover Seattle on-air at all during the same time period,” stated one Fox News article. “Both networks finally addressed the situation early on Thursday but only to comment on President Trump tweeting about it.”

RealClearPolitics’s Tom Bevan pointed out the media hypocrisy in a tweet: “Total blackout on the insanity in Seattle on major news websites: ABC News, NBC News, CBS News.”

Most national media outlets also failed to cover a Florida incident in which a mob several hundred strong called the police with a false report to lure officers into an ambush.

Jeffrey McCall, a DePauw University professor and media critic, told Fox News this lack of coverage by the media simply shows they don’t cover important events that don’t fit into a leftist policial agenda.

“The traditional media loved covering those earlier protest stories because of their dramatic, sensational, and counter-cultural tone. But the escalation of the Seattle demonstrations into the actual closing of a portion of the city is a bridge too far for even a sympathetic media to cover with an approving nod,” McCall said. “The latest chaos in Seattle is not merely a political statement, but an anarchy that even the progressive mainstream press just can’t appear to be advocating. Thus, it is better to leave the story off the agenda, or to at least minimize it, rather than show light on it and have to try to explain it into proper context.”

Mayhem And Rioting Emphasizes Why DC Statehood Is A Terrible Idea,"Protests in Washington, D.C., are common. As the seat of the federal government, the city is guaranteed to attract more than its share of activists hoping to influence the president or Congress with their mass advocacy. The reaction to peaceful protests there is, and should be, roughly the same as in any other city. The First Amendment guarantees that the government will not restrict free speech or peaceful assembly, and whatever regulations it does impose are minor and value-neutral.

When protests turn physical, though, the situation changes. Rioting, violence, and looting are dangerous crimes in any city, but in Washington, they pose a particular threat.

Seattle harbored a mob of anarchists governing a section of its downtown, proclaiming independence from any legal authority. That’s a problem, but it’s a local problem. If a similar commune were proclaimed in the nation’s capital, it would be a threat to the whole country. As The Federalist’s culture editor Emily Jashinsky noted, some D.C. protesters did attempt to erect an autonomous zone of their own, but without much success.

Lawlessness in capitals poses a unique danger to a nation, which is among the reasons the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over the federal district. Capital cities and their residents exert outsized control over the business of government. Were the capital controlled by a state government, as D.C. statehood advocates wish, federal officials would be as powerless to stop disorder there as they are in Seattle. This shows, more clearly than any other argument, why allowing D.C. to become the 51st state would enable one local government to hold the nation hostage through inaction — or even endorsement — of riotous disturbances.

Keeping the Capitol from Controlling the States

How the federal district should be governed is not a new discussion. The District Clause of Article I of the Constitution gave the federal government the power of “exclusive legislation, in all cases whatsoever, over such district … as may, by cession of particular States and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States” even before the location of that district had been decided. In Federalist No. 43, James Madison explained the reasons for that provision.

“Without it,” he wrote, “not only the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings interrupted with impunity; but a dependence of the members of the general government on the State comprehending the seat of the government, for protection in the exercise of their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence.” His point, essentially, was that having the seat of government in one of the states would give that state too much power over the entire union.

That was a fair concern in the republic’s early days. No one knew how long the states would remain united, and the threat of civil war among them was one of the driving forces in the push for a stronger central government. While it sounds bizarre today to imagine the governor of Maryland sending troops to intimidate Congress, the Founding Fathers had no way of knowing it would not come to that. The Civil War we fought 75 years later proved it was at least possible for a state or collection of states to threaten the capital.

Look at Today’s Unrest

But the Civil War was a long time ago, and the idea that a state force could “awe or influence” the government has faded from memory, replaced by the mob.

The riots near the White House are not the first time civil disorder threatened the government. The first was the Pennsylvania mutiny of 1783. Revolutionary War soldiers went long stretches without pay,

and some marched on Philadelphia (then the capital) to remedy the situation. Congress called on the state government to protect them, but Pennsylvania declined to do so.

It took General George Washington’s personal intervention to talk the mutineers down. Without his leadership, the young republic might have become, like so many new nations, the plaything of armies and dictators. That incident was on the delegates’ minds in 1787 when they wrote the District Clause. It was not the last time the capital was threatened by a mob, but in later incidents, the government had advantages.

In 1894, a large group of unemployed men called “Coxey’s Army” marched on Washington to demand government jobs. In 1932, the Bonus Marchers, World War I veterans who wanted an advance on their military pensions because of the Great Depression, did the same. In 1971, anti-war protests in early May featured widespread civil disobedience and led to thousands of arrests.

In all of these scenarios, the federal government had the power to control its environs because of the District Clause of Article I. In the years since the Constitution was written, mobs in capitals around the world have succeeded in revolutions even when the nation did not support their efforts. The Russian Revolution is one such example, as are many of the various French Revolutions. Once the radicals take control of the capital, governments can be forced to capitulate.

The current rioters are unlikely to overthrow the government, although some surely wish to do so. In the meantime, they could cause a great deal of damage, enough to impair the government’s functioning. If D.C.’s government had all the powers of a state, they might use them to protect Congress and the president, or they might not.

It is easy to imagine a scenario where a Republican president is deeply unpopular with the residents of the Democratic capital city, and the local government there sympathizes more with the rioters than with the chief executive. It’s easy to imagine, because it’s happening right now.

Washington’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, has finally recognized the threat rioters pose to the city, much to the consternation of the mob’s leaders. But it took a while, during which she and the rest of the D.C. government sided with the protesters openly and with the rioters covertly. Seattle’s mayor decided to let the mob tire itself out like toddlers throwing a tantrum, but that is not a realistic option in the nation’s capital.

D.C. statehood is advocated as a matter of voting rights, and there is no reason parts of the city could not be returned to Maryland, just as the Virginia portion of the district was returned to that state in 1846. But the core of the city must remain under the sole control of the federal government, lest the mob impose its will on a nation helpless to defend its center of power.

"Black Lives Matter Was Violent From The Start, And Media Knew It","The Black Lives Matter protests are radical, they are violent, and they have claimed innocent lives all over the country. This isn’t a surprise: We’ve watched this movement played out before by many of the exact same leaders and even under the exact same name. Now, through a combination of political foolishness, public amnesia, and willful media gaslighting, America gets to live it all again — and more civilians and police officers are being attacked and even killed.

The Black Lives Matter movement isn’t new at all. It’s the same loose collection of good-thinking people concerned over police violence and violent, anti-police and anti-family radicals as it was when it first gained national prominence in 2014.

As a refresher, the group was founded in 2013, during President Barack Obama’s second term and after the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida. It wasn’t until a rash of viral police-related deaths the next year that its national profile began to rise, including protests over the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Eric Garner in New York City, and then the following year Freddie Gray in Baltimore and Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina.

It was cheered on at the time by the media for all the same reasons it’s being cheered on today: Some of the viral videos and events convincingly depicted unjustified killings of black suspects by police, and despite the clear and radical politics of the founders, their name conveys an obvious truism. Unfortunately, it quickly showed its violent and intolerant side then, just as it has today.

Americans likely most clearly recall Ferguson’s protests, where for days black-owned businesses were torched and looted. Over the next few years, we watched in horror as Baltimore’s years-long revival was stopped in its tracks, block after block burned, and families attending an afternoon baseball game were set upon by screaming mobs.

As editor in chief of The Daily Caller News Foundation then, I oversaw our broader Baltimore 2015 riot coverage. As two in the morning approached on April 28, I turned off the police scanner, confident our guys were OK and looking forward to a few hours’ sleep before an early workday. Minutes later, our man running the coverage on the ground texted, “We are alright,” which indicated to me that they were not alright at all. Indeed, my friend was in the emergency room with two of our young reporters, who had been beaten and robbed by the rioters.

“When I saw the guy heading our way with a hammer in his hand and a bandanna covering his face, I knew he meant business,” a New York Daily News reporter who ran to their aid and then drove our guys through the mob to safety wrote later that morning. By the time they escaped, Caller reporter Casey Harper was struggling to stay conscious with a severe concussion, broken eye socket, and stolen phone, while his colleague Connor Wolf got off with a broken nose (and managed to hold onto his blood-stained notebook throughout). The two had been targeted for being white. No one slept until after we were back in the newsroom and their story was filed.

The violence and disruption they’d been subject to were tolerated and papered over by Democrats and corporate media, who made excuses for attacks on civilians, police, and media, and blamed outside agitators even while they were shouted down and disrupted by activists demanding “a conversation” but committed to ensuring no one speaks but them.

The following year, 2016, national Black Lives Matter protests broke out against the killing of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Dozens of officers were injured with projectiles and threatened by protesters. Then on July 7, just before 9 p.m. CT, a man opened fire on police preparing for one of the protests in Dallas, killing three policemen, wounding three others, and wounding one civilian.

During his retreat, he killed another officer, shooting him in the back after sneaking around a pillar he was taking cover behind during a gunfight. Seeking to fortify an El Centro College building, he opened fire on two campus cops, hitting one in the gut and injuring the other with shattered glass.

Police followed the man’s trail of blood through the school, engaging when they could clearly make him out in the darkness. From a window near where he made his last stand, he was able to kill another police officer who was on the street below. After negotiations broke down, the department killed him with a remote bomb.

Before he was killed, the gunman told a negotiator he was motivated by anger on behalf of the Black Lives Matter movement. His Facebook page called for people to “KILL EVERYTHING IN BLUE EXCEPT THE MAIL MAN.” By the morning of July 8, the murdered men included Officers Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, former Army Ranger Michael Smith, former U.S. Navy sailor Patrick Zamarripa, and former Marine Brent Thompson.

“Protests are messy,” a Vox writer wrote dismissively a week later. “When thousands or millions of people rise up in very passionate demonstrations, some bad, violent people are going to get caught up in the cause.”

But the pressure was intense, and reluctant cracks began to form in the ranks. “Black Lives Matter Was Gaining Ground,” a New York Times headline lamented, “Then a Sniper Opened Fire.”

Things quieted down. Donald Trump won the presidency, and shell-shocked journalists and Democrats went on a short-lived soul-searching mission, wondering what went wrong and how they could have misread the American public so badly. “Maybe we pushed too far,” President Obama privately reflected. “What if we were wrong?”

The introspection did not last, and by the end of the year — a year five police officers were killed and dozens wounded and hospitalized by Black Lives Matter radicals — BuzzFeed fondly looked back on 2016 as “the year Black Lives Matter went global.”

Just a few short weeks into the summer of 2020, it’s happening again: Seven shot in a Louisville protest park; one week later a protester killed; two dead in Chicago; four shootings in Seattle’s “autonomous zone;” a 77-year-old, black, retired St. Louis Police captain murdered; a 22-year-old, black woman in Davenport shot as she tried to leave.

Once again, politicians and media are defending and gaslighting for the violence. “I want to be clear how I characterize this,” MSNBC’s Ali Veshi said while buildings visibly burned in the night sky behind him. “This is mostly a protest. It is not, generally speaking, unruly.”

“But fires,” he admitted, back-lit by flames, “have been started.”

Meanwhile in Washington, D.C., rioters threw frozen bottles, glass, rocks, and bricks at police, then lit a church on fire. Afterward, corporate reporters, Democratic politicians, and even the leader of that church called the protests peaceful and attacked police tactics. The mayor allowed protesters to maintain that space, rename it Black Lives Plaza, and paint “Black Lives Matter” on the street.

“White women are lucky that we are just calling them ‘Karen’s,'” Washington Post editor Karen Attiah wrote June 29, “And not calling for revenge.” She listed her reasons for revenge on white women as the deadly racist massacre in Tulsa 99 years ago, the lynching of Emmet Till 70 years ago, liberal feminists making her feel excluded, and white women voting for Donald Trump.

Eight days later, she complained that “The ideas of the elite class is to be protected [sic] and supported at all costs,” but “black people… poor people… [and] uneducated people? We’re supposed to accept our marginalization.” She graduated from Northwestern University, won a Fulbright Scholarship, got a master’s at Columbia University, is now the global opinions editor for The Washington Post, and still has not been fired.

But the charade cannot stand. This past weekend, an eight-year-old black child was shot and killed besides her frightened mother as the driver tried to navigate around illegal barriers Black Lives Matter protesters were guarding near the Atlanta Wendy’s where a black man was killed after scuffling with police and stealing and firing one officer’s Taser. The little girl’s name was Secoriea Turner.

“They say ‘black lives matter,'” her father, hoarse with pain, accused the movement just hours later. “You killed your own. You killed your own this time.”

“You killed a child. She didn’t do nothing to nobody.”

“My baby,” her mother sobbed as family comforted her and helped her walk from the stage.

“At the point that an eight-year-old baby is killed, the discussions have ended,” the mayor announced. Just hours later, another person was killed and two more wounded nearby.

But some aren’t getting the message. “If you want an all-black lives matter movement started … then start that movement,” CNN’s Don Lemon told black actor Terry Crews Monday. “But that’s not what Black Lives Matter is about.”

Lemon was wrong on most things during that segment, but on that one point, he was right. Let’s see how long it takes us to remember.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/07/08/black-lives-matter-was-violent-from-the-start-and-media-and-politicians-knew-it/,2020-07-08
Trump Was Right: Fake News Media Really Is The Enemy Of The People,"Firework smoke still lingered in the sky over Mount Rushmore as journalists began their daily routine of story-spinning, as if their very lives depended on headlines reflecting the exact opposite of true events. President Donald Trump’s pro-America speech, dripping with unity and patriotism, was decried in legacy media as diabolical.

Just moments after the star-spangled spectacle, The New York Times blasted out a news alert, calling the president’s remarks “dark and divisive” and condemning his Independence Day speech as insufficiently focused on the Wuhan virus. ABC News claimed “Trump pushe[d] racial division” and defied pandemic rules, while the Washington Post opted for “dark” descriptors and blamed Trump for “exploit[ing] social divisions.”

One honest look at Trump’s speech spikes these media fictions into orbit.

""President Trump used his inflammatory Fourth of July speeches at the White House and Mount Rushmore to distract from the real threat facing America: the coronavirus,"" @MaeveReston writes. | Analysis https://t.co/IvYh9UjXMb — CNN (@CNN) July 5, 2020

This same media over the last several years has routinely railed against the president for his dismissal of what he calls “fake news.” Journalists lost their minds in February 2017 when Trump took things a step further, for the first time characterizing the fake news media as the “enemy of the people.”

https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/832708293516632065

CNN’s chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta, who frequently spars with the president while grandstanding in the press briefing room, capitalized on the phrase while playing the martyr, publishing a book called “The Enemy of the People” last year. Ironically, Acosta used the same words to characterize Trump’s rhetoric about the press as the press used to slander Trump: dark and dangerous.

“What may have begun as something of a reality TV-style parlor trick has mutated into a full-blown assault on the American free press,” Acosta argued, saying of the president’s “enemy of the people” remark, “It was a dark and dangerous tweet that may well define much of his presidency.” Plenty of others have echoed Acosta’s sentiment.

In short, Trump delivers a unifying speech, and the media lies, calling it dark and divisive. Trump exposes the media for its lies, and the press calls his rhetoric dark and divisive. The cycle has repeated itself over and over again.

While the press’s most recent Fourth of July smear was blatantly partisan and anti-American, it’s worth noting that this wasn’t an isolated instance of media misspeak. Bad-faith actors in the press have proved time and again that they are indeed the enemy of the people.

Liar, Liar, Cities On Fire

This is the same media that has spent the last six weeks stirring up strife over the death of George Floyd and lying about the resulting chaos. While rioters and looters desecrated major cities across the United States, many journalists downplayed the violence and tried to convince Americans most of the actors were simply peaceful protesters.

“I want to be clear in how I characterize this. This is mostly a protest. It is not, generally speaking, unruly,” said one MSNBC reporter as buildings burned down behind him.

The media malfeasance was endless. Many outlets initially failed to report on the autonomous zone mayhem in Seattle, compared the anarchy and violence to Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters, and pretended the looting was the same as peaceful lockdown protests.

All the while, many mainstream journalists ignored the ongoing pandemic they were otherwise using to shame Americans into lockdown. After hundreds of thousands of protesters and rioters clambered through the streets, the media continued blaming churches for coronavirus upticks, while crediting Black Lives Matter protests with helping to “slow the spread” of the virus.

Of course, one can’t forget the media storm over Trump’s trek from the White House to St. John’s Episcopal Church, when every single major media outlet falsely reported that Park Police had attacked peaceful protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets so the president could have a photo-op. It turns out none of that was true. CBS then later deceptively edited an interview with Attorney General William Barr, leaving out important details about the violent nature of the protests outside the White House. The Washington Post even ran this headline with this infographic:

Countless media personalities and outlets then eliminated clear context to pretend Trump’s remarks about Floyd and equality were instead making light of Floyd’s death to tout an improvement in unemployment numbers.

This is only a fraction of the press’s spin over the protests and riots — which have only been going on since May 26.

All The Pinocchios

Before that, the press compulsively lied about COVID-19 on every front, using a bogus hydroxychloroquine study to bash the president, shaming small business owners for protesting lockdowns, blaming Republicans for Democrats’ failures, scorning Christians for wanting to prioritize their spiritual health over physical, distorting remarks by members of the Trump administration, and running constant cover for Communist China and the World Health Organization.

Instead of seeking answers to questions plaguing the American people, reporters used press briefings to make the story about themselves, casting themselves as victims and asking asinine questions such as “Is Chinese food racist?” They ridiculed Trump for featuring Mike Lindell, the MyPillow guy, who pledged to use his facilities to manufacture masks, while they spit out pro-China headlines that easily could have been written by communist dictator Xi Jinping.

This is the same media that spent years peddling a Russia collusion hoax based on opposition research funded by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. The same media that ran interference for Democratic lawmakers in their ridiculous impeachment sham. The same media that slandered Brett Kavanaugh over sexual assault allegations but largely refused to cover seemingly more credible allegations against their 2020 savior Joe Biden. The same media that lied about former national security adviser Michael Flynn, airing deceptively edited videos and then blaming journalistic ineptitude.

If journalists aren't checking original sources/transcripts, what the HELL are they doing? https://t.co/NmxH2i7fTg — Kylee Zempel (@kyleezempel) May 12, 2020

This is the same media that perpetuated Jussie Smollett’s race hoax and defamed a Catholic high school student. The same media that scoffed at Trump voters and “stupid” Republicans, defended defunding the police, and published revisionist history such as the 1619 Project. The same media that exploited deaths of minorities that fit their “America is racist” narrative while ignoring the killings of black police officers. The same media that tried to silence this very publication for criticizing it.

Enemy of the People

In a May 2020 interview with WGBH News, ABC News correspondent and president of the White House Correspondents’ Association Jonathan Karl described Trump’s tension with the press, using the media’s preferred vernacular to describe the relationship as having taken a “dark turn.”

“I think [Trump has] sent the message that you can go out and say things that are completely untrue and you can vilify anybody who criticizes you and just basically say that it’s all fake and made up, and get away with it,” Karl said.

Karls words, however, could just as easily be said about corporate media, as they publish lies wholesale and denigrate anybody who finds fault with them.

The American people deserve the truth. They’re smart enough to intake facts and discern what action to take based on unadulterated information filtered through their own values. They don’t need the news sifted through the skewed moral framework of the Washington Post and The New York Times or packaged inside the worldview of Brian Stelter and Yamiche Alcindor.

This life consists of enemies and allies, and we constantly discern the two. When you encounter an entity that trashes the things you cherish and promotes the things you hate, that repeatedly lies to you, slanders you, mocks you, hides things from you, and actively tries to mislead you, should you conclude it is anything but your enemy?

Trump called the fake news media the enemy of the people, and they’ve proved him right.

Black Lives Matter Is Not A Peaceful Protest Group,"Wisconsin police say a Mexican man intentionally drove his truck into a motorcyclist earlier this month for the sole purpose of killing a white person.

According to the criminal complaint reviewed by local Green Bay outlet NBC26 charging Daniel Navarro with a hate crime, “Navarro stated that if Trump and white people are going to create a world like we are living in then he has no choice and people are going to have to die.”

Police say the victim, Philip Thiessen, 55, a former Marine, police officer, special agent, and regular volunteer at a local food pantry, died on the scene.

According to the criminal complaint, Navarro deliberately ran his truck into a motorcyclist as opposed to a car because “he wanted the person to die and not be paralyzed.” The complaint also says Navarro perceived Harley culture as brimming with white supremacists.

Further south in Indianapolis, the downtown canal saw its second homicide within a week after an argument broke out. One group offended over the term “all lives matter” shot and killed the mother of a 3-year-old on Sunday.

In Detroit, new Black Lives Matter protests erupted last week demanding “justice” and taking action against local law enforcement that shot and killed a black man who had opened fire on officers first at point-blank.

“Justice for Hakim Littleton! Fire and jail the killer cop!” shouted hundreds of demonstrators outside the 12th precinct headquarters for police, according to the Detroit News.

It doesn’t seem to matter that bodycam footage showed Littleton first firing at police arresting an associate, because in the eyes of the restless mob under the banner of Black Lives Matter, police are public enemy number one.

Black Lives Matter is not a peaceful protest group. It is a cultural revolutionary Marxist mob pursuing the total transformation of modern society under the new woke world order. In reality, Black Lives Matter don’t actually care about black lives, otherwise there would be more outrage over recent spikes in community violence leaving more black people dead rather than chasing an anarchic quest to “defund police” that will demoralize law enforcement and increase homicides.

“We’re protesting for months, for weeks, saying ‘black lives matter,'” said John Ayala, who lost his granddaughter to a shooting in Washington D.C. “Black lives matter, it seems like, only when a police officer shoots a black person. What about all the black-on-black crime that’s happening in the community?”

Since the killing of George Floyd at the knees of Minneapolis police, Black Lives Matter have exposed its true colors as an anarchic movement terrorizing the nation. Within the last three months, mob rioters have burned down minority businesses, destroyed minority neighborhoods, killed a black police chief, desecrated civil rights monuments, launched deadly occupations of downtown centers, and set fire to churches.

“You ain’t seen nothing yet,” said an Atlanta resident said after a murder near his own home, where Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has declared a state of emergency and called up the National Guard to address an epidemic of violence.

While merely exacerbated in the apocalyptical year of 2020, Black Lives Matter has always been violent. Its leaders knew it. Activists knew it. Politicians knew it. And the media knew it, but legacy media wouldn’t dare report it. To the contrary, the media will literally stand in front of a burning police precinct and characterize the demonstrators as “mostly a protest.”

""This mostly a protest. It is not, generally speaking, unruly. But fires have been started."" MSNBC reporter says protests in Minneapolis are not ""generally speaking, unruly"" as buildings burn in the background. pic.twitter.com/IzzEmKgxhM — Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) May 29, 2020

At least he qualified with “mostly.”

While exhaustively rushing to cover protests as peaceful demonstrations of the oppressed courageously standing up to political power which just happen to sometimes result in the combustion of buildings, the disappearance of items from small businesses, and shooting of police, the media was rushing to condemn any who exposed their malicious lies with ill-fated attempts at de-platforming opponents.

Just a few weeks prior to Floyd’s death, after which it would celebrate the protests, corporate media was raising hysteria over lockdown demonstrations calling Americans who protested for their freedoms reckless, suicidal, selfish, racist because they could spread the virus to black people, undeserving of medical attention, irresponsibly spreading the virus, and dangerous.

The coverage of the “social justice” riots also mark a stark contrast from the way Tea Party protests were depicted by Democrats and the media nearly a decade ago.

In 2011, former Vice President Joe Biden said Americans protesting the nation’s troubling high deficit were “acting like terrorists,” and the coverage of Tea Party demonstrations were so mischaracterized a year earlier that Breitbart founder, Andrew Breitbart offered a $10,000 reward to anyone who could prove demonstrators had shouted the N-word at the Congressional Black Caucus.

One can easily imagine what the media coverage ought to look like if the Tea Party engaged in the kind of widespread destruction left behind by Black Lives Matter. It’s all proof that America’s corporate media does not report, it attempts to manipulate the public for dangerous partisan gain.

Why Is Hillary Clinton Support In 2016 Correlated With Cities’ 2020 Riots?,"Image Credit Lorie Shaull / Flickr

In a soon-to-be-released book, Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan says when President Obama called him during the 2015 riots in Baltimore, he expected the president to offer federal assistance. Instead, Obama urged Hogan to back off.

Hogan ignored Obama’s advice about the violence following the death of Freddie Gray, and worked to restore order to the state’s largest city. More than $20 million of damage was done after Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake told reporters the city would provide space to “those who wished to destroy.”

If Baltimore’s Democrat leaders gave $20 million of “space to destroy” in 2015, the price tag ballooned 100-fold in cities governed by the hard left in the 2020 round of urban violence.

The left and major media say the urban violence often accompanying protests following the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25 is a direct descendant of America’s past paroxysms of racial unrest. As such, the looting and arson in major cities is claimed to be the righteous child of Baltimore (2015), Ferguson (2014), Los Angeles (1992), and even the widespread riots in America’s major cities following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968.

But is it really? Or could it be something entirely different?

In past urban riots, a single spark ignited a mixture of anger and resentment over racial discrimination, poverty, or police brutality. When the cities burned, the damage concentrated in and around the neighborhoods of the urban poor. I witnessed this first-hand as an Army National Guard officer deployed to Los Angeles in 1992. The city was calm in the morning, and by the evening there were widespread murders with businesses being looted and burned.

In 2020, Floyd’s death appeared to trigger something different. Rather than a spark, a signal flare was sent aloft, with prepared cadres launching protests in cities across the nation often followed by violence late into the night.

Unlike Baltimore in 2015, cities like Minneapolis and Seattle featured leftwing mayors and governors, none of whom appeared interested in restoring order. This was due to those elected officials’ deep sympathy towards the protesters’ stated goals: defund the police, or, at the very least, reduce the apparent incidence of police brutality while shifting public funds out of law enforcement to more social welfare spending.

While the protests are ostensibly about the police, including accusations of routine police brutality and racist law enforcement practices, this claim can be subjected to a statistical test. For instance, are cities that spend more on police, resulting in a higher number of police per capita, more prone to violent protests in reaction to perceived over-policing?

Similarly, might cities with a high percentage of black residents have a larger share of their population that may harbor anger at their treatment by law enforcement? Or are cities with high crime rates that routinely feature violent interaction between neighborhood criminals and law enforcement stoking resentment against the police? Lastly, might poverty be a driving factor, with poorer urban areas leading to anger among the residents about the lack of opportunity?

Let’s Run the Numbers

The number of police per capita, the share of the black population, violent crime rates, and poverty levels are routinely reported by the FBI and Census Bureau. It is also possible to estimate recent urban violence by measuring protest news coverage in 37 of America’s big cities when a story also mentions “violence,” “looting,” or “arson” in the period from May 26 to June 30, and then factoring for a city’s population.

(The cities analyzed total 41.5 million people in Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Madison, Miami, New York, Newark, Oakland, Oklahoma City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Portland, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, St. Louis, Tampa, and Washington D.C. Minneapolis was excluded since many news stories included mention of Minneapolis in stories about local unrest.)

Comparing the above factors in a multivariate regression analysis with the incidence of violence as the dependent variable shows a statistically noisy and weak link to the number of police.

Of note, considering an additional variable—the share of a city’s population with a college degree or post-graduate degree—generates an even higher correlation to violence than does police per capita, suggesting that the protests and allied rioting are not the result of a working-class movement.

But none of these factors is convincingly determinative. There was one variable that did correlate strongly to urban violence: a city’s percentage of vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016. The more a city voted for Clinton, the more violence it saw in conjunction with the protests. (For the statisticians, the regression provides a significance of 0.0019 with the 2016 vote variable yielding a P-value of 0.003). The greater percentage of support for Clinton in 2016, the more likely a city was to suffer wanton destruction in connection with the “mostly peaceful” protests.

The figure below displays the simple correlation between urban violence and the 2016 Clinton vote.

Tellingly, out of the top ten cities for violence, looting, and arson, the average vote for Clinton was 77 percent. In the ten cities with the least destruction, Clinton won 53 percent of the vote.

That a city’s political leanings are more likely to lead to a breakdown in law and order in service of political protest shouldn’t be a surprise. In this, Seattle, with a black population of 7 percent, San Francisco (5 percent), Portland, Oregon (6 percent), and Madison, Wisconsin (7 percent) have one big thing in common with Washington D.C. and Atlanta, with black populations of 47 percent and 52 percent, respectively: They are all governed by the far-left.

Why did the leaders of the hardest-hit cities decide to give space to destroy? Some mayors saw the protest organizers as political supporters. A few may have calculated that widespread coverage of burning cities would harm President Trump’s reelection chances. And some just didn’t want the responsibility of ordering their police to restore order.

Unfortunately, it is often the case in politics and revolutions that the common people—the proletariat—are sacrificed for the movement. In this case, it will be those living in dangerous neighborhoods who will end up being murdered, robbed, raped, and extorted in greater numbers if the misguided call to “defund the police” becomes a widespread reality.

Americans have largely forgotten the hard-won gains made in public safety since 1992, during the last peak of violent crime. If crime rises to the level of a generation ago, we would suffer 14,261 more murders (almost double those murdered in 2018), 580,460 more robberies, and 636,038 more aggravated assaults every year. And these crimes would be concentrated in our urban centers, specifically in working-class and poor neighborhoods.

Think about that the next time you see those young vanguards of the proletariat, armed with law degrees and Molotov cocktails, visiting violence upon a city, only to return to their expensive lofts with a city view before daybreak. In this, the leaders of our recent round of urban violence appear to be trying to ignite a revolution rather than merely win a campaign.

Man With American Flag Stands Down Rioters: ‘None Of You Guys Represent Black Lives’,"A black man holding only an American flag tried to stop a crowd from breaking into the Federal Courthouse in Portland during widespread unrest in the city Saturday. The vandalized building was surrounded by hundreds of protesters, most dressed in black while sporting protective gear, and almost exclusively white.

“If you stand for justice come here and stand with me! Stand with me because I’m not here to tear down this f***ing fence, I’m not here to spray paint. It’s going on every day!” the man shouted into the crowd. He placed himself directly between the crowd and the opening to the justice building.

“If you don’t want to get gassed, stop! If you don’t want to get gassed, stop! It has to stop! This is not peaceful. None of you guys represent black lives! Sit and protest. Sit and protest.”

As he spoke, a handful of protesters appeared to join him. Most, however, instead hurled obscenities, and shouted that property destruction wasn’t violence. A video of the entire event was captured by reporter Jorge Ventura, of the Daily Caller.

Ultimately, the man was not able to protect the justice building. Later that night, the fencing protecting the courthouse was torn down and the building was attacked with sledgehammers made of broken protective barriers as rioters occupied the area. His prediction regarding how it would end, however, proved to be true later that night. As the violence continued, police arrived to disperse the protesters. Clashes broke out between the groups, with tear gas and flash bangs used.

The same night, the city’s police union was set ablaze by protesters.

Sunday night, hundreds of protesters again occupied the area, tore down fencing, and started fires inside the property. They were again dispersed with tear gas, pepper balls, and flash bangs.

Black Officer Shocked At Racist Things BLM Protestors Scream At Him,"In one black Portland police officer’s frontline experience, the Black Lives Matter protests in his city are not about helping black people attain better lives. What this officer sees is privileged white kids infiltrating communities that don’t belong to them to burn stuff, break things, cause trouble, incite violence, and tell black people what they should do.

This officer, Jakhary Jackson, is a nine-year veteran of the Portland Bureau of Police. After working for Nike for 10 years, Jackson joined law enforcement to “make the most out of my life by helping others.” Both sides of his family have long Portlandian roots. Jackson works where he grew up, and his love for the people of his community is evident.

A Different Kind of Racism

During a Portland press availability, Lt. Tina Jones interviewed Jackson, simply asking him to share his experience working these protests every evening for the last few months.

I’ll say this. I got to see folks that really do want change like the rest of us, that have been impacted by racism. And then I got to see those people get faded out by people who have no idea what racism is all about, that have never experienced racism, that don’t even know that the tactics they are using are the same tactics that were used against my people.

Jackson tells of a young black woman asking him one evening, while he held the line with protesters, why he wouldn’t talk with her and her friends, why he wouldn’t engage them. He explains that young black people often ask him what he thinks of all the unrest. They want to know what he thinks about the injustice, about George Floyd’s death, about the pain resulting from killings of black men.

It isn’t Jackson’s superiors who demand he not speak, it’s the young white protestors — nearly every night. Jackson explains that when “a brother or sister” approaches him, wanting his perspective on things, white protesters jump in like clockwork to tell the inquirer, “F-ck the police. Don’t talk to him.”

“That was the most bizarre thing,” Jackson says, wincing as he tells the story. “Honestly, every time I try to have a conversation with someone that looks like me, someone white comes up and blocks them and tells them not to talk.” Jackson says the very moment he was explaining this to a young black female, “this white girl pops right in front of her” and told her not to speak.

“He just said that was gonna happen!” the black girl said, stunned, is if Jackson were a fortune teller. She looked at the white girl and said, “Why did you do you that?”

Jackson continues, relaying his conversation with the girl, who interrupted: “Then I said, straight up, ‘I’ve been called the N-word. She’s been called the N-word. Why are you talking to me this way? Why do you feel she can’t speak for herself? Why do you feel you need to speak for her when we’re having a conversation?’”

“She couldn’t answer my question,” Jackson says. “All she said was, ‘Someone told me to do it.’”

A Profile of Portland Protesters

When asked about what he and fellow black officers have been subjected to by protesters who are supposedly fighting for racial justice, Jackson tells of protesters regularly threatening his life. He’s taken multiple incoming explosives thrown by rioters, some very powerful with marbles and rocks taped to them, intended to inflict maximum and sustained damage. He saved a female officer from being hit in the head with a massive projectile that he said would certainly have killed her had he not been present.

But to Jackson and his black peers, the most painful thing is white protesters’ words. “It says something when you are at a Black Lives Matter protest, and you have more minorities on the police side than you have in a violent crowd,” Jackson says. “And you have white people screaming at black officers, ‘You have the biggest nose I’ve ever seen.’”

Jackson says he is totally “cool” with people wanting to join efforts to achieve social change. What he’s seen at the Black Lives Matter events, however, “has been very strange to watch” precisely because, as he explains, so-called anti-racism tactics have come full circle: White protesters are telling black people what is best for them. Worse, these white kids are destroying black neighborhoods while they do it.

The first images Jackson saw from the protests were white people, who Jackson says are “not even from here,” burning and looting black businesses. “They don’t even know what they’re doing,” he adds. “So that to me was very angering.”

“The community is not happy with it,” he says. “They asked for the violence to stop.” Jackson tells of his cousin who had attended a Black Lives Matter event but soon left dismayed at the violence perpetrated by white rioters, saying, “This has turned into something else. This is weird.”

Jackson tells another story of a pair of young brothers he met while they were cleaning up the street after the protesters had cleared out. Jackson and a few of his fellow offers went over to shake the boys’ hands, impressed at their efforts to restore the city. “You know,” the boys told the officers, according to Jackson, “We’re from here. This is our city. I don’t understand why people are coming here and destroying it. We want to clean it up.”

An Officer’s Reality

Jackson explains how strange it is for angry white youths to come to his community, claiming they want to help, but telling him to quit his job without knowing anything about him.

Once again, you have a privileged white person telling someone of color what to do with their life. And you don’t even know what I’ve dealt with, what these white officers you’re screaming at have dealt with. You don’t know them. You don’t know anything about them.

Jackson tells how he watches his fellow officers serve the community year after year, risking their lives each day. They do whatever it takes to care for those who have been shot, not afraid to get blood on them. He knows these officers do what they do because they care deeply about all the lives in their community, regardless of skin color.

“You see [the officers], and they are truly trying to help save someone’s life, and then are called racist by people who have never seen anything like that, who have never had to put themselves out there like that. It’s really—” Jackson takes a long pause. “It’s disgusting.”

"179 Monuments Ruined Since Protests Began, And Counting","Thirty-three statues of Columbus. Nine of the Founding Fathers. Eight of Saint Junipero Serra. With the frequency of the ongoing iconoclasm, it can be hard to gain a scale of the problem.

For each story that has breached the news cycle, at least a dozen went unreported outside of local media. This detailed list records each instance monuments have been defaced, vandalized, and or torn down since nationwide protests began, updated as more occur.

Some key takeaways include:

At least 183 monuments, memorials, statues, and major historical markers have been defaced or pulled down since protests began in May.

While Confederate monuments have taken the lion’s share of media coverage, they actually form a minority of the statues targeted.

By far the most popular target was Christopher Columbus, with 33 statues in total having been defaced and pulled down.

The next most popular targets were Robert E. Lee (9), Serra (8), and Thomas Jefferson (4).

The vast majority of the vandals were never charged, with 177 out of 183 instances having no arrests.

Most monuments torn down were not by protesters, but by city officials after pressure or threats from protesters.

By far the most common route for monuments being destroyed was for protesters to damage it, then the city quickly removing it as a “public safety” hazard, not to be returned.

For a majority of the statues removed, the fate of the artwork is currently unknown, while a minority have been moved to cemeteries and museums.

The list begins with the most recent instance of iconoclasm and continues backwards in time until the first instance connected with nationwide rioting, in late May.

How Memphis Kept Protests Peaceful While Other Cities Burned,"In this tense summer of racial unrest, cities around the country have erupted in violence. The damage estimate for Minneapolis’ riots is more than $500 million for the first weekend alone. Portland is heading into its eighth week of destructive riots. Even Christopher Columbus could not escape the anger of the mob as they toppled his statue into Baltimore’s inner harbor.

One large American city has maintained peaceful protests night after night: Memphis, Tennessee. Given that Memphis is routinely listed among the country’s most dangerous cities, it is hardly a place one would expect to escape the scourge of violence. More than 50 years ago, Martin Luther King Jr. was shot by an assassin there on a gentle evening in April, and the city still bears the scars. Although some problems remain yet unsolved, Memphis has clawed its way back from the precipice, blazing a path for other cities.

One crisis in particular, the 2016 bridge incident, illustrates the Memphis approach. Memphis police had shot and killed a local man when he pulled a gun on an officer. In response, more than 2,000 people flooded the Memphis-Arkansas Bridge, cutting off access to St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital and blocking the interstate.

Police Director Michael Rallings walked out onto the bridge in his Sunday church clothes to talk with protesters. Four hours later, police and protesters walked two miles off the bridge together with an agreement to meet the following day at City Hall.

This ability to diffuse a potentially explosive situation did not come out of nowhere. The key to Memphis’ peaceful protests lies in an intricate web of relationships forged over time between churches and police, business leaders and community activists. These intentional efforts have made Memphis a model for how a torn city can come together again.

A Police Force Engaged with the Community

For the past 30 years, the Memphis police have worked hard to build relationships that foster trust in the community. Matching the racial demographics of the police force to the racial demographics of the city has been a major goal.

Memphis is 60 percent black, so police have worked hard to recruit and train black officers. Most have grown up in Memphis or surrounding areas. They know the community and its history. The police force is now more than 55 percent black.

Years ago, the Memphis police began to sponsor summer camps staffed and run by police officers. James Kirkwood, who now heads a Memphis pastors’ network, spent 31 years on the Memphis police force. He claims he can hardly go to the mall without some grown man calling out to him. “Hey, Kirkwood, you don’t remember me, do you?” It’s one of his old campers whose name, indeed, he can’t quite place. A handful of those former campers now serve on the city police force.

Summer camp is only one of the ways Memphis police have sought to forge community relationships. They created backyard neighborhood watch groups that listen for problems and search out practical solutions. Midnight basketball games bring together police and youth in the community.

One particular effort has brought tangible returns over time. Memphis police created “academies” that invite clergy and citizens to learn what police do and how they work. They demonstrate how fast someone can pull a knife on them — or a police officer. When police are dispatched to a violent scene, they do “ride alongs,” meaning a clergy member accompanies the officer.

As Kirkwood explains, “We work hard to make sure people understand that the police are not just about crime. They are here to serve the community.” Police are called to intervene in domestic violence, or take someone in kidney failure to dialysis, or talk a suicidal person into giving life another try. Even now, as almost a 1,000 cars a night bring food to the Memphis Food Bank during the pandemic, it’s the Memphis police who direct traffic.

Memphis’ Localized Dialogue

One unique aspect of Memphis’ ability to maintain peaceful protests is its history of hands-on, common-sense approaches to neighborhood needs.

Years ago, the Memphis mayor’s office created a partnership that brought together neighborhood residents, business leaders, and city officials. Folks meet at the Piccadilly Cafeteria and get stuff done. Where are the abandoned buildings? The piles of trash left untended? The house where drugs are sold? These are precursors to crime and neighborhood blight.

As one city official explains, these practical things must be tended to or people lose their sense of safety and peace of mind. When neighborhoods decline, crime and drugs take over.

As tensions rose following the tragic death of George Floyd, church and civic leaders realized that harder, more painful conversations needed to take place. They committed themselves to listen and ask only clarifying questions. Two meetings were held with area residents and community activists. No media were allowed.

At one of the meetings, George Robertson, the pastor of Second Presbyterian Church downtown, voiced the sentiments of many when he said, “I want to apologize for what the people of my race continue to do to the people of your race.” “I appreciate what you are saying, George,” one activist responded. “But if you really mean that, let’s do something about it.”

A new effort called “Opportunity Youth” is slowly evolving from those meetings. Economic inequality has been a point of ongoing pain in Memphis. An estimated 40,000 people ages 18 to 24 live below the poverty line. They have few meaningful skills that would allow them to hold a job.

Business, church, and civic leaders have committed themselves to create on-ramps for younger people who have been left behind. Their goal is to provide more apprenticeships that allow people to learn on the job. They recognize the need for coaching and accountability, for a social network that provides young people with support and role models — and in some cases, surrogate families.

As the country suffers through a summer pandemic, untangles the meaning of racism, and digs out from death and destruction, Memphis is a city to watch and emulate.

Kirkwood says the lines from an old hymn he learned as boy often filter through his head in this dismal season: “Lord, shine the light from heaven on my soul. If you find anything that shouldn’t be, take it out and straighten me. I want to be right. I want to be whole. I want to be saved.”

Perhaps the city of Memphis could share a bit of its salvation with the rest of us.

"Cuomo Investigates Concert Over Social Distancing, Excuses Protests","New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared Wednesday his state’s Department of Health would be launching an investigation into a Chainsmokers concert in the Southamptons over the weekend featuring guests flouting social distancing guidelines.

“Videos from a concert held in Southampton on Saturday show egregious social distancing violations. I am appalled,” Cuomo wrote on Twitter. “We have no tolerance for the illegal & reckless endangerment of public health.”

Cuomo however, didn’t share the same outrage as crowds repeatedly gathered to form massive protests in recent weeks that featured explicit lawlessness and rioting that devastated small businesses already struggling through the pandemic.

While Cuomo called the protests “counterproductive,” there was no full-blown state investigation to track down those who participated in pursuit of government punishment.

Legacy media and public health officials meanwhile, played down the severity of the two-months protesting concluding they played no role in spreading the virus after declaring the novel Wuhan coronavirus woke sensitive by naming systemic racism a greater public health threat than the very virus that shut down the entire country. In fact, New York City contract tracers were instructed not to even ask about individual participation in the protests.

“New York Black Lives Matter Protests Haven’t Sparked Coronavirus Surge,” read one headline in USA Today.

“Coronavirus News: New York City protests haven’t caused spike in COVID-19 cases,” read another in a local New York ABC affiliate.

“Trump tried to blame Black Lives Matter protests for the coronavirus surge. Data doesn’t support his claim,” observed the Washington Post last week.

The Wall Street Journal found in mid-July however, that coronavirus cases were surging among the exact demographic out protesting in the New York streets.

“New York City Coronavirus Infection Rate Is Rising Among Younger People,” the Journal headlined on July 14. One day later, Mayor Bill de Blasio rejected the idea that the protests and the rise in new cases among those protesting had any kind of connection.

“I think we’re seeing this around the country. I do think the crisis has hit younger people in a really challenging way,” de Blasio said. “And I think they’ve been yearning to get out and are used to, you know, a very outward focus in life.”

One week earlier, de Blasio placed a ban on large gatherings through September but permitted protests in the name of Black Lives Matter.

“This is a historic moment of change. We have to respect that but also say to people the kinds of gatherings we’re used to, the parades, the fairs – we just can’t have that while we’re focusing on health right now,” de Blasio said on CNN, unless it’s a protest against systemic racism.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/07/28/cuomo-investigates-hamptons-concert-over-lack-of-social-distancing-excuses-mass-protests/,2020-07-28
Portland Was Burning Well Before The Federal Surge In Law Enforcement,"Contrary to Democrats’ claims and reporting from legacy media seemingly hellbent on downplaying violence from the left, the assistance of federal law enforcement in Portland spurred no civil unrest that wasn’t already present before in the Oregon city.

“This [rioting] has been going on for more than a month now,” Portland’s Democrat Mayor Ted Wheeler complained on July 3 just before the ramped up federal presence. “Violence and vandalism detract from the importance of the larger movement for justice.”

For weeks following George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody, Portland police had declared the ongoing protests “riots” as the explosion of chaos tightened its grip on the city.

Now, Portland demonstrators have surpassed their 60th straight day of rioting as the city continues its devastating descent into anarchy. The community’s Democrat leaders have meanwhile begun to aim partisan outrage at President Donald Trump, accusing the White House of fanning the flames of the riots by sending federal law enforcement to prevent the mob from doing just that.

Wheeler now calls federal assistance for his city “an attack on our democracy.” Oregon Democratic Gov. Kate Brown condemned the move as “a blatant abuse of power.” The state’s Democrat Sens. Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden even introduced legislation to end the “paramilitary occupation” in U.S. cities where protests in solidarity with Portland have unleashed a second wave of violence.

Legacy media, of course, have indulged and even perpetuated the Democrat narrative that Portland’s violence was catalyzed by federal “stormtroopers” sent in by the evil orange emperor, nevermind the mayor’s own complaints at the beginning of the month. If not blaming federal agents for sparking the protests, the media is blaming police officers for the violence during which protestors who tear down public property also launch attacks featuring mortar-style fireworks and lasers that can cause permanent blindness

“Portland police and feds are ‘responding to largely peaceful protests with violence,'” headlined a piece by government-funded PBS.

“Federal Agents Push Into Portland Streets, Stretching Limits of Their Authority,” read another in The New York Times.

“Federal agents use tear gas to clear rowdy Portland protest,” observed ABC. Indeed, things have gotten very rowdy.

New York Rep. Jerry Nadler, however, has gone one step further, claiming violence in the city to be nothing more than marely a “myth.”

"Fauci Attacks Choirs, Implies Worship Is Less Important Than Protests","Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in June said churches should consider suspending their choir if located in an area with a high infection rate. On Friday, Fauci refused to say whether large protests should also be suspended.

“My recommendation still holds that the choirs should refrain from singing. When you sing and you protect your voice, the aerosols of the virus come out,” he said, contradicting Centers for Disease Control recommendations on socially distanced worship.

According to Newsy, the CDC also first wrote on their website that faith communities should “consider suspending or at least decrease the use of choir/musical ensembles, congregant singing, chanting or reciting during services…” Those initial recommendations then disappeared from the website overnight without an explanation. Fauci stood by the recommendation.

While state and local governments lock down bars and restaurants, and limit large gatherings like worship services, mass protests and demonstrations have been left free to flood city streets.

During a House hearing of the committee investigating the Trump administration’s pandemic response, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) asked Fauci, “Do protests increase the spread of the virus?”

“Crowding together, particularly when you’re not wearing a mask, contributes to the spread of the virus,” Fauci said. Jordan asked the question again. Fauci dodged, then claimed he didn’t think the protests question was relevant. “I’m not in a position to determine what the government can do in a forceful way,” he said.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/07/31/fauci-attacks-church-choirs-implies-worship-is-less-important-than-protests/,2020-07-31
8 Democrat Myths Barr Debunked Between Deliberate Interruptions,"When Attorney General William Barr testified before the House Judiciary Committee last Tuesday, Democrats’ rhetorical questions reinforced eight falsehoods previously peddled by left-wing media. Notwithstanding these attempts to prevent Barr from setting the record straight, the attorney general dismantled much of the fake news that has made headlines over the last two months.

Here are the highlights of the media myths congressional Democrats paraded for the public during the hearing.

Myth 1: Barr overruled prosecutors’ sentencing recommendation for Roger Stone because of a Donald Trump tweet.

Several of Democrats’ attacks focused on President Trump associate Roger Stone. Democrat committee Chair Jerry Nadler accused Barr of personally interfering “with ongoing criminal investigations to protect the president and his allies from the consequences of their actions,” and then “when career investigators and prosecutors resisted these brazen unprecedented actions, you replaced them with less qualified staff who appear to be singularly beholden to you.” Rep. Hank Johnson, a Georgia Democrat, drilled more specifically into the Stone case, misrepresenting the facts in the process.

“Isn’t it true that when prosecutors in the Roger Stone case filed a memo with the court recommending a sentence of seven to nine years in prison, a few hours later, President Trump tweeted that the sentence recommendation was quote, ‘a disgrace,’” Johnson began. Barr acknowledged that reality. Johnson then asked Barr whether, “several hours after that, you filed a pleading with the court stating that the sentence recommendation would be changed and that you would be asking for a lighter sentence for Roger Stone?”

Barr attempted to explain that Johnson was mispresenting the circumstances, but the Democrat cut Barr short to grandstand. “You’re expecting the American people to believe that you did not do what Trump wanted you to do when you changed that sentencing recommendation and lowered it for Roger Stone?” Johnson asked rhetorically.

However, when Republicans allowed him to explain the circumstances of the about-face, the attorney general exposed the ridiculous nature of the charge that he was cutting breaks for Stone. “Stone was prosecuted under me, and I said all along, I thought that was a righteous prosecution,” the attorney general explained. But “line prosecutors were trying to advocate for a sentence that was more than twice anyone else in a similar position had ever served, and this is a 67-year-old man, first-time offender, no violence,” Barr continued. “I wasn’t going to advocate that because that is not the rule of law.”

The attorney general also testified that he “never discussed our sentencing recommendation with anyone outside the Department of Justice.” Barr then laid out the timeline: On Monday, Barr explained, he had concluded that the Department of Justice (DOJ) “should not affirmatively advocate for seven to nine years,” but would leave the decision to the sentencing judge. However, that night, the prosecutors filed a sentencing memorandum that did not reflect Barr’s decision.

“That night I told people we had to fix it first thing in the morning. We did as soon as I got in,” Barr said. Only then did Barr learn about the president’s tweet. Barr explained that he then “hesitated because I knew that I would be attacked for doing it. People would argue that I did it because of the tweet, but I felt at the end of the day, I really had to go forward with our filing because it was the right thing to do.”

Barr did do the right thing: In sentencing Stone, the presiding judge stated she was concerned seven to nine years would be greater than necessary,” and that she “agree[d] with the defense and with the government’s second memorandum.”

Myth 2: Barr dropped the case against Flynn because he was Trump’s friend.

Democrats likewise pushed the narrative that Barr filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charge against former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn because of Flynn’s connection to the president. Barr countered this charge both generally and specifically.

“I agree the president’s friends don’t deserve special breaks, but they also don’t deserve to be treated more harshly than other people, and sometimes that’s a difficult decision to make, especially when you’re going to be castigated for it,” Barr told the Judiciary Committee. “But that is what the rule of law is, and that’s what fairness to the individual ultimately comes to, being willing to do what’s fair to the individual.”

Barr then stressed what Democrats ignore—that it was an independent U.S. attorney in St. Louis “who had 10 years in the FBI and 10 years in the Department of Justice as a career prosecutor, who “determined, based on documents that had not been provided to Flynn’s side and not been provided to the court that in fact there was no basis to investigate Flynn.”

Rather, Missouri-based U.S. Attorney Jeff Jensen concluded “that the only purpose was to try to catch him in saying something that they could then say was a lie.” “Furthermore, it was clearly established by the documents that the FBI agents who interviewed him did not believe that he thought he was lying,” Barr added.

Knowing what we know now, Barr concluded, “We don’t think any of the U.S. attorneys in the department would have prosecuted this case.” And what “I’m trying to establish is that we will use the same standards for everybody before we indict anybody. This goes for both sides,” Barr stressed. He later added that “the true two standards of justice were really during the tail end of the Obama administration.”

Myth 3: Barr fired an acting U.S. attorney for investigating Trump associates.

Another line of attack focused on Barr’s firing of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman. In June, Barr had decided to replace Berman as acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York until the permanent U.S. attorney could be confirmed. Barr had announced Berman would be “stepping down” because he intended Berman to remain in the DOJ. Yet after the announcement, Berman went public with a statement that he wasn’t going anywhere. Berman’s insubordination led to his immediate firing.

At the time, the media narrative ran that Barr had fired Berman because he was investigating Trump associates, and possibly even Trump. The House Judiciary Committee attempted to push that theory too, but Barr shot it down,” calling it “nonsense.” “Anyone familiar with the Department of Justice would say that removing a component head is not going to have any effect on any pending investigation,” Barr noted.

Myth 4: Barr punished Michael Cohen but rewarded Paul Manafort.

Democrats on the committee also attempted to paint the attorney general as showing favoritism to former Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort while retaliating against former Trump-attorney turned Trump critic Michael Cohen. Rep. Eric Swalwell took the lead in pushing the myth that Barr had retaliated against Cohen.

“Did you know that as a condition of Cohen’s release from prison, the government intended to direct Cohen not to engage with the media and not to write a book?” Swalwell asked Barr. Barr said “no,” then attempted to explain that situation.

Cohen had been furloughed from prison, Barr explained, and the conditions of that home confinement were set, not by the Bureau of Prisons but “by the probation office, which is part of the U.S. Court System.” “And it was the U.S. Court System that had the requirements about not writing,” Barr explained.

Swalwell ignored Barr’s response, claiming this condition of release was retaliatory, even though Barr’s office had nothing to do with the condition. Swalwell also attempted to paint Cohen’s return to prison as retaliatory, but again, Barr countered it was the probation office that had determined Cohen was being “uncooperative.” At that point, the Bureau of Prisons determined Cohen was no longer eligible for home confinement. Barr would also later testify he “didn’t even know [of] the decision to send Cohen back to prison.”

Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas) pivoted from Swalwell’s charge of retaliation against Cohen to an allegation that Barr favored Manafort by arranging his release from prison out of concern for the coronavirus.

“In March 26 and April 3rd, your department released guidelines, criteria, setting priorities by which people would be released early,” Garcia began. “By your own Department’s admission, Manafort did not meet that criteria. Since the start of this pandemic, we have repeatedly urged you to use your authority to protect vulnerable populations in prisons. Instead, you release the president’s former campaign manager.”

Barr had little chance to respond to the charge, with Garcia—like the rest of the Democrats on the committee—interrupting when he tried to correct the record. Yet, as she ended her tirade, Barr succinctly countered the claim: “The director of the BOP testified under oath: No one from Justice Department was involved” in the decision to release Manafort from prison.

Myths 5, 6: Barr used tear gas to clear out peaceful protestors for a photo op for Trump.

The myth that Trump and Barr are supposedly squashing peaceful protests throughout the country also held top billing at Tuesday’s hearing. One main line of this attack focused on the narrative that Barr had directed the removal of peaceful protestors, including with tear gas, from Lafayette Square in Washington, DC so Trump could walk to St. John’s Church for a photo op.

“On the first day of June, the world watched in horror on live television as federal agents deployed by the administration, and with you present and telling him to get it done, used force to clear Lafayette Park so that the president, with you and others at your side, could walk across the park and have a photo op in front of St. John’s church,” one committee member charged. Rep. Pramila Jayapal repeated this claim, saying Barr had directed “federal officers to close in on the protesters and to use shields offensively as weapons, tear gas, pepper balls, irritants, explosive devices, batons and horses to clear the area just so the president could get a photo op.”

‘There was unprecedented rioting right around the White House. Very violent.’

While Democrats refused to allow Barr to respond to the charges, Republicans provided the attorney general a chance to detail the facts. “There was unprecedented rioting right around the White House,” Barr explained. “Very violent.”

“During that time about 90 officers were injured. In fact, the Secret Service was so concerned it recommended the president go down to the shelter,” Barr noted. “There was a breach of the Treasury Department, the lodge—an historical building on Lafayette Park—was burned down, and St. John’s Church was set on fire,” Barr added.

On Monday, Barr explained, “there was total consensus that we couldn’t allow that to happen so close to the White House, that kind of rioting,” and “therefore we had to move the perimeter out one block and push it up toward I Street.” This plan had nothing to do with the president’s decision to walk to St. John’s Church, Barr explained.

Barr also responded to another falsehood, noting that no tear gas had been used in moving the perimeter. Rather, tear gas was used to clear the way for a fire truck to put out the fire at St. John’s Church the previous evening.

To say the protest was peaceful was also not accurate: “It is a fact that the park police reported, and I saw myself projectiles being thrown from that crowd,” Barr explained, “so I did not consider them at all peaceful protesters.”

Myth 7: Portland is just a bunch of peaceful protestors.

Next, the Democrats turned to Portland, chastising Barr for sending federal “troops” to the Oregon city, with Rep. Zoe Lofgren blaming the federal response for the violence. “The governor of Oregon and the mayor of Portland has asked that the federal troops leave because the reaction has actually been in reverse proportion, people are showing up because the troops are there,” Lofgren said, confusing federal law enforcement officials with the military.

She then proceeded to paint the protests as mostly “nonviolent,” with a “wall of moms” leading the way. Nadler pushed this narrative too, claiming “the protestors aren’t mobs, they are mothers, and veterans, and mayors.”

“I think your characterization of Portland is completely false,” Barr responded, and then laid out the facts—which are much different than the myth narrated by the Democrats on the committee. “In Portland, we have a relatively small number of federal officers who have been withstanding, [the assault] for almost two months. It’s a great strain, but we cannot just stand aside and allow the federal court to be destroyed.”

Where ‘we don’t have the support of the local government, we have to take a stand and defend this federal property.’

Where “we don’t have the support of the local government, we have to take a stand and defend this federal property,” Barr explained. Further, without the deployment of federal law enforcement, the federal building in Portland would likely not be standing today, Barr told Republican Jim Jordan, as “there’ve been multiple attempts to set it afire.”

The attorney general also squashed the idea that defending the federal courthouse in Portland infringed on protestors’ free speech rights. “I have to say,” Barr told the committee, “I don’t understand why a small contingent of marshals inside the court poses a threat to anybody’s First Amendment rights.”

Then he obliterated the idea that these are peaceful protestors: “They set up a fence on federal property,” and when people are arrested “it’s because they’re trying to come into the fence.” “These aren’t peaceful protesters,” Barr made clear. “They bring power tools to cut through the wire and so forth to get in.”

For two months, the federal courthouse has been under daily attacks, “where people march to the court, try to gain entrance and have set fires, thrown things, used explosives and injured police, including, just this past weekend, perhaps permanently blinding three federal officers for with lasers,” Barr countered.

Then, in what should have shamed the majority party, Barr laid out the shocking reality that makes him “concerned for the country”: “this is the first time in my memory that the leaders of one of our great two political parties, the Democratic Party, are not coming out and condemning mob violence and the attack on federal courts.” “Why can’t we just say the violence against federal courts has to stop? Could we hear something like that?” the attorney general asked the committee.

Myth 8: The DOJ is sending federal agents to cities to bolster Trump’s re-election bid.

But no, instead, at Tuesday’s hearing, Chair Jerrold Nadler took the peaceful-Portland-protestors myth national, claiming “the president wants footage for his campaign ads, and you appear to be serving it up to him as ordered.”

“There are those who believe you are sending federal law enforcement into these cities, not to combat violent crime, but to help with the president’s reelection efforts,” the committee chair claimed, adding “the president has made clear that he wants conflict between protesters and police to be essential claim at the central theme of his campaign.”

“We are on the defense, we’re not out looking for trouble,” Barr countered. He also refused let Nadler get away with the sleight-of-hand that sought to conflate protesters and rioters. “Protesters are good. Demonstrations are good. They’re part of the First Amendment. What I’m condemning is people who commit crime,” Barr told the committee. And federal law enforcement officials are not targeting protesters, but those engaged in violence, such as those attacking the Portland federal courthouse.

Democrat Rep. Jayapal attempted to reframe the attack by suggesting Barr responds differently when the protesters support the president. When Michigan protesters swarmed the Michigan capital, carrying guns, “some with swastikas,” Barr did nothing, Jayapal claimed.

Even with his limited ability to get a word in during his exchange with Jayapal, Barr nonetheless exposed the two fallacies in her argument: First, the Michigan capitol is not a federal building. Second, unlike in Portland, the local officials were able to handle the situation.

While Democrats on the committee hit Barr with a scattershot of other criticisms, none of those complaints hit their target either. Instead, Barr batted away falsehood after falsehood, and all within a fraction of the speaking time the Democrats controlled via their “reclaim their time” ploy.

"Tyranny Strikes Texas As Dallas Leaders Cancel YAL Event, Allow Protests","It is often remarked that Texas is the greatest place in America for freedom. Talk to any fourth- or fifth-generation Texan long enough, and you’ll soon hear anecdotes and folk legends about how the state’s history is virtually written in the blood of gallant men and women who overcame the merciless American frontier, overthrew a repressive government, and established a republic where an empire once held sway.

2020, however, has had a way of subverting our expectations, often in the worst ways possible. What happened to Young Americans for Liberty (YAL) this week was no exception.

As more than 1,400 YAL students and 100 elected officials prepared to gather in Dallas on Monday for YAL’s premier event, the organization received word that the city had issued a “force majeure” order canceling it “to limit the spread of COVID-19.” This happened a mere three days before the event was scheduled to kick off — and in spite of several months of caffeinated workdays registering attendees, booking flights, and coordinating with investors. YAL even had its staging, banners, and audio/video equipment waiting in the parking lot of the venue.

Make no mistake: This was never about safety. With tyrants, it never is.

The City of Dallas is playing political favorites. Millions of Americans have taken to the streets to protest, riot, loot, and vandalize over the last two months, often failing to wear masks or abide by basic social-distancing guidelines. In Dallas, protests have continued for more than 40 consecutive days, in many cases amounting to thousands of protesters in the streets at any given time. In fact, just last month, the city’s “leadership” — if we can even call them that — lifted curfew restrictions on protesters after they had filled the streets for nine straight days. Yet the city has made zero interventions against these people on the basis of “public health.”

The city’s problem is not that 1,000 socially distanced students would have been in the same room with masks and temperature checks. It is not that city officials had the best interests of their people at heart as they made this decision. It is not even that they are trying to curb the spread of COVID-19. It is that YAL was there to teach young people how to fight the very kind of tyranny the city relishes.

Perhaps if this event were named “Mobilize Black Lives Matter,” it would not have been canceled. Who knows, maybe YAL could have even gotten CNN or MSNBC to issue a glowing story about it, calling attendees “mostly peaceful protesters.” Perhaps the organization could have even established an autonomous zone so Democratic mayors such as Jenny Durham and Ted Wheeler could praise it. It could be called the “Summer of Love.”

Some critics have said YAL should have known this would happen. The organization scheduled this months ago, however, and YAL had been in close contact with local officials to ensure the organization followed all protocols. The city demanded YAL have only boxed meals, and YAL obeyed. The city demanded YAL keep groups who traveled with one another together at the event, and YAL obeyed. The city demanded all seating be arranged according to social-distancing requirements, and YAL obeyed.

YAL played the city’s game, and it changed the rules when it was too late to adapt. This was a deliberate and politicized move to crush a liberty-aligned organization’s ability to gather and express its First Amendment rights.

One canceled convention and one organization’s troubles are not the biggest problem. The problem is the greater outpouring of tyranny that has spread across this country like a corrosive acid, slowly dissolving our constitutional liberties one mask mandate, one shelter-in-place order, one bankrupted business, and one canceled event at a time.

If we are to save our country from little dictators like the local mafia-style overlords running Dallas, the time for playing nice is over. We will never get a fair fight or an equal playing field, no matter how far we bend or how much we compromise. The time to meet these tyrants head-on is now.

WaPo Glorifies Antifa In Fashion Spread That Fails To Make Helmets Sexy,"The Washington Post published a glowing photo essay on Saturday featuring Antifa protestors in Portland showing off their riot gear. The article fawns over the anarchists’ courage to maintain a months-long assault on the city in the name of social justice, violently attacking federal agents and holding public property under siege.

The piece, authored by Post protest reporter Marissa Lang prominently highlights testimony from several Portland activists sharing their one-sided experiences painting police as violent agents an oppressive state with no mention of word “riot” where protestors have sowed more than 70 days of perpetual unrest, including attempts to burn down a federal courthouse.

According to Lang, protestors merely “directed their anger at the federal courthouse where they broke windows and tagged the building with bright paint” which provoked White House action to send in federal law enforcement to quell the chaos.

Despite conceding that “federal agents and police officers say” they’ve been subject to violent attacks by demonstrators, Lang goes on to attribute that much of the violence is instigated by white supremacists seeking to exploit the crisis.

Here’s the only passage where the author uses the term, “violent.”

City officials and soccer moms alike readily admit to being ‘antifa’ – an abbreviation for anti-fascist that many conservatives and far-right groups have decried as violent, left-wing extremists prone to looting and fire-setting.



White supremacists and far-right militia groups have been drawn to Portland to stand against the anti-fascist movement. Extremists such as the Proud Boys, a group that espouses white nationalist ideology, have clashed violently with counterprotesters and anarchists.

The Post’s photo essay meanwhile, attempts to capture glory of the self-righteous organizers terrorizing the city by weaving in professional photos of the story’s subjects donning their riot gear as if it were a Maxim photo shoot, for social justice of course.

The Saturday fashion spread comes just a week after the Post declared an end to the Portland riots following the retreat of federal law enforcement.

The withdrawal of sworn federal officers providing support for an overwhelmed police department however, has offered no peace to a city in peril. The Portland Police Bureau (PPB) have declared eight unlawful assemblies since the beginning of August and four official riots.

Even Portland’s progressive Democratic Mayor Ted Wheeler, who once marched with the protestors demanding he resign, decried the never-ending unrest.

“You are not demonstrating, you are attempting to commit murder,” Wheeler said to those who tried to set fire to a police building, warning rioters they are becoming props in President Donald Trump’s bid for re-election. “You are creating the B-roll film that will be used in ads nationally to help Donald Trump during this campaign.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/10/wapo-glorifies-antifa-in-fashion-spread-that-tries-fails-to-make-bike-helmets-sexy/,2020-08-10
"Local Residents Push Back Against Violence, Looting In Their Neighborhoods","While violence ensued across American cities in recent months, many citizens are becoming exasperated with the protesting, rioting, and looting and are demanding a change when their own local leaders won’t. According to a recent Rasmussen Reports poll, “50% of Likely U.S. Voters say the police should crack down on the protests to bring them to an end.”



Multiple cities over the last week have seen a pushback against violence from citizens who agree that the original protest movements may have lost their purpose.

According to The Daily Wire, residents of Chicago’s Englewood neighborhood interrupted a Black Lives Matter protest on Sunday “to demand the protesters leave.”

Some community members and protesters are getting into arguments here at the 7th district police station, many community members are demanding that these protesters leave their community and protest somewhere else. #Chicago #ChicagoProtests pic.twitter.com/Ej1dUwGRgc — Tyler LaRiviere (@TylerLaRiviere) August 11, 2020

The Chicago BLM group, joined by other activist organizations, was “holding a protest to support those arrested for looting” after over 100 people were arrested on Sunday “claiming that looting is ‘reparations’” and they were just “taking what is rightfully theirs from ‘corporations.’”

Residents of the nearby neighborhood however, quickly organized a counter-protest asking the non-resident activists to disperse.

“If your issue is with the police, take it to 35th and Michigan [where CPD headquarters is located]. Don’t come in Englewood with it,” Darryl Smith, president of the Englewood Political Task Force and Englewood resident of 51 years. “If the people on 56th Street want to come over and protest the police, they can do it. But no one from the North Side or Indiana or any place other than Englewood can come here and do that.”

From earlier Daryl Smith a Englewood resident of 51 years, and community activits tells reporters why he doesn't want protesters in his neighborhood. #Chicago #ChicagoProtests pic.twitter.com/5PepJ68Y5C — Tyler LaRiviere (@TylerLaRiviere) August 12, 2020

“Y’all don’t come out when a kid gets shot. Y’all come out when it’s got something to do with the f****** police,” Smith added.

Another Englewood resident also expressed his frustrations “They didn’t let the community know. They didn’t put flyers on peoples’ doors,” Kidd continued. “If they would’ve gotten something incited with the police, who’s gotta deal with it tomorrow? The community. Not them. They’ll be somewhere sipping sangria somewhere. I’m telling you like it is.”

According to on the ground reporters, the protest was “canceled” by BLM about 30 minutes after it started.

“We have a relationship with the commander and if anyone wants to come in here and talk to the police about the shooting or anything, they have to go through us,” the group reportedly stated.

The local BLM organization however, disputed this claim on Twitter saying that they didn’t “cancel” the protest.

Meanwhile, in Richmond, Virginia, The Washington Post reported that residents became more than uneasy with looting and violence since the most recent outbreak of rioting over the last week.

According to one Richmond resident and her husband, attempts to ask the protesters to relocate so her family could sleep were met with cries of “no justice, no peace.”

“I have been very sympathetic to [fighting] injustice and inequality, but it seems like right now the protesting and the destruction of private property has nothing to do with any of that,” Nuckolls added.

According to the Post, “a group of about 50 protesters vandalized downtown businesses and smashed windows at the city’s John Marshall Courthouse, causing what Mayor Levar Stoney said was hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage.”

“Regular citizens [feel] caught in the middle,” said Charlie Diradour, a Monument Avenue citizen. “This movement started to take the statues down and many of us — I would say a majority of us who live on Monument Avenue — were completely down with that movement, all up until they started breaking s—. And that was a bridge too far for many of us. Because what does it benefit society to have the right to have your voice heard if your next move is to break a window of the Omni Hotel, the John Marshall court building?”

According to Fox 12 in Portland, many are worried for their safety as rioting and violence permeate their neighborhood close to the Portland Police Association.

“It really feels like a war zone,” Marta, a resident told Fox.



Other residents are feeling the physical effects of the rioting as well.

“It’s scary. We’re not sure what is going to happen and just the destruction. You know, if they were marching and so on, I’d be out there marching with them,” Tina Henderson, another resident said.

While many in the neighborhood feel the desire for the violence to calm down, many aren’t sure what to do.

“Of course I want the city to do more but I don’t know what the answer is, you know if I were the mayor I don’t know what I’d be doing,” Henderson said.

"Wisconsin Rally Protests Mask Mandate, Stifling Dissent From Doctors","On Sunday, Wisconsinites protested a new state-wide mask mandate by Gov. Tony Evers at a “We Will Not Comply” freedom rally held in the rural town of Mosinee. It was also a protest against the recent Marathon County online reporting tool for violations of the mask mandate.

Marathon County Health representative Judy Burrows said the online complaint form and tracking process will help officials identify businesses or organizations with multiple reports. “Our primary intention is to educate on the need and benefit to wearing a face covering to prevent the spread of COVID,” Burrows said.

The event was organized by Get Involved Wisconsin, a grassroots organization that was also responsible for an April rally held at the same location to protest Evers’s stay-at-home orders.

The rally this past weekend drew national speakers such as Dr. Simone Gold and local physicians, including cardiac surgeon Fernando Riveron. Both doctors asserted medical experts are being silenced by corporate media and big tech companies about the true risks of coronavirus and weighing those against other medical concerns.

Gold, a board-certified emergency physician and founder of America’s Frontline Doctors, spoke at a “White Coat Summit” in Washington D.C. last week about the effects of COVID on different age groups, people with varying preexisting conditions, and treatments, including the benefits of Hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 patients.

A video clip of Gold speaking at the summit’s press conference went viral, garnering more than 15 million views on Facebook alone. It was shared on Twitter by President Trump and Donald Trump Jr. The corporate media viciously attacked Gold and the other doctors who participated in the summit. Gold’s website was shut down. She was also recently fired from two hospitals where she worked in California.

“I’m a populist,” said Gold at the Wisconsin rally. “Information belongs to the people.” Gold encouraged the crowd “to elect people who will be for the people and not for the elite,” adding, “Doctors have been muzzled… If we don’t do something, we’re going to be living in China.”

Riveron, a Cuban immigrant and a board-certified cardiac surgeon, evoked the famous words of President Roosevelt, stating, “We have nothing to fear but fear itself.” Echoing Gold, he stated, “Physicians have been muzzled… People will call your lawyer and fire you if you tell the truth about what you think is the analysis of science.”

Riveron referenced a colleague, cardiologist Dr. David Murdock, who was fired from the Aspirus hospital in Wausau, Wisconsin for attending the April rally protesting Evers’s stay-at-home orders. Murdock says he was slandered by colleagues, hospital administration, and local papers for attending the rally and not wearing a mask. In a post addressing his termination, Murdock wrote:

The loss of millions of jobs caused by the shutdown was hard to comprehend. I felt I needed to observe the economic side on a more personal level in our community. So, I attended the rally… Upon returning home, I learned of some of the comments made on social media about me and the orchestrated slander of my name and reputation. These comments had my wife and family in emotional turmoil and my wife, in particular, in tears numerous times. I was accused of taking action that would cause the death of children. I was accused of showing a total disregard for my patients’ health. These words and accusations do not in any way reflect my 33 years of dedicated service to my patients and my community. I was called a conspirator and an anti-science Trumptser. But most disturbing was the vulgarity involved and a clear sense of an orchestrated political hit job. There were words said using language that I haven’t heard since high school. They vandalized my home by scattering feces on the front steps prompting me to file a police report. They also mocked Christianity. Nobody should have to put up with this evil. No human has the right to inflict this pain on others.

Another speaker at the rally, Yuri Maltsev, an economic historian and a professor of economics at Wisconsin’s Carthage College, joked that ‘the ghost of socialism” is haunting him. He stated it was “ridiculous” how readily people are giving up the “freedom that many people lost their lives and other things for.”

Maltsev and Riveron’s personal experiences with authoritarian governments reinforced Gold’s message that the government, media, and big tech companies are silencing medical professionals during this pandemic. They say citizens are allowing American leaders to take away freedoms and move the United States closer to socialism.

"At DNC, Muriel Bowser Repeats Debunked Lie About DC Protesters","Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser addressed the Democratic National Convention (DNC) Monday night, praising the “peaceful protesters” in front of a backdrop of Black Lives Matter Plaza. These are the same protesters who ransacked the nation’s capital earlier this summer and who the legacy media claimed that federal law enforcement officers had tear-gassed.

“While we were peacefully protesting, Donald Trump was plotting,” Bowser said, painting the president as a despotic emperor deploying agents of an American Gestapo to quell the worst outbreak of civil unrest to break out in the capital district in decades. “He stood in front of one of our most treasured houses of worship and held a Bible for a photo op. He sent troops in camouflage into our streets. He sent tear gas into the air and federal helicopters.”

The episode of which Bowser spoke happened in June, when nationwide riots were reaching their peak, devastating communities and terrorizing major cities across the country just days after George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody.

Following days of severe civil unrest sweeping the nation, President Donald Trump gave a prime-time address from the White House Rose Garden to declare the administration’s pledge to restore law and order. This was followed by a short walk across the street to the historic St. John’s Church which the so-called peaceful protesters had burned the night before.

As Trump made his way across the street, demonstrators hurling projectiles at law enforcement officers were removed from the president’s vicinity, after 150 officers were injured including several hospitalized with concussions. While Democrats and allies in legacy media charged law enforcement with deploying tear gas to remove a crowd singing “Kum ba yah” in front of the White House, the Park Police later released a statement debunking the left’s narrative and confirming that “no tear gas was used.”

“At approximately 6:33 pm, violent protestors on H Street NW began throwing projectiles including bricks, frozen water bottles and caustic liquids,” United States Park Police acting Chief Gregory Monahan said. “As many of the protestors became more combative, continued to throw projectiles, and attempted to grab officers’ weapons, officers then employed the use of smoke canisters and pepper balls. No tear gas was used by USPP officers or other assisting law enforcement partners to close the area at Lafayette Park.”

Later on CBS, Attorney General William Barr offered an account of the events, contradicting what was reported from the media, exhaustively sympathetic to the rioting.

There were three warnings given. But let’s get back to why we took that action. On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, OK, there were violent riots in Lafayette Park, where the Park Police were under constant attack at the, behind the bike rack fences. On Sunday, things reached a crescendo. The officers were pummeled with bricks, crowbars were used to pry up the pavers at the park, and they were hurled at police. There were fires set in not only St. John’s Church, but a historic building at Lafayette was burned down.

Death Toll Rises To An Estimated 30 Victims Since ‘Mostly Peaceful Protests’ Began,"An estimated 30 people have died after supposedly “peaceful” protests erupted across the nation after George Floyd’s death on May 25. What started as civil protests and marches to address police brutality, condemn racism, and support Black Lives Matter, quickly turned into violence unmatched since the Civil Rights Movement.

Despite claims by politicians and corporate media that these protests were “mostly peaceful” and safe to do amidst a pandemic because racism is also a public health crisis, US cities were quickly plagued with looting, violence, arson, vandalism, and damage to public property.



It was this mayhem that proved fatal for some. Protestors and bystanders, ranging in age from 14 to 77, lost their lives in the chaos that media outlets labeled as a “peaceful demonstration intensified.”

Victims of the violence included a police captain, a former football player, a federal officer, a photographer, business owners, teens, and others. A majority of their deaths were caused by shootings, but a select few were caused by being hit or dragged by cars. One news report documented that a body was found burned to death in the remains of a Minneapolis pawn shop set on fire by rioters.

Chris Beaty, 38, who played football for Indiana University, was shot and killed on the street during an Indianapolis protest on May 30. Beaty’s family says they were told he was helping two women being mugged when he was shot.

Another life taken away.. just a week ago we spoke and just In a snap of a finger to hear that you not with us because you got your life taken away no reasons. I’m for the protesting but the violence got stop in both parties and this killing is breaking family and friends heart. pic.twitter.com/eYCM5RddmD — Kemoko Turay (@Kturay_58) June 1, 2020

Only some of those responsible for these deaths have been found and charged.

“Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black families,” the Associated Press reported.

While the media circus ran circles around the issue of these riots and deaths, others spoke out, calling for the cessation of violence to shield people from further injury and death.

In June, Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best spoke out against the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) after a series of fatal shootings, violence, and tensions between CHAZ members and police broke out in the area.

“Enough is enough,” she said, calling for CHAZ’s dispersal. “Two African American men are dead at a place where they claim to be working for Black Lives Matter.”

“We have had multiple other instances of assaults, rape, robbery, shootings, and this is something that is going to need to change,” she added.

Attorney General William Barr called out the violence stating that it was causing “senseless havoc and destruction on innocent victims.”

“In the wake of George Floyd’s death, violent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests to wreak senseless havoc and destruction on innocent victims,” Barr wrote.

“To state what should be obvious, peaceful protesters do not throw explosives into federal courthouses, tear down plywood with crowbars, or launch fecal matter at federal officers. Such acts are in fact federal crimes under statutes enacted by this Congress,” he added.

Barr also pledged to take legal action against those causing this destruction.

“We’ve had scores of indictments so far for such things as arson, destruction of federal property,” Barr said. “We have right now about 500 investigations underway, so it’s picking up pace. We are committed to holding accountable the people who engaged in this.”

President Trump tweeted that there must be law and order where violence is rampant. He also honored one of the victims of the riots, David Dorn, “a Great Police Captain from St. Louis” who died after being shot by looters at his friend’s pawn shop in St. Louis.

In addition to the deaths and injuries caused by the riots, cities around the United States are suffering from some of their most fatal and violent weeks in years. According to a report released by the Anderson Economic Group, looting costs in America’s 20 largest metropolitan areas exceeded $400 million in just the first weekend of rioting.

Chicago Mayor Who Can't Contain Rioting Bans Protests From Her Block,"Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has banned protesters from congregating on the block where she lives, citing concerns for her safety. She defended the ruling, stating, “I have a right to make sure that my home is secure.”

While like all other Americans she certainly has a natural right to her person and property being protected from the violence of protests and riots, why aren’t the residents of Chicago afforded the same security?

https://twitter.com/Heminator/status/1296554684975636480?s=19

Lightfoot has been a controversial figure in Chicago due to comments about the looting and violence that keeps breaking out there this summer during Black Lives Matter protests. While Lightfoot has openly supported the protests, she has criticized the riots.

In the aftermath of a particularly violent struggle between cops and rioters in July, she released a statement, saying,

Hundreds took to the streets yesterday to express their First Amendment right to protest. I unequivocally support and will always fight for the rights of individuals to peacefully protest on any issue… There is a dialogue that must be had to honestly confront the deeply ingrained history of racism and discrimination that has subjected Black, Indigenous and other communities of color in our city and our nation for too long… Unfortunately, last night, a portion of the protesters turned violent… These violent acts are unacceptable and put everyone at risk.

Despite strong criticisms of cops in general, she has praised the Chicago police and does not support defunding the police. She claims instead to support “reform,” which is not good enough for the local Black Lives Matter leaders. Due to her refusal to support disbanding the police despite paying protesters lip service, Lightfoot says threats are being made on her and her same-sex partner’s lives, which led her to ban protesters from gathering on her block. Anyone who disobeys the ban will be arrested.

Of course, it is a basic duty of government to protect people from violence in their own homes. Yet this is the reality for many in Chicago right now. The city is facing looting and rioting that, despite mass arrests, is largely remaining unchecked. Chicago just faced its most violent month in 28 years, as 107 people were murdered in July. Most of these unjust deaths resulted from shootings. Chicago has stringent gun restrictions on its books, but that hasn’t stopped criminals from obtaining or using weapons.

If Lightfoot can maintain a heavy police presence around her home at all times, maybe some of those 140 officers could be used to protect the residents of the city she was elected to lead. It is blatantly hypocritical for Lightfoot to allow her city to descend into turmoil and violence while she uses police to protect her while she fails to provide the same to the people she’s been elected to serve.

"CNN Accidentally Displays Honest Chyron, Quickly Changes It","CNN accidentally displayed an honest chyron Monday afternoon in reporting on the militant mobs terrorizing the Wisconsin town of Kenosha this week after a police shooting of a black man. The chyron however, was taken down after 15 seconds.

“8PM Curfew Ordered After Violent Protests Over Police Shooting Of Unarmed Black Man In Wisconsin,” read the text on screen during “The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.”

The word “violent” however, was quickly removed and changed to instead read “8PM Curfew Ordered After Protests Over Police Shooting Of Unarmed Black Man In Wisconsin”

The chyron came just hours before a second night of anarchic terror gripped the city, and after mobs already set an entire car dealership and a church on fire in the early hours of Monday morning.

CNN Changing Tune On Violent Riots Because Of Polls,"CNN anchors Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo spoke out about the violence in Kenosha, Wisconsin Tuesday, providing a stark contrast in CNN’s previous coverage and analysis of the sustained riots in cities around the nation. Lemon and Cuomo cited polling as the main reason why rioting should now be acknowledged as something more than “peaceful protests.”

“It’s showing up in the polling. It’s showing up in focus groups. It is the only thing right now that is sticking,” Lemon explained.

“The riots and the protests have become indistinguishable,” he added.

CNN's Don Lemon is panicking over the disastrous impact that far-left riots are having on the Democrat Party. pic.twitter.com/lqZl7nuKQ6 — Ian Miles Cheong @ stillgray.substack.com (@stillgray) August 26, 2020

Don Lemon states what Democrats and supporters of the ""Defund the Police"" movement don't want to hear: ""Most Black people don't want police defunded. They don't want fewer police there. They want more. And most communities of color in this country need police…"" pic.twitter.com/EFjPaWlsOx — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) August 26, 2020

Lemon proposed that Kenosha is a “Rorschach Test for the entire country.”

“I think this is a blind spot for Democrats. I think Democrats are ignoring this problem or hoping that it will go away, and it’s not going to go away,” Lemon said.

Despite their previous unwillingness to acknowledge the issue, Lemon and Cuomo urged Democrats to address the rioting and police reform, saying that, even though no solution will be finalized by the election, Biden must at least acknowledge it.

“The problem is not going to be fixed by then,” said Lemon. “But what they can do, and I think maybe Joe Biden may be afraid to do it…he’s got to address it. He’s got to come out and talk about it.”

“And they’re rioters, not protesters. They’re criminals,” he added.

Lemon also spoke out against the “defund the police” movement, claiming that “most black people don’t want police defunded.”

“They don’t want fewer police there. They want more. And most communities of color in this country need police more than white communities,” he explained, giving the disclaimer that many wouldn’t like his statement.

While Cuomo and Lemon both cite the polls as the reason for Democrats to capitalize on this movement as part of their political platform, some have pointed out that polling in recent weeks, especially about the DNC, is not yet released.

Last night @donlemon called for the rioting to end, ""because it's showing up in the polling."" What polling? The media polling after the DNC Convention that was never released over the weekend. Yes, folks, it exists. You’re just not allowed to see it. https://t.co/yjm1UUdfmf — Rasmussen Reports (@Rasmussen_Poll) August 26, 2020

Lemon and Cuomo’s acknowledgment of the riots as violent crime serves as a strict pivot from CNN’s previous coverage of Kenosha and other riots across the U.S. On Monday, a CNN broadcast covering the Wisconsin riots labeled them as “violent protests” in the displayed chryon for a few seconds, but the chryon was quickly changed to remove the word “violent.”

“8PM Curfew Ordered After Protests Over Police Shooting Of Unarmed Black Man In Wisconsin,” the new chyron read.

CNN Chyron: 'Fiery But Mostly Peaceful Protests After Police Shooting',"A CNN chyron reporting on the riots exploding in Kenosha, Wisconsin, during the early hours of Tuesday morning appeared to have gone unnoticed.

“Fiery But Mostly Peaceful Protests After Police Shooting,” the news network’s television headline blared while its reporter, Omar Jimenez, stood in front of several burning cars.

The footage features Jiminez explaining to viewers that while the city burns to the ground behind him, the so-called protesters destroying the blue-collar midwestern town were being “mostly peaceful.”

“What you’re seeing behind me is one of multiple locations that have been burning in Kenosha, Wisconsin, over the course of the night,” Jiminez said, reporting that daytime demonstrations marked a stark contrast to the riots occurring behind him after Jacob Blake’s shooting by Kenosha police on Sunday. “The common theme that ties all of this together is an expression of anger and frustration over what people feel like has become an all-too-familiar story.”

The early-morning episode Tuesday resembles a similar incident in May when MSNBC’s Ali Velshi stood in front of a liquor store burning behind him and called the riots surrounding the camera crew “mostly a protest” that is “not generally speaking unruly.”

“But fires have been started,” Velshi noted.

On Wednesday, CNN’s chyron writer accidentally corrected its network’s television headline to describe the events in Kenosha as “Violent Protests” for 15 seconds before editing the caption to read simply “Protests.”

Watch here:

Kenosha became the next hotspot of American civil unrest after a police shooting of a black man Sunday set off a new wave of rioting, even after the first wave, following George Floyd’s death, had barely begun to settle.

On Tuesday, Wisconsin’s Democratic Gov. Tony Evers declared a state of emergency over the unrest. He accepted federal reinforcements to support police on Wednesday after initially refusing White House help to quell the chaos. The demonstrations turned deadly Tuesday night when three people were shot, leaving two dead and another wounded, amid the turmoil that intensified without enough law enforcement officials present.

Portland Protestors Occupy Mayor Ted Wheeler’s Apartment Building Demanding His Resignation,"A group of activist protestors organized a sit-in at Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler’s apartment building on Friday, demanding that he “reduce the Portland Police Bureau budget, commit to never voting for police budget increases again, and resign.”

The demand letter also commands Wheeler, who it labels as a “true embodiment of white supremacy” to “complete abolition of the Portland Police Bureau by 2022, with no private or technological replacement” and redirect the money from the PPB into social programs.

Local news reports claim there were “about 10 people inside the lobby,” but that a larger crowd—estimated to include over 100 people—congregated outside the building playing loud music, dancing, chanting, and holding various signs.

Despite the protestors’ cries, Wheeler responded to them on Twitter. He thanked the protestors for their “powerful display of solidarity” and encouraged the protestors to “move forward with reform, recovery and resilience plans for PDX.”

While the crowd of protestors outside the building dissipated later that night, rioters gathered around the Portland Police Association building and attempted to set it ablaze, ultimately choosing to light a dumpster mattress on fire instead. According to local news, “the situation was quickly declared a riot, and multiple arrests were made.”

Over the last few months, Portland has suffered massive violence and damage from rioters protesting police brutality in light of George Floyd’s death. Many of these attacks by rioters have been targeted at the PPA, with destruction and vandalism even targeting a memorial to a fallen police officer.

One Dead In Portland After Pro-Trump Caravan Clashes With Protestors,"Another night of riots in Portland turned deadly when a President Trump supporter wearing attire with the emblem of “Patriot Prayer,” a conservative group against the leftist domestic terror group Antifa, was fatally shot on Saturday. The shooting was documented on multiple video livestreams that show a small group of people yelling, then scattering after shots were fired.

Here is video recorded from a distance of the shooting. https://t.co/wtxItCDMay — Andy Ngô 🏳️‍🌈 (@MrAndyNgo) August 30, 2020

The Portland Police Bureau reports that the man died of a “gunshot wound to the chest,” but no suspect was named in the homicide investigation as of Sunday morning.

“This violence is completely unacceptable and we are working diligently to find and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible,” said Portland Police Chief Chuck Lovell.

Antifa and Black Lives Matter protestors rallied and cheered at the announcement of the victim’s death, claiming that “he was a f—ing Nazi!” and that “our community held its own.”

Some even went so far as to say “I am not sad that a f—ing fascist died tonight.”

The shooting came just minutes after a large pro-Trump car caravan made its way through Portland and the downtown area, heavily protested and opposed by Antifa.

Videos of the scene posted to social media show throngs of people throwing objects at the vehicle train and attempting to block the street so the vehicles can’t proceed. Some of the Trump supporters, in exchange, maced and shot the protestors with paintballs.

According to the Portland Police, the caravan “stretched for miles” and officers addressed “sporadic fighting and vandalism” as well as “responded to scenes of fights, disturbances, and collisions throughout downtown and made some arrests.”

On Friday, Wheeler sent a letter to President Trump refusing help from federal law enforcement, despite three months of ongoing violence and riots in Portland in the name of social justice.

Wheeler sent the letter on the same day protestors gathered outside of his apartment building and occupied the lobby, demanding that he “reduce the Portland Police Bureau budget, commit to never voting for police budget increases again, and resign.”

A riot was declared later that night when a group of people attacked the Portland Police Association building and tried to set it on fire.

New York Times Failure In Kenosha Shows Why Online Media Is Essential,"Clips of blazing businesses, the sounds of gunfire, and harrowing tales from Kenosha, Wisconsin, have inundated the social mediasphere and airwaves since violent riots broke out following the police shooting of 29-year-old Jacob Blake. The footage, it seems, is inescapable.

When one young man present at the riots Tuesday night fired his gun on three others, killing two and leaving the third injured, not only were on-the-ground reporters there to capture it in real-time, one of them rushed into the horrific scene to administer aid to one of the victims lying on the pavement, a gunshot wound in his head.

BREAKING someone has been shot. @RichieMcGinniss just carried him into a car. Directly across street from hospital — Shelby Talcott (@ShelbyTalcott) August 26, 2020

This wasn’t a reporter from the Washington Post or CNN. In fact, on Monday night, when the violence began escalating and New York Times correspondent Julie Bosman figured she would be in for another long day Tuesday, she left for the night.

Bosman called the Kenosha County sheriff, who told her law enforcement was outnumbered. With only about 200 police officers and not enough National Guardsmen, he said 9-1-1 calls would pour in all night and officers are simply unable to respond timely enough. “So I realized that tomorrow was probably also going to be a long day,” Bosman said. “So I decided it was just time to get home.” Bosman didn’t respond to a request for an interview.

“As the night went on, it sure became less and less press,” noted Shelby Talcott, a media reporter at the Daily Caller who covered the Kenosha mayhem throughout the violent hours.

Julio Rosas, a senior writer at Townhall, told The Federalist that while the chaos and darkness made it difficult to tell which people amid the nightly riots were members of the press, “If they were there, they didn’t post any videos of it.” Journalists by nature love to be the first to break a story with original footage, meaning it’s highly unlikely that many mainstream reporters were on the streets recording but simply kept their videos to themselves.

Instead, in the absence of legacy media getting the full story in southern Wisconsin, online publications, freelancers, and live-streamers took to the streets to report.

Based on the work of the small group of reporters, including from the Daily Caller and Townhall, as well as freelancers such as Brendan Gutenschwager, all the puzzle pieces of the protests-turned-riots began to fit together, especially from Tuesday night, when the fatal shooting occurred. Talcott said it’s the Caller crew’s habit to spread out to cover as much ground as possible. As a result, we have eyewitness accounts and videos from multiple angles spanning the entire sequence of the night’s most notable events.

“Julio saw the second shooting, Richie saw the first shooting, I saw the guy being chased down the street,” Talcott noted. You can read her entire account of the night’s events here.

Mainstream Media Rely on Online Media

The New York Times later assembled a thorough and helpful timeline of events related to the shooting. But the truth is, the paper of record never could have done that work without the tenacity of online media reporters.

“Our team’s content is dominating the national news landscape right now because we were one of the few digital natives staffed with young and brave reporters who view it as their obligation to tell the American public what is really happening in our cities and neighborhoods,” Richie McGinniss, chief video editor at the Daily Caller who administered immediate aid to one of the shooting victims and rushed him to the hospital, told The Federalist in a statement.

If the last several months of deadly demonstrations around the country, following the deaths of George Floyd in police custody back in May and now Blake, have shown us anything, it’s that just because the mainstream reporters might go home when the sun goes down doesn’t mean violent rioters do.

“What we’ve seen with these riots and protests is that things become violent at night,” Rosas said, his words confirmed by countless videos of looting and arson despite the mainstream media continuing to insist protests have been “mostly peaceful.” “We can talk about peaceful protests,” Rosas continued, but “if you’re ignoring the riots just because you weren’t there, that’s a problem.”

“We’re out ’til 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, and those hours matter,” Talcott said. “I think it’s important to get all parts of the story. … The problem is that everybody reports when it’s peaceful, not so much when it’s violent,” she continued. “It’s part of the story. It’s going to be part of history. It’s both peaceful and non-peaceful. They’re not mutually exclusive.”

When mainstream outlets did finally report on the scene at night, they lied about what was going on around them.“Fiery But Mostly Peaceful Protests After Police Shooting,” one CNN chyron blared, as reporter Omar Jimenez stood in front of an inferno of cars early Tuesday morning.

“When you had CNN at Kenosha, they had a narrative. They were trying to say it was mostly peaceful … as a building was burning behind them,” Rosas said, pointing to MSNBC’s similar reporting in Minneapolis. They just got it “completely wrong,” he continued. “That’s why people don’t like the media, and I don’t blame them.”

Americans Need the Full Story

Even as most Americans believe the free press is essential to self-government, their confidence in the media has eroded sharply in recent years. According to a 2019-2020 Gallup/Knight Foundation study, 86 percent of Americans believe there’s at least a fair amount of political bias in news coverage, with 49 percent perceiving “a great deal” of bias. Republicans especially doubt what they see on television and read in the headlines.

Depending on their sources for news, Americans are consuming vastly different accounts of the events unfolding around the country, but if it weren’t for these teams of persistent online media reporters, it’s likely Americans wouldn’t even have access to the truth. Press conferences, rallies, and interviews with local business owners as they clean up broken glass in the daylight — these all make for nice stories, but they ignore unfortunate realities, and they demonstrate a lack of both journalistic curiosity and ultimately integrity. Americans need access to what unfolds when things turn a dark corner, long after mainstream reporters become frightened or tired. “Our team’s goal in Kenosha was simple,” McGinniss told The Federalist. “[G]ather a complete picture of the events as they unfolded, interviewing citizens cleaning up the streets the day after, protesters with good intentions, those bent on destruction of property, and even the armed individuals who were guarding businesses in a show of force.” In other words, his team’s goal was to convey the whole story, peaceful and non-peaceful alike. “If we didn’t tell [the story], would it get out?” Talcott asked. “Would anyone know what’s going on? I’m not sure.”

"The Street Violence And Gunplay Started With The Left, Not The Right","In the wake of recent deadly clashes between Black Lives Matter activists and counter-protesters in Portland and Kenosha, Wis., the media is rolling out a new narrative: that right-wing extremists have introduced firearms to what have been, until now, “largely peaceful protests,” and BLM demonstrators are now trying to figure out how to keep themselves safe.

Consider an appallingly dishonest New York Times headline on Tuesday that declared, “As Guns Get Drawn at Protest Sites, Demonstrators Fear a Volatile New Phase.” The Times frames months of protests and street violence nationwide as “largely between protesters and the police, with the conflict playing out in tear gas volleys and lobbed projectiles.”

In this telling, the deadly clashes in Portland and Kenosha represent “a more perilous turn” because of the arrival of “right-wing activists” with firearms who are “bent on countering the racial justice protests with an opposing vision of America”—as if we’re seeing a peaceful and benign protest movement suddenly under threat from MAGA-hat-wearing militias.

As right-wing groups increasingly move to confront protesters in U.S. cities, demonstrators are assessing how to keep themselves safe https://t.co/g8jeTXjtTG — The New York Times (@nytimes) September 1, 2020

This is gaslighting on steroids. In fact, BLM protests have been violent from the beginning, long before “right-wing activists” showed up with guns. The list of shootings and violent crimes committed by BLM protesters is long, and it destroys the mainstream media’s false narrative that these protests have been peaceful.

There were the fatal shootings in Seattle’s CHOP back in June that left two teenagers dead and one wounded. There was the man who was burned to death inside a pawn shop during riots in Minneapolis in May. There’s all the footage of BLM activists attacking people in the streets, like the Portland man who was dragged from his truck and beaten unconscious by a mob last month. And of course, there’s been the persistent and widespread looting and mayhem in cities like Chicago, Seattle, Portland, Minneapolis, and elsewhere.

There has also been plenty of gunplay at these so-called protests, and any claim to the contrary is utterly divorced from reality. What follows is a partial list, just for the record.

BLM Gunman Reportedly Shoots Driver In Provo, Utah

In late June, 33-year-old Jesse Taggart was arrested in Provo, Utah, after police say he ran up to an SUV that drove past a BLM protest and shot the driver through the passenger-side window. The driver, a 60-year-old Provo resident, was not part of the protest or any counter-protest, but just happened to be driving by.

After he allegedly shot the man, Taggart reportedly ran after the vehicle as it was speeding away and fired another round, while another “protester” drew a weapon and pointed it at the SUV but did not fire. The driver got away but was later hospitalized.

After the shooting, Taggart put away his firearm and continued to protest, police said. “This same protester later approached another vehicle at 500 North and University Avenue, striking and breaking the window with the handgun.”

BLM Gunman Shot And Killed In Austin, Texas

On July 25 in Austin, Texas, BLM protester Garrett Foster was shot and killed after allegedly pointing his AK-47 at an Uber driver, later identified as U.S. Army Sgt. Daniel Perry, whose car had been surrounded by BLM protesters.

According to Perry’s attorneys, Perry mistakenly turned onto a street where a BLM march was taking place after dropping off Uber passengers. Perry, who has not been arrested or charged with a crime, told police that protesters surrounded his vehicle and began pounding on it, then Foster approached his vehicle and pointed an AK-47 at him. That’s when Perry fired on Foster, striking him multiple times.

Perry then drove away and called the police to report what happened. After Perry fired, a second gunman in the crowd fired a volley of shots at his vehicle as he drove away. Police are still investigating the shooting and calling for eyewitnesses to come forward.

BLM Gunman Arrested For Firing At Jeep In Aurora, Colorado

During a BLM protest in Aurora, Colo., in late July, 23-year-old Samuel Young allegedly shot at a Jeep that was trying to get through a crowd of protesters on the interstate. Young missed the Jeep but police say he hit two fellow protesters.

One of the victims was rushed to the hospital with serious injuries, the other was grazed by what police say was Young’s bullet. Young was later arrested and charged with four counts of attempted first-degree homicide and four counts of first-degree assault.

BLM Protesters Allegedly Fire Shotgun At Police Officer Outside His Home

In early August, a group of about 60 protesters gathered outside the home of a police officer in Wauwatosa, Wis., who is on paid administrative leave after fatally shooting a 17-year-old in February, a case that’s still under investigation. During the ensuing confrontation, one of the protesters allegedly fired a shotgun at the officer as he retreated into his home. Three men have since been arrested and charged.

All this to say, don’t believe The New York Times and the rest of the mainstream media when they try to tell you that firearms have only just been introduced to the toxic brew of BLM and Antifa mob action in our cities. If you haven’t heard about some of the above incidents, it’s because the media would rather pretend they never happened. They interfere with the narrative.

Firearms and violence have been part and parcel of these demonstrations from the very beginning. The only difference now is that counter-protesters, having seen this violence play out for months on end with no law enforcement or elected officials acting to stop it, are also arming themselves.

The result is no doubt going to be more bloodshed and likely more death. But please, let’s not pretend this didn’t start with left-wing extremists. We all know it did.

Black Lives Matter Protesters Reviling Trump's Kenosha Visit: 'Riots Work',"When President Trump traveled to Kenosha, Wis., on Tuesday, Black Lives Matter protesters congregated by the county courthouse, which was gated off and protected by National Guardsmen. The protesters carried signs that said “F-ck the police,” “Dump Trump,” and “F-ck Trump,” but there was not a single sign for or against Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden.

A Black Lives Matter protester and Bernie Sanders supporter who traveled from Grand Rapids, Mich. to protest Trump’s visit told me, “I don’t know who I’m voting for” in the 2020 presidential election. The Bernie bro described the Biden nomination as “blowing.” Although he thinks left-wing activists will ultimately vote for Biden, he said it is going to be “very hard” for him to vote for Biden. “If I don’t vote for Biden it’s going to be for the Green Party,” he said.

Lamar Whitfield, the founder of the No More Foundation, traveled to Kenosha from Chicago to protest. Lamar said, “Right now, I’m not really in support of any of the candidates.” Lamar doesn’t know whether Trump or Biden are “sincere.” “We need someone that is going to come out and make a difference,” said Lamar, who even said he might sit out of the election.

“I’m less pro-Biden and more anti-Trump,” said Rachel Thompson, a BLM protester who also traveled to Kenosha from Chicago. Niko Estwind, who self identifies as a “revolutionary Communist” added he believes Biden is a “war criminal.”

“Biden still represents the Washington establishment in a lot of ways,” explained Thompson. “… he’s pro-fracking… he was the one who wrote the 94’ crime bill.” “There’s a lot that I think is pushed on us, that he’s the most progressive candidate, and I want that to stop, and I want the vote-shaming to stop,” she said. Although Thompson is not enthusiastic about Biden, she affirmed her support for him, stating, “I think when it really comes down to… do we want a fascist regime to continue for another four years?”

Enthusiasm among the BLM protesters centered around “police brutality,” “justice for Jacob Blake,” and their hatred for the “fascist,” Trump. In a tight presidential race, with tensions higher than they have ever been in American politics, one might think left-wing activists, at a protest many of them traveled from out of state to attend, would be more excited about their presidential nominee. He has certainly attempted to win them over by allowing Sanders and fellow socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to write Biden’s policy platforms.

Yet there are many reasons members of the left, especially young voters, aren’t excited about the “pro-fracking” and “establishment” Democrat presidential nominee.

Biden has made blatantly racist statements throughout his career and even during this election cycle. Biden’s own running mate, Kamala Harris, viciously attacked him on the debate stage in prime time, insinuating he was a racist for opposing busing laws in California. Now that Biden has decided to denounce rioting, it is hard to imagine that his popularity is rising among the radical left-wing parts of the Democratic Party, such as the protesters who came to Kenosha.

Although I did not come across a BLM protester who thought looting and destruction of property was necessarily a good thing, many excused the behavior because it “gets attention.” A young woman I spoke with explained the rationale: “Riots work. Burning down buildings works and it gets the attention of people to make real change. That’s what we had to do during the civil rights movement. That’s what we had to do during Stonewall. It’s what we had to do during women’s rights. People that aren’t white cis males wouldn’t have rights if it weren’t for burning down a f-cking building.”

While some left-wing activists, like the young woman I interviewed, see merit in violent and destructive rioting, many Americans are put off by it, especially old school blue-collar Democrats, like the many who live in Kenosha.

Racial minorities in many ways are being hit the hardest by BLM and Antifa rioting across the country this summer, which is taking place in mostly poor black and brown neighborhoods. In Kenosha, an Indian immigrant, who owns a family-run car dealership had his entire lot and American dream destroyed by BLM arsonists. He says insurance will not cover his losses.

Valerie, a 25-year-old African-American former Democrat from the inner city of Milwaukee, was in Kenosha supporting President Trump. She told us she does not believe Democrats help black people, but use them by exploiting “the pain” in their communities.

Valerie said the welfare state, burning buildings, and defunding the police are not the solutions she wants to see for black people. To Democrats' solutions Valerie said, “I’m good, no thank you.” pic.twitter.com/c31w2IWGxr — The Federalist (@FDRLST) September 2, 2020

Valerie said that the welfare state, burning buildings, and defunding the police are not the kind of solutions black people need. “I’m good, no thank you,” she said to Democrat solutions. “If anything, I see Republicans doing things to help my community. I don’t see Democrats doing things to help my community,” said Valerie.

Thanks to recent polls, Democrats have begun to realize that condoning domestic terrorism is not popular with voters, and they are scrambling to appease undecided voters, classical liberals, and minorities who do not like the destruction and violence BLM and Antifa have brought to their neighborhoods.

Biden has decided to play both sides. He denounces rioting, but still protects violent elements of the radical left, like some BLM rioters and Antifa, by not specifically calling them out and by endorsing policies that distribute government awards and attention based on race. Biden is hoping that blanket-condemning violence will appease both sides of the Democrat vote. However, he risks turning off everyone. The radical left may become more put off by his establishment behavior, and undecided Americans may think he is not done enough to condemn violence.

The question is will “anti-Trump not pro-Biden” be enough to get people out to vote for Biden, or will significant numbers of Democrats sit this election out, write in a candidate, or vote for in a third party.

Time will tell, but Trump certainly doesn’t have the enthusiasm problem Biden has. Trump supporters waited hours in partial rain just to get a glimpse of President Trump’s motorcade. They were pro-Trump, not simply anti-Biden. Unlike the BLM protesters, the Trump supporters showed support for their nominee with Trump flags, signs, hats, T-shirts, cozies, and even “MAGA” cheese heads.

Yes, a woman I met wearing a MAGA cheese head, who has been to seven Trump rallies, said proudly, “the true cheese heads of Wisconsin love our president!”

"Elites Only Care About The Politics Of Riots, Not The Lives And Property Lost","Portland militants eclipsed 100 days of consecutive rioting this weekend to cap off a historic summer of unrest, which appears likely to persist through election day as campaigns amplify nationwide divisions.

After months of exhaustive attempts to downplay the riot violence, and even justify the brutality, Democratic elites and their allies in corporate media have begun to change their tune on the destructive forces gripping the nation’s cities. They are now decrying the left-wing savagery, not out of concern for fellow citizens, but rather to ensure a Democratic re-election this fall after observing a notable shift in the presidential race in Trump’s favor.

2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden only began to forcefully condemn the riot violence of his own base late last month, after qualifying each of the his past few criticisms with a denunciation of the police, who have become the targets of mortar-style fireworks and permanently blinding lasers.

“It’s showing up in the polling. It’s showing up in focus groups. It is the only thing right now that is sticking,” said CNN’s Don Lemon panicking on-air as conventions wrapped up going into September. “The riots and the protests have become indistinguishable.”

Of course, seated right next to him on screen was the network’s Chris Cuomo, who just months ago asked where in the Constitution it says protests were supposed to be “peaceful” at the onset of the initial outbreak of unrest in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death.

Here’s the text from the First Amendment, emphasis ours:

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

Some however, including many at CNN which two weeks ago aired a chyron reading “Fiery But Mostly Peaceful Protests After Police Shooting” as its reporter stood in front of a burning building, have clung to the false narrative that the protests have only featured demonstrators spontaneously lobbing Molotov cocktails in cities “peacefully.”

According to a new study from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) published last week, which attempts to frame this year’s demonstrations as overwhelmingly peaceful, the country suffered 570 violent protests erupt in nearly 220 locations nationwide.

Here’s a look at some of the wreckage the Biden campaign wishes the American public couldn’t see, gathered by reporters the corporate media didn’t send. Indeed, one New York Times reporter went home early during one of the first nights of rioting in Kenosha because she was tired.

This year’s carnage has now claimed the lives of more than 30 people across the country while wreaking havoc on communities by exacerbating divisions and destroying businesses in the name of social justice, many of which were minority owned. Despite protestors discounting the impact of widespread looting as merely forced reparations from businesses that have insurance, many small enterprises have emerged from the wreckage facing the cruel reality that any money collected will only come to cover a fraction of the costs associated with the damage.

But for our Trump-obsessed political elites, stopping the riots is not about the small business owner now forced down to the food pantry to feed their family because militant anarchists destroyed their life’s work while on some quest to achieve social justice. Rather, the riots must be stopped so that Democrats can dodge the political consequences and ensure a Joe Biden victory.

“To anyone considering employing violence as a form of ‘protest,’ let’s be perfectly blunt: The rioting and looting must end. Now,” wrote former Obama State Department appointee Marik Von Rennenkampff in an op-ed for The Hill aptly headlined, “End the violent ‘protests’ now – y0u’re only ensuring Trump’s reelection.”

“Not only are your actions guaranteeing Donald Trump’s reelection, you are alienating the people you desperately need to win over.”

But it’s not just Rennenkampff placing a higher priority on control of the White House over the lives who have been devastated.

"As Shot Police Fight For Their Lives, Protesters Shout 'We Hope They Die'","After a gunman opened fire on two Los Angeles County deputies Saturday night, protesters gathered to express hate for the police outside the hospital where the two “ambushed” officers still lie with life-threatening injuries. Police say they had to clear the protesters from blocking ambulances from bringing sick people into the hospital.

Videos from reporters on the ground show the protestors yelling at the police outside of St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood, California, calling cops “pigs,” screaming “f-ck the police,” and “we hope they die.”

The Los Angeles County Sheriffs pleaded with the public on Twitter to cease the protests, saying that they were “blocking the entrance & exit of the HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM.”

“DO NOT BLOCK EMERGENCY ENTRIES AND EXITS TO THE HOSPITAL,” the sheriffs’ office tweeted. “People’s lives are at stake when ambulances can’t get through.”

A male protestor and female National Public Radio reporter for Los Angeles were arrested at the protest and charged with violating California penal code 148, which prohibits anyone from stopping a “public officer, peace officer, or an emergency medical technician” from performing their assigned duties. The violation of the penal code is punishable with up to a $1,000 fine or up to one year in the county jail.

The Saturday shooting, depicted in a video released by the L.A. County Sheriffs, shows the suspect walking up to the police vehicle and shooting into it “without warning or provocation.”

According to the sheriffs’ department, the suspect is still at large.

L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva gave a press conference about the 31-year-old female and 24-year-old male deputies on Saturday night. He said both had successfully emerged from emergency surgery but remained in critical condition. Villanueva emphasized that this shooting is “a somber reminder that [policing] is a dangerous job.”

‘This is a somber reminder that this is a dangerous job, and actions, words have consequences and our jobs don’t get easier because people don’t like law enforcement,” he said.

Villanueva says the 2 deputies suffered multiple gunshot wounds and are out of surgery. One is a 31 yo mother of a 6 yo boy. Her husband is at the hospital. The other deputy is 24 years old. His parents and gf are with him. Villanueva says both were sworn in 14 mos ago. — Josie Huang (@josie_huang) September 13, 2020

"FLASHBACK: BLM Was Violent From The Start, And Media Knew It","Two officers were shot at close range while they sat in their cruiser Saturday night in Los Angeles. The victims, who were hit multiple times and in critical condition Sunday (but are now are expected to survive) are a 24-year-old man and a 31-year-old woman, whose six-year-old child stayed home while her husband came to her side in the hospital.

Outside, Black Lives Matter protesters blocked the emergency entrance to St. Francis Hospital, chanting “We hope they die” and “Y’all gonna die one by one.”

It was a murderous terrorist attack, within hours claimed, if not perpetrated, by Black Lives Matter. The shooter is still at large.

These two officers graduated the academy 14 months ago, before Democrat and other leftist politicians once again abandoned them to the mob. Since George Floyd died under arrest, these politicians have chanted Black Lives Matter’s anti-police lies alongside the crowds.

It wasn’t surprising it came to this. For more than half a decade, Black Lives Matter has used a nice-sounding name to shroud a terrorist agenda. “Now,” I wrote July 8, “through a combination of political foolishness, public amnesia, and willful media gas-lighting, America gets to live it all again — and more civilians and police officers are being attacked and even killed.”

And in the months since, we’ve seen roads and bridges blocked, young and old attacked, and a civilian murdered — all in its name.

In a sane world, Black Lives Matter blocking entrance of a hospital to cheer for the death of a 31 year old mother of a 6 year old boy would be the end of a movement. pic.twitter.com/V4bOV3LJ0K

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, in the meantime, condemned the shooting Sunday, but still refused to name the organization behind the violence on our streets. And why would he? On Wednesday, he attacked the president for even criticizing them. Campaign staffers donated money to bail out rioters in Minneapolis, then bragged about it online. His running mate tweeted a link so her supporters could follow suit. The Democratic Party thinks they’re on its side.

July 8, The Federalist — The Black Lives Matter protests are radical, they are violent, and they have claimed innocent lives all over the country. This isn’t a surprise: We’ve watched this movement played out before by many of the exact same leaders and even under the exact same name. Now, through a combination of political foolishness, public amnesia, and willful media gas-lighting, America gets to live it all again — and more civilians and police officers are being attacked and even killed.

The Black Lives Matter movement isn’t new at all. It’s the same loose collection of good-thinking people concerned over police violence and violent, anti-police and anti-family radicals as it was when it first gained national prominence in 2014.

As a refresher, the group was founded in 2013, during President Barack Obama’s second term and after the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida. It wasn’t until a rash of viral police-related deaths the next year that its national profile began to rise, including protests over the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Eric Garner in New York City, and then the following year Freddie Gray in Baltimore and Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina.

It was cheered on at the time by the media for all the same reasons it’s being cheered on today: Some of the viral videos and events convincingly depicted unjustified killings of black suspects by police, and despite the clear and radical politics of the founders, their name conveys an obvious truism. Unfortunately, it quickly showed its violent and intolerant side then, just as it has today.

Americans likely most clearly recall Ferguson’s protests, where for days black-owned businesses were torched and looted. Over the next few years, we watched in horror as Baltimore’s years-long revival was stopped in its tracks, block after block burned, and families attending an afternoon baseball game were set upon by screaming mobs.

As editor in chief of The Daily Caller News Foundation then, I oversaw our broader Baltimore 2015 riot coverage. As two in the morning approached on April 28, I turned off the police scanner, confident our guys were OK and looking forward to a few hours’ sleep before an early workday. Minutes later, our man running the coverage on the ground texted, “We are alright,” which indicated to me that they were not alright at all. Indeed, my friend was in the emergency room with two of our young reporters, who had been beaten and robbed by the rioters.

“When I saw the guy heading our way with a hammer in his hand and a bandanna covering his face, I knew he meant business,” a New York Daily News reporter who ran to their aid and then drove our guys through the mob to safety wrote later that morning. By the time they escaped, Caller reporter Casey Harper was struggling to stay conscious with a severe concussion, broken eye socket, and stolen phone, while his colleague Connor Wolf got off with a broken nose (and managed to hold onto his blood-stained notebook throughout). The two had been targeted for being white. No one slept until after we were back in the newsroom and their story was filed.

The violence and disruption they’d been subject to were tolerated and papered over by Democrats and corporate media, who made excuses for attacks on civilians, police, and media, and blamed outside agitators even while they were shouted down and disrupted by activists demanding “a conversation” but committed to ensuring no one speaks but them.

The following year, 2016, national Black Lives Matter protests broke out against the killing of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Dozens of officers were injured with projectiles and threatened by protesters. Then on July 7, just before 9 p.m. CT, a man opened fire on police preparing for one of the protests in Dallas, killing three policemen, wounding three others, and wounding one civilian.

During his retreat, he killed another officer, shooting him in the back after sneaking around a pillar he was taking cover behind during a gunfight. Seeking to fortify an El Centro College building, he opened fire on two campus cops, hitting one in the gut and injuring the other with shattered glass.

Police followed the man’s trail of blood through the school, engaging when they could clearly make him out in the darkness. From a window near where he made his last stand, he was able to kill another police officer who was on the street below. After negotiations broke down, the department killed him with a remote bomb.

Before he was killed, the gunman told a negotiator he was motivated by anger on behalf of the Black Lives Matter movement. His Facebook page called for people to “KILL EVERYTHING IN BLUE EXCEPT THE MAIL MAN.” By the morning of July 8, the murdered men included Officers Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, former Army Ranger Michael Smith, former U.S. Navy sailor Patrick Zamarripa, and former Marine Brent Thompson.

“Protests are messy,” a Vox writer wrote dismissively a week later. “When thousands or millions of people rise up in very passionate demonstrations, some bad, violent people are going to get caught up in the cause.”

But the pressure was intense, and reluctant cracks began to form in the ranks. “Black Lives Matter Was Gaining Ground,” a New York Times headline lamented, “Then a Sniper Opened Fire.”

Things quieted down. Donald Trump won the presidency, and shell-shocked journalists and Democrats went on a short-lived soul-searching mission, wondering what went wrong and how they could have misread the American public so badly. “Maybe we pushed too far,” President Obama privately reflected. “What if we were wrong?”

The introspection did not last, and by the end of the year — a year five police officers were killed and dozens wounded and hospitalized by Black Lives Matter radicals — BuzzFeed fondly looked back on 2016 as “the year Black Lives Matter went global.”

Just a few short weeks into the summer of 2020, it’s happening again: Seven shot in a Louisville protest park; one week later a protester killed; two dead in Chicago; four shootings in Seattle’s “autonomous zone;” a 77-year-old, black, retired St. Louis Police captain murdered; a 22-year-old, black woman in Davenport shot as she tried to leave.

Once again, politicians and media are defending and gaslighting for the violence. “I want to be clear how I characterize this,” MSNBC’s Ali Veshi said while buildings visibly burned in the night sky behind him. “This is mostly a protest. It is not, generally speaking, unruly.”

“But fires,” he admitted, back-lit by flames, “have been started.”

Meanwhile in Washington, D.C., rioters threw frozen bottles, glass, rocks, and bricks at police, then lit a church on fire. Afterward, corporate reporters, Democratic politicians, and even the leader of that church called the protests peaceful and attacked police tactics. The mayor allowed protesters to maintain that space, rename it Black Lives Plaza, and paint “Black Lives Matter” on the street.

“White women are lucky that we are just calling them ‘Karen’s,'” Washington Post editor Karen Attiah wrote June 29, “And not calling for revenge.” She listed her reasons for revenge on white women as the deadly racist massacre in Tulsa 99 years ago, the lynching of Emmet Till 70 years ago, liberal feminists making her feel excluded, and white women voting for Donald Trump.

Eight days later, she complained that “The ideas of the elite class is to be protected [sic] and supported at all costs,” but “black people… poor people… [and] uneducated people? We’re supposed to accept our marginalization.” She graduated from Northwestern University, won a Fulbright Scholarship, got a master’s at Columbia University, is now the global opinions editor for The Washington Post, and still has not been fired.

But the charade cannot stand. This past weekend, an eight-year-old black child was shot and killed besides her frightened mother as the driver tried to navigate around illegal barriers Black Lives Matter protesters were guarding near the Atlanta Wendy’s where a black man was killed after scuffling with police and stealing and firing one officer’s Taser. The little girl’s name was Secoriea Turner.

“They say ‘black lives matter,'” her father, hoarse with pain, accused the movement just hours later. “You killed your own. You killed your own this time.”

“You killed a child. She didn’t do nothing to nobody.”

“My baby,” her mother sobbed as family comforted her and helped her walk from the stage.

“At the point that an eight-year-old baby is killed, the discussions have ended,” the mayor announced. Just hours later, another person was killed and two more wounded nearby.

But some aren’t getting the message. “If you want an all-black lives matter movement started … then start that movement,” CNN’s Don Lemon told black actor Terry Crews Monday. “But that’s not what Black Lives Matter is about.”

Lemon was wrong on most things during that segment, but on that one point, he was right. Let’s see how long it takes us to remember.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/14/flashback-black-lives-matter-was-violent-from-the-start-and-media-and-politicians-knew-it/,2020-09-14
1960s Riots Foreshadow Today's Communist Weaponization Of Black Pain,"Leaving the White House grounds recently, I knew I would encounter protestors. You could hear them throughout the evening, trying to disrupt.

Most of the protestors were to the east and north of the White House, so staff directed us to exit out the west gate. A security guard offered to accompany me and my husband south to Constitution Avenue to meet our Uber driver, and we went safely home.

We heard numerous stories the next morning of guests who had been threatened and endangered. One friend with whom we had walked out of that west gate actually decked a foul-mouthed biker. The biker had veered too close to our friend’s wife while shouting threats and obscenities, and the husband then acted as a man might reasonably be expected to — he punched the guy.

Elsewhere, dozens of angry protestors surrounded Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and his wife Kelley as they left the White House grounds. Eventually, more police officers arrived and escorted the couple to the safety of their hotel.

Sen. Paul later reported: “After we got back to our hotel room and some safety we heard something frightening. The ‘protesters’ were staying on our floor — including the room next door to us. They were talking about their mob activities and even saying they thought we were here on this floor. We had to develop a 3 a.m. plan with the Capitol Police to get to safety.”

Paul asks, “Who are these people? Who paid for their hotel rooms? Who flew them in?” What he saw that night led him to conclude, “It’s organized. It’s paid for. It’s violent.”

Several days later, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf announced the Justice Department had launched an investigation into the organization and funding of the violent protests that have wracked cities across America for months. On Sept. 10, 50 members of Congress signed a letter, calling on Attorney General William Barr to investigate the groups responsible for the ongoing attacks against our republic.

How Do Communists Start a Riot?

This calls to mind a similar moment 60 years ago. President Dwight Eisenhower had planned a state visit to Tokyo in August 1960, but a series of demonstrations and riots by Japanese communists against the visit led the president’s security team to cancel. DeWitt Wallace, founding editor-in-chief of The Reader’s Digest, asked two pivotal questions: “All the newspapers say these are communist-inspired riots. How do we know? If you’re a communist, how do you start a riot?”

Wallace’s questions ended up on the desk of a 26-year-old journalist from Georgia named Eugene Methvin. Starting his research at the Library of Congress, Methvin looked up books on riots. He could find only one — a U.S. Army field manual from 1882 that had been written in response to the 1879 C&O railroad strikes.

In 1960, there were no riots in the United States, only in foreign countries. But that quickly changed. By 1965, America’s cities were imploding. By 1968, there had been more than 150 riots or major disorders. In 1967 alone, rioting left 83 people dead and 1,800 injured.

Methvin did come across a pamphlet published by The Senate Internal Security Subcommittee entitled, “Communist Mob Violence Around the World.” It had been written by the committee’s research director, Ben Mandel. Methvin described it as “the first published study of Communist techniques of ‘riot diplomacy.’”

Mandel knew about the topic because he had been a card-carrying member of the Communist Party. Indeed, he had been the one who handed Whitaker Chambers his Communist-Party card in the 1920s. Mandel referred Methvin to Steve Posony, who had fled Austria when the Nazis took over in 1938. Posony taught history at Georgetown and advised the deputy director for intelligence in the U.S. Air Force.

With Posony and Mandel as guides and mentors, Methvin spent the next 10 years trying to answer Wallace’s questions. They are essentially the same questions we should pose today.

How To Turn Civil Unrest Into Riots

How do we know those are Marxist riots in our streets? That one’s easy: because the organizers tell us they are. In a 2015 interview, Patrice Cullors said she and Alicia Garza, co-founders of Black Lives Matter, are “trained Marxists.”

The second question is more challenging: If you are a Marxist, how do you start a riot? Or, as Methvin posed the question: “What turns an ordinarily trivial city street arrest incident into a gargantuan explosion of mass violence?” After 10 years of research, Methvin found the answer, and he published it in “The Riotmakers.”

He opens with the Newark riots of 1967, which were eerily similar to the riots following George Floyd’s death. From the windows of two public housing buildings on the evening of July 12, 1967, police were seen dragging a struggling man upstairs into the police station. Rumors quickly flew that the police had beaten and killed the prisoner.

Protests began and soon erupted into riots. Over the next four days, 26 people were killed as a result and many homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed. Within 10 days, riots had broken out in 43 cities across the United States.

Methvin dug deep to understand the cause. One factor he identified was the “Tractor Revolution,” the mechanization of agriculture after World War II that pushed poor blacks and whites into northern cities. While many of those poor whites were able to transition into industrial jobs, Methvin saw that blacks faced numerous obstacles such as poor education, union racism, and housing discrimination, which kept them out of the suburbs and thus out of reach of the industrial jobs.

Other factors playing a role were: the welfare policies of the 1960s, which had started to erode the black family; rampant corruption in Newark’s government, and epic overcrowding. Newark was a tinderbox. Tens of thousands of black Americans were underemployed, undereducated, alienated, exploited, and resentful.

Spontaneous or Incited?

Methvin asked: Would Newark have erupted into violence spontaneously, or did someone light a spark? He found multiple sparks.

Three years prior to the summer riots of 1967, Tom Hayden had arrived in Newark. White, bored, and unhappy, the 25-year-old from Royal Oak, Michigan was on a mission to upend the comfortable world he had been born into.

Hayden was a leader of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). He had co-authored the manifesto that lifted them out of obscurity, the 1964 Port Huron statement, which begins: “We are people of this generation, bred in at least modest comfort, housed now in universities, looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit.”

Methvin describes the statement as “warmed-over Marxist analysis of American society, with a pinch of Lenin’s Imperialism, the Last Stage of Capitalism, and a heavy flavoring of anarchistic utopian idealism.” The statement called for a new left which “must include liberals and socialists,” and which would “start controversy across the land.”

‘We Are Actively Organizing Sedition’

What exactly was SDS’s work in Newark? While it might have been ennobled with the aspiration of rectifying the unjust and inequitable treatment of Newark’s black population, in essence, it sought to foment war. The immediate goal was revolution.

Three months before the Newark riot, Hayden took a local protégé, Jesse Allen, to Puerto Rico to meet with members of the pro-Castro “Movement for Independence.” While there, according to Methvin, Hayden denounced the Newark slum as a colonial possession of the United States. Just weeks before the Newark riot, SDS National Secretary Gregory Calvert revealed: “We are working to build a guerilla force in an urban environment. We are actively organizing sedition.”

To lead their guerilla force, SDS brought in Hassan Jeru Ahmed, a militant activist with a long criminal record who formed a battalion of “Black Beret” mercenaries and organized a campaign of agitation. Newark was flooded with anti-police propaganda and instructions for making Molotov cocktails, which included this directive: “Light rag and throw at some white person or white person’s property.”

The SDS spent three years exacerbating grievances, heightening tensions between black and white, demonizing the police and local government officials. They provided the training, the tools, and the weapons for violence. The riots that ensued, killing 26 and causing millions of dollars in damage, were in no way spontaneous.

The month after the riots had finally ended and the buildings had stopped smoldering, The New York Times Review of Books published an article by Hayden, in which he wrote:

The role of organized violence is now being carefully considered. During a riot, for instance, a conscious guerilla can participate in pulling police away from the path of people engaged in attacking stores. He can create disorder in new areas the police think are secure. He can carry the torch, if not all the people [sic], to white neighborhoods and downtown business districts. If necessary, he can successfully shoot to kill.

Communist Incitement Buried

Methven cites the numerous investigations and court cases that found similar patterns of deliberate instigation in riots across the United States: in Rochester, Cincinnati, Baltimore, San Jose, Toledo, Philadelphia, Watts, Detroit, Chicago.

Young, bored, white college students decided to conduct their revolutionary experiment using black people as the trigger.

In spite of all the evidence to the contrary, including Hayden’s well-publicized admission of SDS’s tactics and the open calls for violence by Black Panther leader Stokely Carmichael, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, appointed by President Johnson, concluded in what is known as the Kerner Report that racism was the primary cause of the riots.

Historian Sean Wilentz calls out the profound bias in that conclusion. The experts and analysts who made up the Kerner Commission were not unified in their conclusions.

Those who ultimately held sway justified the riots “not as signs of oppressive poverty and social breakdown but as righteous political protests against racist institutions, in particular the police. The events in Watts, Detroit, and elsewhere were not riots…they were rebellions; instead of seeking to quell the outrage in the nation’s inner cities, responsible government officials needed to awaken to the racism so deeply and systematically embedded in American life, and then attack it head-on.” Sound familiar?

Young, bored, white college students, seduced in their ignorance by the dysfunctional dream of Marxism, decided to conduct their revolutionary experiment using black people as the trigger. But at tremendous cost. The riots of the 1960s had a long-term negative impact on both the value of black-owned properties and on black income and employment.

Riots ‘Unambiguously’ Hurt Black People Most

Robert Margo, a professor of economics at Boston University, and William Collins, of Vanderbilt University, concluded: “the riots were unambiguously negative. They reduced incomes of African Americans’ employment, and they reduced housing values. In the case of housing values, it was broader; it actually affects overall housing values in cities, but the impact is primarily felt by African Americans.”

The Kerner Commission spent seven months looking into the cause of the riots and concluded, simply, it was racism. Methvin spent 10 years looking into the same question and came to a very different conclusion.

He fully acknowledged an array of negative factors affecting blacks in many American cities, but Methvin also demonstrated, incontestably, that the explosion of discontent into violence and rioting was not spontaneous. Indeed it was the direct result of planning and interference by white college students under the sway of Marxism.

Their meddling not only did nothing to help black people, it set many of them years back. As Margo concludes, “whatever was done afterwards was not enough to compensate for the damage and whatever economic consequences came after that.”

These Riots Are Not Random Or Spontaneous

Many of today’s leaders and mainstream media outlets would have us believe that the riots and violence sweeping across America’s cities this year are spontaneous. But history and current evidence tell us otherwise.

As Lora Ries and Charles Stimson of The Heritage Foundation pointed out in a recent report, “Video evidence and arrest records demonstrate that some rioters…have moved from city to city to cause violence using repeated tactics. Their movement and the places they go are not random. Rather, this appears to be part of an organized effort to cause chaos and destruction across the country…”

Similarly, Mike Gonzalez recently wrote in City Journal:

The protests that sprang up in the wake of George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis seemed like spontaneous outpourings of grief and anger. They weren’t entirely. Though many who joined their ranks may have been moved by outrage at the images of Floyd’s death, those operating behind the scenes have prepared for this moment for a long time.

Gonzalez cites Melina Abdullah, of BLM’s Los Angeles chapter, who told an interviewer that the demonstrations in that city had been strategically planned: “We built kind of an organizing strategy that said, build black community [to] disrupt white supremacy.”

The New York Times also cites the role of Black Lives Matter: “One of the reasons there have been protests in so many places in the United States is the backing of organizations like Black Lives Matter. While the group isn’t necessarily directing each protest, it provides materials, guidance and a framework for new activists.”

Not Just Parallels, But Direct Links

Not only are there strong parallels between the riots of 2020 and the riots of the 1960s, but there is a direct link between the organizers. As Gonzalez points out, one of the three BLM founders, Patrice Cullors, spent a decade working as a radical organizer in the Labor/Community Strategy Center, which was established and run by Eric Mann, a former member of the Weather Underground.

They bombed the State Department, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, the California attorney general’s office, and a New York City police station.

The Weather Underground was formed in 1969 as a militant wing of the Students for a Democratic Society. They sought “the destruction of U.S. imperialism and [to] form a classless communist world.” In seeking those ends, they bombed the State Department, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, the California attorney general’s office, and a New York City police station.

Andrew McCarthy recently documented ties between the BLM Global Network and the Weather Underground. Kyle Shideler has also exposed the ideological roots of BLM’s obsession with white privilege, which can be traced directly to the terrorists of the Weather Underground.

As the United States now finally embarks on a serious effort to uncover whether, as Rand Paul charges, the current rioting is planned and organized, they would do well to rediscover the ground-breaking work of Methvin. He exposed the very real injustices faced by black Americans, but he also exposed the way those injustices were exploited by those who had been seduced by the lies of Marxist utopia.

Through painstaking research, Methven was able to uncover exactly how those radical organizers turned despair and frustration into violence. We can also now see, with the benefit of hindsight, that the social demolition of the revolutionaries only hurt those it aspired to help.

To Truly Help Black People, Reject BLM

Why is this all of this so vitally important? Because right now, many well-intentioned Americans believe they are helping black people by putting Black Lives Matter signs in their front yards. A number of corporations believe they are helping stamp out racism by donating millions of dollars to Black Lives Matter. Middle schools and high schools across the country are using a curriculum developed by Black Lives Matter to teach children that America is riddled with systemic racism.

But in fact, Black Lives Matter is not about helping black people. It is about using black people to achieve the co-founders’ revolutionary, ideological aims.

BLM wants to overthrow the American system of deliberative democracy and ordered liberty and replace it with their Marxist hell. The sooner Americans wake up to that reality, the less black people will suffer as a result of their current exploitation by the radical left.

Study: Up To 95 Percent Of 2020 U.S. Riots Linked To Black Lives Matter,"Contrary to corporate media narratives, up to 95 percent of this summer’s riots are linked to Black Lives Matter activism, according to data collected by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED). The data also show that nearly 6 percent — or more than 1 in 20 — of U.S. protests between May 26 and Sept. 5 involved rioting, looting, and similar violence, including 47 fatalities.

ACLED is a nonprofit organization that tracks conflict across the globe. Its U.S. project that collected the summer protest data is supported by Princeton University. The project’s spreadsheet collating tens of thousands of data points documents 12,045 incidents of U.S. civil unrest from May 26, 2020 to Sept. 5, 2020. May 26 is the day after George Floyd’s death in police custody with enough fentanyl in his system to have died of an overdose if police had never touched him.

Of the 633 incidents coded as riots, 88 percent are recorded as involving Black Lives Matter activists. Data for 51 incidents lack information about the perpetrators’ identities. BLM activists were involved in 95 percent of the riots for which there is information about the perpetrators’ affiliation.

Early estimates from insurance agencies say the cost of this summer’s rioting will set a record surpassing that of the 1992 Rodney King riots, which cost an inflation-adjusted $1.2 billion. Much of that will be paid by taxpayers in the form of overtime and hazard pay for police and EMTs, emergency room visits, destruction of public property, and more. Of course, rioters are inflicting these costs during a time governments, and the people who fund them, have fewer resources due to coronavirus shutdowns and pent-up entitlement obligations.

A look at an interactive map illustrating the data shows just how widespread the summer BLM-linked rioting has been. It has not been limited merely to anarchist strongholds such as Portland, Oregon, or locales that saw media-spotlighted violent interactions between police and suspects, but has stretched across both major and minor U.S. cities and included dozens of locales with no violent police incidents this summer.

Here are some screenshots of the map. The circle size indicates the number of riots.

According to this record, rioting occurred in the United States this summer not just in Portland, New York City, Chicago, Washington DC, and other large U.S. cities, but in small and midsize cities such as Fort Collins, Co. (population 170,000), Cottonwood Heights, Utah (population 33,800), Gilbert, Ariz. (population 258,900), Wichita, Kan. (population 388,800), and Davenport, Iowa (population 382,600). Forty-seven states have seen riots this summer.

A report accompanying the data project, however, reads like an upscale attempt to blame the police for criminals’ decision to steal, kill, and destroy. Several times the report explicitly does so, such as here: “Although federal authorities were purportedly deployed to keep the peace, the move appears to have re-escalated tensions. Prior to the deployment, over 83% of demonstrations in Oregon were non-violent. Post-deployment, the percentage of violent demonstrations has risen from under 17% to over 42% (see graph below), suggesting that the federal response has only aggravated unrest.”

This is a logical fallacy called post hoc, ergo propter hoc: Because one thing happened after another, the first thing caused the second. It’s just plain false. In science, this error is described as the difference between correlation and causation. Social scientists ought to be aware of and refrain from employing it, yet these did not.

The cause of violence is not the police. It is not poverty. It is not one’s race. To say so is in fact a smear against poor people and people of the racial group identified. The cause of violence is the people who have chosen to be violent.

Rather than assigning responsibility for violence to those who engage in it, the report constantly pushes the criminal victimization narrative that the rioters are not to blame for their rioting. This is abuser psychology 101: The abuser is never responsible for his or her abuse. The people who might object to it are. This is also false and manipulative.

The report also attempts to downplay the wave of BLM-linked violence sweeping the nation this summer, even while documenting it.

“The vast majority of demonstration events associated with the BLM movement are non-violent (see map below). In more than 93% of all demonstrations connected to the movement, demonstrators have not engaged in violence or destructive activity,” it states. “Peaceful protests are reported in over 2,400 distinct locations around the country. Violent demonstrations, meanwhile, have been limited to fewer than 220 locations — under 10% of the areas that experienced peaceful protests.”

I’m sure it is comforting to those whose businesses have been burned down and insurance won’t cover it to hear that the movement that ruined their livelihoods protests peacefully in most other cities.

When unarmed black people comprise 1.2 percent (or less) of annual police shootings, it is alleged to be a gross injustice that may legitimize, or at least excuse, murder, and theft. Yet when an activist movement is linked with riots approximately 6 percent of the time it engages in public protest, we are to see that movement as “non-violent.”

ACLED labels a 5 percent rate of police use of “force” — such as rubber bullets, tear gas, pepper spray, and other crowd dispersal techniques — as “heavy handed.” Thus ACLED both claims a 6 percent rate of rioting is “peaceful” and “non-violent” and that a 5 percent rate of police response to such riots is “heavy handed.”

“Over 5% of all events linked to the BLM movement have been met with force by authorities, compared to under 1% of all other demonstrations,” its report says. Elsewhere, it says: “ACLED conducted a pilot data collection program for the US last summer, allowing for comparison of the current moment with the same time period last year. In July of this year alone, ACLED records nearly 2,000 demonstrations — an increase of 42% from the 1,400 demonstrations recorded in July 2019.”

The violence is not limited to the extreme of rioting. It is pervasive in the summer 2020 protests. Of the 12,045 incidents recorded by ACLED, 1,143 — or nearly 1 in 10 — involved violence of some sort: rioting, looting, clashes with police, cars rammed into crowds, bystanders pepper-sprayed, armed attacks. Of these violent incidents, 84 percent involved BLM.

These statistics could be interpreted as indicating BLM is unusually violent among U.S. political movements, but ACLED interprets it in a way that enables resentment against police. Widespread U.S. political demonstrations such as the Tea Party, however, almost never featured violence despite holding thousands of events. Tea Partiers were even known for cleaning up the public areas where they demonstrated.

The report goes on amazingly to suggest that police standing behind barricades using tear gas and rubber bullets is a disproportionate use of force against rioting in Portland that has included the use of blinding lasers, rushes at barricades with clubs, destruction of public buildings, bomb-throwing, arson, and murder: “In some contexts, like Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon (see below), the heavy-handed police response appears to have inflamed tensions and increased the risk of violent escalation,” the ACLED report says.

Judge for yourself whether police use of force and riot-dispersal techniques often seems justified by reading the project’s summaries of some of these riots based on largely local news reports. I picked incidents from smaller cities to avoid the most sensational and nationally publicized instances, in an effort to fairly illustrate what police were responding to. The italicized material below is all quoted directly from the project. The bold is added.

On 28 May 2020, about 200-400 people demonstrated in Columbus, Ohio in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and against police brutality and the death of George Floyd. The demonstration turned violent when businesses and the Ohio Statehouse were damaged. Some people threw water bottles, smoke bombs, and other items at police. Police used tear gas on the demonstrators.

On 28 May 2020, around 400 people held a demonstration in Albuquerque, New Mexico over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. At night, the demonstration turned violent when a group of rioters were approaching vehicles and trying to damage them. Also, several shots were fired from a car and 4 people were arrested. Another man took a baseball bat and started smashing police car’s windows. Police used gas to disperse the crowd and control the area.

On 29 May 2020, hundreds of people attended a demonstration in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and against the death of George Floyd. The demonstration was initially peaceful until conflicts broke out between the demonstrators and the police. A demonstrator was pepper-sprayed twice in the face. Another demonstrator was shoved to the ground. Vandalism was reported. 29 people were arrested. Clashes continued until the next morning.

On 29 May 2020, over 1000 demonstrations [sic] were held in Des Moines, Iowa over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. Police vehicles and buildings were damaged. Police used pepper spray and tear gas and made 12 arrests.

On 30 May 2020, people demonstrated in Grand Rapids (Michigan) in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and against police brutality and the death of George Floyd. Rioters smashed windows and lit fires. A non-violent demonstrator was pepper-sprayed and shot in the face with a ‘Spede-Heat’ round by a police officer.

According to many innocent victims of this wave of injustice, the police response is not robust enough. They want to know why the police are not protecting them and their property. They pay taxes. They contribute to the common good rather than attempt to destroy it. What’s the point of mayors and governors if they don’t ensure their police protect innocent people and their property when rioters come to town?",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/16/study-up-to-95-percent-of-2020-u-s-riots-are-linked-to-black-lives-matter/,2020-09-16
"Study: To Protect Your Child From Divorce, Send Him To Christian School","Children who attend Christian schools are significantly more likely than peers who attend public schools to marry and stay married as adults, and to refrain from making babies who lack married parents, according to a study published Sept. 16.

“Adults who attended Protestant schools are more than twice as likely to be in an intact marriage as those who attended public schools,” the joint American Enterprise Institute-Institute for Family Studies report says. “They are also about 50% less likely than public-school attendees to have a child out of wedlock.”

“Among those who have ever married, Protestant-school attendees are about 60% less likely than public-school attendees to have ever divorced,” the report continues. Strikingly, the study found that children of poorer parents had significantly better marriage and childbearing outcomes than children of wealthier parents if they attended Christian schools. Children with a financially unstable childhood were more likely to be married and less likely to have a child out of wedlock if they went to a Christian school as compared to a public school.

The opposite is true of children who attend public school, where poor children have significantly worse marriage, childbearing, and academic outcomes than wealthier children do.

“The ideals that students encountered in Protestant schools appear to compensate for a lack of economic resources when it comes to their own marital and child-bearing decisions,” report authors Albert Cheng, Patrick Wolf, Wendy Wang, and W. Bradford Wilcox write.

The study used two nationally representative, commonly used data-sets on 5,006 Americans, the Understanding America Study from the University of Southern California and the Bureau of Labor Statistics’s National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. These surveys follow participants for decades, making it possible to connect their educational experiences with their adult lives.

While the study cannot definitively prove that Christian schools caused their graduates’ better family outcomes later in life, the authors also controlled for demographic differences including race, ethnicity, parental education, age, and sex, and found the same positive patterns persisted. That’s an indicator of not just correlation, but also causation. When controlled for these factors, the study found, for example, “young adults who attended Protestant schools are about 70% more likely than their peers who attended public schools to be in an intact marriage.”

When controlling for such background factors “where all private schools are combined,” the authors write, “we see that young adults who attended public schools are about 30% more likely to divorce than those who attended private schools (p=0.04). Both young adults who attended Catholic schools and those who attended Protestant schools are significantly less likely than public-school attendees to have ever had a non-marital birth.”

Numerous studies have demonstrated the superiority of private and Christian schools over public schools for many societally beneficial outcomes, such as lower rates of crime, higher rates of educational achievement, increased patriotism, more volunteering, higher racial integration, and a higher tolerance for religious and political differences. Research has also established that attending a Christian school makes a child significantly more likely to remain in the faith as an adult. This new study suggests part of the reason for such outcomes is that every school teaches certain morality and habits, and Christian values are better for society than secular values.

“All schools do their part to put kids on one kind of civic and family path or another, insofar as they constitute moral communities, whether they intend to do so or not,” the AEI-IFS study notes, citing research to this effect. “They inculcate students to abide by specific values, norms, practices, and habits as well as situate them within specific peer influences and social networks.”

The study includes survey data from students at Protestant, Catholic, public secular, and private secular schools about the social norms in each type of school. Students in private schools were far less likely to say their peers engaged in premarital sex and illegal drug use, and far more likely to say most of their peers planned to attend college. Students in religious schools were far more likely to say their peers went to church regularly. As Judith Rich convinced much of the social science world with “The Nature Assumption,” peers and social environment strongly influence children’s norms, thinking, and character into adult life, possibly even more than parents do.

“Schools are embedded in a larger web of factors that fundamentally shape students. No aspect of the students’ lives — including their views of marriage, sexuality, and family — are untouched,” the AEI-IFS authors write.

“The results detailed in this report suggest that boys and girls who attend private schools are more likely to avoid a nonmarital birth and to get and stay married,” the authors conclude. “This pattern is especially pronounced among Protestant-school attendees, which suggests that these schools are more likely to foster a kind of ‘Protestant Family Ethic’ among their students. This is an ethic that seems especially conducive to strong and stable families.”

The norms, values, and habits of Christian schools are superior to those of public schools, in terms of supporting marriage and other key elements conducive to the common good. Centuries of social science and informed observation have shown marriage is crucial to a well-ordered society, and the lack of it means more crime, dependency, and despair.

The United States is a ground zero of an explosion in broken families, which strain our social safety nets and inflict deep misery on children and adults. We know of extremely few ways to effectively address the problem on a large scale. Social welfare initiatives in fact have a track record of highly expensive failure.

This study is one of many that suggest giving families the power to take their children’s public education dollars to a private school would be one of the few things elected officials could do that would actually help alleviate the familial primal wounds that affect so many Americans. At this point, the evidence is so robust as to suggest helping families access religious schooling is a moral imperative. Regardless of whether government officials do the right thing, families, churches, and charitable institutions have a moral duty to make support for religious education a top priority.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/18/new-study-suggests-to-protect-your-child-from-divorce-send-him-to-a-christian-school/,2020-09-18
Riots Erupt In Denver Over Grand Jury Verdict In Breonna Taylor’s Case,"DENVER — Riots erupted in Denver Wednesday night over the afternoon grand jury verdict in 26-year-old Breonna Taylor’s case because jurors thought the evidence merited bringing Officer Brett Hankison to trial on first-degree “wanton endangerment.”

Rioters were demanding murder charges for officers who shot Taylor while executing a no-knock drug raid on her home. During the raid, according to grand jury testimony, a male inhabitant standing next to her shot police after they announced themselves, got no response, and then opened the door, upon which officers returned fire, hitting Taylor.

Hundreds flocked to the Colorado Capitol building in the early evening to hear speeches. They proceeded to take over the street on the west end of the capital grounds, chanting “Breonna Taylor.”

Things quickly escalated after 9 p.m., when most of the protestors went home, while a slimmer but sizable crowd of about 100 stayed behind and still demanded control of the streets. Moments later, one man drove his car down the block protestors were occupying. They surrounded the car and ordered the individual to turn around.

After several minutes of tense back-and-forth, the driver gave up and plowed through the unrelenting crowd anyway.

Demonstrators then began a march to the Denver police about three blocks west of the capitol building where protestors harassed police through the gates and re-positioned dumpsters to serve as protective barriers.

“I need that, I need that for things,” said a man who can be heard in the background who worked in the building next-door where the dumpster was taken.

Several other major cities across the nation suffered a repeat outbreak of civil unrest in the aftermath of Taylor’s verdict, including Louisville, where the March shooting occurred. The Louisville Police Department reported that two of its officers had been shot amid the anarchic chaos.

Interim Louisville Chief of Police Robert Schroeder told reporters both officers are “stable.”

How Civil Disobedience Curbed The Mich. Governor’s Abuses Of Power,"The news broke late on Oct. 2 that the Michigan Supreme Court had invalidated Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s authority to issue executive orders related to Covid-19 after April 30. This was a victory for the rule of law, for the separation of powers, and for the liberties of the American people (okay, maybe just the people of Michigan).

Whitmer had declared a state of emergency on March 10 and extended it through a series of executive orders, on April 1, on April 30, and afterward. She claimed authority for these actions under the Michigan Constitution and two specific laws: the Emergency Powers of the Governor Act of 1945 and the Emergency Management Act of 1976.

The problem for Whitmer was that the 1976 law required the state legislature’s approval to extend a state of emergency beyond 28 days, which Republicans in the legislature refused to do. Whitmer’s response? Reinterpret the older law to give herself the power to extend the state of emergency unilaterally.

The draconian lockdowns she imposed on Michigan led to protests that attracted national attention in May. Some protesters were armed. These protests were peaceful. But the national media and Democrats in Michigan criticized the protestors as violent right-wing extremists.

The protests drew criticism because the protestors went mask-less and failed to observe social distancing. How selfish of them, and didn’t they care about grandma’s health?

Some critics went further and made religious arguments against the protests, asserting that Romans 13 requires Christians to respect and obey the governing authorities. On this interpretation, the Christians who protested Whitmer’s lockdown orders were actually disobeying God.

The critics were wrong, as the Michigan Court decision shows, but their mistake was more fundamental: Is the application of Romans 13 as straightforward in a republic as it was in the Roman Empire?

The Romans 13 argument for unlimited submission to civil magistrates runs into two chief difficulties. First, American constitutionalism sets limits on the authority of our civil magistrates. Second, the separation of powers and federalism creates situations in which magistrates will disagree, and well-intentioned Christians may rightly choose to obey one rather than the other. The decision of the Michigan Supreme Court illustrates the reality of both difficulties.

Romans 13 Doesn’t Demand Unlimited Submission

In the Apostle Paul’s epistle to the Romans, Chapter 13, he writes: “Let every soul be subject under the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever, therefore, resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.”

The literalist application of this text requires total obedience to the ruling authorities. This was how American loyalists read the text in the 1760s and 1770s. For them, the obvious duty of the Christian was obedience to the British government, and any effort towards revolution was disobedience.

But this woodenly literalistic interpretation runs into immediate difficulties: Does the Christian have a moral duty to submit to the magistrate under every circumstance? Does faithful Christian living require Christians to surrender their right to self-defense and to permit the agents of the government to kill them, even arbitrarily? This line of reasoning would justify any number of heinous acts, from Joseph Stalin’s purges (he was the governing magistrate, after all) to any murder committed by agents of the state.

The American theory of government recognizes this problem. Indeed, the patriots of 1775 and 1776 understood the challenge and met it. Their answer was clear. In a constitutional republic (or in 1775, a constitutional monarchy), the constitution is the highest law. The citizen’s duty is to obey all constitutional and legal orders.

Given the imperatives of Romans 13 and parallel biblical texts, Christians should be foremost in their obedience to the legal and constitutional commands of their government. But those very laws and constitutions exist to place clear limits on the powers of the government, and when the governors exceed their constitutional or legal authority, the citizens have no duty to obey them.

This was part of the American political order from the beginning, and this was what Calvin Coolidge meant as governor of Massachusetts when he explained that “Opinions and instructions do not outmatch the Constitution. Against it they are void. . . . Instructions are not given unless given constitutionally. Instructions are not carried out unless carried out constitutionally. There can be no constitutional instruction to do an unconstitutional act.”

In a constitutional republic, the Christian has a moral duty to obey all constitutional and legal commands. The Christian has no moral obligation to obey unconstitutional or illegal orders.

Which Magistrate Commands Obedience?

Another obstacle to the literalistic application of Romans 13 in America is the division of political authority. Well-intentioned Christians may call for their fellow believers to obey the civil magistrate, but they often evade the question of which magistrate to obey. A system of government that separates political power between three co-equal branches creates a confusing number of civil magistrates, each with legal authority that commands the obedience of the citizen.

In the case of Michigan, should the citizens of that state have obeyed the orders of their governor? Or should they have listened to the leadership of the state legislature? Michigan’s Constitution of 1963 gives pride of place to the legislative branch, just as the U.S. Constitution does. Don’t the people of a state owe greater allegiance to their representatives?

Or consider the problem of federalism: what happens when the president supports protests against lockdown orders? Faced with contradictory commands from equally legitimate magistrates, citizens must obey the Constitution as they understand it. Appeals to Romans 13 offer no guidance in such a case.

Court decisions, too, command the respect and obedience of the people. Now that the Michigan Supreme Court has spoken on the meaning of the 1945 and 1976 emergency powers laws, the people of Michigan know with some finality that their governor acted without legal authority in extending Michigan’s lockdown beyond April 30.

Civil Disobedience Can Be Obedience to a Higher Law

This Michigan drama demonstrates that American citizens must be willing to stand up for their rights. Courts cannot simply hand down decisions of their own accord. Michigan courts needed private citizens and businesses to challenge Whitmer’s orders before they could act. Citizens had to go first.

Some did so by offering free hair-cuts on the sidewalks of Lansing. Others pushed back by simply refusing to close their shops. These acts of defiance took courage, and they demonstrated that republicanism requires a spirited body of citizens who know their rights and are willing to defend them.

The real lesson of the Michigan high court’s decision is that it validates the behavior of Michiganders who have protested Whitmer’s actions since April 30. They were fighting for the Constitution and their constitutional rights.

They exercised the right to protest to oppose an illegal usurpation of powers by their governor. They followed the lead of the state legislature, deferred to the courts throughout the summer, and have at last found vindication in the state’s highest court. The protestors fought to preserve their republican form of government against paternalism and petty authoritarianism, exactly as all citizens in a free republic should.

No Arrests Made After Violent Antifa Attack Hospitalizes Pro-Free Speech Demonstrators In San Fransisco,"A pro-free speech, pro-Trump, and pro-police demonstration turned violent at United Nations Plaza in San Francisco over the weekend when a group of several hundred so-called anti-fascists began attacking and throwing projectiles at protestors and police. Despite multiple attacks caught on camera, no arrests were made.

The protest, organized by “Team Save America” and Philip Anderson, was intended to “protest Twitter which it said squelches conservative speech.” Those who attended the protest in the name of free speech also expressed support for President Donald Trump and the police by wearing “Make America Great Again” hats and waving “Thin Blue Line” and U.S. flags.

The protest began peacefully, but as Anderson mounted the stage to begin his speech, anti-fascists dressed in black “surged the area, outnumbering and attacking those gathered,” according to the Associated Press. They also began throwing plastic and glass bottles at the pro-police Trump supporters.

Among those injured was Anderson, who suffered a knocked-out tooth from Antifa who attacked him “for no reason,” a Trump supporter, and at least three San Francisco police officers who were assaulted and injured with pepper spray and caustic chemicals. Multiple people were taken to the hospital.

During the attack on Anderson, people can be heard screaming “pray about it” and yelling racial expletives as he walks away holding his mouth.

https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2209454595864588

According to the Associated Press, Anderson said he “called the counterprotesters hypocrites and said they are the reason why he’s voting for President Donald Trump.”

“I love America, I love this country, and I love free speech,” he said.

The San Francisco Police Department’s response to these attacks looked drastically different compared to Phoenix law enforcement responding to a similar protest Saturday. AZ Central reports that nearly every attendee of a protest against police in downtown Phoenix was arrested “after police say the group marched in the road, knocked barricades into the road, and threw smoke bombs at officers.”

Eighteen people were arrested and were facing charges “including aggravated assault on an officer, riot, criminal damage, unlawful assembly, hindering prosecution, resisting arrest, and obstructing a road.”

The riot was first announced on social media, but only 30 minutes after it began, it was declared an unlawful assembly as protestors threw devices emitting smoke at officers.

“Phoenix PD underestimates the power of the people. March with us to occupy Washington Street and remind PD who they serve. We will not stay silent. Until we get justice, Phoenix will have no peace,” the digital flyers advertising the event stated.

Phoenix Police Department spokesperson Sgt. Ann Justus said that it was “due to the ongoing criminal activity and assault, the Phoenix Police deployed less-lethal munitions in order to safely make arrests.”

Former Bears QB Jim McMahon Calls NFL Players Kneeling 'Ridiculous',"Former Chicago Bears legendary quarterback Jim McMahon denounced the National Football League’s “take a knee” protest Wednesday as disrespectful.

“I don’t think they should be disrespecting the flag or the national anthem,” the two-time Super Bowl champion told Jon Zaghloul of Sports Talk Chicago/WCKG. “There’s so many different platforms if people want to protest whatever they’re protesting.”

EXCLUSIVE for @WCKGChicago: @JimMcMahon criticizes the national anthem protests in the #NFL. “I don’t think they should be disrespecting the flag. I’m sure I’ll catch a lot of grief for this on social media, but I don’t care.” #DaBears #BLM #Bears 🎙https://t.co/aEEvJKqh6b pic.twitter.com/RJjs5p0rD3 — Jon Zaghloul (@JonZSports) October 20, 2020

McMahon’s former team continued the NFL racial justice crusade during the national anthem before their game Sunday against the Panthers. While fans stood, removed their hats, and placed their hands over their hearts for the national anthem, Bears players kneeled while linking arms or stood with their fists raised. Another roughly 20 Bears players actually stayed in the tunnel during the anthem, including Eddie Jackson, Khalil Mack and Allen Robinson.

This season, it appears racial justice is the name of the game for the entire NFL ever since Colin Kaepernick’s “take a knee” protest has become politically fashionable during the Black Lives Matter movement.

Even NFL commissioner Roger Goodell dramatically shifted the NFL’s stance on protesting the anthem.

In 2016, Goodell said, “I think it’s important to have respect for our country, for our flag, for the people who make our country better; for law enforcement, and for our military who are out fighting for our freedoms and our ideals.”

In a June video from the league’s Twitter feed, Goodell stated, “We, the National Football League, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all players to speak out and peacefully protest. We, the National Football League, believe that black lives matter.”

We, the NFL, condemn racism and the systematic oppression of Black People. We, the NFL, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest. We, the NFL, believe Black Lives Matter. #InspireChange pic.twitter.com/ENWQP8A0sv — NFL (@NFL) June 5, 2020

“I think Goodell is doing a disservice to the league … he’s destroying the brand,” said McMahon. “What they’re doing I think is ridiculous,” and “there’s not a whole lot of fans right now with what’s going on.”

McMahon is right. Since the NFL declared war on patriotism, their ratings have tanked. At this year’s season opener — one of the few games to include fans in the stadium — between the reigning Super Bowl champs, the Kansas City Chiefs, and the Houston Texans, the Texans remained in the locker room during the national anthem. When the team emerged from the tunnel fans booed them. The booing continued as the two teams interlocked arms from one end zone to the other during what was supposed to be a “moment of silence.”

The Federalist reported that a September survey found there has been a “30 percent decline from American views on the sports industry a year ago, when the corporate sports enjoyed a net positive 20 percent rating, with 45 percent of Americans reporting a favorable opinion compared to 25 percent who said otherwise.”

When asked if he was concerned about any blow back he’ll receive for his comments, McMahon said no. “I’m sure I’ll catch a lot of grief over the social media, but I don’t care.”

“I’ve never been on Facebook or Twitter or whatever that crap is,” he added.

McMahon is pretty brave considering almost every player who criticizes the “take a knee” protest has been browbeaten into apologizing.

In June, NFL star quarterback Drew Brees backtracked after saying in an interview, “I will never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States of America or our country.” Brees explained that his family’s military history heavily contributes to his feelings about the subject. After the Twitter mob viciously attacked him, Brees issued a lengthy apology calling his own comments “insensitive.”

McMahon said it was “ridiculous” Brees had “to apologize to teammates for his thoughts or for his opinions he said for people that served in the military.”

McMahon also linked his personal respect for the flag and anthem to his admiration for members of the U.S military. “This is one percent of our country that protects the 99 percent, and this is why we have the freedoms that we do.”

"AP: Leftist Rioters Are Not Just Antifa, They're Normal Suburban Kids","“[M]ost arrested in protests aren’t leftist radicals,” headlined an Associated Press analysis published Oct. 20. Of those arrested this summer during the nation’s largest outbreak of riots in 30 years, “Very few of those charged appear to be affiliated with highly organized extremist groups, and many are young suburban adults from the very neighborhoods Trump vows to protect from the violence in his reelection push to win support from the suburbs,” the article’s second paragraph says.

They've been portrayed by the president as violent left-wing radicals and used to scare suburban voters. But an @AP review found most of those arrested in U.S. protests look like regular citizens caught up in the moment — many are young suburban adults. https://t.co/TP3LyuFLme — The Associated Press (@AP) October 20, 2020

These nice young people throwing Molotov cocktails and setting police cars on fire are basically the kids next door, the article implies. It is clear from the article’s framing the AP intends it to be another entry into the “move along, nothing to see here” genre employed against facts that make the left look bad and are impossible to ignore. In reality, however, the article makes things look even worse than the reality it is meant to counter.

The AP doesn’t show or explain how it came to the conclusion that most of the 286 people being federally prosecuted for crimes in connection with this summer’s Black Lives Matter riots are the young, suburban, “not leftist radicals” its article claims. If this is true, however, it suggests violence has become uncomfortably normalized among those who identify on the political left.

If the AP characterization is accurate, tolerance for violence in the service of political ends is not just concentrated in fringe outliers like Antifa cells. It is attracting middle-class people who grew up in comfortable suburbia. People whose parents are aware that their children are politically intoxicated to the point of arson and still bail them out of jail and hire them lawyers. This is not comforting at all.

What We Can Learn from This Article about Rioters

The article does give information about age, race, and sex. A plurality of those charged with federal crimes in connection with summer riot violence are white; most are men, and seven in 10 are under 30: “More than 40% of those facing federal charges are white. At least a third are Black, and about 6% Hispanic. More than two-thirds are under the age of 30 and most are men. More than a quarter have been charged with arson, which if convicted means a five-year minimum prison sentence.”

It also includes a graph counting up all the federal charges these 286 people are facing. The most common are arson (one-third of those charged), illegal possession of a firearm (one-sixth of those charged), and civil unrest/rioting (one-tenth of those charged).

The AP article gives two examples of young men we are apparently meant to take as representative of these rioters. Both are in their early 20s, male, leftist, with no previous criminal records, and living with their parents.

“Brian Bartels, a 20-year-old suburban Pittsburgh man who is described by prosecutors as a ‘self-identified left-wing anarchist,’ was flanked by his parents when he turned himself in to authorities,” says the AP article. “Bartels, who lives at his parents’ house, spray painted an ‘A’ on a police cruiser before jumping on top of it and smashing its windshield during a protest in the city, prosecutors said. He pleaded guilty in September.” The other such young man was “caught on camera making a Molotov cocktail.”

The article is rife with the “both sides have bad people” frame the corporate press goes nuts about after falsely characterizing its use by President Trump. For example: “Some of those facing charges undoubtedly share far-left and anti-government views. Far-right protesters also have been arrested and charged.”

Far later, the article runs down the six cases out of these 300 that could be attributed to “far-right protesters.” Six. For those who can’t do basic math, that’s 2 percent of the total. Again, in attempting to debunk something President Trump and conservatives are saying, the article reinforces it.

Article Provides No Evidence for Its Own Headline

The article also contains nearly no evidence for its headline claim, that “most arrested aren’t leftist radicals.” Instead, it says the AP reporters were unable to find evidence in court documents that the majority of the 286 people whose cases they reviewed are part of Antifa or formally affiliated with similarly “radical” groups.

The AP reporters may have scoured the social media accounts of every person in this group to try to discern their political leanings. But the article does not say they’ve done so. It says the reporters looked at “thousands of pages of court documents.” In those documents, “the only apparent mention of antifa is in a Boston case.”

Of these 286, which may not be representative of all summer rioters as most are being charged under state, not federal laws, “many have had no previous run-ins with the law and no apparent ties to antifa, the umbrella term for leftist militant groups that Trump has said he wants to declare a terrorist organization,” the article also says.

“While some of the defendants clearly hold radical or anti-government beliefs,” the article says elsewhere, “prosecutors have provided little evidence of any affiliations they have with organized extremist groups.” Besides a handful of mentions of individuals’ social media, this is the total of the evidence provided to bolster the headline claim that most BLM rioters are not leftists.

Notice also all of the qualifications to get to that conclusion: these had to be federal cases, the prosecutors had to have explicitly noted the political affiliation of the person charged in court documents, and that affiliation had to be with an “organized extremist group.” Not with the Democratic Party, not with MoveOn.org, not with some political campaign or club. An “organized extremist group,” whatever that is. Technically, according to their frame, such an extremist group couldn’t even be Antifa, because as the article notes, FBI Director Christopher Wray claims Antifa “is more of an ideology or a movement than an organization.”

The evidence presented suggests these reporters searched the court documents for the term “Antifa,” found it once, and therefore concluded that they had proved none of the people arrested would consider themselves on the political left. That’s like saying because I looked in your car for a book and didn’t find one, you probably don’t know how to read.

There is no formal membership card for the “Leftist Radical Club.” Therefore, according to the AP’s apparent logic, nobody is a leftist radical. Apply that logic to Antifa, and you end up with Wray’s conclusion that it’s not an organization at all, it’s just an ideology.

We All Know BLM Is Linked with These Riots

The AP’s supposed conclusion also contradicts facts we do know about the riots, which is that they have been explicitly and openly connected with self-described Marxist organizing groups, most obviously the Black Lives Matter organization. Another report that twisted itself to try to hide the connections between BLM and rioting still showed that 95 percent of the summer riots were linked to BLM.

One in ten of these protests involved violence, according to the data collected — an astronomical number. Far, far fewer than one-tenth of U.S. mosques, let alone Muslims themselves, are connected to Islamist terrorists. If the 2010s Tea Party protests had been as violent as the BLM protests, the Obama administration could have labeled the Tea Party a domestic terror group.

People at all of these protests carry signs emblazoned with leftist politics. Anyone just passing through anyone could easily see that. BLM signs at every one accompanied a host of other politically left demands, such as ending “housing discrimination,” defunding the police, and demanding reparations. This an explicitly leftist movement. Who are you going to believe, the Associated Press or your own eyes?

Covering for Extremists Is Bad for the Country

We have other indications that extremism is moving to the center among America’s political left. For one, Joe Biden let the openly self-proclaimed socialists Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez write his policy platform.

Pertinently and recently, 200 leftist elites war-gamed the election and released a report explicitly rejecting the possibility of a legitimate Trump win and winking at violence to impose such a perception on Americans: “this may well be a street fight, not a legal battle; technocratic solutions, courts, and a reliance on elites observing norms are not the answer here.”

And no less an elite Democrat than Hillary Clinton “declared publicly that Joe Biden should not concede the election “under any circumstances.” “Any circumstances” includes “Trump legitimately winning.” The ground troops have heard these calls for unrest and are preparing to attack members of Congress and businesses like Amazon should Trump declare victory under any circumstances.

America is not served by a berserked left. Not only is it morally wrong to kill, steal, and destroy to get what you want, when one party’s platform is not fit to govern a garden club, let alone the greatest nation in the world, it erases all pressure on the other party to excel. All they have to be is not physically attacking bystanders or endorsing unfettered unborn genocide, and they win. Any dummy can do that, and lots of dummies are doing that. As a result, the nation’s business has long been left undone.

If Democrats don’t want Trump to be president, rather than scaring the stuffing out of the people who vote for him, they need to present a rational alternative. Violence is not a rational alternative. And I shouldn’t need to say that.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/23/ap-leftist-rioters-are-not-just-antifa-wackos-theyre-normal-suburban-kids/,2020-10-23
Alex Jones Swoops Into Arizona Election Protest With Cameras On Blast,"PHOENIX, Ariz. — Controversial radio host Alex Jones made a surprise appearance Thursday night at a protest in Arizona outside the Phoenix-area Maricopa County election center.

Jones emerged on site Thursday night with all the flare of a Hollywood celebrity. As the radio personality marked a dramatic entrance to the municipal parking lot screaming “1776” into a megaphone, the crowd of Trump supporters surrounded Jones and followed with every step.

“The globalists thought they could defeat our country! They’ve only awakened the sleeping giant!” Jones shouted into a microphone at the center of a huddle.

At the protest demanding greater transparency in the ballot-counting process, Jones then began directing his ire towards the typical targets of the host’s online fire.

“Burn in hell, Bill Gates! Burn in hell, Fauci! America is awake and we are never backing down!” Jones screamed. “America is awake!”

Throughout the brief appearance, Jones led chants of “USA,” “Biden for prison,” and “1776,” comparing the current moment to the fight for American independence nearly 250 years ago.

This moment, Alex Jones tells Trump supporters in Arizona, is “as important as 1776, July 4” pic.twitter.com/26pSbv2FWQ — Tristan Justice (@JusticeTristan) November 6, 2020

“America is fighting for its life,” Jones said standing on top the back of a pick-up truck. “The moment we’re in is as important as 1776, July 4th!”

Jones made a few substantive points during the half-hour visit, such as complaining about the outsized role of big tech dictating the 21st century public square to influence elections.

“Big tech had tried to steal the election, but America knows what happened and is fighting back!” Jones said. Facebook and Twitter indeed suppressed bombshell revelations in October implicating Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in his son’s potentially criminal overseas business activity while amplifying every anonymously sourced claim against President Donald Trump to surface from corporate media.

On the other hand, Jones also called for executives of Google, Facebook, and Twitter to be in prison. When asked on the sidelines what big tech censorship might look like under a Biden administration, Jones said “it’ll be totally worse.”

“China is the model,” Jones added.

While railing against China to an angry crowd on the back of the pickup, several counter-protestors showed up with signs behind him, prompting Jones to turn around and condemn the liberal agitators as “corrupt globalists.”

Jones was gone by 9 p.m., and the protestors went back to moments of group prayer and grievance, airing frustrations about the ballot process that bipartisan officials in the state have concluded are a result of voter confusion over inconsistencies in precinct policies.

Many voters reported that local election officials made individuals vote with Sharpie markers that bled through ballots, invalidating them. The claims, which spread rapidly on social media, were dismissed by local election officials and investigated by the state’s Republican attorney general, who determined that what became known as “Sharpiegate” “did not result in disenfranchisement for Arizona voters.”

Based on correspondence and conversations with Maricopa County officials, we are now confident that the use of Sharpie markers did not result in disenfranchisement for Arizona voters. We appreciate the county’s prompt insight and assurances to address public concerns. pic.twitter.com/NdYLsEAvwd — Mark Brnovich (@GeneralBrnovich) November 6, 2020

An equally pressing issue for the Republican protestors Thursday night were demands that Fox News and the Associated Press retract their projections in Arizona for Biden, whose lead has collapsed since each outlet made their calls earlier this week. As of this writing, Biden leads by less than 50,000 votes with thousands more remaining to be counted, many of which come from rural areas favorable to the president.

Trump Supporters Plan To March On Washington In Protest Of Election Fraud,"Look forward to seeing you all this Saturday, November 14th,

Several groups known as Women for Trump, Million MAGA March, and Stop the Steal DC are planning organized gatherings near the White House and down the National Mall.

One week after crowded gatherings outside of the White House following the mainstream media’s projection of former Vice President Joe Biden’s presidential victory, multiple pro-Trump organizations are scheduled to hold protests, caravans, and marches in the nation’s capital city on Saturday to support President Donald Trump and protest election fraud.

A counter-protest held by an organization called Refuse Fascism is scheduled to begin just 30 minutes before most of the pro-Trump events.

Roads will begin to close down starting Thursday evening in anticipation of the flood of people.

Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said that the city is gearing up for the series of anticipated protests and that police will be on the ground ready to take action if there are clashes.

“We continue to follow those activities and be prepared for those activities,” Bowser said at a press conference on Tuesday. “Our police chief will have a similar posture this weekend as he did last week and we will be there to support peaceful exercise of First Amendment demonstrations.”

Last weekend, hundreds of people took to the D.C. streets and Black Lives Matter Plaza to celebrate the media’s projections of Biden’s presidential victory. Many of the people in the crowd were yelling, dancing, taking pictures, and popping champagne to commemorate Trump’s defeat, ignoring the social distancing and COVID-19 guidelines about mass gatherings.

How America’s Adams Family Inherited And Preserved The Pilgrim Mind,"The following essay is part of The Federalist’s 1620 Project, a symposium exploring the connections and contributions of the early Pilgrim and Puritan settlers in New England to the uniquely American synthesis of faith, family, freedom, and self-government.

In his account of the 1620 voyage of the Mayflower, William Bradford wrote that “they knew they were pilgrimes, & looked not much on these things; but lift up their eyes to ye heavens, their dearest cuntrie.” This Augustinian distinction between the earthly and heavenly city — the profoundly Judeo-Christian sense of being strangers, wayfarers, pilgrims, exiles from the heavenly city of Jerusalem — is a haunting inheritance of American culture.

The Pilgrims are distinguished from the larger Puritan movement by their anti-Erastianism — they rejected Thomas Erastus’s insistence that the state is superior to the church. Against both Cavaliers and Roundheads — the High Church Episcopalians wanting the authority of the king’s appointed bishops or the congregationalist churches which accepted the Cromwellian Parliament’s control over ecclesiastical matters — Pilgrims insisted on the liberty of the church.

One hears this Pilgrim inheritance in the haunting song that Cecil Spring Rice wrote on seeing the funeral monument Henry Adams built for his wife, a figure in the pose of thoughtful reflection on immortality:

I vow to thee, my country all earthly things above,

Entire and whole and perfect, the service of my love.

And there’s another country, I’ve heard of long ago,

Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know;

We may not count her armies, we may not see her King;

Her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering;

And soul by soul and silently her shining bounds increase,

And her ways are ways of gentleness, and all her paths are peace.

The Adams family were heirs of this Pilgrim distinction between the duties rendered to Caesar and the duties rendered to God.

We often think of the American Founding in terms of the “Virginia Dynasty” — Jefferson, Madison, Monroe — a series of slaveholding southerners who helped to transform the new republican nation into a democratic continental empire. But there is another “American Dynasty” more representative of a deep strain of Christian conservatism that preserved the American revolution from the political utopianism of the French Revolution of 1789 and the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.

The idea that the eighteenth century is an indiscriminate “Age of Revolutions” — that one can lump 1688, 1776, 1789 and all the successor revolutions in Latin America and across Europe until one meets up with the 1848 year of revolutions that inspired Karl Marx’s “Communist Manifesto” — is a massive interpretive swindle on the American public.

In truth, “America’s First Dynasty,” the Adams family, stood athwart this interpretation of the American Founding since the beginning: Americans were first and foremost Pilgrims at heart, deeply imbued with a Lutheran conviction of the total depravity of man and the impossibility of building here any heavenly city. The Christian sense of sin — “a stain inherited from my greatest-grandmother’s birth,” as Henry Adams put it — constantly restrained the modern impulse to “immanentize the eschaton.”

As Jean Bethke Elshtain has shown repeatedly in her life’s work, an Augustinian skepticism about the City of Man ever achieving perfection runs throughout American culture and politics. Christian political realism has been challenged repeatedly by Unitarianism, Romantic Transcendentalism, and Progressivism, but it remains a powerful strain in American life that cannot be overlooked.

The heritage of the Mayflower was particularly strong in John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Charles Francis Adams, and Henry Adams who, across four generations, spans the first century of American history. As Henry Adams, great-grandson of the patriot founder, wrote in retrospect in “The Education of Henry Adams:”

The atmosphere of education in which he lived was colonial, revolutionary, almost Cromwellian, as though he were steeped, from his greatest grandmother’s birth, in the odor of political crime. Resistance to something was the law of New England nature; the boy looked out on the world with the instinct of resistance; for numberless generations, his predecessors had viewed the world chiefly as a thing to be reformed, filled with evil forces to be abolished, and they saw no reason to suppose that they had wholly succeeded in the abolition.

“The law of New England nature” in which he was “steeped from his greatest grandmother’s birth” was “the instinct of resistance to something,” “for numberless generations his predecessors had viewed the world chiefly as a thing … filled with evil forces to be abolished.” Russell Kirk took this “Adams Dynasty” to be the backbone of “The Conservative Mind“ in America, contributing in each generation a break on political utopianism.

John Adams Against The World

“My opinion is, and always has been, that absolute power intoxicates alike despots, monarchs, aristocrats, and democrats, and Jacobins, and sans-culottes,” wrote John Adams. David McCullough’s biography and HBO mini-series softens and makes amiable John and Abigail in a way that does them a disservice. In truth, Adamses all have a tendency to become angry blogger dudes in their old age, full of sharp intelligence and bitterness.

John Adams is not often read because his works are interminable Jeremiads (like the recent letters of Archbishop Vigano). Adams’s “Defence of the Constitutions” uses all ancient and modern republican constitutions as considered by all ancient and modern philosophers and historians (its “Table of Contents” is alone formidable) to refute repeatedly and ad nauseam every argument of Turgot and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who favor a simple, straight-forward, democratic absolutism.

His “Discourses on Davila“ is a similarly long and detailed diatribe against the Marquis de Condorcet’s confidence in humanity’s natural benevolence, which can allow us to divest ourselves of constitutional restraints, checks, balances, and separation of powers. His series of letters to Thomas Jefferson over the course of their retirement counter Jefferson’s enlightenment trust in democratic processes with the need for the conservation of a culture, a “we the people” prior to the political regime, of piety and virtue:

We have no Government armed with Power capable of contending with human Passions unbridled by morality and Religion. Avarice, Ambition, Revenge or Gallantry, would break the strongest Cords of our Constitution as a Whale goes through a Net [Here’s lookin’ at you, Moby Dick!]. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious People. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.

Adams, like George Washington, believed that no polity could eradicate the sinfulness of man, so any man who disparaged the place of morality and religion in public life was a traitor.

John Adams and Jefferson dueled for decades over whether a Christian anthropology or a French Enlightenment anthropology underlay the American regime. It was a fight to the death over who would control history’s judgment on the American Founding, a replay of the great presidential election of 1800. Adams wrote monthly; Jefferson responded at leisure — annually. In the end, it was a question of who would outlive whom.

Jefferson passed away in the morning of the Fourth of July, 1826 at Monticello — 50 years to the day from the promulgation of the Declaration of Independence. Adams died the same day, in the evening, whispering “Jefferson still lives,” not knowing that he had survived his intellectual and political adversary by hours.

In reality, Adams survived Jefferson by decades, in his son, his grandson, and his great-grandson. Only in 1947, would the Supreme Court’s Everson decision resurrect Jefferson’s idea of a “wall of separation” between church and state, just as Kirk made his great attempt to recover the Adams family tradition for American conservatives in his 1953 classic.

John Adams reaches his rhetorical climax when objecting to the idea that man is a mere materialistic clash of atoms — Lego blocks to be worked and reworked according to the purposes of the collective need (transgenderism, transhumanism) — with no form, soul, or nature to which the polity must conform itself:

Is there a possibility that the government of nations may fall into the hands of men who teach the most disconsolate of all creeds, that men are but fireflies, and that all this is without a father? … Is this the way to make man, as man, an object of respect? Or, is it to make murder itself as indifferent as shooting a plover, and the extermination of the Rohilla nation as innocent as the swallowing of mites on a morsel of cheese? If such a case should happen, would not one of these, the most credulous of all believers, have reason to pray to his eternal nature or his almighty chance … give us again the gods of the Greeks; give us again the more intelligible as well as more comfortable systems of Athanasius and Calvin; nay, give us again our popes and hierarchies, Benedictines and Jesuits, with all their superstition and fanaticism, impostures and tyranny. A certain duchess of venerable years and masculine understanding, said of some of the philosophers of the eighteenth century, admirably well, — ‘On ne croit pas dans le Christianisme, mais on croit toutes les sottises possibles ‘(Having ceased believing in Christianity, they believe in all possible nonsense.)

With a series of piled up rhetorical questions, Adams throws his opponents back, back, back, ending with a “Touché.” “Sot!”

In his objection to the idea of the fluidity and mutability of human nature, John Adams resonates with Czeslaw Milosz a century later, the Polish poet laureate who argues that the ultimate enemy of the Communist regime is not the propertied class, Kulaks, and capitalists, the nations and churches which prevent man from recognizing himself as purely proletariat worker, but “Man, This Enemy” — human nature itself, born anew in every generation, with its desire for truth and freedom, is the ultimate enemy of the totalitarian state.

The absence of any realistic account of human nature leaves the human mind vulnerable to be “captivated” by “ideology” — by histories that purport to tell of the evolution and progress of the human towards some final perfect state within time.

John Quincy Adams Against the World

Seeing how unpopular John Adams’s disdain for absolute democracy made him, John Quincy Adams tried desperately to conform himself to the modern democratic age in order to stay electable: he was the first American president to wear pants. The 18th-century gentleman, who “looked his land” in silk hose and breeches, and considered property essential to being a participating member of the “Publick,” had been put aside in favor of the Jacksonian democrats “pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps.”

The alliance between upstart southwestern planters and the property-less Irish of the booming cities of the north was unstoppable in presidential politics in the 1830s and 1840s. No Boston Brahmin, no patrician WASPs need apply. Working men’s garb, the sans-culottes of the French Revolution became the fashion in the 1830s.

But, at heart, John Quincy could never conform to the sheer voice of the majority: the Democratic Party that captured the nation was in his eyes the “Slave Power” and his old age was poisoned by his one-issue obsession with slavery. His wife, Louisa Catherine Adams, agonized in her diary that his political obsession — his angry blogger dude post-presidential career, the only American president who returned to the House of Representatives after his presidency, and persisted until he dropped on the floor of the House — would destroy their family and bring the country at last to civil war.

Perhaps John Quincy Adams’s most memorable post-presidential performance was his tenacious fight for the liberty of a group of mutinous slaves. In his majestic closing statement in the Amistad case, Quincy appeals to the judges’ “fear of the Lord” rather than their natural benevolence. He reminds them of all the Supreme Court justices who had died and been replaced during the long years during which the Amistad case had been before the courts, and bid them consider, whether at their deaths they too will hear from their Maker the final judgment: “Come, good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of your master.” Vox populi, expressed in either executive fiat or positive law, could not overrule “the laws of Nature and Nature’s God.” “Hic cestus, artemque reponat.”

John Quincy Adams portrays himself as old Entellus from Virgil’s “Aeneid,” an old warrior returned from his deathbed for one final duel, the Ents of Onodrim returned for the defense of Middle Earth. It is a persona, the literary pose of Jeremiah, that the Adamses embodied in every generation.

Charles Francis Adams Against the World

John Quincy Adams’s son is largely unknown, but Charles Francis Adams helped to found the Free Soil party, a third party that eventually helped birth the Republican Party. He acted as Abraham Lincoln’s “man in Havana” — ambassador to Great Britain throughout the American Civil War. Lincoln tasked him with preventing the British from entering the war on the side of the Southern Confederacy, as the cotton mills of northern England fell silent without American cotton.

As his son, Henry Adams wrote, the Adams family watched the Whig hope in political compromise with the Slave Power, watched the progression from Northwest Ordinance to Missouri Compromise, to Great Compromise of 1850, with skepticism. The Adamses, “saw no reason to suppose that they had wholly succeeded in the abolition.”

They were not shocked, surprised, or stunned by the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the Repeal of the Missouri Compromise, the Dred Scott decision, and the ascendancy of the Slave Power in the executive, legislative, and judiciary branches. They had never succumbed to the facile belief that “human nature worked for Good, and three instruments were all she asked — Suffrage, Common Schools, and Press. … Man needed only a correct knowledge of facts to reach perfection.”

Indeed, Charles Francis Adams launched the third-party movement that eventually broke the power of the Democratic city machine that had controlled American politics for three decades.

Henry Adams Against the World

Henry Adams found it impossible to be truly Bostonian — either Unitarian or Transcendentalist. He could not conform himself to Daniel Webster’s Whiggish belief in progress, nor the Hegelian dream of a utopian state of Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott. To him, as to his Puritan forebears, sin was metaphysical, not social. The remedy for sin was supernatural, not political:

The religious instinct had vanished, and could not be revived, although one made in later life many efforts to recover it. That the most powerful emotion of man, next to the sexual, should disappear, might be a personal defect of his own; but that the most intelligent society, led by the most intelligent clergy, in the most moral conditions he ever knew, should have solved all the problems of the universe so thoroughly as to have quite ceased making itself anxious about past or future, and should have persuaded itself that all the problems which had convulsed human thought from earliest recorded time, were not worth discussing, seemed to him the most curious social phenomenon he had to account for in a long life.

The faculty of turning away one’s eyes as one approaches a chasm is not unusual, and Boston showed, under Webster’s lead, how successfully it could be done in politics; but in politics, a certain number of men did at least protest. In religion and philosophy, no one protested.

Such protest as was made took forms more simple than the silence, like the deism of Theodore Parker, and of the boy’s own cousin Octavius Frothingham, who distressed his father and scandalized Beacon Street by avowing skepticism that seemed to solve no old problems, and to raise many new ones. The less aggressive protest of Ralph Waldo Emerson, was, from an old-world point of view, less serious. It was naïf.

The utopianism of either the Whig compromisers in national politics or of the small, local groups like the Oneida community and Concord Farm — variations on the Puritan vision of establishing “a city upon a hill” — did not suit the sharp vision of the ineradicable nature of sin. Such attempts were, in Adams’s judgment, “naive.”

Late in life, Henry Adams turned away from the bizarre dynamism of progressive revolutions creating ever more absolute and invasive governments in pursuit of social perfection. He observed the French 1901 Law of Associations and the 1905 Separation law establishing state secularism. The confiscation of church property in France, challenges to church control of the marriage law, or church preeminence in the field of education all drew comment from Adams.

He was consistently appalled at the naivete of the churches in thinking that they could survive being regulated by the state authorities. “I see, almost without noting it — so universal is the sensation — that the Holy Father is complaining bitterly of the same thing. He has now complained for some five hundred years, but it is queer that I should have caught up with him.”

At last, Henry Adams’s inner Pilgrim rebelled. Like the anti-Erastian John Henry Newman, he turned at last to the medieval devotion to the Virgin, Regina et Mater Ecclesia — a church independent of any national power. He acknowledged that it was the strangest place for an “American of the Americans, with who knows how many Puritans and Patriots in his lineage” to find himself, kneeling in an empty church praying his “mea culpas” after 500 years of protest.

But, he reassured himself, the Adamses were Normans, so it was his Norman ancestors who had built the cathedrals and fought the crusades. Like T. S. Eliot in the quiet chapel at Little Gidding: “In my end is my beginning.”

America’s Pilgrim Inheritance — The Liberty Of The Church

Paradoxically, as the Pilgrims of 1620 fled the control of the king’s authority over the church, many a Catholic and Jew fled the control of the state over the church in the 1920s and 1930s. The Bolshevik regime confiscated church property, sold chalices and chasubles on the black market, and infiltrated seminaries. The Nazis purged schools and churches of teachers and ministers who objected to their national socialist agenda.

Yet the wake of these horrible circumstances saw a new immigration of artists, philosophers, scientists, political thinkers, poets, ministers, and teachers — Jacques and Raissa Maritain, Albert Einstein, Paul Tillich, Martin Buber, Czeslaw Milosz, Aleksander Solzhenitsyn, Eva T. H. Brann, Leo Strauss, Eric Voegelin. They came to American shores in the twentieth century seeking liberty to seek the truth; pilgrims who could never finally conform themselves to the Earthly City.

How Reformed Theologians' Commitment To Self-Rule Shaped America,"The following essay is part of The Federalist’s 1620 Project, a symposium exploring the connections and contributions of the early Pilgrim and Puritan settlers in New England to the uniquely American synthesis of faith, family, freedom, and self-government.

Last year marked the culmination of The New York Times’s controversial 1619 Project. The project rightly brought attention to the importance of the African American story of enslavement and the 400-year struggle for freedom. Yet its original claim that the United States was founded in 1619 rather than 1776 went too far.

Indeed, if one were to select a year from the 17th century, a better year to mark America’s founding would be 1620, the year the Pilgrims consented to the Mayflower Compact and, shortly thereafter, began America’s experiment in self-government. This year marks the 400th anniversary of the signing of this important document.

In a speech commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing at Plymouth, the great orator Daniel Webster lauded these refugees as the authors of American “civil and religious liberty.” A few decades later, Alexis de Tocqueville observed that “Puritanism was not only a religious doctrine, but also at several points it was mingled with the most absolute democratic and republican theories.” He contended that understanding this “point of departure” is “the key to the whole book” of his magisterial “Democracy in America.”

Alas, on the 400th anniversary of the fateful landing, many Americans believe these settlers were dour Christians who, according to Nathaniel Hawthorne, wore “sad-colored garments” or, in the words of the 19th-century English professor Moses Coit Tyler, “cultivated the grim and the ugly.” More recently, H.L. Mencken described them as harboring a “haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy,” and the playwright Arthur Miller said they were “theocrats” who desired to prevent “any kind of disunity.”

In truth, the Pilgrims, and the Puritans who followed them, were not 21st-century liberal democrats, but they created political institutions and practices that profoundly influenced the course of American politics and facilitated later experiments in republican self-government and liberty under law. They valued natural rights, rule by the consent of the governed, and limited government; and they were convinced that citizens have a right, and perhaps even a duty, to resist tyrannical governments. Four hundred years since the signing of the Mayflower Compact, we should honor their contributions to the creation of the American republic.

The Reformation: A Very Brief History

To understand the Puritans, we must briefly consider the Protestant Reformation. This movement may be conveniently dated to 1517, when Martin Luther nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the Wittenberg castle church door. The Puritans came out of the Calvinist (or Reformed) wing of the Reformation. Like other Reformers, John Calvin emphasized doctrines such as sola gratia, sola fide, sola scriptura, and the priesthood of all believers. But concerning politics, he and later Calvinists developed ideas and practices that were innovative, empowering, and conducive to human flourishing.

Reformers rejected the idea that the church and its priests were necessary intermediaries between ordinary people and God, and that the church as an institution possessed the authority to speak for Him. Individuals were told that they were responsible for their relationship with God and that His will for them is most clearly revealed in the Holy Scriptures. These last two beliefs led to an emphasis on literacy and a commitment to translating and printing the Bible in the vernacular.

The significance of the explosion of literacy in Protestant countries cannot be overestimated. In the mid-seventeenth century, literacy rates of Italy and France were 23 percent and 29 percent, respectively. In contrast, scholars estimate that up to 95 percent of males in New England at that time could read. Widespread literacy helped undermine existing hierarchies and paved the way for the growth of republican self-government.

The Reformation had several false starts in England — most notably those led by John Wycliffe and William Tyndale, both famous for translating the Bible into English (a “crime” for which Tyndale was burned at the stake). King Henry VIII was not particularly interested in Protestantism, but he did want to divorce Catherine of Aragon. Because the Pope refused to annul his marriage, he cut ties with Rome in 1534 and created the Church of England. Henry made himself rather than the Pope the head of this new church, but otherwise was largely content to leave it alone.

When Henry’s daughter, Mary, became queen in 1553, she persecuted and killed Protestant leaders, actions that earned her the pejorative nickname “Bloody Mary.” Many Protestants fled England for Calvin’s Geneva, Switzerland. After Mary died in 1558, these “Marian exiles” returned to their homeland with a renewed desire to “purify” the Church of England. In 1564, they were first called “Puritans” by their opponents.

Most English Puritans were content merely to purify the Church of England, but a subset of them saw no biblical precedent for a national church, believing each Christian congregation constituted a church and should govern itself. Because of their desire to separate from any sort of national church, they became known as “Separatists.” To freely practice their faith, a group of them fled to Holland in 1608, and then to America aboard the Mayflower in 1620.

Puritan Political Thought

Before these English Separatists, more commonly known as Pilgrims, disembarked from the Mayflower, they made an agreement that represents an important political innovation. This covenant, known today as the Mayflower Compact, committed the people and their rulers to pursue “the Glory of God, and the Advancement of the Christian Faith, and the Honor of our King and Country.” Its legitimacy stemmed from the consent of the 41 men — most of whom were Separatists — heading households on the ship.

Some scholars have attempted to downplay the importance of the Mayflower Compact by arguing that it was not well known until the 19th century and was not called the “Mayflower Compact” until 1793 — a fact that, while true, remains irrelevant. Verily, the Compact is significant because it represents the commitment many Reformed leaders had to the idea that people must consent to civic and ecclesiastical institutions if they are to be legitimate. The Pilgrims, and the Puritans who followed them, created civil governments that are among the most republican the world had ever seen.

Before the Protestant Reformation, most Christian thinkers contended that either a monarchy or a monarchy checked by a legislative body was the ideal form of government. The Protestant emphasis on literacy, the priesthood of all believers, and, in some cases, congregational ecclesiastical polities, helped to undercut hierarchical forms of government. In the 17th century, Reformed authors began to argue for the first time that the Bible sanctioned only republican governments. They adopted this idea from an unlikely source: commentaries on the Old Testament written by Jewish rabbis.

Reformers believed that ministers and scholars should read the Holy Scriptures in their original languages, which led many of them to learn Hebrew. Moreover, as Eric Nelson explains in his wonderful book “The Hebrew Republic”:

… to understand the Hebrew Bible, they insisted, one should consult the full array of rabbinic sources that were now available to the Christian West. One should turn to the Talmud and midrash, to the targums and medieval law codes.

In these texts, Protestant Reformers discovered a set of ideas that scholars now refer to as “political Hebraism.”

The most important political idea that Reformed thinkers drew from rabbinical commentaries was that republics were the only form of government approved by the Bible. From these works, they learned to interpret passages such as 1 Samuel 8 as condemning the Jewish people’s desire for a king, not their desire for a ruler other than God. By the mid-17th century, many Reformed leaders had come to embrace these views in theory, and civic leaders in New England could put these ideas into action as early as 1620.

Yet while the Mayflower Compact reflects aspects of Hebraic republicanism, it is far from unique. In the 1630s, waves of non-Separatist Puritans came to New England, where they created hundreds of ecclesiastical and civil covenants whereby people joined together for various purposes, all of which were ultimately aimed at glorifying God. Each of these covenants reinforced the idea that governments are legitimate and binding because they were established by the consent of the governed.

Not only did the people consent to the formation of governments, but most men could also participate in town meetings and be elected to public office.

Of particular significance for America’s later break from the British Empire, Calvinist political thinkers developed a strong commitment to the idea that tyrants must be actively resisted. Traditionally, many Christians understood Romans 13 and related texts to prohibit rebellion or active resistance to tyrannical rulers. Reformers initially embraced this approach, but almost immediately changed their minds.

Calvin, one of the most politically conservative of the Reformers, contended that in some cases inferior magistrates may resist a tyrant. Nevertheless, other Calvinists including John Knox, George Buchanan, Theodore Beza, Christopher Goodman, John Ponet, Samuel Rutherford, argued that inferior magistrates must resist unjust rulers, with some even permitted private citizens to do so.

Reformed Americans had experience resisting tyranny well before the War for American Independence. New England Puritans supported Parliament during the English Civil War, and John Cotton even preached a sermon defending the execution of Charles I.

After the Restoration, England attempted to “improve” the governance of the colonies by combining New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Plymouth into a single administrative unit known as the Dominion of New England (1686–89). The second governor of the new entity, Sir Edmund Andros, immediately made himself unpopular by demanding that a Congregational meeting house in Boston be made available for Anglican services and by restricting town meetings.

On April 18, 1689, shortly after news of the Glorious Revolution reached Boston, Puritan civic leaders arrested Andros and returned him to England for trial. The new monarchs wisely abandoned the Dominion and issued a new charter for Massachusetts, one that incorporated Plymouth Colony into its borders.

Long before John Locke wrote his “Second Treatise on Government,” Reformed civil and ecclesiastical leaders were convinced that the Bible taught that governments should be based on the consent of the governed and that unjust or ungodly rulers must be resisted. They created political institutions that were profoundly republican, and their descendants had roughly 150 years of experience governing themselves before the King embarked on a “long train of abuses” aimed at “reducing them” to despotism.

England would have done well to heed Edmund Burke’s 1775 warning to Parliament that Americans “are Protestants; and of that kind which is the most adverse to all implicit submission of mind and opinion. This is a persuasion not only favorable to liberty, but built upon it.”

The Puritans as Theocrats?

Early Puritan colonies are often described as theocracies, but this cannot be the case if by “theocracy” we mean either rule directly by God or ruled by priests. Non-Separatists were permitted to consent to the Mayflower Compact and were included in Plymouth Colony’s civic life. Clergy in Massachusetts Bay were initially banned from holding civic offices, and early Puritan legal codes specifically prohibited European institutions such as ecclesiastical courts. Furthermore, these statutes stipulated that ecclesiastical sanctions such as excommunication had no effect on civic officeholders.

Puritans were committed to creating social and political institutions that they believed were mandated by the Bible. This aspiration is illustrated well by the 1672 declaration by the Connecticut General Court that: “We have endeavored not only to ground our capital laws upon the Word of God, but also all other laws upon the justice and equity held forth in that Word, which is a most perfect rule.” But the implications of this approach are far from theocratic, at least as the term is usually used.

The influence of scripture upon New England’s laws is most obvious in each colony’s capital laws. Crimes such as adultery and incest were not punished by death in England, but the Puritans, looking to the Old Testament for guidance, made them capital offenses. Lest there be any mistake about the biblical warrant for this punishment, each capital law cited scriptural authority. For instance:

If any child, or children, above sixteen years old, and of sufficient understanding, shall curse, or smite their natural father, or mother; he or they shall be put to death: unless it can be sufficiently testified that the Parents have been very unchristianly negligent in the education of such children; or so provoked them by extreme, and cruel correction: that they have been forced thereunto to preserve themselves from death or maiming. Exod. 21. 17. Lev. 20. 9. Exod. 21. 15.

Such laws are harsh — especially compared to our modern sensibilities — but in practice, the death penalty was rarely enforced. Only three people, for instance, were hanged for adultery in Puritan New England and no one was ever put to death for being disrespectful to his parents.

On balance, the Puritans’s use of scripture as a guide for criminal law had a liberalizing effect. In 17th-century England, a person could be put to death based on circumstantial evidence, but the Puritans, drawing from Deuteronomy 19:15 (“One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses…”), required two witnesses to the same act in capital cases.

Similarly, a third of all English criminals were sentenced to death; a person could be executed for stealing property worth little more than a shilling. But American Puritans interpreted biblical texts such as Exodus 22:4 (“If the theft is certainly found alive in his hand, whether it is an ox or donkey or sheep, he shall restore double”) to require restitution as the penalty for theft rather than death.

The Puritan legal revisions were extensive. David D. Hall of Harvard Divinity School observes in his masterly “The Puritans” that they included “adding a cluster of rights and privileges for plaintiffs and defendants … Out went torture, high fees, and long delays … Overnight, the cruelties of the English law and the abuses of power and money it sanctioned gave way to the value of peace, ‘mutual love,’ and equity.” American law owes much to these biblically inspired Puritans.

Nursing Fathers

The Puritans considered civil magistrates to be “nursing fathers” (a phrase taken from Isaiah 49:23) to the church, and so like most countries and colonies, they established churches. The only European colony or country that declined to have an established church in this era, Rhode Island (also known as “Rogues Island”), was viewed by almost everyone as an experiment gone horribly wrong. It was commonplace to require church attendance, support favored churches with tax revenue, give special privileges to its ministers, and place restrictions on dissenters.

In the late 17th century, Pennsylvania and a few other colonies declined to create officially established churches, and unlike Rhode Island, they were viewed as being reasonably successful. Yet even these colonies had religious tests for civic offices and the government actively punished vice and promoted Christianity.

For instance, Article 37 of Pennsylvania’s first laws (1682) held that magistrates should punish such offenses against God as “swearing, cursing, lying, profane talking, drunkenness, drinking of healths, obscene words, incest, sodomy, rapes, whoredom, fornication, and other uncleanness (not to be repeated) … all prizes, stage-plays, cards, dice, May-games, gamesters, masques, revels, bull-battings, cock-fighting, bear-battings, and the like, which excite the people to rudeness, cruelty, looseness, and irreligion.”

The point, of course, is not that religious tests and bans on “vices” such as stage-plays, cards, and dice are prudential, it is simply that Puritans were not unusual in enacting such restrictions.

Puritans were more tolerant than is often assumed. Most non-Congregationalists were tolerated if they remained quiet and did not disturb the public order. Massachusetts law recognized that civic authorities should not attempt to “constrain [citizens] to believe or profess against their consciences.”

In other words, Puritan rulers did not attempt to compel belief. But they also did not permit men and women to disturb the public order. So, for instance, Anabaptists were banned from the colony not because they held erroneous views, but because “they have been the incendiaries of commonwealths” and are “troublers of churches.”

Likewise, Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson were exiled from the colony for being too vocal about their dissenting and dangerous (at least to Puritan ears) theological views. Most famously, the Puritans executed four Quakers on Boston Commons and 19 citizens accused of witchcraft in 1692, all episodes worthy of further exploration for the intellectually curious.

Limited Government and Bills of Rights

The Puritan conviction that rulers should promote true religion and virtue suggests a powerful state, but this possibility was tempered by their view that civil power must be strictly limited. Puritans believed that all humans are sinful and that Christians struggle with sin (Romans 7: 13-25). Like Lord Acton, they understood that “power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”

Accordingly, they placed a variety of checks on rulers, including regular elections and legal restraints on civic officials. The Massachusetts Body of Liberties (1641) contains numerous protections later found in the American Bill of Rights, including prohibitions against double jeopardy, torture, and “in-humane, Barbarous or cruel” bodily punishments.

Seven years later, these laws were revised and published as “The Book of the General Lawes Liberties and Liberties Concerning the Inhabitants of Massachusetts.” This was the first printed code of laws in the Western world, an innovation that made it possible to distribute the statutes more widely than if they were copied by hand. As Michael Winship observes in his excellent book “Hot Protestants”:

In New England, the colonists created legal systems that were simple, equitable, inexpensive, speedy, transparent, and grounded in law codes crafted to protect colonists’s rights against overbearing local rulers.

In the final analysis, while the Puritans were not 21st-century liberal democrats, neither were they intolerant theocrats. They created some of the most republican political institutions the world had ever seen and strictly limited civic leaders by law. They valued liberty and had, as David D. Hall puts it in “A Reforming People,” an “animus against ‘tyranny’ and ‘arbitrary’ power that pervaded virtually every sermon and political statement.”

We do not need to join Webster and Tocqueville in overstating their contributions, nor to replace 1776 with 1620 as the nation’s birthday to recognize that they played an important role in the formation of American religious and civic liberty. As John Adams observed late in life, without the “great exertions & severe sufferings” of the Reformers, the United States of America might never have existed.

Hong Kong Pro-Democracy Leaders Sentenced To Prison For Protesting Communist China,"Hong Kong pro-democracy leaders were arrested and sentenced to prison on Wednesday following their involvement in a series of protests created in resistance to the Chinese Communist Party’s tightening control of the territory.

Joshua Wong received the heaviest sentence with 13 and a half months in prison, Agnes Chow was sentenced to 10 months, and Ivan Lam received seven months. While Wong has been charged in other cases, Chow is still facing potential charges of inciting secession and all of the activists are subject to further scrutiny from the Chinese government.

2. Once again, It’s another blatant attack on the HK activists, whose wishes are solely bringing democracy to Hong Kong. Beijing never fulfilled their promises Rather, they have politically suppressed tens of thousands of protestors who are chanting for their legitimate claims. — Nathan Law 羅冠聰 (@nathanlawkc) December 2, 2020

4. Sentences could pile up. To be honest, I have no idea when the trio could step out of the prison if Beijing pledges to impose the hardest charges on them arbitrarily. Please support them and offer them encouragement, to remind them that they are not alone.

-END — Nathan Law 羅冠聰 (@nathanlawkc) December 2, 2020

Shortly after they were sentenced, Wong was forced into solitary confinement for three days “because a scan had suggested he might have ingested a foreign object before his detention.” Wong wrote a letter posted to Twitter on Tuesday saying that the conditions were difficult.

“Even though I have been imprisoned three times and have the experience, I still found it difficult to be sent suddenly to the ‘prison within a prison,'” he wrote.

2. Today is the 100th day that the #12Hongkongers were detained in #China. I hope every one of you can continue paying attention to them. #save12hkyouths — Joshua Wong 黃之鋒 😷 (@joshuawongcf) November 30, 2020

Chow also said that “she was not adjusting well to conditions in detention and was unable to sleep at night.” “I understand that I will probably be sentenced to prison on Wednesday, so my morale has been low, and I’ve been very worried,” she reportedly said. Wong, Chow, and Lam were all part of a pro-democracy political party Demosisto, which disbanded shortly before the communist National People’s Congress passed a new “security” law in July that criminalizes regular protest activity as “terrorism” for disrupting traffic, “subversion” for disrupting any government agents, and “secession” for groups speaking of potential independence. Any attempt by protest groups to work with the members of the international community was also made a criminal offense. Violators of the new legislation were subjected to harsh punishments including potential life in prison. The activists previously pleaded guilty for participating in what was deemed an “unauthorized assembly” in front of police headquarters in June of last year when the pro-democracy protest movement first began to gain international attention. As noted by the New York Times, both Wong and Lam, eventually joined by Chow, were influential in organizing and lifting Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement off of the ground. Nearly 10 years ago, the activists recognized the influence the Chinese Communist Party was having on their generation and began to coordinate protests against a “national education curriculum in Hong Kong schools, which they considered ‘brainwashing.'” The young activists also helped organize the Umbrella Movement, a series of campaigns and protests against “limits on direct elections in 2014.” When urgency and awareness picked up about the Hong Kongers’ fight for freedom in 2019 following protests over China’s intention to extradite criminal offenders to be tried in mainland China, they rose into the international spotlight as leaders of the movement.

"By Imprisoning Hong Kong Protest Leaders, China Betrays Weakness","Three prominent leaders of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement were sentenced to prison this week for leading a protest last year. Joshua Wong received 13 and a half months; Agnes Chow, 10 months; and Ivan Lam, seven months. Wong has already been in prison a few times as the result of his activism.

They are young. Lam is 26. Wong is 24. Chow turned 24 this past Dec. 3, the day after she received her first prison sentence, spending her birthday in jail.

Had they lived in a free society like in the United States of America, these young people would have likely lived a normal life: hanging out with friends, spending hours playing video games (a confessed hobby for both Joshua and Agnes), looking for their first job out of college, and finding love. Unfortunately, the Chinese Communist Party’s suppression has quickly turned Hong Kong — one of the formerly freest places on the planet — into a dystopian state.

Led By the Future

While young, these three activists are veterans of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. Their activism began when they were still teenagers.

Wong led his first peaceful protest against Beijing’s plan to build a high-speed rail linking Hong Kong and mainland China — he was just 13. Two years later, he joined 17-year-old Ivan Lam in founding the student activist group, Scholarism, fighting against the Hong Kong overnment’s plan of implementing a “moral and national education” curriculum that intended to craft Hong Kong school children into citizens loyal instead to Beijing.

At 15, Chow joined a sit-in demonstration outside the Hong Kong government’s office. Parents and teachers also voiced their concerns about Beijing’s attempts to infiltrate various sectors in Hong Kong. They regarded such compulsive patriotic education as an effort to brainwash young minds. In time, Beijing-appointed Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying withdrew the plan amidst public pressure.

Then, in 2014, after Beijing denied Hong Kongers the right to universal suffrage, more than 800,000 Hong Kong residents signed an online pro-democracy petition. The petition was soon followed by protests, and young people, mostly students, occupied three downtown business districts streets, demanding the right to choose the city’s political leaders and calling for Leung’s resignation.

Their movement became known as the Umbrella Movement, deriving its name from members’ ingenious usage of umbrellas to shield against tear gas and rubber bullets police fired. Wong was the most visible leader of the movement, and his young face graced the cover of Time magazine.

Although the movement failed to secure universal suffrage, in former Democrat legislator Emily Lau’s words, “the desire for democracy had been stirred up.” In 2016, Wong and Lam joined Chow and another young activist — 23-year-old Nathan Law — to co-found a youth-oriented political party, Demosistō, literally meaning “democracy standing.” They called for reclaiming Hong Kong’s political agenda through “democratic self-determination” while rejecting the CCP’s authoritarian rule.

In the 2016 Legislative Council election, Law became the youngest candidate ever elected. Those were the times Hong Kong youth still felt hopeful that the existing political process could achieve some of their goals. Their hopes, however, were quickly diminished.

A Turn For the Worse

In 2017, on the eve of the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover, the Chinese Foreign Ministry declared, “Now that Hong Kong has returned to the motherland for 20 years, the Sino-British Joint Declaration, as a historical document, no longer has any realistic meaning.” In effect, it was abandoning all pretense of keeping the promises they made to Britain and Hongkongers when Britain allowed the city its independence.

Shortly after Beijing’s declaration, a Hong Kong court disqualified four pro-democracy lawmakers, including Nathan Law, for modifying their oaths of allegiance to China during their swearing-in ceremony back in 2016. Then, Nathan Law, Wong, and Alex Chow (no relation to Agnes Chow) were convicted and sent to jail for their activities in the 2014 Umbrella movement. In 2018, a Hong Kong court barred Agnes Chow from running for office.

For a while, it seemed a majority of Hong Kongers lost interest in fighting for their political rights. Attendance at the annual June 4th candlelight vigil had dwindled. Then came Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s 2019 attempt to expedite a controversial bill that would allow Hong Kong to extradite wanted criminals to mainland China for trial. Many Hong Kongers are concerned that if the new extradition bill becomes law, Hong Kong authorities, under Beijing’s pressure, will also surrender anyone wanted by Beijing on trumped-up charges.

Yet the extradition bill seemed to be the last straw. Widespread opposition united legislators, legal scholars, business people, and ordinary citizens, rejuvenating the pro-democracy movement. With leaders such as Wong and Chow, young people have been at the forefront of the city’s anti-extradition bill protests, which later evolved into a renewed pro-democracy movement.

Not Yet a Lost Cause

After several months of protest and unrest in the city, Carrie Lam finally withdrew the bill, but she and her Communist Party bosses in Beijing are unwaveringly bent on making the leaders of the protests pay. On July 1, 2020, Beijing forced a draconian national security law onto Hong Kong, all but ending its commitment to the “One Country, Two Systems” framework.

Each day, news out of Hong Kong reads like a eulogy of a city that used to be a bastion of liberty. Political organizations have disbanded. Activists like Nathan Law have left Hong Kong in self-imposed exile. Democratic lawmakers are ejected from the city’s legislature. Books by pro-democracy writers are removed from public libraries. Local businesses rush to remove posters supporting protests and the pro-democracy movement. Hongkongers scrub their digital footprints and install virtual private networks.

Despite his wealth and prominence, 71-year-old businessman Jimmy Lai was also arrested on a trumped-up fraud charge the day after the prison sentence of the three young activists. He’s another long-time outspoken critic of Beijing silenced.

Considering all of this, it may be tempting to conclude that a truly free Hong Kong is a lost cause and that the CCP has won. Yet if a regime with one of the most powerful militaries on earth feels the need to imprison youths and senior citizens to suppress dissent, it may not be as powerful as it seems. The image of these brave, handcuffed activists walking into prison cells says more about the CCP’s insecurity and weakness rather than its surface-level strength.

The U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted : “The United States is appalled by the Hong Kong government’s political persecution of Jimmy Lai, Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow, and Ivan Lam. Their struggle to resist the CCP’s denial of their fundamental rights will stand throughout history as testaments to the human spirit.”

The backlash to China’s aggression has gone beyond words. Beijing’s mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic, its ruthless political crackdown on Hong Kong, as well as its ethnic cleansing of Uighur Muslims, have exposed the CCP’s nature in its truest form.

Led by the United States and its allies, a united front to push back on the CCP’s domestic and international aggressions is starting to take shape. As a result of this joint effort, more countries are now excluding China’s telecom company, Huawei, from their 5G networks; more countries are offering to accept Hong Kong political refugees despite threats from Beijing; and more countries are demanding an investigation of the origin and spread of the novel coronavirus.

History has shown us that even the hardest totalitarian regimes will crumble when courageous people rise up. As the future of Hong Kong, time is on the side of Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow, and Ivan Lam. The CCP can’t imprison the future forever.

WATCH: Pro-Lifers Arrested For Protesting Baby Organ Harvesting,"A group of protestors were arrested on a public sidewalk outside of University of California San Francisco’s (UCSF) Zuckerberg Hospital in San Fransisco last month, and are now being charged with trespassing despite not stepping foot on hospital grounds until after their arrest.

In video footage shared by the organization Pro-Life San Francisco, protestors are seen being arrested by local authorities and then walked into the hospital, where they began chants intended to draw attention to the hospital’s use of aborted fetuses for publicly funded experimental studies.

Martin Cannon, senior counsel at the Thomas More Society, is representing one of the protestors, Terrisa Bukovinac, executive director of Pro-Life San Francisco. Cannon said he believes it was local sheriffs, not hospital staff or security, who walked Bukovinac and others into the hospital after arresting them for stepping past an arbitrary barricade outside.

“They arrested her on a sidewalk, basically just for showing up. She did not have a megaphone, she wasn’t calling out at all. She didn’t even have a sign. They arrested her for being within an area,” that the hospital arbitrarily declared was too close to the entrance, Cannon said.

As seen in the video, it wasn’t until after authorities arrested Bukovianc that she began leading chants.

“The problem here is that they got arrested, when they made no noise. They got arrested for showing up because the cops are thinking they might make some noise,” Cannon said. “They got arrested anticipatorly.”

Cannon said the trespassing charges brought against his client seem like a stretch, but that “stretches” seem to be a common theme among law enforcement lately, pointing out a trend of failure of equal protection across the country.

“We see governors and mayors and election commissioners, people are just making up new rules. It’s just sort of sweeping the country, and our pro-life people are seeing a lot of it,” Cannon said. “The same people that will let the protesters bash windows and burn buildings and steal everybody’s inventory and call it ‘lawful protest –we can’t do anything,’ will respond where there’s half a dozen pro-lifers on the sidewalk and start building constraints against them”

Other protestors arrested belong to the organization Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust, who are being represented by the Life Legal Defense Foundation.

“Our position is that this is an unlawful arrest, as the pro-lifers were engaged in constitutionally protected speech on a public sidewalk,” Alexandra Snyder, executive director of Life Legal Defense Foundation, told The Federalist last week. “This appears to be an attempt to suppress the dissemination of information in order to protect UCSF.”

The pro-lifers were protesting USCF’s practice of conducting studies with tissue of healthy, aborted babies at various gestational phases, including some studies in which fetal intestines and reproductive tracts were transplanted into rodents.

Restaurant Workers Rally In Times Square To Save Indoor Dining,"I’ve covered a lot of protests in my day, protests demanding all kinds of things, but Tuesday was the first time I’ve ever attended a protest where people were simply demanding the right to go to work at jobs they already have.

In Times Square Tuesday morning, an industry tired of being a scapegoat for hypocritical politicians who are destroying their livelihoods begged for the right to work. The right to feed their families, to buy their kids Christmas presents.

As one speaker put it, first in Spanish then in English, “We are tired of being the guinea pig of the government.”

And here’s the thing on that. The experiment was a success. The restaurants in New York City took temperatures, did contact tracing, maintained social distancing, and as a result Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s own data show that dining out is responsible for just 1.4 percent of the spread of the Chinese Virus.

Brian, a retired state auditor came out to support their cause. “I walked down from 72nd street,” he told me. “It’s terrible, people are hurting.”

A restaurant owner I spoke to told me the uncertainty was the worst part. He honestly has no idea if his business will survive another closure of indoor dining. And by the way, state taxes are due next week from these shuttered restaurants.

The crowd of a few hundred was loud, buoyant, and diverse. Among the groups present was the New York State Latino Restaurant, Bar & Lounge Association. They were handing out signs and t-shirts. This was far more organized than any of the other anti-lockdown protests I have seen in New York City. It speaks to the desperation these people feel as their ability to work for a living is stolen from them. They don’t want money from the government or their neighbors. They want to work, they want that dignity, and they deserve it.

This summer when New Yorkers were enjoying cocktails on St. Mark’s Place outside the bars and restaurants they couldn’t enter, our tough guy Emperor Cuomo tweeted out, “Don’t make me come down there.”

Don't make me come down there… https://t.co/OeVGMW7LEO — Archive: Governor Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) June 13, 2020

Well, governor why don’t you come down here now? Why don’t you come to these protests and explain to these New Yorkers that you are thrusting them out of work when your own data say their establishments are safe? What? Are you a little worried about how you’d be received? Worried they won’t be big fans of your self-congratulatory book? You should be.

If this decision by the governor is not reversed, if Cuomo insists on plunging tens of thousands into poverty based on his capricious whims when even his own science mocks his mandate, then we can expect these protests to continue. The people are speaking out loud and clear, the city is listening, but sadly the governor is not.

Instead, he insults these workers with talk of outdoor dining the day before the city is expecting a blizzard. Cuomo might be looking at a blizzard of his own as his autocratic job killing diktats send more and more New Yorkers to the bread lines.

WaPo Defends Mob That Terrorized Sen. Hawley’s Family At Their Home,"The Washington Post defended a mob of leftist protesters, who under the cover of night yelled through a megaphone and trespassed at the home of Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., while Hawley was away and his wife and children, including a newborn, were inside.

“Tonight while I was in Missouri, Antifa scumbags came to our place in DC and threatened my wife and newborn daughter, who can’t travel,” Hawley wrote on Twitter. “They screamed threats, vandalized, and tried to pound open our door.”

Tonight while I was in Missouri, Antifa scumbags came to our place in DC and threatened my wife and newborn daughter, who can’t travel. They screamed threats, vandalized, and tried to pound open our door. Let me be clear: My family & I will not be intimidated by leftwing violence — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) January 5, 2021

The Washington Post, however, insisted that the protest outside the congressman’s house was just a “peaceful vigil.”

“The activists said they had staged a peaceful vigil on Monday night to protest a GOP plan to object to Congress’s certification of the presidential electoral vote this week,” the Post wrote. “On the sidewalk in a Northern Virginia suburb, a group of 15 people chanted while holding candles and signs saying, ‘Protect democracy.’”

Admitting that police in Vienna, Virginia, did not respond to a request for comment, the Washington Post proceeded to downplay the protesters’ actions:

Demonstrators with ShutDownDC, which organized the protest, told The Washington Post that they did not engage in vandalism or even knock on Hawley’s door. A 50-minute video shared by the group shows protesters writing in chalk on the sidewalk, chanting through a megaphone and at one point leaving a copy of the Constitution on Hawley’s doorstep. “This was not threatening behavior,” said Patrick Young, a ShutDownDC organizer. “This is people engaging in democracy and engaging in civil discourse. … This was a pretty tame and peaceful visit to his house.” Police in Vienna, Va., who responded to the protest, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Post late Monday. The group’s video shows several officers asking protesters to quiet down, but then standing by as the crowd continued with its demonstration.

The demonstrators did not simply stand quietly outside Hawley’s home with candles, however. Video shows several protesters used megaphones to shout at Hawley’s family inside, trespassed on Hawley’s yard, went straight up to his front door, and argued with neighbors who asked them to be quiet.

https://twitter.com/KBoomhauer/status/1346312800231067648?s=20

Hawley fired back at the Post, writing on Twitter:

.@washingtonpost this morning printing outright lies from the Antifa group who now describe themselves as sweet angels. BS. You screamed through bullhorns, shouted down my wife when she asked you to leave, vandalized property, pounded on our door, and terrorized neighbors — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) January 5, 2021

Contrary to what you’ll hear from the Post, it is always threatening when protesters show up at a politician’s home, whether the target is a Democrat or a Republican. When the mayor of Olympia, Washington, Democrat Cheryl Selby, saw her house vandalized during Black Lives Matter riots, of which she was formally supportive, she called it “domestic terrorism.”

Democrat Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot banned protests on the block where she lives, citing concerns for her safety. “I have a right to make sure that my home is secure,” she said.

Democrat Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, who was also overwhelmingly supportive of the BLM riots, called for an investigation into socialist Councilwoman Kshama Sawant, who led a protest outside Durkan’s home. Durkan accused Sawant of “recklessly undermin[ing] the safety of others, all for political theatre.”

Given the violent riots that took place this summer, Hawley’s wife, like the aforementioned Democratic politicians, would understandably feel threatened while protesters yelled outside her home, especially since she was alone with a newborn. Since protests outside personal addresses are threatening and the Post hadn’t heard from the local police, the corrupt publication shouldn’t have run with the story, excusing the protesters’ behavior for political points.

28 Times Media And Democrats Excused Violence By Left-Wing Activists,"Democrats and their allies in the media are ready to condemn riots now that the turmoil has shifted to fit their narrative.

On Wednesday, a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building. It was an astonishing display of anarchic protest that delayed congressional certification of the Electoral College vote formally handing former Vice President Joe Biden the keys to the White House.

The scenes from the dark day of disaster demonstrations illustrated a deteriorating country, repulsed millions, and traumatized a nation still recovering from the death, despair, and disruption that came to define the dystopian months of 2020. Above all, what happened Wednesday served as a grim reminder that the institutional stress test of 2020 has followed us into 2021.

For the left, however, the chaos at the Capitol has opened an opportunity to refute the perception they own the monopoly on widespread political violence. Democrats and left-wing media elites have already capitalized on the violent outbreak, where four people died, to characterize conservatives as the creatures of chaos.

At this point, it’s undeniable that the political far-right calls home to its own Antifa-like anarchists. It is also undeniable, however, that reaction to the protests from conservative leaders roundly condemning the violence from their own side stands in remarkable contrast to the way Democrats and corporate media spent months going out of their way attempting to justify the deadly actions of militant leftists.

Not one prominent conservative pundit or politician with any significant platform was reported to have tried endorsing the mob of Trump supporters infiltrating the U.S. Capitol. To the contrary, conservatives spent months vilifying Democratic leaders for not doing enough in their own states and cities to crack down on the militant mobs of leftists taking streets under siege, normalizing the kind of political violence on track to appear routine in the nightmare 2020 decade.

It was only seven months ago that Washington D.C. was last on fire.

Reminder that our nation's capital looked like this at the beginning of the summer and most Democrats/media shrugged it off as mostly peaceful https://t.co/1zvsLVRuQc — Greg Price (@greg_price11) January 6, 2021

A trip down memory lane chronicling the left’s reaction to last year’s eruption of unrest claiming the lives of at least 30 people not only exposes the hypocrisy suffusing Democrats’ condemnation of political violence, but also illustrates a sobering reality that there’s plenty of blame to go around for the situation in which the United States now finds itself.

1. Kamala Harris Urges Followers to Cover Rioters’ Bail

Incoming Vice President Kamala Harris encouraged her supporters last summer to donate to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which provided bail money to the militant anarchists facing charges for setting fire to Minneapolis.

2. Chris Cuomo: Who Said Protests Were Supposed To Be Peaceful?

CNN’s Chris Cuomo showcased his ignorance of the First Amendment in June when dismissing the idea that militant protests sweeping the nation in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death were illegal.

“Please, show me where it says protesters are supposed to be polite and peaceful,” Cuomo demanded.

Here’s the text from the First Amendment, emphasis added:

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

CNN continued to parody itself in August as a second wave of mass unrest swept the country with Kenosha, Wisconsin as its focal point. After the label “fiery but mostly peaceful” had become a trolling phrase online to describe legacy media’s coverage of the summer riots, the network literally adopted the words to describe events unfolding in Kenosha while a reporter stood in front of a several burning vehicles.

“Destroying property, which can be replaced, is not violence,” Hannah-Jones said on CBS, to which the anchors offered no challenge.

“It’s a great point that you make, Nikole,” CBS’s Vladimir Duthiers replied.

Hannah-Jones also said it would be “an honor” for 2020 riots be deemed the “1619 Riots” despite destroying minority businesses.

Leftist Journalists Collude With Big Tech To Attack Independent Journalists,"If the blatant mainstream media bias we’ve seen in 2020 has taught us anything, it’s that independent reporting and news outlets are essential to get any real understanding of events in the United States. Yet leftist journalists in mainstream media are calling for unelected, big tech companies to deplatform independent journalists.

Among those being nominated for cancellation are Andy Ngo, editor-at-large for The Post Millennial (where I’m also an editor); The Blaze’s Elijah Schaffer; Mollie Hemingway of The Federalist; and Dan Bongino. Schaffer was removed from Facebook and Instagram and Bongino was yanked from Twitter. The move to an alternative social media platform, Parler, has been hindered by Google and Apple app stores refusing to carry the app, and by Amazon nuking Parler’s servers.

The mob of leftist journalists demanding the ouster of other journalists is a horrifying trend, but it’s all in the name of social justice. Many demanded the removal of President Donald Trump’s accounts from Twitter, and now that Twitter has banned him permanently, they rejoice in the squashing of free speech. As Ngo told me, “Left-wing journalists see an ally in Twitter and now feel emboldened to make more demands of censorship.”

The corporate media narrative throughout the summer of 2020 was clear: any action taken in the name of social justice was acceptable. They barely showed the violence and destruction, and when they did, they glossed it over, changing the language to make it palatable.

If it weren’t for the work of independent journalists and outlets, we would not have seen the violence that came with these protests, understood who was committing the violence, or gotten any insight into these disruptive movements under the surface of American culture. These journalists are now under threat of erasure by social media companies, and by those who are asking social media to target them.

Ngo has come under fire from those he has exposed. Having worked to cover the Antifa-led protest movement in his home town of Portland, Ore., he has long been a target to those who would like anonymity as they attempt to disrupt the social and political order of the country.

Many corporate reporters didn’t believe Ngo when he dragged these bad actors into the light, showing mug shots of their arrests, digging into their social accounts to expose their motivations. Even after Ngo was brought to testify before the House and Senate on Antifa’s involvement in riot activity across the country, Joe Biden called Antifa an “idea, not an organization.”

Antifa-affiliated social media accounts have been trying to discredit Ngo for years, and now that big tech companies are on their side, they see an opening to try to get him, and his reporting, taken down for good. Among those calling for his ouster is Sarah Jeong, a New York Times writer whose racist vitriol was not an issue for the Times either when they hired her or when she repeated it while on staff. Jeong wrote on Twitter, “I wonder when Twitter is going to ban A*dy N*o,” then shared a slew of articles criticizing his reporting.

To be clear, this is a writer for The New York Times, which is basically the premiere U.S. legacy outlet, calling for a journalist to be banned. Jeong had written previously “Are white people genetically predisposed to burn faster in the sun, thus logically being only fit to live underground like groveling goblins.” This was fine to say, apparently, but to Jeong reporting on rampant crime and the criminals who undertake it in one’s own home town is a reason for banishment.

Donavan Farley of Vice started the call for Ngo’s removal on Jan. 8, claiming that Ngo, whose family has been threatened as part of the attempts to silence his reporting, is a liar, without proof. Farley tried to link Ngo to far-right propagandists who bolstered Trump conspiracy theories. Again, this is both circumstantial and a serious stretch. Farley is another journalist asking for unelected big tech companies to silence the free press.

Schaffer of The Blaze was instrumental in covering the riots and demonstrations during the 2020 summer of destruction and rage. He, like Ngo, was attacked by the bad actors he exposed. In each of these cases, those committing crimes for their own political or avaricious ends would rather shut up the reporter than be exposed.

Schaffer’s accounts were removed from both Facebook and Instagram. “Reporting the truth is now illegal,” Schaffer wrote on Twitter. Schaffer revealed that the social justice narrative was being used as a cover for some seriously criminal activity, and that the altruism mainstream media assumed as the basis for Black Lives Matter protests was not altogether accurate.

Coverage of the protests and riots on CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, and the Washington Post, to name a few, praised those who broke lockdown orders and coronavirus restrictions to express their anger in the streets. Anyone who opposed those actions, or wanted to break the restrictions for any other reason was selfish, and sometimes a racist. They did not cover that those who back those protests and riots are pushing not for a return to normalcy but the complete disruption of the social and political order.

Corporate media bias brought us the phrase “mostly peaceful” during the 2020 summer of outrage. As more than 7,750 protests were staged in 2,400 locations across the country in the wake of George Floyd’s death on May 25, violent demonstrations erupted in 220 of those locations, some of which were sustained for more than 100 days, as in Portland, Ore. While corporate outlets covered the events from the edges, giving nothing but snapshot visuals and chyrons, it was the cadre of independent journalists who covered what was going on from the inside out.

We’re hearing from big tech companies and their allies in mainstream media that only one perspective is valid, and that if you’re a journalist who fights for truth, even at the risk of your own safety, you are at risk of banishment. This is not simply a threat against these journalists or the independent outlets that back them, but an assault on truth, reality, and our free press.

Correction: A previous version of this story inaccurately reported the hosts of “Red Scare” were kicked off Twitter. Host Anna Khachiyan clarified she “preemptively self-ejected” after the podcast’s inactive official account was “banned” over a rule violation.

‘We Just Wanted Our Voices To Be Heard.’ Capitol Protesters Speak Out,"Why did hundreds of thousands of people from all over the country show up in Washington, D.C., last week to protest the presidential election? What were all those people doing there, and what did they hope to accomplish?

The corporate press, Big Tech monopolists, Democrats, and quite a few Republicans and right-of-center media outlets aren’t at all interested in those questions. They don’t care. To them, the people who rallied in support of President Trump last Wednesday and marched to the U.S. Capitol—whether or not they took part in the violence—are nothing more than traitors.

It doesn’t matter that the vast majority didn’t so much as jostle a barrier, let alone smash a window or throw a punch. Didn’t you hear? Those people tried to stage a coup. Trump incited them. They’re terrorists and insurrectionists, and all we need to know about them is where they live and who they work for.

That’s how you respond to the horrible events of Jan. 6 if you want to deepen the divisions in America and make it impossible to live together in peace. But if you want to fix what’s wrong and salvage our broken republic, you at least have to try and understand why so many Trump supporters gathered at the U.S. Capitol last week. And yes, you can do that without condoning or excusing the idiots who attacked the police.

That’s not hard to do, although the left has had trouble with it this year. When it was Antifa and Black Lives Matter activists demonstrating and rioting in the streets and attacking police, corporate journalists churned out essays and commentary that either tacitly or explicitly endorsed the violence, while insisting that we understand and sympathize with the ideology and outrage fueling it. Some argued that we must kneel, literally, and profess BLM dogma, or be branded a racist.

By contrast, almost no one has insisted that we understand or sympathize with the cause of the peaceful protesters who marched to the capitol, to say nothing of the people themselves. So I decided to talk to some of them.

‘I’m Shocked to The Core’

Jaron Pensinger, a 21-year-old student at Georgetown University, told me he went to the protest for two reasons: to voice his opposition to what he believes are unjustifiable pandemic lockdowns, and to raise awareness about mail-in ballot fraud in the November election.

“I’m concerned that the Democrats actually changed and loosened election laws over the summer and made them less stringent,” he said. “So now more than ever we should be investigating fraud, and I felt like the Democratic Party just swept it under the rug and didn’t want to investigate anything.”

Pensinger specifically asked me to use his name because his school newspaper, The Hoya, ran a hit piece on him this week, badly mischaracterizing his presence at the protests, which the paper described as a “coup attempt,” and associating him with the violence that broke out at the U.S. Capitol.

Pensinger attended the protest with two other Georgetown students, and he says they were caught “completely unaware” when they saw from a distance people pushing against police barricades, because the vast majority of the protesters—hundreds of thousands of them—were peacefully demonstrating. He says that where he was on the capitol grounds, he didn’t see anyone so much as cross a security barrier.

“We were just peacefully assembling,” he said. “And I assumed that this was going to be a completely peaceful statement to our government that we would like more investigation into the election and perhaps stop with these covid lockdowns.” Pensinger says he’s “shocked to the core” that anyone would portray it as an attempted coup or an insurrection.

‘We Had A Civic Duty to Our Country to Attend’

Not everyone wanted to speak on the record, for fear of harassment and threats. Another college student I talked to drove six hours with her mother to attend the rally and protest. She said she felt she had “a civic duty to our country to attend,” given the “substantial evidence of voter fraud and irregularities.”

“We want to stand up and show that we’re following the news and we’re reading between the lines,” she said. “I think the mainstream media has largely failed to report upon very concerning evidence of voter fraud. And really we just wanted our voices to be heard.”

She says the crowd around her, both at the White House Ellipse where Trump spoke and when she and her mother marched to the U.S. Capitol grounds, was “calm and respectful,” and that there were a lot of young families with babies, elderly couples, and military veterans in uniform. One group had traveled all the way from Hawaii to be there.

This student and her mother decided to go back to their hotel to charge their phones and rest before coming back later that evening, but as soon as they left the area, she starting getting texts that “they stormed the capitol, somehow they got into the capitol.” At that point, she heard sirens and saw police cars speeding toward the capitol, so they decided not to go back.

Like Pensinger and every other person I spoke to, they obeyed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser’s 6 p.m. curfew that night and stayed in their hotel rooms—an odd thing for “insurrectionists” to do. She never expected the protest to turn violent: “I absolutely did not intend to enter the capitol, I obviously did not enter the capitol, and if anyone would have told me on Tuesday or Wednesday morning that others had that intention, I would have just laughed.”

‘I Didn’t Have Any Delusions of Grandeur’

So, far from being the launch-point of an insurrection, much of what was planned for last Wednesday was orderly and ordinary—permitted groups planning events and speakers at the capitol grounds to draw attention to election fraud and irregularities that were ignored or dismissed by the corporate press.

One such event organizer was Nathan Martin, an Iraq War veteran and city councilman in Shelby, Ohio. His group had obtained a permit from the Capitol Police, along with a bunch of other groups that planned events for that day. “We went through all the steps,” he said.

As for the march to the capitol grounds, “We didn’t think it would change the outcome” of the election. Martin’s hope was that Republican lawmakers would put their objections on the record and go through the claims of election fraud, “line by line,” especially claims in states where instances of fraud and election irregularities were well-documented.

“That’s it. I didn’t have any delusions of grandeur that Vice President Pence would come swooping in and change the results or anything like that,” he said. “Although there had been some constitutional talk about whether that was allowed or not, I didn’t feel constitutionally that there was room for that.” At best, Martin says he was hoping for an election commission to look into fraud, and that maybe some good would come from that.

After Trump spoke, Martin went back to his hotel to get some supplies for their planned event. When he returned, he at first saw no signs that anything was amiss or that any part of the capitol security had been breached (and because there was no cell service, he didn’t know about the violent clashes with police).

He was walking around the capitol grounds looking for his parents, who had driven down from Pennsylvania because they “wanted to pray over the capitol grounds and pray for our country,” when he saw some people going into the capitol through a side door. That didn’t seem quite right to him. A short time later, he says, the metro police showed up, “And it was at that point I realized that, you know what, I’m going to go back to my hotel.”

Back at the hotel, he learned what had happened. “All of our objectives, everything that we wanted to achieve, was destroyed in a matter of hours,” he said. “I don’t think we’re going to get an election integrity commission. I don’t think we’re going to get accountability or really fully know what happened.”

‘It Just Incensed Me’

Not everyone I talked to was opposed to civil disobedience or pushing past security barriers at the capitol. One man, a 62-year-old software engineer who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from his employer, told me he hadn’t planned to force his way into the U.S. Capitol or break any rules. But in the moment, something changed.

Initially, he’d hoped that the sight of a mass demonstration on the capitol grounds would give “weak-knee Republicans” the courage to “stand up and save our country.” He thought there was a last-ditch chance that GOP lawmakers would be able to force a vote on electors in the House, by state delegation.

Once he got to the capitol itself, he didn’t see anyone fighting with police or throwing objects, but he did see people pushing and pulling on the barriers. He and a friend were pretty far back, he says, so they walked around to an open area on the south side of the complex where he encountered a flimsy fence and a sign that said “No Entry Beyond This Point.” Beyond that were a few Capitol Police, just standing around.

“When I saw that I just kind of got—mad is not the right word, but I just got indignant, you know?” He says after nine of months of rioting and mayhem in U.S. cities, supported by Democrats and the media, the authorities at the capitol just assumed that pro-Trump protesters would obey the rules and do as they were told.

He told me, “I walked up to that [barrier] and said, ‘These people want me to keep off the grass and stay behind their barriers and obey the rules?’ And it just incensed me. I just couldn’t believe these people. So I start pushing and pulling on the stupid barrier at that point, I said, ‘I’m going in there.’ But it didn’t last long.”

He says a capitol police officer was walking down the line with a big canister of liquid pepper spray and dousing anyone who jostled the barrier, and he got hit full in the face. His friend pulled him back and it took him hours to recover. He never made it into the capitol.

Even if he had, though, he says goal wasn’t to hurt anyone or stage a coup, or anything of the sort. It was to make a statement.

Our civil disobedience is, we’re going to walk into this building and wave the American flag. That’s what I felt like everybody who was around me, that’s what their attitude was. It wasn’t beating up officers, it wasn’t tearing things down or destroying. It was, that’s our building and we’re gonna go in there and wave the American flag. And if it puts a little fear of God into those people, I could care less.

Not everyone will agree with that view. I don’t. But I do understand it. It makes sense to me that some people, even law-abiding software engineers in their sixties, might get so fed up with the hypocrisy and contempt shown to them by our ruling class that they decide they’re going to break a few rules, push past a few barriers, and make their voices heard.

The vast majority of the protesters didn’t quite get there. But they did get to the point where they were willing to travel across the country to protest what they believe, not without good reason, was an unfair election. Far from being insurrectionist, theirs is a quintessentially American impulse—and the news media would have said as much if the protesters, and even the rioters, had been left-wing activists objecting to a Trump victory.

But they weren’t. So no one in the press or the halls of power will ever say a sympathetic word about them. They’ll be shunned from polite society and branded as traitors and terrorists and conspiracy theorists. They’ll be kicked off social media and mocked by cable news. If they have podcasts or YouTube channels, those will be shut down. Some of them will even be fired from their jobs and harassed in the street for nothing more than expressing a political opinion.

But they won’t go away.

I Didn't Need A Day Off For Biden's Inauguration. I Had A Fulfilling Day,"Four years ago, students across America walked out of class (if they had shown up in the first place) in protest of the perceived horror that was the inauguration of President Donald Trump.

Students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill walked out of class to protest Trump’s inauguration. More than 100 students at Boston’s Northeastern University walked out of their classes on Inauguration Day, while dining hall workers at Northeastern went on strike.

Ohio State was ahead of the game, offering a “safe space” for students who couldn’t emotionally cope with the reality of Trump’s swearing-in. That wasn’t enough for their students, however, who still held a walk-out.

A group of students at Temple University coped with Trump’s inauguration by waving their phone flashlights in the air and singing “This Little Light of Mine.”

I didn’t do any of those things yesterday. I didn’t even consider doing them. I didn’t wake up yesterday morning with a sense of dread and despair. In fact, I didn’t think about it being Inauguration Day until I opened Twitter. I had a pretty normal, fulfilling Wednesday.

It’s not that I don’t care about the presidency. I’m a government major, a political news reporter, and a former intern in the Trump White House, living an hour from Washington, D.C. But having a president with whom I passionately disagree — even a president whose plans and policies I find alarming — didn’t keep me from functioning as an adult either.

I made my bed, and I made myself coffee as usual, unironically in my White House mug. I noticed the snow flurries outside as I went to my morning class. Five of us in that class had either interned or worked in the Trump White House, and while we jokingly eyerolled about the day’s events, we participated in class with no paralyzing sorrow. If we had decided not to show up, and explained to our professor (no fan of Biden himself) that we needed the day to mourn or protest the incoming president’s existence, I hope he would have thought we were joking.

I read my Bible and made my to-do list for the day, and went to corporate chapel with my classmates as I do every Wednesday. “Tis So Sweet To Trust In Jesus,” we sang, not as melancholy, afflicted creatures but as happy souls that meant it.

Afterwards, I clocked in for my work shift in the campus bookstore. If I’d dramatically staged a walk-out, I’m sure the sweet lady I work for wouldn’t have been impressed with my show of protest but would have just been confused why I was bailing on my job. Instead, I served customers, folded sweatshirts, organized displays, and talked about political theory with a campus visitor.

On my lunch break, I caught up with some sophomore and junior friends. We laughed for a minute about the softball press coverage of Biden on the heels of four years of relentless hatred of Trump by the media. (I mean, the lights from the Lincoln Memorial looking like “extensions of Joe Biden’s arms embracing America”? Really, CNN?) But for the most part, we spent our time talking about everything from post-grad plans to our families and our favorite classes.

After work I read from Booker T. Washington’s “Up From Slavery” for a class assignment. If anyone ever had reason to feel paralyzed by hurt, anger, or fear, it was Washington — born into chattel slavery and with every tangible circumstance stacked against him. Yet Washington remarkably was unfazed by his odds, choosing instead to approach the daily tasks before him with the simple goal of serving others well. Looming political threats did not deter him from the mission of hard and honest work.

The conservatism that I know aspires to imitate Washington’s approach. It is based on the idea that the strongest victories are achieved in personal relationships and local service rendered in the course of everyday responsibilities. The most sacred duties are performed not in government buildings but close to home.

So I won’t walk out of my classes or forsake my responsibilities as an act of defiant protest. But I will perform my daily duties to the best of my ability, as a sign of commitment to the values I hold dear.

That’s the only way liberty has ever been preserved. No electoral victory or defeat is weightier than the ties of duty and friendship that bind people together in their communities. No struggle for true freedom has succeeded without them.

All conservatives lost yesterday was (for now) the presidential office. We have not truly lost until we have ceased to be able to serve our God, our families, and the people closest to us. That’s what gives elections significance — not the other way around.

Conservatives Should Stop Trying To Justify Impeaching Trump,"Now that Joe Biden has been sworn in as the 46th president, Democrats and the corporate press have turned their attention back to Donald Trump’s impeachment trial in the Senate, which will likely begin next month.

Senate Democrats will need 17 Republicans to join them in order to convict Trump on the single impeachment charge of “willful incitement of insurrection.” Although Democrats might get a few GOP members like Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Mitt Romney to join them, it’s unlikely they’ll get many more. That would mean Trump’s second impeachment ends up like his first: a pointless exercise in partisan politics.

That would be fitting, because that’s exactly what this second impeachment effort is. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi knows it, McConnell knows it, and the American people know it.

Surprisingly, though, some conservative commentators don’t seem to know it. Consider the case for convicting and disqualifying Trump recently put forth by Dan McLaughlin at National Review. After some caveats and throat-clearing, McLaughlin’s argument boils down to this: Trump should have known that claiming the election was rigged would inspire a small group of protesters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Therefore, he bears “moral and political responsibility for inspiring the Capitol riot, and for putting a target on Mike Pence’s back.”

That’s quite the claim, especially since Trump explicitly called for a peaceful march from the White House Ellipse, where he spoke, to the Capitol grounds, where a number of permitted events were planned and hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered. I spoke to some of them, several of whom had traveled great distances to make their voices heard.

They had no idea that a misguided few were planning to force their way into the Capitol, no matter what Trump said. All of them expressed shock and disgust that it happened. None of them condoned it, and neither did Trump, who later that day called on all the protesters to go home and the next day condemned those who fought with police and stormed the Capitol.

For some on the right, Trump’s calls for peace and order were too little, too late. They smacked of Biden’s weak denunciations of Black Lives Matter (BLM) violence this summer. But it’s one thing to say it was too little too late, or that Trump should have toned down his rhetoric, and quite another to claim that he incited the rioters and to convict him on that basis. The stakes are high here, so the standard for conviction must also be high.

So when McLaughlin says Trump is responsible for inciting the Capitol riot, what standard is he using? By his own admission, it’s not a legal standard, which requires specific intent to produce “imminent lawless action.” Is he saying Trump somehow knew what would happen when the protesters marched to the Capitol, even though it caught almost everyone else by surprise?

No, McLaughlin is using what we’ll call the “taken together” standard. He admits that no single thing Trump did or said after the election is an impeachable offense, but that his actions in the two months after the election taken together constitute a violation of his Oath of Office.

But this is really no standard at all—or rather it’s such a plastic standard it could be bent to fit just about any accusation of incitement or reckless endangerment, however far-fetched. You could even—as a group of Senate Democrats did last week—accuse Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley of having some part in the “insurrection” simply because they formally objected to the certification of the Electoral College vote and called for a commission to investigate election fraud. They might not be legally responsible, goes this argument, but their actions taken together mean they’re at least complicit in what transpired.

That’s nonsense. It boils down to arguing that because people feel strongly about elections, Trump should have toned down his criticism of election fraud because some radicals in his party might get crazy ideas about storming the Capitol. But if Trump really believes the election wasn’t fair, as millions of Americans do, he has a right, and arguably a duty, to speak out about it.

Democrats certainly have no compunction about speaking out (and sometimes taking direct action) about similarly explosive issues. Vice President Kamala Harris raised funds to bail out BLM arsonists and looters in Minneapolis. Should Congress hold her responsible for widespread destruction in that city over the summer?

Pelosi called federal officers in Portland “stormtroopers” back in July and said they “must be stopped” even as violent riots were shaking the city. Did she put federal officers in danger? (Former Attorney General William Barr thinks she might have.)

What about Biden himself? During a presidential debate, then-candidate Biden said Antifa was just an “idea” even as Antifa thugs were besieging the federal courthouse in Portland and attacking federal law enforcement officers there. Should he be impeached for “inciting” that “insurrection”?

Of course not. And neither should Trump.

In a way, all this boils down to whether one thinks concerns about election fraud are real or just a bunch of conspiracy theories that stupid people believe because Trump told them so. Democrats and the media, along with Big Tech and our entire elite class, believe the latter. They remind us of it constantly.

By contrast, Trump, Cruz, Hawley, and tens of millions of American believe the November election was riddled with voter fraud, illegal electioneering, unconstitutional interference from judges, and local election officials’ refusal to enforce state election laws.

The impossibility of bridging the gap between these two realities was captured well in a recent exchange between CNN’s Erin Burnett and Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York. At one point, Burnett said: “Those tens of millions of Americans think it wasn’t fair because Donald Trump told them that. And that voice of Donald Trump was amplified by other people in power, okay? Because the reason they don’t think it was fair is because someone told them it wasn’t fair. And it was fair.”

It’s hard to believe that Burnett really believes the only reason tens of millions of Americans think the election was unfair is because Trump said so, as if they’re all brainless rubes with no access to news or information about the election. But I’ll take her at her word, which represents the view of the entire corporate press, the Democratic Party, and vast swaths of the mainstream American left.

The problem with this view, besides the seething contempt it shows for half the country, is that it’s impossible to have a productive debate, much less come to a reasonable compromise, with someone who holds it. The November election was indeed marred by fraud and irregularities, the predictable results of loosening election-integrity laws and recklessly expanding mail-in voting. The pandemic was the perfect excuse to conduct what amounted to an unprecedented experiment with mass mail-in voting, and Democrats used it to their benefit. Those are facts.

Maybe it was enough to change the outcome of the election, maybe not. But for Democrats and the media to say there’s no reason whatsoever to talk about election integrity or draw attention to these issues by protesting, and that the only reason anyone is worried about it is because Trump told them a lie, is unserious in the extreme. It amounts to a refusal to engage with reality.

You Can’t Convict Trump Because You Think He Was Imprudent

Refusing to engage with reality is commonplace on the left, but the right should know better. Once you admit, as most conservatives have, that there were in fact major problems with election integrity in November, and that we’d better find out the extent of the problems and fix them so Americans can once again have confidence in our elections, you’ve also tacitly made the case that Trump was right to speak out about it.

You can think Trump went about his post-election grievance-airing in a tragic, self-destructive way, or that he should have pressed his case in a less caustic manner, but to say that he should be impeached and convicted because he didn’t press his case in just the way you prefer isn’t the application of any “standard,” much less a compelling reason to convict on something as grave as impeachment.

Reasonable people can disagree about how Trump reacted to the election and all that came after, just as they can disagree about the prudence of protesting at the Capitol on the day Congress certified the results of the Electoral College vote. I wouldn’t have gone to that protest, but I understand why others did, and I understand why Trump kept talking about election fraud, especially on that day.

McLaughlin says the Capitol riot “took direct aim at that central pillar of our American system.” Insofar as it concerns the riot, that’s true. But the peaceful protest Trump called for on Jan. 6 drew hundreds of thousands of Americans who marched to the U.S. Capitol not to storm it or change the results of the vote, but because they believe one of the central pillars of our American system—the peaceful transfer of power through free and fair elections—is rotting, and if we don’t fix it the whole house is going to come down.

Schumer Used Violent Rhetoric To Sic A Mob On Supreme Court Justices,"When Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., spoke against the constitutionality of the Democrats’ impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, he reminded his colleagues that Democrat elected officials had recently told their followers to attack Republicans. If Trump was to be impeached for asking followers to “peacefully and patriotically” make their voices heard by members of Congress on Jan. 6, what to do with Democrats’ more incendiary rhetoric and actions, he wondered.

Sen. Kamala Harris solicited funds to bail out the rioters who destroyed Minneapolis during 2020’s “Summer of Rage.” Rep. Maxine Waters called on Democrats to seek out Republicans in public places and “create a crowd” and “push back” on them to let them know “they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere.”

The Bernie Sanders supporter who nearly killed House Republican Whip Steve Scalise at a baseball field in Virginia said he was motivated to kill for “health care” after Sanders and other Democrats had said the Republican health care plan was to kill many Americans. Sen. Cory Booker told his supporters at one gathering in D.C. to “Please don’t just come here today and then go home. Go to the Hill today. Get up and, please, get up in the face of some congresspeople.”

One example Paul left out of his excellent speech is even more relevant to next week’s impeachment. Less than one year ago, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York led a mob on the steps of the Supreme Court while a case was being heard and tried to thwart the natural deliberation of justices by violently threatening two of them to rule in favor of his and other Democrats’ preferred outcome.

“I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions,” Schumer threatened the two most recently confirmed justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.

The threat was so alarming that even leftist activists such as Laurence Tribe condemned it. Schumer received a rare, same-day rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts, who said, “Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous.”

Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell condemned Schumer’s remarks as “astonishingly reckless and completely irresponsible.” However, Sen. Josh Hawley’s efforts to censure Schumer for his violent threats were scuttled.

The Washington Post write-up of Schumer’s threats focused instead on Republican opposition to them. “GOP seizes on Schumer’s remarks” read the headline.

Schumer’s threats came just 17 months after the Supreme Court had been besieged and attacked by abortion activists upset at Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Like the Jan. 6 event, the October 2018 siege also involved Vice President Mike Pence being condemned by protesters. As he walked down the steps of the U.S. Senate following the vote to confirm Kavanaugh, the crowd greeted him with chants of “shame!”

Across the street, hordes of protesters broke through a police barricade and attempted to beat down the 13-ton bronze doors of the court. Protesters included a topless woman with a Hitler mustache and another woman who scaled the Contemplation of Justice statue in front of the court and sat in her lap to the cheers of other protesters.

Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan, who attended Kavanaugh’s immediate swearing in, were hit with water bottles and tomatoes when their car left the court afterward. Some 164 people were arrested in that protest.

For all the concern about disruptions to the constitutional processes regarding Electoral College votes on Jan. 6, there was far less concern from corporate media and others on the left when Democrat mobs completely disrupted the constitutional proceedings for confirming a Supreme Court justice in 2018.

The Center for Popular Democracy brought 600 protesters to Washington, staging a demonstration in and around the Capitol. On August 1, 2018, following the group’s rally, 74 protesters were arrested when they blocked the Senate hallways to prevent Kavanaugh from meeting with U.S. senators.

Kavanaugh’s first day of hearings included 63 interruptions from Senate Democrats and more than 70 arrests of protesters. The protesters had been flown in by Planned Parenthood Action Fund from across the country.

Winnie Wong, a senior advisor to the Women’s March, explained their carefully coordinated messages. Members going into the hearing room were given “a script where we suggest certain messaging that may resonate more.” The storytellers’ travel and accommodations were paid for, as were their legal aid and bail if they were arrested, which was generally the goal.

Later in the hearings, the organizers of the protesters—the Women’s March and the Center for Popular Democracy— were warning activists that being arrested three times might lead to a night in jail. The group raised sums of more than six figures to finance the protests. “This is well-organized and scripted,” said Wong, “This isn’t chaos.”

Protesters also occupied senators’ offices, managed to shut down the Capitol building, and trapped senators in elevators. All of this was done to disrupt the constitutional process for confirming a justice.

“We were planning to shut down the Capitol Building but the authorities were so scared of this #WomensWave that they shut it down for us,” read a tweet from one activist group:

Particularly by the standard adopted by the media and Democrats for the second impeachment of Trump, Schumer bears responsibility for the protests and riots at the Supreme Court and in Senate office buildings, as well as the attempt to destroy the life and family and reputation of Kavanaugh. Within 23 minutes of Kavanaugh’s nomination, Schumer said, “I will oppose Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination with everything I have.”

His destruction, during the Gorsuch confirmation process, of the filibuster for Supreme Court justices contributed to the heated rhetoric in the Kavanaugh battle. His refusal to treat the nomination as legitimate included a prohibition on Democrat meetings with Kavanaugh.

Schumer didn’t trust Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein to handle the political machinations he felt were needed. He organized the barrage of interruptions from other senators that led to the hostility and chaos of the first day of hearings.

Sen. Christopher Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, later told Politico, “It was important that we lay down a marker that this is not a normal hearing.” Sen. Dick Durbin said they wanted to “single out the hearing as something unusual.” Sen. John Cornyn was appalled by the spectacle. He decried the “mob rule” that was disrupting the hearings.

Schumer also said Kavanaugh had no presumption of innocence. He believed outrageous conspiracy theories. For instance, when Michael Avenatti’s client Julie Swetnick claimed — with no evidence in support and plenty of evidence in opposition — that Kavanaugh was a serial gang rapist who had roamed the streets of suburban Maryland for his prey, Schumer demanded the allegations be accepted as true and that Kavanaugh’s nomination be pulled.

Democrats’ argument in favor of Trump’s impeachment is that even though he told his protesters to be peaceful, his refusal to accept the 2020 election incited a mob. What to do, then, with a Senate majority leader who issued a violent threat against Supreme Court justices after a multi-year campaign to undermine confidence in Supreme Court confirmation processes?

What to do with the many senators who brought the mobs into hearing rooms and Senate buildings in order to destroy the confirmation process? What to do with the mob’s many attacks on Kavanaugh and his family?

And how to take seriously a Senate that never held Kavanaugh’s false accusers to account, never censured the now-majority leader for issuing violent threats while a court case was being heard, and never held Democrats accountable for assisting the mobs who attempted to shut down their proceedings?",https://thefederalist.com/2021/02/03/chuck-schumer-used-violent-rhetoric-to-sic-a-mob-on-two-supreme-court-justices/,2021-02-03
Washington Post Journalists Need To Protest Deplatforming By Jeff Bezos,"Washington Post employees should vehemently protest their owner and his flagship company for eroding norms of free expression.

Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s famous founder and CEO, owns The Washington Post, a news outlet presumably staffed by people with an interest in preserving a culture of free expression given that it makes their journalism possible. Bezos is allowing Amazon’s corporate might to deplatform Ryan T. Anderson, a perfectly mainstream conservative writer who researches transgenderism with nuance and compassion.

Amazon recently yanked Anderson’s popular 2018 book “When Harry Became Sally: Responding To The Transgender Movement” from its digital shelves. The company sought to stack the deck against Abigail Shrier’s “Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters” last summer as well.

In effect, corporate executives operating under Bezos’s leadership are categorizing reasonable, good-faith arguments on one side of a contentious and consequential political issue as bigotry. They’re also using that egregious and offensive definition of bigotry to purge dissent from their powerful and massive platforms. (As Christina Hoff Sommers points out, they’re also doing that unevenly.)

It’s not just that Amazon is blocking Anderson’s access to the world’s largest book store. As one of the world’s most powerful corporations, Amazon is using its power to erode our norms of free expression, narrowing the boundaries of acceptable speech to one side of hotly-contested political debate.

Why does it matter? The free exchange of ideas is how journalists and readers sort fact from fiction, hold powerful people like Bezos to account, and work through good and bad. Corporate executives should not make those decisions for us.

People can debate market share and monopolies, but wherever you land on those questions, this corporate conduct is morally wrong. It’s defensible only if you accept that Anderson and the perspective he represents is objectively bigoted and then also accept that corporations should make those decisions.

I’m entirely sympathetic to the argument that private business owners should have the freedom to decide what they sell, like Jack Phillips. This isn’t an argument against that. This is an argument against the mentality that drives corporate executives to categorize reasonable people as bigots, which leads to harmful deplatforming, unjust personal and professional consequences, and dangerously one-sided debates moderated by oligarchs.

It’s also an argument that free expression is essential, even when it’s difficult or painful, in order to sharpen our policies and ideas. That’s why it’s been our norm for decades.

The journalists who work for Bezos know that. They benefit from it daily. It’s not just about precedent, it’s about principle, and as a matter of principle, journalists who work for Bezos should oppose and protest Amazon’s enforcement of political deplatforming and narrowed speech boundaries. It’s wrong and dangerous.

This oligarchical manipulation of speech norms should be especially irksome to members of the fourth estate whose paychecks ultimately come from Bezos.

"No, Johnson Didn’t Promote A ‘Conspiracy Theory’ About The Capitol Riot","“Facts are stubborn things,” John Adams famously said as the lawyer defending the British soldiers involved in the 1770 Boston Massacre, “and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.”

More than 250 years later, The Federalist provided an eyewitness account of events outside the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol. From the Washington Post to Whoopi Goldberg, members of the chattering class tried to alter the state of facts and evidence they didn’t like.

As the Post headlined the day before the Feb. 23 hearing, “at stake” was “the story of the Capitol riot, and who is responsible.” The hearing, the Post reported, could devolve into “a battleground for competing narratives over what prompted the riot and who was responsible for it.”

Federal Prosecutors Confirm the Violence Was Planned

The prevailing narrative was that the violence was the spontaneous action of hordes of Donald Trump supporters incited into insurrection by the then-president’s rambling speech. That narrative collapsed weeks later.

Federal prosecutors issued indictments alleging that the Capitol raid was, indeed, a conspiracy planned in advance. FBI investigators agreed. Prosecutors say that elements of the criminal conspiracy began as early as November 3, 2020.

At the Senate hearing, current and former top U.S. Capitol security officials gave similar assessments, saying that “wide-ranging intelligence failures” prevented detection of what became a “military-style, coordinated assault.” Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who co-chaired the hearing, concluded, “This was a planned insurrection.”

The Federalist article said that from the beginning, on Jan. 14. I was the eyewitness who wrote it.

Johnson Enters the Article into the Senate Record

Sen. Ron Johnson read extensively from the article, summarizing it in parts, during the hearing. The Wisconsin Republican asked that the full text be entered into the official record. The Federalist article was accepted without objection from senators of either party. The eyewitness account was now officially evidence for the Senate investigation.

Johnson was one of the first senators to suspect that the riot had been planned. In The Federalist article, I identified four groups that appeared to have planned for violence well in advance.

Video of the hearing shows Johnson saying, “He [Waller] describes four different types of people: plainclothes militants, agents provocateurs, fake Trump protesters, and then disciplined, uniformed column of attackers. I think that these are the people that probably planned this.”

Johnson accurately related what I wrote in The Federalist article. That was a faithful summary of my exact description of the four organized groups of operatives I witnessed before the violence began in the Capitol:

Plainclothes militants. Militant, aggressive men in Donald Trump and MAGA gear at a front police line at the base of the temporary presidential inaugural platform; Agents-provocateurs. Scattered groups of men exhorting the marchers to gather closely and tightly toward the center of the outside of the Capitol building and prevent them from leaving; Fake Trump protesters. A few young men wearing Trump or MAGA hats backwards and who did not fit in with the rest of the crowd in terms of their actions and demeanor, whom I presumed to be Antifa or other leftist agitators; and Disciplined, uniformed column of attackers. A column of organized, disciplined men, wearing similar but not identical camouflage uniforms and black gear, some with helmets and GoPro cameras or wearing subdued Punisher skull patches.

The Fact Too Terrible to Be Told

Three of those descriptions would not have been controversial. But one of them was too inconvenient for some people to bear: the fact that, during the march along Constitution Avenue from the White House to the Capitol, I saw furtive, small groups of left-wingers wearing Trump-supporting attire.

“I presumed these fake Trump protesters were Antifa or something similar. However, that entire afternoon I saw none of them act aggressively or cause any problems. At least, not from my vantage point,” I wrote. I didn’t know then that a notorious leftist from Utah had been at the vanguard of the fatal attempt to smash down the door to the House chamber and ran through the Capitol screaming that it should be burned down.

That didn’t matter to a lot of the journalists covering Johnson’s comments. To them, the fact that I had seen “fake Trump protesters” before the riot was a fact that had to be discredited and destroyed, before it could even be evaluated.

New Narrative: It’s a ‘Ridiculous Conspiracy Theory’

And so began a new narrative to recover the old: That Johnson and others were pushing a fake story to exculpate right-wing extremists and blame it all on left-wingers. That false narrative became international “news.”

Then came the gush of headlines, with reporting of equal caliber, exaggerating and distorting what I wrote and what Johnson accurately said, and accusing the senator of spreading a false, ridiculous, extreme, baseless conspiracy theory:

CNN: “Ron Johnson just dropped a ridiculous conspiracy theory at the Senate Capitol attack hearing,” by CNN Editor-at-Large Chris Cillizza;

New York Daily News: “Sen. Ron Johnson airs conspiracy theory about ‘fake Trump supporters’ in Senate hearing on Capitol riot,” by Dave Goldiner;

Washington Post: “Ron Johnson’s extreme effort to distance Trump supporters from the Capitol Riot,” by Aaron Blake (who tried to discredit me by deploying a 12-year-old quote from the former head of my place of employment);

Huffington Post: “Senator Ron Johnson Defends Capitol Rioters During Hearing,” by Matt Fuller;

Daily Beast: “Johnson Pushes Deranged ‘Fake Trump Supporters’ Theory During Capitol Riot Hearing,” with the topic “Gaslighter-In-Chief” by a “Breaking News Intern”;

Washington Examiner: “Ron Johnson shares dubious article blaming ‘fake Trump protesters’ and ‘provocateurs’ for Capitol riot,” by Haley Victory Smith (and we know why she took the “dubious” swipe at The Federalist);

Boston Globe: “Senator Johnson pushes false claim that insurrectionists on Jan. 6 were ‘fake Trump protesters’ during hearing,” by Amanda Kaufman and Christina Prignano;

The Independent of London: “Who is Ron Johnson? The pro-Trump senator sharing conspiracy theories about Capitol assault,” by Alex Woodward;

Daily Mail of London: “Republican Ron Johnson makes conspiracy theory claims at Senate hearing on riot that anti-Trump ‘agents provocateur’ incited violence and police fired tear gas on ‘pro-police, jovial’ mob,” by Geoff Earle.

There you have it: A rash of fake news, whipped up in a jiffy.

To his credit, Earle from the Daily Mail, unlike the “quality” media, did try to contact me before running the story and I didn’t receive the message in time. The next day we spoke at length and he wrote an updated article with the lively headline, “Chuck Schumer blasts Republican Ron Johnson for spreading ‘mindless garbage’ about ‘fake Trump protesters starting the Capitol riots.’”

The Washington Post’s Aaron Blake, who did read The Federalist article, did not bother to call me, as a professional journalist would do. So I called him out on Twitter and corrected his error that I blamed the leftists.

Blake tweeted back a single line: “Please tell me where I said you blamed them solely.” I answered, “Your entire premise was that I blamed anti-Trump people for the January 6 violence. You are wrong. You never even bothered to clarify anything with me prior to writing your ‘analysis.’ You lied.” That’s the last I heard from that Washington Post blogger.

Not that it matters, but even Vanity Fair had something to say, with Bess Levin headlining her Levin Report: “Republican lawmaker Ron Johnson: Capitol rioters were actually Democrats disguised as Trump supporters.”

Then the wise sages of popular culture began offering their thoughtful critiques. Actor Rob Reiner, the Lincoln Project donor most famous as “Meathead” from Archie Bunker, tweeted that Johnson “bald faced lied.” On ABC’s “The View,” Whoopi Goldberg called Johnson’s reading of The Federalist a lot of “boo hoo.”

Someone Got It Right

Only one mainstream journalist, veteran reporter Craig Gilbert of the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, got the story right:

At a Senate hearing on the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson defended the Trump supporters gathered that day as overwhelmingly pro-police and suggested a small group of ‘provocateurs’ turned unsuspecting marchers into an invading mob. Johnson also suggested Tuesday that police actions — firing tear gas into the crowd — altered the psychology of a previously peaceful gathering, turning pro-law enforcement demonstrators against the police.

Gilbert then quoted from this writer’s Jan. 14 article in The Federalist. For the record, the editorial position of the Milwaukee paper is strongly critical of Johnson. Gilbert the newsman told both sides of the story and reported the context without omitting or twisting key facts.

Such good journalism shouldn’t be too much to ask. But it isn’t as titillating as conspiracy theories.

BLM Protestors Trap Customers Inside Grocery Store On Anniversary Of Daniel Prude’s Death,"More than 200 Black Lives Matter protestors trapped customers inside a Wegmans grocery store in Rochester, New York on Tuesday afternoon.

The incident comes a year after a black man named Daniel Prude died after an altercation with the Rochester Police Department. Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James said in February that no charges would be filed against the officers involved. Activists in attendance repeatedly yelled Prude’s name.

“In the course of the investigation, the Office of the Attorney General concluded that there was sufficient evidence surrounding Mr. Prude’s death to warrant presenting the case to a grand jury,” the attorney general said in a statement.

BLM protestors can be seen in several videos formed in a mob outside of the Wegmans, chanting. Demonstrations are also happening across the city.

“Wegmans is a system that upholds white supremacy,” Ashley Gantt said, a leader of the organization Free the People Rochester, that set up Tuesday’s disturbance.

“Allowing the mob to shut down the East Ave [Wegmans], trapping at least a hundred people, is an immoral failing by the mayor at @CityRochesterNY and the @RochesterNYPD,” tweeted reporter Bob Lonsberry, who was at the riot. ” “To kiss the a-s of the mob, the rights of others are trodden, and the city dies even more.”

According to Democrat & Chronicle reporter Justin Murphy, shoppers have not been able to leave the grocery store. Activists are drawing with chalk outside the store and ordering pizza. The mob can also be seen arguing with customers who initially came to Wegmans to shop for their groceries.

The radicals are marching to show their frustration over the death of Prude. The 41-year-old instructed officers to give him their gun and was physically restrained for two minutes, before losing consciousness and going to the hospital.

Prude was resuscitated en route to the hospital. The Monroe County Medical Examiner’s Office “listed the cause of Prude’s death as ‘complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint due to excited delirium due to acute phencyclidine intoxication,’ an indication that Prude might have been high on PCP,” according to WXXI News.

The police report states:

[The paramedic] stated that the observations of the subject were that he could be experiencing ‘excited delirium,’ which she described as a condition in which the subject is experiencing agitation and aggression; increased heart rate and respiration; overheating — which she stated would explain the subject being naked on a night when temperatures were around 32 degrees and mixed snow and precipitation — sweating, flushed appearance; excessive strength, a high tolerance for pain and incoherent speech.

According to the most recent update by WXXI News, this is an ongoing situation, and protestors are still gathered outside the Wegmans.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/03/23/blm-protestors-trap-customers-inside-grocery-store-on-anniversary-of-daniel-prudes-death/,2021-03-23
Morally Bankrupt Left Wants You To Forget About The Summer Of Riots,"A CNN article titled “What Jim Crow looks like in 2021” by columnist Nicole Hemmer last Friday perfectly encapsulates the left’s tactical lawlessness and disorder gaslighting. “And while it may still wear a suit and tie,” Hemmer wrote, claiming Jim Crow is alive and well, “it also still marches hand in hand with both state violence and mob violence, as we were once again reminded during the insurrection at the Capitol.”

Aside from making the astounding and flat-out false claim that Republicans are similar to segregationists for opposing a bill that would eliminate election security, Hemmer’s piece reiterates one of the Democratic Party’s favorite talking points: that the GOP is supposedly composed of white supremacists broadly committing violence, while the virtuous left peacefully protests in the name of social justice. This is an evil lie.

Anyone with two eyes knows what went down last summer in response to the death of George Floyd. Data sets first reported by Axios in September estimated that the Black Lives Matter and Antifa rioting and looting carried a price tag of as much as $2 billion. This effectively makes the 20 states where it occurred the carriers for the most expensive manmade insurance damage in U.S. history, ahead of the Los Angeles riots of 1992 after the acquittal of four officers for beating Rodney King.

On June 1 alone, the Washington, D.C. police arrested more than 300 BLM and Antifa activists. According to Metropolitan Police Department data, D.C. police arrested more than five times as many protesters compared to the 61 arrests for the Capitol riot on the day it occurred, which corporate media insisted was the result of law enforcement actively encouraging “white supremacy,” a charge not grounded in reality.

Nevertheless, the media side-stepped per usual to construct a baseless plot that fit its preferred narrative that any social justice demonstration, regardless of the outcome, is a moral one. Hemmer and her morally bankrupt allies are under the impression that the Capitol breach was an “insurrection,” whereas the modest estimate of $1 to 2 billion in property damage due to BLM and Antifa riots can best be described as “mostly peaceful” or “non-violent.”

A report from Politico on Tuesday said what right-leaning media knew for months — but what all of America needs to hear. The supposed insurrectionists who participated in the unruly Capitol breach have overwhelmingly been charged with trespassing.

“The prospect of dozens of Jan. 6 rioters cutting deals for minor sentences could be hard to explain for the Biden administration, which has characterized the Capitol Hill mob as a uniquely dangerous threat,” writes Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney.

“That reckoning is coming sooner rather than later, lawyers say, putting prosecutors in the position of wrist-slapping many participants in the riot despite framing the crimes as part of an insurrection that presented a grave threat to American democracy,” the reporters add.

The corporate media has overwhelmingly pushed the opposite narrative, in addition to its trivializing of the clear facts that leftist activists committed far worse acts for far longer — such as burning down police stations, using $35 million to bail out sex offenders and other criminals, and killing innocent children.

“Activists in DC said they were shocked that a deadly assault on the heart of American democracy led to far fewer people in police custody than the clashes that erupted during protests over law enforcement brutality,” said one CNN article. “The Capitol attack was also deadlier than the summer protests.”

“For months, Republicans have used last summer’s protests as a political catchall, highlighting isolated instances of property destruction and calls to defund the police to motivate their base in November,” the New York Times said.

“The vast majority of demonstrations were peaceful and leading BLM activists repeatedly distanced themselves from agent provocateurs and instigators,” ABC claimed. “Non-violent protesters during the summer faced brute force from federal officers, but rioters were met with minimal federal response.”

“Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough on MSNBC mostly reiterated this doublespeak in February, claiming the billion-dollar BLM vandalizing is not equatable in magnitude to the one-day Capitol breach. “I know there are idiots on other cable news channels that will say, ‘Well, this mom-and-pop store was vandalized during the summer riots and that’s just as bad as the United States Capitol being vandalized.’ No. No, actually no, jack-sses, it’s not,” Scarborough said. “I’m not going to confuse a taco stand with the United States Capitol.”

Scarborough is contrarily spot-on about the fact that what happened at the Capitol cannot be equated to the summer of BLM and Antifa rioting and looting. The latter was significantly worse. Five people died at the Capitol, of which at least two died from natural causes. According to a running list, there have been 32 BLM and Antifa riot-associated deaths, meaning CNN’s claim that the “Capitol attack was also deadlier than the summer protests” is a bald-faced lie.

Victims of the deadly summer riots include David Dorn, a black retired police officer who was shot and killed when he tried to protect a pawnshop during a break-in, 8-year-old Secoriea Turner killed in Atlanta by armed rioters, and 24-year-old mother Jessica Doty-Whitaker murdered while walking by an armed group of BLM rioters who yelled at her to join in their chanting. They also include 38-year-old Christopher Beaty, a black male in Indianapolis trying to stop a group of militant teenagers from looting, and 50-year-old Marvin Francois, who was shot when two rioters jumped on his Jeep out of nowhere. This only touches the surface of the tragedies.

There is no competition between what happened in D.C. versus what happened across the country for months on end. All violence ought to be denounced, but the left has operated in an eerie vacuum since the beginning of the BLM riots — attempting to claim a moral high ground and telling the American people that their actions were for a noble cause.

Standing before a building on fire in Minneapolis in May, for instance, MSNBC anchor Ali Velshi committed a brazen act of journalistic malfeasance.

“I want to be clear in how I characterize this,” Velshi said, as the flames stoked behind him and the mob responsible watched. “This is mostly a protest. It is not generally speaking unruly.”

The left’s immorality continued to be on full display. CNN national correspondent Omar Jimenez stood before the enflamed streets of Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August after the shooting of Jacob Blake while the chyron read, “Fiery But Mostly Peaceful Protests After Police Shooting.”

The reality is that all of the lies, the gaslighting, the manipulation of truth — it all boils down to the left’s quest for total control over the information you take in and your resulting worldview. To our ruling class, BLM and Antifa are just an “idea” and not composed of domestic terrorists working to unravel our social fabric (which they are).

“They will come into our schools, they come into our churches, they will come into our social media, our place of employment, our private company, our home, and our family,” Federalist Senior Editor Chris Bedford writes of the left. “The real question is: How far will we let them come? Because no one else is going to stand up for us.”

The corporate media thinks you are stupid. They think you will roll over and play nice and sing hallelujah because Joe Biden is president and he is promising “unity.” After all, isn’t it a “time to heal?” Since elites in the morally bankrupt Zoom cubicles of corporate America will not stand for truth, it is up to you to do so.

Chris Hayes Dismisses Routine Left-Wing Riots To Portray Double Standard In Protest Policing,"MSNBC prime time host Chris Hayes painted a double-standard in riot policing Wednesday night with depictions of law enforcement clearing a peaceful Colorado vigil last summer compared to Capitol rioters allowed to walk right through the complex past several checkpoints in January.

“Just look for a moment at the utter inversion of what happened on the steps of the Capitol in January,” Hayes said. “There was hardly any police presence at all … There was relatively speaking, no one there.”

Hayes spoke on the heels of a new report from Capitol Police inspector general which documented broad failures among top law enforcement officers faulting officials for inadequate preparedness and orders to stand down as the virulent mob overwhelmed the ill-equipped force left to defend the complex.

“The report finds the Capitol Police were warned three days before the threat,” Hayes said. “They were specifically warned and they did not prepare. They did not prepare the way they prepare for just about every protest we’ve seen police at.”

Hayes charged the lack of preparedness as another product of racism, glossing over the fact repeated outbursts of political violence for much of the prior 12 months had come from militant social justice warriors and not armed Trump supporters.

While Hayes called the protests on the Capitol were called an “insurrection,” his monologue failed to mention the armed, prolonged assault on a federal courthouse in Portland that lasted for weeks and injured hundreds of officers last year. That same courthouse was attacked again in March.

On whether the Capitol police should have been more prepared, agreement is nearly universal. But when comparing the events at the Capitol this year to 2020’s summer of rage, Hayes exemplifies the double-standard often applied.

Hayes’ claim Capitol rioters were met with police pacifism compared to the millions protesting for supposed social justice last year is pure gaslighting, and ignores the routine outbursts of domestic terrorism that swept the nation’s cities for months on end, all provoked by leftist deceptions of white supremacy.

In Minneapolis, police retreated from their precinct building. Rioters burned it down while a reporter from Hayes’ own network characterized the carnage on air behind him as “mostly a protest,” that is “not, generally speaking, unruly.”

Just this week, demonstrators in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center danced atop police cars in the middle of the street as a new wave of chaos retraumatized a city still recovering from last year’s devastating riots. The Sunday spectacle, which came after the fatal police shooting of 20-year-old Duante Wright, who was black, marked the first of three more consecutive nights of rioting in the Twin Cities to preview another summer of rage.

Hayes did address the violence of last year’s riots, only to dismiss them as isolated incidents among the nationwide protests which pulled millions to the streets.

“It is true, we should be clear, that there are examples, they are documented, you can find video, of violence by those and other protesters, examples of lawlessness and property damage throughout the country in the context of tens of thousands of protesters,” Hayes said, but emphasized, “only a small percentage of people were violent.”

The map below, however, shows no small population of riotous demonstrators who devasted communities in nearly 220 locations across the country. These were all before Jacob Blake was shot in Kenosha, Wis., the week of the Republican National Convention (RNC) which sparked another outburst of terrorism across the nation. At the end of the RNC, Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul and his wife were ambushed as he left the White House.

The destruction left behind just within the two weeks after George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody last summer totaled 66 times more than the damage at the Capitol in January.

Meanwhile, not all police at the Capitol acted as mere bystanders. Many present at the Capitol that day, including both police and protestors were injured, and one was even killed.

In the fatal shooting of rioter Ashli Babbitt, another double-standard persists where the identity of the officer who shot her remains unknown. In any other highly publicized shooting, the name of the officer involved is almost immediately revealed regardless of whether circumstances justified the use of force. Yet, more than four months later, the identity of Babbitt’s shooter is under lock and key.

Characteristically, in what has become more common among the American elite, Hayes’ coverage appears to place a far higher priority on the offices of politicians than the small businesses down the street torn apart by the rioters, because the owners were complicit in white supremacy, or something.

Yes, the Capitol Police should have been better prepared for a day of protest in Washington D.C. It’s tragic they weren’t. Police leadership was rightly fired. But the fact is, scenes of political eruption are intensely chaotic, and the actions of the Capitol Police on a single day don’t represent the bias Hayes proclaimed with cherry-picked footage to advance a preconceived narrative.

Maxine Waters: ‘I’m Not Going To Be Bullied’ For Telling Protestors To Get ‘Confrontational’,"On Monday, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., defended her inciting rhetoric Saturday night urging protestors to riot if former police officer Derek Chauvin is not found guilty for the murder of George Floyd.

Waters blamed Republicans for trying to make her calls for violence to “fit their message and their cause for denouncing us and denying us.” “Any time they see an opportunity to seize on a word, so they do it and they send a message to all of the white supremacists, the KKK, the Oath Keepers, the [Proud] Boys and all of that …,” Waters said. “This is a time for [Republicans] to keep telling our constituents that [Democrats] are the enemy and they do that time and time again. But that does not deter me from speaking truth to power. I am not intimidated. I am not afraid, and I do what needs to be done.”

Waters was sounding off after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., demanded House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., take action “against this dangerous rhetoric.”

In a video of Waters’ appearance in Brooklyn Center, she told protestors, “We’ve got to stay on the street, and we’ve got to get more active, we’ve got to get more confrontational. We’ve got to make sure that they know that we mean business.”

As reported by a New York Times reporter, Waters plans to remain in Minnesota until the verdict is delivered in the case. Closing arguments are expected today.

On Sunday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., announced she will put forth a measure to expel Waters from Congress after her comments.

“Very soon I’ll be introducing a resolution to expel Rep. Maxine Waters from Congress for her continual incitement of violence on innocent American people. Rep Waters is a danger to our society,” Greene wrote in a statement. “After traveling across state lines to incite riots, her orders recorded on video last night at the Brooklyn Center, directly led to more violence and a drive by shooting on National Guardsmen in Minnesota early this morning.”

Waters has a history of calling for violence. This is yet another incident in which the congresswoman has encouraged rioting, to which the left has remained silent.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/04/19/maxine-waters-im-not-going-to-be-bullied-for-telling-protestors-to-get-confrontational/,2021-04-19
The Left Now Knows That Threatening To Riot Works,"On April 21, America held its collective breath. When the news broke that the jury in the murder trial of Derek Chauvin had arrived at a verdict, the fate of the nation’s cities was hanging in the balance. As the boarded-up storefronts in urban areas and suburbs from coast to coast showed, there was little doubt that if a Minneapolis jury didn’t produce the verdicts many people wanted, riots would ensue.

When Judge Peter Cahill read the verdicts, the nation heaved a sigh of relief. The conviction on all three counts against the former Minneapolis police officer — second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree murder — for the death of George Floyd, means Chauvin faces up to 40 years in prison. But more was at stake in the trial than just his future.

The widespread outrage generated by the appalling nine-minute video that depicted Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck set off a summer of “mostly peaceful” protests orchestrated by the Black Lives Matter movement. The BLM movement and advocates of critical race theory about “white privilege” used Floyd’s death at the hands of a white cop to justify their assertions that not only was there an epidemic of police shootings of black men but that America was guilty of institutional racism.

The demonstrations they orchestrated in response to the case transformed Floyd into a martyr for civil rights. Millions attended demonstrations in the weeks and months that followed. Hundreds of these “mostly peaceful” protests around the country turned into riots in which neighborhoods were burned. Stores were looted, resulting in casualties and deaths involving law enforcement personnel and civilians.

Democrats Keep the Anger Churning

Worries about more riots should Chauvin be acquitted were not theoretical. Threats from activists and politicians demanding a conviction had created an atmosphere in which anything less than a guilty verdict would have been used as an excuse for more rioting.

President Joe Biden said he was praying for “the right verdict.” Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., told demonstrators to “get more confrontational” with police if the Chauvin jurors didn’t give them what they demanded. Not long after, some protesters committed a drive-by shooting of National Guardsmen in the area to protect against riots. Indeed, Waters was chided by Judge Cahill for having given the Chauvin defense possible grounds for appeal although he denied a motion for a mistrial.

But thanks to the Chauvin jury, that nightmare was not repeated on the evening of April 21. There had been some justified fears that riots might occur even if the former cop was convicted. But as it turned out, the reaction to the verdict was one of general jubilation. Celebrations, rather than angry demonstrations, were held around the country.

Biden weighed in with rhetoric about the trial being a “reckoning” and a “wake-up call” for the nation. Vice President Kamala Harris also claimed what happened to Floyd, who died after being arrested for passing a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, epitomized the truth about widespread racial injustice in the United States.

Despite nonstop claims that the United States is an irredeemably racist society, the feeling that the system had worked to punish someone who had committed an egregious act produced happiness, not more anger. While those intent on keeping the anger churning, like former President Barack Obama and various BLM activists, sought to dispel any idea that the verdict should inspire confidence in American justice rather than serve as a reason for more protests, it was hard for even the most determined race-baiter to dispel the good feelings the verdict produced.

For those living in neighborhoods that were torched or looted last summer — like many in Minneapolis — there were expressions of relief about the threat of violence and unrest having been averted. But the fact that violence wasn’t the result this time,shouldn’t inspire confidence that last summer’s riots were a one-off that won’t be repeated.

Police shootings, however justified they might have been, in Atlanta and Kenosha, Wisconsin also provoked riots last summer. And only a week before a jury convicted Chauvin in Minneapolis, a police shooting of Duante Wright led to the violence which Waters had helped cheer on.

The Chauvin verdict was not the first time in the last year riots had been forestalled, not by cooler heads prevailing, but because those who might have rioted had gotten what they wanted. That was true last November when the same storefronts were boarded up throughout the country in anticipation of violence had Donald Trump won the presidential election.

Riots Are the New Norm

We now know that any time the BLM movement can highlight a case that they think proves their point about racism, whether accurate or not, riots will follow. As the aftermath of the presidential race proved, the same may be true of the outcomes of elections.

In Minneapolis, the possibility of riots had hung over the trial from the beginning. Indeed, the agitation for Chauvin’s conviction — regardless of how heartrending the dismal spectacle that unfolded in the videotape of Floyd’s death might have been — resembled the way Jim Crow racists intimidated juries into acquitting those accused of killing blacks.

The events of the past year have proven that in post-George Floyd America, political violence over anything that can be claimed to prove racism is something to be expected, rather than a shocking occurrence. Indeed, it’s those instances where riots don’t follow, like the Chauvin trial outcome, that are the outliers.

Democrats are content to excuse or rationalize riots when they occur, as happened throughout last summer when the mainstream media tried to claim they were “mostly peaceful.” They are actively opposing efforts, like the law passed by Florida to increase the penalties for rioting while still preserving the right to peacefully protest.

Protests are a justified reaction to the way most of those who engaged in the BLM violence either weren’t charged or got off lightly after being bailed out by funds supported by Biden and Harris. The fact that the same people rationalizing BLM riots are still demonizing the pro-Trump mob that took part in the Capitol riot and demanding that they be convicted on serious charges think left-wing rioters should get a pass illustrates their hypocrisy and lack of principle.

While Americans were pleased to avoid another round of riots over Floyd’s death, it’s obvious that riots or the threat of them, are now a permanent feature of American life. Going forward, anytime an incident that can be framed, either fairly or not as racist, or a trial produces an unpopular verdict, or the left loses power, riots are likely.

Even if Chauvin deserved to be convicted, no one should be happy about the way the trial confirmed again that we are now living in a country where political violence is no longer considered beyond the pale.

How Religion Influenced Modern Economics,"“One of the fundamental elements of the spirit of modern capitalism,” German sociologist Max Weber wrote in his landmark 1905 book, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, “of rational conduct on the basis of the idea of the calling, was born from the spirit of Christian asceticism.”

Weber attributed the free-market success so prevalent amongst Protestant societies to its origins in Calvinist predestinarian theology: believers could never know for sure whether they had been saved, but material success portended well for their prospects of eternal salvation, so they might as well earn and save money.

Benjamin Friedman, a longtime Harvard economist, has absorbed the Weberian explanatory spirit and reshaped it for the modern age in Religion and the Rise of Capitalism, his new book exploring the interplay between economic and religious ideologies. Friedman’s central contention, that “our ideas about economics and economic policy have long-standing roots in religious thinking,” permeates his treatment of Adam Smith, the progenitor of modern economics, and his ideological descendants, especially in the United States.

While his analysis is detailed and compelling, his key arguments are susceptible to blind spots, including the contemporary, and possibly lasting, dissociation of American religious observance from enthusiasm for the free market.

Self-Interest as a Virtue

In the 17th and 18th centuries, self-interest was widely disdained as vicious, not virtuous. Acquisitiveness and luxury became associated with immorality, especially in the wake of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the bursting of the South Sea bubble in 1720. Mercantilism ruled the day, with its focus on preserving monopoly power and favoring producers over consumers. Even David Hume, who, alongside Smith, would eventually midwife capitalism, disparaged self-interest in his early work.

“This avidity alone,” Hume wrote in 1739, “of acquiring goods and possessions for ourselves and our nearest friends, is insatiable, perpetual, universal, and directly destructive of society.”

But this fierce opposition to self-interest slowly began to change. Friedman traces Smith’s groundbreaking insights—that “private initiative, undertaken for no reason other than to advance a person’s own economic interest, can nonetheless end up making other people better off too”; that “the setting in which such beneficial consequences would follow was the market economy”; and that “the mechanism that delivered this outcome was competition”—to the development of the Moderate faction of the Church of Scotland following the 1707 Act of Union and to 17th-century French Catholic theologians.

The Moderates’ “notions of divine benevolence and their benign view of human character” aligned with and arguably inspired Smith’s thinking. Although he never directly acknowledged the link, Smith shared cultural and intellectual space with these thinkers. Vigorously disputing the dour and forbidding Calvinist-Presbyterian-Puritan notion of predestination and original sin, the Moderates embraced a fundamentally positive view of human nature, and, Friedman argues, “Smith and his contemporaries were secularizing the essential substance of their clerical friends’ theological principles.”

Meanwhile, those like the 17th-century priest Pierre Nicole, influenced by the Jansenist school of French Catholicism, who believed that “there is nothing so resembling the effects of Charity, as those of self-love,” likewise softened the ground in which a beneficent variety of self-interest could take root. Again, while Smith never cites Nicole, the latter’s books were taught in English translation in Glasgow when the former studied there.

Smith’s development of his earlier philosophical advances in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, including a prototype of his “invisible hand” theory, emerged from this miasma of theological thought, according to Friedman. Deploying self-interest in a near-automatic way to benefit all of society reflected these earlier beliefs.

“The role of markets and competition became an ongoing way of setting one person’s economic interest against another’s,” Friedman contends, in order to “not only restrain them both, but at the same time harness the energy and initiative to which each person’s self-interest gives rise, in such a way as to achieve some common purpose” (emphasis in original).

Indeed, Smith synthesized his earlier thoughts into his 1776 masterpiece The Wealth of Nations, where he famously posited that “it is not from the benevolence of the butcher, or the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.” This sensibility, Friedman posits reflects the religious concept of “humans as morally conscious agents, with free will and choice” who autonomously “determine whether they are saved or not.” As such, Smith’s economic thinking represented a rejection of the predestinarian theology of the Presbyterians, who were rapidly falling out of favor in Scotland and elsewhere.

Economics in America

Similarly, the American colonies in the 18th century slowly came to eschew the orthodox Puritan belief in original sin in favor of a philosophy of free choice. “This uncomfortable doctrine” of Calvinist determinism, the Methodist preacher John Wesley proclaimed following a 1736 missionary visit to the Georgia colony, “directly tends to destroy our Zeal for Good Works [and] our Love to the greater Part of Mankind.”

After Harvard College trended too heavily away from rigorous Puritanism, Cotton Mather and others famously founded Yale—only to see their New Haven enterprise adopt a softer Anglicanism some 20 years later. Even the intense revivalism of Jonathan Edwards and the Great Awakening eventually gave way to the kinder and gentler Unitarianism, Deism, and “natural theology,” all of which emphasized reason, morality, and the benevolent human desire for external validation.

This positive outlook found expression, among other places, in the Declaration of Independence’s affirmation of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Leading colonial political economists likewise espoused it. They also cottoned to the post-Millennial concept of a Kingdom of God on earth, the notion that humanity, endowed by its Creator with intellect and moral reasoning, could itself usher in economic and political perfection.

Friedman argues this faith in human progress writ large dovetailed with Smith’s philosophy, expressed in his Lectures on Jurisprudence, of steady advances in human development from prehistoric hunter-gatherers to commercial agents of the modern era. As Friedman puts it, “religious values and economic values were therefore in harmony, not opposed, in America of the early nineteenth century.”

This optimistic religious and economic outlook persisted after the devastation of the Civil War. Henry Ward Beecher, a widely respected clergyman who had been a prominent abolitionist in the 1850s, wrote in The Administration of Wealth in 1867 that Americans “need not be ashamed to be rich [or] to be thought to be seeking riches” because wealth could and should be harnessed to the greater good of society. Russell Conwell, who led Philadelphia’s Baptist Temple and is considered the progenitor of the “Gospel of Wealth” (also known as the “Prosperity Gospel”), deemed it “your Christian and godly duty” to attain riches, and proclaimed that “to make money honestly is to preach the gospel.”

But other strands of religious thinking arose in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that countered this narrative. Friedman pits the Gospel of Wealth against the “Social Gospel” of Walter Rauschenbusch and Washington Gladden, who emphasized the Christian duty to eradicate poverty and combat inequality.

Rauschenbusch labeled “the great sin of modern humanity” the unfortunate truth that “men learned to make wealth much faster that they learned to distribute it justly.” The Social Gospel came to dominate mainline Protestant denominations, while the Prosperity Gospel held sway among evangelicals.

This division manifested in the newly developing field of economics, where pioneers like Wisconsin’s Richard Ely and Columbia University’s John Bates Clark founded the American Economics Association and embraced the Social Gospel. Clark declared in his 1894 The Philosophy of Wealth that “the security of the greatest quantity, the highest quality, and the most equitable distribution of wealth is the rational goal of economic society.” Franklin Roosevelt hailed from this tradition, as did many members of his cabinet, and the redistributionist thrust of the New Deal drew its force from it, in Friedman’s telling.

Meanwhile, both the Great Depression and especially the Cold War galvanized, on the right, an amalgam of traditional Christianity and libertarian economics. Conservative luminaries like Billy Graham and William F. Buckley unified evangelicals and business interests in opposing the spiritual and material evils of communism—a fusionist alliance that outlasted even the demise of the Soviet Union.

It is to this alliance that Friedman points in concluding that Americans remain moored to a subliminal, at times almost unconscious, faith in markets, even when capitalism supposedly runs against their interests. “It also helps explain,” Friedman reckons, “what we often view as the puzzling behavior of many of our fellow citizens whose attitudes toward questions of economic policy seem sharply at odds with what would be to their own economic benefit.”

He cites data indicating that evangelicals consistently support cutting taxes and spending despite earning less than the national average. “What is especially striking,” Friedman notes, “is that despite their typically lower incomes, evangelical Protestants are more likely than other Americans to believe that economic success in life is the result of individual effort.”

But here, and elsewhere, blind spots begin to emerge.

Correlation vs. Causality

First, Friedman spends an inordinate amount of time recounting the 16th- and 17th-century history of the split in the Catholic and Anglican churches, the progress of Calvinism’s advance on the continent and subsequent retreat in Britain, and the intricacies of intra-Protestant theological debates that could easily have been summarized in a few pages. He also delves too deeply into the nuances of competing strands within both the Federal Council of Churches and the National Association of Evangelicals.

Some of this effort would more profitably have been diverted to a comparative analysis of the development of modern economic and religious thinking in Britain, where Friedman’s story starts, and in continental Europe in order to help the reader understand why Americans are unique.

More fundamentally, Friedman proves far more capable of establishing correlation between religious and economic ideas than causation. Yes, Smith was exposed to, perhaps even immersed in, Moderate Christian thought, but his writing evinces few references to it and no proof of its impact, as Friedman recognizes, especially given Smith’s generally secular leanings and pro-Enlightenment orientation. “To be sure,” he concedes, “recognizing the logical connection between ideas … is not the same as establishing historical influence.

This lack of causality appears most striking in Friedman’s conclusion, where he attributes religious motives to evangelical views on economic issues. Here, he vastly underestimates the bearing of tribalism on voting patterns and the sorting that has characterized American politics over the last several decades. For instance, as the Dispatch’s David French, my American Enterprise Institute colleague Tim Carney, and others have shown, Donald Trump attracted his strongest evangelical support from voters who attended church less frequently, suggesting an inverse correlation between religiosity and support for conservative economic policies.

Then, too, certain leading religious conservatives have recently presented economic plans that openly challenge free-market orthodoxies. Sen. Josh Hawley, an evangelical Protestant, has sounded a distinctly populist note, introducing legislation that would impose a $15 per hour minimum wage on large companies and offer a “blue-collar bonus” to the working class. In a 2019 speech at the American Principles Project, Hawley decried “market worship” and “the rise of a new oligarchy of wealth and education,” promoting instead “our communities of home and worship and labor.”

Meanwhile Sen. Marco Rubio, a devout Catholic, has championed what he calls “Common Good Capitalism,” which focuses on Catholic social doctrine and the dignity of work. In a 2019 speech at Catholic University, Rubio argued that “the notion that, left unguided, the market will solve our problems will not restore a balance between the obligations and rights of the private sector and working Americans.” Religious fundamentalism and market fundamentalism appear to be diverging, perhaps enduringly so.

Yet even though a religion-only explanation, like all monocausal theories, cannot sufficiently explain the development of free-market capitalism by Adam Smith and his American exponents, Friedman’s thorough analysis nicely illuminates the issue. Whether or not he’s correct that this economic “worldview too rests on presumptions that originate in the religious thinking of either today or sometime in the past,” he raises and investigates an important and interesting phenomenon.

Intercept Touts Lies About Riots While Maliciously Attacking Conservative Journalists For Reporting On Them,"The Intercept released a video report touting lies about the violent riots that broke out over the summer of 2020 and targeting the conservative journalists who reported on them.

“By focusing on sensational, graphic images of violence on the margins of protests and entirely ignoring peaceful demonstrators, even members of the Riot Squad who are not as far right as Schaffer have contributed to a political project: the right-wing media’s campaign to portray racial justice protests as anarchic and dangerous,” Intercept claimed.

In the media outlet’s video, a narrator details how conservative reporters made up an informal “Riot Squad” that followed the violence, destruction, vandalism, and arson that occurred in cities all over the U.S. last year. While the riots, 95 percent of which are linked to Black Lives Matter activism, caused more than $2 billion in damages from May 26 to June 8, corporate media organizations, including The Intercept, hold fast to the idea that these “protests” were “mostly peaceful.”

“…the broader picture is that Black Lives Matter protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful,” the Intercept claimed without evidence.

Not only does The Intercept downplay the violence that destroyed businesses, cities, and ended in more than 47 riot-related fatalities, but also targets conservative reporters, many of whom were some of the only on-the-ground journalists in ravaged areas, for choosing to cover the destruction. Reporters Elijah Schaffer, Shelby Talcott, Julio Rosas, and Jorge Ventura are slandered as spurring on false narratives in exchange for appearances on Fox News and fueling online conspiracy theories.

These reporters’ choices to turn their cameras away from “peaceful marches” over “racist policing” to the dangerous and violent looting and rioting that occurred, The Intercept claims, is just meant to add fuel to the fire.

“The impact of their work is hard to overstate. Even as they remain relatively unknown, this tight-knit group has produced many of the most viral videos of Black Lives Matter protests over the past year. And those images have helped create the false impression, relentlessly driven home by Fox News and Republican politicians, that the nationwide wave of protests that erupted after George Floyd was killed was nothing but an excuse for mindless rioting,” The Intercept narrator said.

The Intercept also accused conservative journalists covering the riots of staking out in aggravated areas such as Portland to “record and exaggerate.”

“It was no accident that Rosas and Ventura chose to spend Inauguration Day this year in Portland. The liberal city’s strong anti-fascist protest culture, in a metro area surrounded by ultraconservative exurbs, has for years provided right-wing video journalists with a steady stream of skirmishes to record and exaggerate,” the narrator stated.

Reporters were faulted for their coverage of the shooting by Kyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin and The Intercept even speculated that the Daily Caller’s Chief Video Director Richie McGinniss refused to release video of the shooting right away because he “decided to suppress or delete footage that could be used to convict the young right-wing vigilante.”

“That fueled speculation that McGinniss might have withheld incriminating visual evidence to shield Rittenhouse, who quickly became a hero to many of the Daily Caller’s far-right readers and was defended by the site’s founder, Tucker Carlson,” the narrator continued. “McGinniss, however, told The Intercept that while he thought he had recorded video of the shooting, he discovered later that he had accidentally hit the wrong button on his iPhone and it did not start recording until after the shots were fired.”

Even the one reporter in the so-called “Riot Squad” who does not work in conservative news faced scrutiny from Intercept for “attending at least 24 Trump rallies before the 2018 midterms and describing them as ‘exhilarating’ on his video blog.” And despite almost all of the reporters’ coverage of the Capitol riot and “pro-Trump thugs,” The Intercept still blamed the journalists because “all this video evidence of right-wing violence was not used to vilify the rioters the way that clips of far less significant events at left-wing protests were last summer.”

The Intercept concluded by scolding Scriberr field reporter Kalen D’Almeida and other reporters for “contributing to an atmosphere of paranoia and mistrust, making assaults on journalists more frequent.”

“Violence against journalists, even ones operating in bad faith, is inexcusable. Unfortunately, videographers like D’Almeida have contributed to an atmosphere of paranoia and mistrust, making assaults on journalists more frequent. And this has also made the work of scrupulous and fair reporting on the politics that plays out on our streets much harder, and more dangerous,” The Intercept concluded.

The narrator ends the video with a propagandist statement lamenting the fact that attention on the riots has taken away from criticizing law enforcement.

“It’s been a year since the horrifying cellphone video of George Floyd’s murder drove millions of Americans to the streets to demand justice,” he said. “But it’s important to keep in mind that the conservative media has been working almost nonstop to undercut the movement for black lives by spreading the lie that the nation’s main problem is the protesters, not the police.”

Some journalists targeted by The Intercept report responded to the outlet’s attacks on Twitter.

Legal Battles Expose Abortion Collusion With Democrat-Run Governments,"On Friday, in a rare move, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals pulled a 100-plus page opinion it had issued in March against a group of pro-life protestors. The short three-sentence order in People of the State of New York v. Griepp—in which the court, without elaboration, granted rehearing of the case, vacated its previous opinion, and reinstated the district court’s decision—tells none of the bigger story of this continuing saga: a story of complicity between the abortion industry and leftist government officials.

The Griepp case dates back to June 2017, when, following a year-long investigation he launched into peaceful pro-life protestors, then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed suit against 13 individuals for alleged violations of the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE) and the state and city equivalents.

FACE (and the state and city corollaries) provides for both civil and criminal penalties for any individual who, “by force or threat of force or by physical obstruction, intentionally injures, intimidates or interferes with or attempts to injure, intimidate or interfere with any person because that person is or has been, or in order to intimidate such person or any other person or any class of persons from, obtaining or providing reproductive health services.”

Although Schneiderman initiated the civil lawsuit against the protestors, he later resigned in May 2018 following reports he assaulted four women. The case against the Griepp defendants continued under his successor.

Two months after Schneiderman resigned in disgrace, and after hearing extensive testimony and viewing videos capturing the defendants’ conduct outside the Queens Choices Women’s Medical Center, a federal judge rejected the Office of Attorney General’s request for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the protestors from speaking outside the abortion facility.

Abortionists Working with State Officials

While the district court’s decision represented a victory for the pro-life defendants, most of whom were members of either the Church at the Rock or Grace Baptist Church, Judge Carol Bagley Amon’s opinion also exposed the deceit of the abortion apologists and the symbiotic relationship between the abortion facility and the AG’s office. As I reported shortly after Judge Bagley Amon handed down her decision:

In her 100-plus page order, Judge Carol Bagley Amon, a George H.W. Bush appointee, dispassionately detailed Schneiderman’s efforts to keep the Christian protestors quiet and why. At a press conference held outside the Choice facility to announce his lawsuit against the protestors, Schneiderman declared this is ‘not a nation where you can choose your point of view.’ In furtherance of these efforts, the attorney general dispatched undercover investigators to Choice, with most of the investigators ‘pretending to be patients and their companions, and wearing hidden cameras recording video and audio.’ But, as Bagley Amon explained, ‘[d]espite these investigative activities, the [attorney general] did not call any of its investigators as witnesses, and introduced few of the undercover videos as evidence.’ In addition to the undercover investigators, Schneiderman used two of the abortion ‘escorts’—volunteers who walked abortion clients into the Choice facility—to help gather evidence. The escorts, Pearl Brady and Theresa White, wore recording devices and helped prepare a ‘protester dossier’ that collected personal information about the protestors.’

Both Brady and White conducted their own investigations as well. White recorded the license plate numbers of the protestors and conducted internet searches for them. Brady also conducted internet searches on the protestors and created a fake Facebook account, with which she pretended to be a pro-life advocate. Then, using that fake account, she “friended” some of the protestors on Facebook and gathered information about them.

Notwithstanding these concerted investigative efforts, Judge Bagley Amon found the AG’s claims of FACE failed. “Despite the availability of hundreds of hours of video evidence, the [attorney general]has not cited a single video that corroborates the witness testimony claiming near-weekly violations,” Judge Bagley Amon wrote. Rather, “the video evidence contradicts the escorts’ accounts of protestor conduct on specific occasions.”

Judge Bagley Amon further found the abortion facility witnesses unreliable and that their sworn testimony “exaggerated descriptions of protestor misconduct,” included “inconsistencies,” or involved “misremembered specific events.” She also concluded that the “Clinic Escort Recaps,” and “Protester Experience Questionnaires” the abortion workers completed were not reliable, as they included many false details.

After rejecting the myriad claims of misconduct leveled against the protestors, Judge Amon denied the New York AG’s Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, which would have barred the defendants from the sidewalks in front of the Choice facility. The New York AG appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard oral arguments on September 26, 2019.

A year-and-a-half later, on March 10, 2021, a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit reversed Judge Amon’s opinion. Judge Rosemary Pooler, a Bill Clinton appointee, authored the belated opinion that spanned more than 100 pages, with fellow Clinton-appointee Guido Calabresi joining to form a majority for the court. Debra Livingston, a George W. Bush appointee, dissented.

Surprise Court Reversal

As Judge Livingston’s dissent detailed, the majority opinion in essence inappropriately ignored the lower court’s credibility determinations and extensive factual findings, and the fractured 2-1 decision primed the case for a rehearing before the full Second Circuit Court of Appeals, or an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The Thomas More Society, which represented the defendants, began with the Second Circuit, filing a motion for rehearing or rehearing en banc. It is rare that such motions are granted, and typically before a federal appellate court decides to rehear a case, it seeks an answer from the opposing party. But that didn’t happen here.

Instead, on Friday, the panel (not the full court) voted to rehear the case. In layman’s terms, that means that either Judge Pooler or Judge Calabresi (or both) had a change of heart. After the year-and-a-half it took to decide the case and after composing 100-plus pages of analysis, the court realized it made a mistake.

The panel’s about-face does not end the case, however, as the judges must still issue a decision on the merits, possibly after allowing fresh oral argument. Even then, the decision will only be the initial one, as this case came to the Second Circuit on appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction. Unless the New York AG drops the case, the defendants face further litigation—and all because powerful leftist politicians worked with the abortion industry to target individuals because of their pro-life speech.

Government Collusion with the Abortion Industry

Not only did the year-long investigation, which included secretly taping the defendants, not turn up the claimed evidence of misconduct, it revealed the abortion facility workers were lying about the protestors. Now contrast the government’s conduct across the continent in California, where private individuals undertook the investigation authorities should have into the selling of fetal body parts. After video evidence suggested abortion providers violated the law, did the state AG launch an undercover investigation into the clinics?

No. Instead, the California Department of Justice, then under the command of Attorney General Kamala Harris, launched a raid on the journalist, David Daleiden, who exposed the horrific bartering of baby body parts. Harris’s successor, Xavier Becerra, who has also since joined the Biden administration as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, then filed 15 criminal charges against Daleiden and his colleague Sandra Merritt. While the court dropped several of the charges, Daleiden and Merritt await trial on the remaining counts.

The duo is also fighting attempts by the abortion industry to silence them in civil litigation. A California federal district court has already entered a permanent injunction forbidding Daleiden from republishing the videos or releasing additional footage, leaving Daleiden’s ability to expose the truth in the hands of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The two cases, although separated by flyover America, unite in their lesson: The truth about abortion must be silenced, and powerful people will try to ensure it is. The Second Circuit has rethought that approach. But will the Ninth?

Corrupt Media Smears IG After He Debunks Their Bogus Trump Narrative,"Members of the corrupt corporate media are smearing the inspector general of the U.S. Department of the Interior after his most recent report debunked their bogus narrative that former President Donald Trump ordered law enforcement to clear protesters so he could pose for a photo during last year’s summer of rage.

News broke this week that an investigation by the inspector general indicated U.S. Park Police did not clear Lafayette Park early last June to accommodate Trump. The report completely shattered the corporate media and Democrats’ prolific but false theory that Trump directed law enforcement officers to forcefully expel peaceful protesters away from the area so he could pose for a photo in front of St. John’s Church.

Even though the report and Inspector General Mark Greenblatt indicate that “the [U.S. Park Police] cleared the park to allow a contractor to safely install antiscale fencing in response to the destruction of federal property and injury to officers that occurred on May 30 and May 31,” some reporters and anchors couldn’t let go of the lies they held onto for more than a year.

MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough used his TV time on Thursday morning to claim that “the headlines from some of our friends and the panting and heavy breathing after this report came out is laughable” and that “the IG himself said this report is not dispositive.”

“If it makes you feel better seizing onto a report that doesn’t cover the entire event and completely ignoring what [Bill Barr] said, you go with that,” Scarborough said. “But that’s awfully thin gruel, if that’s what you’re relying on, awfully thin gruel. Good luck with that.”

CNN’s Jim Acosta took doubting the report one step further and accused Greenblatt of sucking up to Trump.

“As I read the report you wondered if [the IG] was auditioning to become inspector general at Mar-a-Lago. This was almost a whitewash,” he said.

Acosta also continued to push the debunked tear gas narrative by pretending the White House was involved in the Metropolitan Police Department’s decision to use the chemical munition, even though it is a completely different law enforcement agency than Park Police.

“You could hear the Park Police and other federal forces, D.C. police clearing that park — they were violently pummeling protesters, tear-gassing protesters. Remember at the time the White House was telling us, ‘Oh, we didn’t use tear gas.’ The D.C. police were using tear gas,” Acosta said.

As noted by The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway last June, the corrupt corporate media “spun a tale of violent, jack-booted cops running rampant through the streets over innocent docile protesters, using tear gas to clear the area.”

“It turns out none of that was true,” she explained. “Every single major media outlet falsely reported that Park Police were unprovoked when they used ‘tear gas’ to clear the area. If any of that were true, it might mark the first time in history that cops without gas masks launched tear gas in an area that the president of the United States easily walked through minutes later.”

Why Media Failure Is A Major Story Of Our Time,"The following is a transcript of my radar on Thursday’s edition of “Rising” on Hill TV.

People used to make the mistake of treating media criticism like front-page news when it probably belonged on A2. Most of the time, a story’s substance still warranted more attention than the media’s treatment of it. But if newspapers still mattered today, media criticism would belong front and center just about every single morning. The daily failures of the legacy media are so severe and so damaging, they now deserve just as much attention as the very news our news media is failing to cover.

That is to say, media is the public’s primary window into public affairs. That window is now cracked and fogged to the point where the image is entirely unrecognizable on the other side.

Yesterday, Mark Lee Greenblatt, Interior Department Inspector General, released a 37-page report on his department’s ostensibly exhaustive, independent watchdog investigation into the events of June 1 in Lafayette Square, that historic patch of park land just north of the White House.

Lafayette Square was the scene of a memorable clash between protesters and police on the evening of June 1, after which then-President Trump walked through the square, from the White House to St. John’s church, where he posed with a Bible and said, “We have the greatest country in the world. We’re going to keep it nice and safe.”

The entire legacy media reported that the park was cleared in connection with Trump’s “photo op,” which immediately hardened into a narrative they treated like Gospel: Trump deputized police to violently clear peaceful protesters for the sake of a photo op. Take this report from George Stephanopoulos: “The administration asked police to clear peaceful protesters from the park across the White House so that the President could stage a photo op.”

Glenn Greenwald collected just some of the many, many stories that aged so poorly. Here’s an excerpt from his Substack:

“Peaceful Protesters Tear-Gassed To Clear Way For Trump Church Photo-Op,” read the NPR headline on June 1. The New York Times ran with: “Protesters Dispersed With Tear Gas So Trump Could Pose at Church.” CNN devoted multiple segments to venting indignation while the on-screen graphic declared: “Peaceful Protesters Near White House Tear-Gassed, Shot With Rubber Bullets So Trump Can Have Church Photo Op.”

The few journalists who did their jobs correctly, including my colleague Mollie Hemingway, were viciously mocked. The dynamic reflects a toxic combination of arrogance and incompetence. And the ratio of arrogance to competence is wildly out of whack.

Greenblatt’s investigation explicitly disputes the media narrative. He also shows his work, providing pages of evidence based on many interviews to support a more factual rendering of the day.

“The evidence we obtained did not support a finding that the USPP cleared the park to allow the President to survey the damage and walk to St. John’s Church. Instead,” the report says. “The evidence we reviewed showed that the USPP cleared the park to allow the contractor to safely install the antiscale fencing in response to destruction of property and injury to officers occurring on May 30 and 31.”

“Further, the evidence showed that the USPP did not know about the President’s potential movement until mid- to late afternoon on June 1—hours after it had begun developing its operational plan and the fencing contractor had arrived in the park,” according to the document.

Now I’m not going to treat this as the Gospel truth either. But it’s obviously credible. So what explains the disconnect between this watchdog investigation and the initial reports? It shouldn’t take months-long IG probes for the public to get basic facts.

Interestingly, in a fact check published last June, Philip Bump of the Washington Post glossed right over the Trump administration’s contention that “somehow Barr’s instructions [to clear protesters] were unrelated to Trump’s walk,” calling it “an argument which even Barr didn’t directly reject when asked Thursday. (He claimed that there was an existing plan to extend the secure area around the White House but didn’t deny that the immediate need for doing so was Trump’s visit to the church.)”

One administration official not denying something is the thread that Bump staked his narrative on in one of the most prestigious publications in the entire world. Why? Because that thread comported with the hive mind’s expectations of Trump so they all found ways to confirm it.

Their ideology is the source of their arrogance and their arrogance is the source of their incompetence. The media is utterly broken.

Now, the IG report contains some important, newsworthy findings about what actually went wrong with law enforcement that day. But to my point at the beginning of this segment, its stark contrast with the entire volume of legacy media coverage is equally newsworthy because it’s strong evidence the bulk of the public was fed egregiously incorrect information on a major story. And the broader implications of that are even worse, exposing the massive cracks in our most important window into pubic affairs.

Campaign platforms typically consist of policy goals. What the press never understood about Donald Trump is that he basically ran on media criticism and, sadly, a whole lot of it was entirely fair. That’s why it resonated. But even after the host of “Celebrity Apprentice” defeated the former Secretary of State in a presidential match-up, the media’s necessary course correction never materialized. Things have clearly gotten much, much worse.

They peddled the false, self-serving narratives of spies and flaks for years, miring the country in a silly melodrama over a pee tape. Then there’s the lab leak flip flop. How about the press’s treatment of Andrew Cuomo last spring? It doesn’t just happen on the major stories either.

We could talk about the hypocrisy of the press. We could talk about their intolerance for ideological diversity. We could talk about their elitism or their obsessions with Twitter. These are all variables in the equation of their failure. But the most important takeaway is that the media peddles glaring disinformation on a daily basis, on major stories. That’s a big deal because it’s misinforming voters, and much more effectively than those scary Boomer memes Putin put on Facebook.

Democracy dies in darkness, sure, but bumbling Harvard grads with press credentials can turn the light switch off with their incompetence just as much as corrupt rules can do it with their power and money. We desperately need the free press. It’s our only way to keep the government accountable and it’s a disaster right now. There’s your front page.

"New Reports Reveal Democrat Mayor, Not Trump, Teargassed Protesters","The first speaker former actress Eva Longoria introduced at the Democratic National Convention in August 2020 was Muriel Bowser, the Democrat mayor of Washington, D.C. Longoria referenced the clearing of a street in front of the White House earlier that summer, an operation the media had repeatedly falsely characterized as the violent removal of peaceful protesters with tear gas for the sole purpose of a photo opportunity for President Donald Trump.

“When peaceful protesters were teargassed across from the White House, our next speaker stood up, stood strong and turned that place into the Black Lives Matter Plaza in their honor. Please welcome Mayor Muriel Bowser,” Longoria said.

Amazingly, new reports confirm it was Bowser — not Trump — who teargassed the protesters a few blocks away from the White House on the evening in question, that the protests had repeatedly devolved into violence and arson, and that the clearing was done for major security concerns and not a photo opportunity. For more than a year, Bowser allowed Trump to take the blame for what her police forces had done.

In her nationally broadcast speech, Bowser inaccurately called the violent riots — marked by widespread looting, arson of historic buildings, arson of White House buildings, and assaults on scores of police officers — safe and peaceful. Then she blamed Trump for her own police force’s teargassing of protesters.

“[W]hile we were peacefully protesting, Donald Trump was plotting. He stood in front of one of our most treasured houses of worship and held a Bible for a photo op. He sent troops in camouflage into our streets. He sent tear gas into the air and federal helicopters too. I knew if he did this to DC, he would do it to your city or your town, and that’s when I said enough,” she said.

But it was Bowser who “did this to DC,” not Trump.

“We determined, and the [Metropolitan Police Department] confirmed, that the MPD used CS gas on 17th Street on June 1. As discussed above, the MPD was not a part of nor under the control or direction of the USPP’s and the Secret Service’s unified command structure,” the Inspector General said in the report in the section headlined, “The USPP Did Not Use CS Gas on June 1, 2020, But The MPD Did.”

For what it’s worth, the Metropolitan Police Department Bowser oversees claimed it teargassed rioters who had injured cops by throwing an incendiary device at them.

The reports come more than a year after the corporate press, other Democrats, and even some anti-Trump Republicans had filled news cycles with outrage over Trump allegedly teargassing peaceful protesters for a photo op. For example:

The hysterical reaction from anti-Trump forces contributed to a widespread breakdown in law and order throughout the summer, as some government officials feared media pushback to actions that might limit looting, arson, assault, and murder. If protecting the White House from violent mobs was considered unacceptable, what hope did small business owners in mid-size cities have that their lives and property might be protected from destruction?

Other government officials, such as Bowser, demanded there be no federal law enforcement or military presence in their cities.

Bowser, who received accolades and prominent attention for her role in perpetuating the false claim that Trump — not her own police — had teargassed protesters, would continue to play a role in the breakdown of law and order. One day before a mob of Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol, Bowser emphasized in a letter to the Department of Justice that she was in control of the situation and did not want assistance from federal law enforcement.

“To be clear, the District of Columbia is not requesting other federal law enforcement personnel and discourages any additional deployment without immediate notification to, and consultation with, MPD if such plans are underway,” Bowser wrote in a letter to acting U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller, and Secretary of the Army Ryan D. McCarthy.

A Senate report on the policing failures on the day of the riot at the U.S. Capitol specifically cited public pushback against military and federal law enforcement’s role in quelling riots in summer 2020. The Army had previously noted the “considerable scrutiny” it had received for flying medical evacuation helicopters near crowds of protesters.

“McCarthy noted that the concern about the perception of troops on American streets was discussed during the summer of 2020 by all key decision makers, including the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Army Chief of Staff, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and the General Counsels,” according to the Senate report.

According to an Army report, following the June riot response in D.C., Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and McCarthy “determined that any future requests from civil authorities for [DC National Guard] support during planned protests required thorough scrutiny by both of them to ensure that the use of the National Guard was necessary; and that if so, the mission was narrowly tailored and appropriate for military forces.”

Another issue that led to policing and security delays and failures, according to the Senate report, was a letter orchestrated by former House Conference Chair Liz Cheney, a Republican congresswoman from Wyoming. She secretly organized the signing by ten former secretaries of defense, including her father, of a letter headlined “All 10 living former defense secretaries: Involving the military in election disputes would cross into dangerous territory.”

“Mr. McCarthy explained that “[the] hyperbole . . . about martial law and [the] 10 Sec Def letter” were “discussed in the entire Pentagon,” according to the Senate report explaining the Pentagon’s response in January. Worries about the public arguments advanced by Bowser and Cheney’s group made quick response to a deteriorating condition more difficult, according to the report.

Former Trump aide Stephen Miller wrote, “Now that the IG report has thoroughly debunked the Lafayette Lie, one must ask: how many riots subsequently spiraled out of control elsewhere because local authorities embraced the Left’s Lafayette narrative—and did not deploy the rapid initial force necessary to assert control?”

It’s a sobering but important question to answer about the dangerous propaganda spewed by the corrupt press and other Democrats after billions of dollars in destruction, dozens of killings, a ripping of the fabric of society, and a general breakdown of law and order.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/14/flashback-dc-mayor-honored-at-dnc-for-riot-response-new-reports-reveal-she-not-trump-teargassed-protesters/,2021-06-14
Portland's 'Protest Response Unit' Police Officers Resign En Masse,"After one of their own colleagues was indicted, approximately 50 Portland police officers, sergeants, and detectives resigned en masse from the Portland Police Bureau’s protest response unit on Wednesday. This resignation is unprecedented.

The Oregonian notes that police feel abandoned by City Hall and the district attorney, after dealing with over 100 consecutive nights of protest coverage. The indictment of one of their own team members was the final straw.

The unit, which existed to “provide public safety at crowd events when there was a threat of harm to the community,” consisted of approximately 50 voluntary employees, who served on the unit “in addition to their regular duties.”

After a tenuous year confronting violent rioters and extreme, unprecedented circumstances, members of the now-disbanded protest response unit simply refuse to volunteer any longer. They still serve on duty and complete regular assignments, but the protest response unit no longer exists.

In October, Former President of the Police Union, and Presiding Executive Director, Daryl Turner emphasized that “members [of the protest response unit] do not volunteer to have Molotov cocktails, fireworks, explosives, rocks, bottles, urine, feces and other dangerous objects thrown at them.” He added that members of the unit volunteer without receiving any specialty pay. They do it to protect their communities.

Turner continued: “Nor do they volunteer to have threats of rape, murder, and assaults on their families hurled at them. They do not volunteer to suffer serious injuries, to be subjected to warrantless criticism and face allegations by elected officials, or to suffer through baseless complaints and lengthy investigations devoid of due process.” He lamented that “These officers find themselves in a no-win situation.”

The resignations, and ensuing unit dismantlement, follow the indictment of Portland police officer Corey Budworth, who served on the unit. Budworth was charged “in connection with an alleged assault during a confrontation with protestors demonstrating against George Floyd’s murder last year.” He “allegedly [struck] a woman in the head” with a baton.

The police union has criticized the prosecution as politically motivated, arguing that Budworth’s baton strike was an accident, not a criminal act.

The Oregonian also notes that “[t]he Portland Police Association issued a statement earlier this week, saying [the district attorney] needs to prosecute ‘the real criminals who are perpetrating vandalism, arson, gun violence, and other violent crimes in [the] community,’ and not go after officers attempting to do their jobs with little support.”

Meanwhile, Democrat Mayor Ted Wheeler conceded that the past year has been difficult for officers: “I want to acknowledge the toll this past year has taken on them and their families — they have worked long hours under difficult conditions. I personally heard from some of them today, and I appreciate their willingness to share their concerns about managing the many public gatherings that often were violent and destructive.”

Yet, Wheeler’s comments are insufficient in convincing officers to resume their former duties on Portland’s disbanded protest unit. And Portland continues to be an epicenter of violence.

In March, over 50 rioters burned and vandalized Portland’s Mark Hatfield Federal Courthouse. In December, Portland’s (shortly-lived) Antifa autonomous zone sported messages calling for the murder of police officers. Portland also burned following the November presidential election. And all of this follows a summer of violent anarchy.

Meanwhile, just last month, a march on the anniversary of George Floyd’s death became violent and five individuals were arrested. The Portland police department faces “an exodus” of demoralized officers.

Chelsea Wolfe’s Olympic Flag Burning Promise Is A Sign Of Decline,"“My goal is to win the Olympics so I can burn a US flag on the podium,” wrote transgender BMX freestyle rider Chelsea Wolfe in a March 2020 Facebook post. Wolfe, a male, is now that much closer to making his dream come true after he was selected on Monday to be an alternate for Team USA’s women’s BMX freestyle event at the upcoming Olympic Games in Tokyo.

Leaving aside the fact that Wolfe is a man and should not be competing against women, his 2020 statement makes one wonder why he would even be picked as an Olympic athlete, since he clearly has no respect for the country he will be representing.

It turns out this doesn’t matter much, since the only pushback Wolfe has received is coming from conservative media, with others either not caring at all or praising him for “making history” as a trans athlete.

Another Olympic Protest

More than 50 years ago, two American track athletes, John Carlos and Tommie Smith, made their own acts of political protest on the Olympic podium. Both men raised their black-gloved fists and lowered their heads during the American National Anthem at the Mexico City 1968 Olympics. The iconic photo of the two men outstretching their arms into black power fists captured the zeitgeist of the late 1960s in the wake of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination and great racial unrest.

Smith and Carlos, winners of the gold and bronze medals in the 200-meter sprint, respectively, were also dressed in symbolic protest. They wore black socks and no shoes to symbolize black American poverty and a black glove to express black strength and unity. Smith also wore a scarf for black pride, and Carlos beads, in memory of lynching victims.

A wave of boos “rippled” through the spectators as the pair descended from the podium and left the field. Two days later, Smith and Carlos were suspended from the team by the U.S. Olympic Committee because the men violated the International Olympic Committee’s strict rule prohibiting political statements and protests (a rule that is still active today).

Upon returning home, the men were slammed by the public and the media, including some members of the black media, for not showing respect for the United States on the world stage. Indeed, a large number of Americans, including Americans who believed in the civil rights movement, viewed the protest as an insult to the United States.

“East Germans, Russians, even Cubans, all stand at attention when The Star-Spangled Banner or any other national anthem is played,” wrote a Time Magazine journalist in 1968, contrasting other nation’s respect for the flag with Carlos and Smith’s lack thereof.

Sports editor of the “Baltimore Afro-American” Sam Lacy, who had been instrumental during the push to integrate Major League Baseball two decades earlier, wrote that he was embarrassed by the Nazi “heil-like salute,” which he said was “childish and in extremely poor taste.”

None of this is to downplay the very real racial discrimination that existed in 1968, or to comment on whether Carlos and Smith should have raised their fists. It merely underscores that in that day, even those with severe criticisms of their country maintained those alongside honor and respect.

A Decline In Patriotism

John Carlos, Tommie Smith, and Chelsea Wolfe represent a major shift in the United States. What is the bigotry Wolfe is fighting? Is it even remotely comparable to what black Americans were facing during the civil rights movement (especially since burning the flag is far more extreme than the black power fist)? Wolfe certainly cannot claim he is being discriminated against as a transgender athlete, since he is being allowed to participate in women’s sports.

It’s not clear why Wolfe wants to burn the American flag at the podium, and he doesn’t really have to answer this question since many Americans don’t seem to care.

In 1968, by contrast, the American media was so thirsty to know why Carlos and Smith were protesting the United States that Carlos had to tell a group of reporters in the athlete’s village: “Next man who come up and puts a camera in my face or a speaker up in my face, I’m going to knock them down and jump on them, you hear?”

The American people in the 1960s saw Carlos and Smith’s fists as a personal attack on America. They did not want to see the United States be defamed and embarrassed in front of the world, and especially her enemies, like the Soviet Union and Cuba.

Things have changed since then. Wolfe doesn’t need a chance to burn the American flag at the podium. Symbolically he already has, because the United States hand-picked him to be a representative of America internationally. Was Wolfe forced to apologize or take back his statement before accepting his place on the team? Nope, and I’m not surprised since that kind of rhetoric has become commonplace among American athletes in 2021.

Even if Americans are not paying too much attention to Wolfe, you can bet the Chinese are. This year, the genocidal Chinese government slammed the United States, saying it is a racist country in order to deflect from their human rights abuses committed against the Uyghur Muslims and in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Can our president defend the United States against such slander? No, because he has repeatedly stated that the United States — not China or Lebanon or India, the United States — is institutionally racist.

Can American citizens defend themselves? No. Thanks to taxpayer-funded critical race theory, millions of Americans believe that the United States is an evil, inherently racist country. Indeed, China’s slanderous talking points were handed to them on a silver platter by Black Lives Matter and the Biden administration.

Given how strong of a reaction there was to Carlos and Smith raising their fists, it’s not hard to imagine how much stronger the reaction would have been if an Olympic athlete threatened to burn the American flag at the podium in 1968. The shift in the American psyche is reflected in the numbers as well, with American pride plummeting to a record low in 2020.

National Decay

What we are witnessing is a decline in our culture, ethos, and national credibility. It’s no secret that China is beating us in a space race we aren’t even competing in and that they now have the world’s largest navy. What are we doing to meet this challenge? NASA has launched “Mission Equity” (no seriously, that’s not a joke), and our military feeds American soldiers’ spirits with Ibram X. Kendi’s “How to Be an Antiracist,” instead of notions of equality, patriotism, and camaraderie.

It’s gotten so bad that we can’t even recruit soldiers based on patriotism anymore. Just take a look at our military recruitment ad compared to that of Russia and China.

America was founded on principles that freed slaves during the Civil War, granted women the right to vote, established authentic equality during the civil rights movement, and triumphed over the Soviet Union and communism. Today, our founding principles, the documents in which they are contained, and the men who wrote them have been smeared and denounced. Our sense of self and love of country is eroding.

The Olympics have always been a powerful tool for measuring world power and dominance. Why else would the Chinese government fund grueling Chinese “sports schools” to raise Olympians?

That’s why Wolfe’s comments are not just an innocuous Facebook post. It has a profound effect on our enemies and on the American psyche. The world is not only laughing at us, they are taking measure of our weaknesses, and they will use it against us. They know a self-loathing nation is a weak nation.

BLM May Now Have To Admit What Really Happened In Lafayette Park,"A federal judge on Monday dismissed all but two of the claims Black Lives Matter and several individual demonstrators brought against Donald Trump, William Barr, and others in the sprawling lawsuit filed after the clearing of Lafayette Square on June 1, 2020.

Bigger than this legal defeat, however, was the report from the inspector general of the Department of the Interior disproving many of the substantive allegations in the plaintiffs’ complaint — all of which the court had accepted as true in its 50-page opinion.

Attorneys for BLM and the demonstrators now face the unpleasant choice of reframing their case, and thus acknowledging the falsity of their initial allegations, or risking sanctions for alleging facts without evidentiary support.

Court Assumed BLM Complaints Were True

In an opinion issued earlier this week, Judge Dabney Friedrich analyzed the claims Black Lives Matter and several individual plaintiffs brought against a bevy of defendants, including former President Trump, former Attorney General Barr, the U.S. Park Police, the D.C. National Guard, the U.S. Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the Arlington County Police Department, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, as well as individual officers working for the various agencies.

Before delving into the various constitutional and statutory claims, Friedrich made clear he “must accept as true all material factual allegations in the complaint” at this stage of the litigation. This governing standard created an interesting dynamic because the complaints (which were amended three times before the court addressed the defendants’ motions to dismiss) and the corresponding oral argument predated the report from the inspector general. Released earlier this month, that report undermined the prevailing narratives about the clearing of Lafayette Park.

So, in deciding the defendants’ motions to dismiss — a procedure used to quickly toss out a case because the alleged facts fail to support a legal claim — the court cited the falsehoods or half-truths of the complaint. “Peaceful protesters assembled in historic Lafayette Park across from the White House,” the court quoted, when “officials, wielding batons, sprayed the crowd with tear gas, flash-bang grenades, smoke bombs, and rubber bullets.”

According to the complaint, law enforcement did this “to clear the area to permit the President to walk to a photo opportunity at a nearby church.” The plaintiffs further alleged (and the opinion recounted) “the Department of Justice has officially acknowledged that Defendant Barr ordered Lafayette Square cleared minutes before the assault started.” Some of the plaintiffs alleged — in addition to Arlington County Police Department officers, Secret Service agents, and Park Police — officers from D.C. Metropolitan Police Department had assisted in the clearing of Lafayette Square.

Claims Contradicted by Inspector General’s Report

During oral argument last month, the plaintiffs’ lawyers hammered these same points, with attorney Randy Mastro proclaiming “Attorney General Barr incredibly shows up himself to survey the scene, looks at the assembled crowd, and then gives the order, ‘Clear the park.’”

“Several minutes later,” according to Mastro, “law enforcement advanced on the peaceful protesters, spraying them with tear gas, pelleting them with rubber bullets, dropping smoke bombs and incendiary grenades, and using their shields and batons like weapons.” He further stressed this was all so “the president could cross a cleared path to do a photo op in front of a church.”

The American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing BLM, Scott Michelman, also pushed many of these allegations, and even brought up newspaper articles to support them. “These articles,” Michelman explained to the court, “are only in here to establish that as unbelievable as these events are to most of us and as shocked as we were to learn about them, they are corroborated not only by the eyewitness accounts that we give in the complaint but also by other news articles to show the court that we’re not making these things up.”

What articles exactly did Michelman cite in the complaint? Among others, they included the Washington Post’s “Inside the Push to Teargas Protesters Ahead of a Trump Photo Op,” and a Reuters YouTube video entitled “Peaceful Protesters Fired at with Tear Gas, Rubber Bullets by U.S. Military Police.”

[scribd id=512911279 key=key-plyLUsrndaGhhJ1VDKgb mode=scroll]

But the inspector general’s report, released just more than a week after the court heard arguments on the motion to dismiss, disproved many of the plaintiffs’ allegations. For instance, the report refuted the spin that the protests were peaceful, noting the two days prior saw 49 Park Service officers injured and federal and private property vandalized.

More significantly, the inspector general concluded the Park Police “cleared the park to allow the contractor to safely install the anti-scale fencing in response to destruction of property and injury to officers” that had occurred the days before. It was not cleared “to allow the President to survey the damage and walk to St. John’s Church.”

Further, the Metropolitan Police had not participated in the clearing of Lafayette Square. However, it appears to be the only law enforcement entity that used CS gas (known colloquially as tear gas) on protesters outside of the park.

Most of BLM’s Claims Dismissed

In Monday’s opinion, while the district court noted there is “some dispute about whether the D.C. defendants were personally involved in clearing Lafayette Square,” the judge made no mention of the inspector general’s report nor its findings that the park was not cleared for a photo op. But even accepting the plaintiffs’ numerous allegations (many of which the report contradicted), the court nonetheless dismissed all but two of the claims.

Of the two claims that weren’t dismissed, the court first held the plaintiffs’ allegations sufficiently stated First Amendment claims against the D.C. and Arlington County law enforcement officers. According to the complaints, those officials used force to disperse “a crowd of peaceful protestors who were exercising their First Amendment rights.”

Second, the plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim against the federal government, seeking injunctive relief, survived because it “challenged the continued restrictions on access to Lafayette Square.” Significantly, though, it is the Biden administration that must answer for these purported infringements on the plaintiffs’ free speech rights.

In litigating these remaining claims, the plaintiffs must now decide how to handle the inspector general’s report, consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. Rule 11 provides that a lawyer, when “signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating,” a position, is certifying “to the best of [his] knowledge, information, and belief … the factual contentions have evidentiary support or … will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.”

Given the inspector general’s investigation and report, a lawyer would be hard-pressed to keep arguing many of the complaint’s original allegations. Should the plaintiffs’ attorneys do so, they could be subject to sanctions. But pivoting from the “Trump tear-gassed protesters for a photo op” angle will prove challenging — the corrupt media couldn’t bring themselves to do so.

Will Black Lives Matter be able to? We should know soon when the group responds to the court’s Monday ruling.

Antifa Attacked Christian Protesters While Media Looked For More QAnon,"It looks like the controversy over a male who identifies as transgender using the female facilities in a Los Angeles spa late last month may have been rooted in a hoax. But there’s still a very big problem here: namely, the news reports about the protest in front of the spa whitewashing all of the shocking violence perpetrated by Antifa mobs.

Ian Miles Cheong, a popular user on Twitter, posted a couple of videos on June 26 wherein the woman recording inside Wi Spa is telling the front desk that a man disrobed in front of her and others on the women’s side of the establishment. Another woman appears to be asking for her money back over the same issue, though there are reports that police who have since investigated haven’t turned up any evidence that a trans person was actually at the spa that day.

After the video went viral, a protest gathered outside the spa, including a few people with Christian signs and shirts that said, “Obey Jesus,” “Jesus saves,” and “Soldier of the cross.” Then there were several more “anti-fascists,” aka Antifa, unmistakably dressed in their usual all-black and face coverings.

The demonstrations turned violent and, as is always the case, the most and worst of it came from the Antifa people.

Yet here’s how NBC covered it: “A few far-right protesters appeared to be outnumbered by those favoring transgender rights.”

The obvious subtext is that the “far-right” people, who we’re currently told by those in power in Washington are the biggest threat to national security, were on-site to agitate the more inclusive people “favoring transgender rights.”

NBC’s report was also sure to note that “Some of the protesters … included apparent QAnon supporters.”

Ah, yes. Those ever-present QAnon fans who seem to only exist on cable news, or wherever the media say they do.

The Washington Post was likewise eager to note that at the protest was a man “wearing an American flag bandanna” (subtext: a scary hick) who was seen “pulling a gun out of a backpack,” as well as “a plaid shirt hitting a filmmaker in the back of the head with what appears to be a pipe.” The Post said both men “were with the group that said it was rallying for women’s and children’s rights.” (It’s actually unclear that the man had a gun, but even if he did, he had it concealed as he was surrounded by an Antifa mob.)

Interesting. Both NBC and the Post were very concerned about all of that but somehow failed to capture the true essence of what the protest was like, which, as fate would have it, is all on video for anyone who wants to know.

In one widely circulated clip, three protesters wearing Christian-themed attire are encircled by members of Antifa, who start telling them to leave. A projectile flies at the Christian protesters, and one of them, a man, is shoved by an Antifa demonstrator. As the three of them turn to walk away, another Antifa person runs up and punches one of them in the back and retreats to the mob.

Later in the same clip, a man, again in clothing with Christian messaging, is seen on the ground with a group of Antifa surrounding him. He tries to gather his things and is repeatedly shoved. When he finally gets up, his face bruised, one of his associates tries to keep the mob at bay, but an Antifa member punches him square in the face. That man falls to the ground.

In a more extended video, one of the Christian members pushes an Antifa member who was hovering behind his associate. The response is yet more Antifa fighters who mob him, with one of them striking him across the back of his skull with a skateboard. The man continues to try walking away and fortunately finds a police officer to keep the crowd at bay.

An Antifa member yells out to the cop, “F-ck you for protecting this piece of sh-t.”

These are the folks on-site who, according to NBC, were simply “favoring transgender rights.”

QAnon? They’re everywhere and very, very violent.

Antifa? Who? Nah, those were just transgender advocates.

The media’s gaslighting over Antifa continues.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/07/08/antifa-violently-attacked-christian-protesters-in-broad-daylight-while-uninterested-media-looked-for-more-qanon/,2021-07-08
"Spurning The Flag And Anthem Aren’t Protests, But Cancellation Attempts","It’s getting so that we can’t go a week without an incident illustrating woke athletes’ contempt for both the national anthem and the American flag.

Last week, hammer-thrower Gwen Berry became the most famous person ever to finish third in the U.S. Olympic trials in a relatively obscure field event. She achieved this rare distinction by choosing to ostentatiously turn her back to the flag and make sophomoric faces as the national anthem played to honor the achievement of Berry and the two women who finished ahead of her in the competition.

Following the pattern that has become all too familiar since NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick began to popularize kneeling during the national anthem in what we were told was a protest against systemic racism in America, this act of childish disrespect for both her country and her more successful competitors (who stood with their hands over their hearts and whose names are still unknown to all but the most fanatic followers of this sport) turned Berry into a celebrity.

While she has a record of “activism” previous to this incident, the 32-year-old female athlete was just one more unknown struggling for a chance to compete in the spotlight of the Olympics. But in the days that followed her stunt, Berry had her proverbial 15 minutes of fame with the attention of the sports world and the mainstream media ready to hear at length about her reasons for acting in that manner.

Berry didn’t merely claim that playing the anthem at the trial was a “set up” designed to embarrass her. She went on to argue that “The Star Spangled Banner” was just one more outrageous example of American racism and white supremacy. Her argument highlighted that the anthem’s author Francis Scott Key was a slaveholder and that the third stanza of the original poem, although not the version that was officially adopted as the anthem by Congress in 1931, mentions America’s opponents being “hirelings” and “slaves.”

These arguments are not new. The NAACP first called for ditching the anthem in 2017 and woke outlets like The Washington Post have trashed the anthem since Black Lives Matter used the death of George Floyd to gain prominence. But Berry’s sudden celebrity increases the prospect that more American athletes will follow in her footsteps at the Tokyo Olympics later this month.

Days later, the anthem again became a source of controversy when several members of the U.S. Olympic Women’s Soccer team turned away from the flag while a 98-year-old veteran of World War Two was playing the anthem on his harmonica before a warm-up match.

Interestingly, U.S. Soccer did its best to claim the incident was a fiction conjured up by right-wing troublemakers. But the video clearly shows some of the team refusing to look at the flag and that, contrary to those who defended their behavior, none of those who turned away had their hands over their hearts.

In the five years since Kaepernick first popularized the idea of anthem protests, they’ve spread from football to baseball and been front and center during the leadup to this year’s Olympics. Moreover, while Kaepernick and NFL players who agreed with him were at first harshly criticized, the media and even much of the political establishment now lionizes them as heroes of free expression, as White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki’s astonishing support for Berry illustrated.

That latter point shows just how deeply embedded support for the critical race theory notion that America is an incorrigibly racist nation has become in the Democratic Party. If their influence spreads further, then perhaps the best thing to do might be to just give in to the protests and stop playing the anthem at sporting events, if for no other reason than to save these national symbols from more insults. But that would be a mistake.

In 2016, when Kaepernick transformed himself from a fading star into a martyr, his protests were not generally understood as part of a greater struggle to control the culture. But in the last year, as the Black Lives Matter movement went mainstream and indoctrination about white privilege became a dominant force, incidents such as Berry’s tantrum must now be seen as merely one more battle in a crucial war against our history and the ideal of the struggle for American liberty as integral to our national identity.

Far from being just a question of the right to free speech — as Kaepernick’s efforts were initially justified —support for Berry is inextricably tied to ideas like those propagated by The New York Times’ fallacious “1619 Project.” No longer content to merely protest them , the woke critics of the anthem and the flag now want to cancel them. What’s more, they seem to think they can do so as easily as they toppled statues and intimidated much of society into buying the idea that a country that elected a black man president twice and eliminated systemic racism a half-century ago is still irredeemably racist.

Just like the battles being fought around the country in school boards and legislatures over attempts to halt CRT indoctrination, tolerance of disrespect for the anthem and flag is just as important. The left’s hateful ideas that divide Americans against each other solely on the basis of their race and supposed “privilege” are having a toxic impact on society and our democracy.

Despite the fact that elites treat defilers like Berry as heroes, it would be a mistake to concede this battle, if only because the flag and anthem remain popular. For every incident in which spoiled attention-seeking athletes have used the flag or anthem as a punching bag or a platform for disingenuous and false arguments about America, there are likely hundreds in which citizens pause at a game, a graduation, communal ceremony, or religious service to honor their country in a way befitting a nation of patriots.

Consider what happened several times in the last two months at the National Hockey League’s New York Islanders playoff games. As a result of a mic mishap, a new tradition was born. The entire crowd sang the anthem acapella rather than listen to a singer or a recording. The simple patriotism and enthusiasm shown there should give hope to those who think that the weight of leftist opinion has grown too great to resist.

Americans, including our political leaders, should continue to protest any athlete who shows disrespect to the flag and anthem. Their displeasure should be communicated to the various pro leagues and the Olympic committees that tolerate it. Declining ratings for football have shown that Kapernick’s cause is more popular with the media than with those who watch the games.

The grassroots movement to stop the teaching of critical race theory is now so dangerous to the leftist establishment that they are doing everything possible to smear it. The same effort must also be put into the effort to defend our national symbols.

If the left can cancel the anthem, nothing is safe. But if Americans can reclaim the anthem and the flag and return us to a situation where those who attack them are pariahs rather than heroes, then the fight against CRT will also be won.

WATCH: Anti-Police Protesters Disrupt Families Mourning Victims Of Violent Crima,"Video footage shows white, police-hating protesters disrupting black families mourning their dead at a police-sponsored “Stand up for a Safe Oakland” rally in Oakland, California on Saturday. According to the clips, the mourners were infuriated at being infiltrated by radical outsiders.

Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong organized the “Stand up for a Safe Oakland” rally in response to Oakland’s surging crime, because he and his community “cannot sit silent anymore.” During the rally, Oakland residents gathered at Lake Merritt’s Amphitheater to mourn lost community members, as well as to demand an end to the city’s rising violence.

Rather than join Armstrong’s rally, the “Anti-Police Terror Project” held a separate event with community groups on Saturday (though the group claims it made its plans prior to learning of Armstrong’s).

Meanwhile, protesters simultaneously disrupted the event organized by Armstrong. Lee Fang and AntifaWatch say these protesters were members of Antifa, though a spokesman for the Oakland Police Department was unable to confirm whether this was the case or not.

“Surreal moment in Oakland. About 200 mostly black families rally with police to call for an end to the epidemic of gun violence. Mothers at the stage mourning recently murdered children. In the back, less than a dozen mostly white antifa protesters assembled to jeer them,” Investigative journalist at the Intercept, Lee Fang, tweeted.

AntifaWatch reported that “Several #Antifa, who appear to be all white, showed up to ‘protest’ by drowning out mostly black speakers who were naming and remembering homicide victims.”

The protesters held signs with messages like “F-ck OCP” and “Quit your job, kkkop!,” as they shouted with local community members who were gathered to mourn their lost neighbors.

“A white privilege is standing here! You think you have a right to be here — you don’t have a right to be here!” an Oakland resident shouted at the protesters. “Not when black children are dying in the street everyday!” a second woman agreed.

Supporters of the event vehemently pushed back against the protesters’ suggestions that police are the villains. The mourners didn’t want to condemn police officers. They wanted to promote law and order.

“We’re talking about right now. What do you have against safety in Oakland? What do you have against stopping the violence?” a mourning Oakland resident asked the protesters.

“Why are you trying to disrupt something that’s trying to be positive? […] We’re trying to save our people!” the same Oakland resident continued. “We’re trying to save our people!” he repeated. “You are not our people! Get the f-ck out!”

""Black children are dying in the street every day."" ANTIFA: ""Yeah, at the hands of the police."" ""NO!"" ""That's a lie. There are not hundreds of people dead at the hands of police this year."" ""We're trying to save our people. You are not our people. Get the f*ck out!"" https://t.co/bXFgq3sRPf — Vince Coglianese (@VinceCoglianese) July 12, 2021

Armstrong’s event came as crime in Oakland continues to surge. Armstrong himself recently reported that his city is experiencing an approximately 90 percent increase in murders, 70 percent increase in shootings, and 88 percent increase in carjackings.

His goal in facilitating the event was to inspire a multi-pronged approach to fighting crime. Attendees marched from the amphitheater to the location where eight individuals were shot on Juneteenth. And the event included a coffin display with 71 white flowers, representative of the 71 members of the Oakland community who have been murdered in Oakland so far this year. Most of the attendees also wore white t-shirts with the phrase “#SAFEOAKLAND.”

“We continue to see shootings every night in the city,” Armstrong said. “It is time we come together and we unite behind reducing gun violence in the city of Oakland.”

“There are people in our community who don’t feel safe. There are seniors in our community who cannot come out at night. There are young, African-American men and Latino men that are at risk in our city. We have to come together; this is not about politics, this is about saving lives,” Armstrong continued.

Armstrong recently made headlines when he slammed Oakland’s City Council for defunding the police department by nearly $18 million. Since money has been diverted from the police budget to “social services aimed at violence prevention,” he says the community needs to become more actively involved in crime reduction.

Oakland resident Carol Wyatt agreed, saying her city “cannot move past the burials, the memorials and the wakes.” “Gun violence is our community’s longtime pandemic,” she lamented.

“We need your help — we need everyone’s help — because we want this to be the safest Oakland that we can possibly make it,” Brenda Grisham said. Her 17-year-old son was shot and murdered in Oakland in 2010. Grisham says “It’s on all of us to build a safer city.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/07/12/anti-police-protesters-disrupt-black-families-mourning-victims-of-violent-crime-in-oakland/,2021-07-12
"CBS News Blames Trump, Not Communism, For Cuba’s Broken Economy","CBS News blamed former President Donald Trump and his administration’s policies for Cuba’s poverty and broken economy, instead of the island’s communist regime.

In a Monday segment of “CBS This Morning,” the corporate media outlet amplified President Miguel Díaz-Canel’s claims that the anti-authoritarian protests erupting in Cuba are objecting to economic backsliding caused by Trump’s sanctions and designation of Cuba as a “state sponsor of terrorism” shortly before he left office.

“On Cuban television, Díaz-Canel blamed the protests on the U.S. and its trade embargo for a severe impact on Cuba’s recent economic downturn,” the news narrator stated.

CBS then brought on Portia Siegelbaum, a CBS News producer in Cuba, to echo the authoritarian regime’s excuses and pile onto the anti-Trump narrative.

“The Trump administration passed many more regulations, many more sanctions against it, which basically has cut off all income coming into Cuba,” she said. “I think the Biden administration, he at least said at the beginning he was going to review this policy and make changes but nothing has happened.”

Thousands of Cubans gathered across the island to protest the communist regime by yelling for “Liberty” and “Freedom” and demanding Díaz-Canel resign. While Díaz-Canel continues to deflect blame for the country’s increasingly dire COVID-19 and economic conditions, others say this outrage was a long time coming.

“Cuba does not have a president, Cuba has a manager that manages the Castro family’s business center, one of which is the island of Cuba,” Marcell Felipe, founder of Inspire America, told The Federalist. “There is no longer revolution. All that’s left is a dictatorship. It’s evolved into a criminal enterprise that uses politics to justify their criminal activity … this middle-level manager that they’ve appointed tries to hide the fact that communism doesn’t work. It hasn’t worked in Cuba, it hasn’t worked anywhere.”

The Biden White House called the protests “spontaneous expressions” and failed to issue a harsh condemnation of communism, socialism, or the regime that caused what Press Secretary Jen Psaki merely labels “economic mismanagement.”

Sympathetic responses from corporate outlets like CBS, paired with the White House’s failure to harshly condemn the communist regime, received backlash from fed-up U.S. legislators.

“We must stand with the people of #Cuba who have taken to the streets to demand freedom!” Republican Rep. María Elvira Salazar tweeted.

“The protests in #Cuba began over 24 hours ago,” Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted after the Biden administration released a statement on the protests. “And you forgot something,” the Cuban-American senator added, adding the description “socialist and communist” in the margin of Biden’s statement about the Cuban government.

"Thousands Of Cubans Demand Freedom, Protest Communist Regime","Thousands of Cubans banded together over the weekend to protest the island’s communist regime and the dire, impoverished conditions that come with living under a dictatorship.

In Havana, the nation’s capital, protesters gathered to chant for “Liberty” and “Freedom” while demanding the current President Miguel Díaz-Canel resign.

Other protesters waved an American flag as they marched down the capital city’s streets.

As pent-up rage about the authoritarian regime spread, Cuban officials rushed to block the internet, dismiss anti-government content as “disinformation,” and crack down on dissidents which could further taint the country’s image.

“The order to combat has been given,” the Cuban president said in a nationally televised address. Calling on counter-protesters who support his regime to step in, he added, “Revolutionaries need to be on the streets.”

I warned about this earlier today. It is happening and will continue. By the way, they use a system made, sold & installed by #China to control and block access to the internet in #Cuba. #SOSCuba #PatriaYVida https://t.co/d3a3DkGR59 — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) July 12, 2021

“Cuba is often held up as a poster child of a successful socialist society and it isn’t,” Jim Carafano, vice president for the Heritage Foundation’s Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, told The Federalist. “It’s completely masked an unmitigated failure that’s literally propped up by external partners and an incredibly oppressive regime. This is just a reminder that [while] people think that these kinds of societies lead to better outcomes and more equity, it’s just not true.”

The corporate press, big tech, and the Biden administration also quickly misconstrued the Cubans’ cries when they chose to finally cover the outrage. The New York Times faced backlash on Sunday for tweeting that protesters were “shouting ‘freedom’ and other anti-government slogans.”

https://twitter.com/ChristinaPushaw/status/1414363851848622085?s=20

Twitter was quick to slap a slanted explainer on the trending videos, pictures, and reports which Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (who is Cuban-American) said “ignores this is really about how socialism is a disaster and always leads to tyranny, despair, and suffering.”

“People are helping to spread awareness on the impact of COVID-19 in Cuba as cases hit an all-time high in the country,” Twitter’s trending topics page said, accompanied by the hashtag #SOSCuba.

“Surreal but not surprising,” the senator replied.

Julie Chung, Acting Assistant Secretary for the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, also misrepresented the protests by claiming that they were largely focused on COVID-19.

“Peaceful protests are growing in #Cuba as the Cuban people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express concern about rising COVID cases/deaths & medicine shortages,” Chung tweeted. “We commend the numerous efforts of the Cuban people mobilizing donations to help neighbors in need.”

After facing backlash, Chung quickly followed up with a new statement condemning the regime’s “calls to combat.”

We are deeply concerned by “calls to combat” in #Cuba. We stand by the Cuban people’s right for peaceful assembly. We call for calm and condemn any violence. — Brian A. Nichols (@WHAAsstSecty) July 11, 2021

She also retweeted President Joe Biden’s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan after he said the U.S. “would strongly condemn any violence or targeting of peaceful protestors who are exercising their universal rights.”

While COVID-19 did play a role in the outrage, some contend the country’s medical shortcomings were the “straw that broke the camel’s back” atop a host of deeper concerns.

“Cubans have been dealing with food shortages for decades and tolerating different levels of discomfort, but when they see their healthcare system collapsing under the weight of COVID while the rest of the world gets them under control, it becomes the straw that breaks the camel’s back,” Republican media strategist and former Trump campaign official Giancarlo Sopo told The Federalist. “There’s a widespread sentiment on the island that change is needed.”

While President Biden eventually issued a statement supporting the “Cuban people,” Carafano says the administration missed an opportunity to more strongly assert the nation’s position on communism.

We stand with the Cuban people as they bravely assert their fundamental and universal rights, and as they all call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering. https://t.co/KGY3MFfsw0 — President Biden (@POTUS) July 12, 2021

“Clearly the administration has failed coming out of the box,” he said. “It’s a complete lack of leadership. I think it’s the most humiliating statement from a country that should be leading the free world. We should have a clear, unambiguous statement from the United States and supporting the Cuban people.”

Domenech Examines Pro-Liberty Protests In Cuba With Mike Gonzalez,"Federalist Publisher Ben Domenech was joined by Mike Gonzalez, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, on his Fox News podcast published Monday to discuss the ongoing Cuban pro-liberty protests and what it means for the left.

“So, I think these are demonstrations that were sparked by the government’s botched response to COVID-19,” said Gonzalez. “People are dying in greater numbers. The vaccines that the Cuban government came up with are absolutely basura, trash, didn’t work. The people know it.”

Gonzalez, however, noted the protests broadened in scope and began to be based on the various regime problems understood by the people.

“They morphed right away into pro-liberty protests because what it did was it kind of tapped into frustration,” he said. “The 62 years of economic mismanagement that you always get with socialism. But also political repression of the brutal treatment of the government, by the government, of the people.”

In looking at the 2020 presidential election, Gonzalez and Domenech touched on Donald Trump’s success with Hispanic voters who maintain a negative opinion of Cuban repression. Domenech noted that members of the far-left have romanticized socialism, to which Gonzalez said Marxism is “a cult.”

“The ideology reigns supreme,” he said. “We’re going to have to be dealing with Marxism forever. It’s never going to go away. Our children are going to have to deal with this. They strongly believe in this to the point that it’s quasi-religious. They don’t believe their lying eyes, that socialism is an utter failure everywhere.”

Don't Be Fooled By 'Conservative' Groups Pushing Leftist Civics Education,"The groundwork is being laid for what will essentially be Common Core civics. The last attempt to nationalize K-12 school standards occurred with Common Core English and math. This failed spectacularly in terms of student achievement but staggers on as a vehicle for imposing progressive education and generating cash for the myriad grifter organizations that sprang up to profit from it.

From the perspective of leftist bureaucracies and their affiliated opportunists, Common Core has been a smashing success. So let’s do it again, they say. This time, let’s go for the grand prize: leftist civics instruction which, compared to English and math, will give maximum bang for buck in the cause of promoting political indoctrination in schools.

The Fordham Institute’s Role in Common Core

One of the Common Core profiteers now making the transition to nationalized civics is the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, an Ohio-based think tank that corporate media insist on calling “conservative” or “right-leaning.” But it’s been a long time since Fordham actually pushed conservative policies in education.

According to Jamie Gass of the Pioneer Institute, former Fordham president Chester Finn once criticized the “outsized influence” of D.C. education insider groups. But now, Gass notes, “Fordham is working closely with [such] groups to shift policymaking power from state and local taxpayers … to the federal government and the D.C. blob.” “Maybe the educational establishment is only a bad thing if you’re not part of the club,” Gass adds.

In any event, fueled by millions of dollars from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (also a major financier of Common Core), Fordham threw itself with fervor into the effort to impose the national English and math standards. Fordham’s participation provided conservative cover for the statists behind the centralization initiative. Now it’s playing the same role in civics, which activist educators can use to generate millions of little left-wing community activists.

‘Consensus by Surrender’

That will happen through the imposition of “action civics” (more accurately called “protest civics”). This scheme would encourage or even require students to engage in political advocacy – which means left-wing political advocacy – as part of their civics course.

Leftists are pushing this on a national level via initiatives like Educating for American Democracy (EAD). As Stanley Kurtz has explained, EAD’s self-description as a bipartisan attempt to improve students’ civic knowledge actually conceals a stealth attempt to impose nationalized standards that encourage protest civics. Dominated by leftist individuals and organizations, the EAD coalition has produced a “roadmap” and associated reports that “are thoroughly progressive in both their underlying assumptions and their details.”

Certain professed conservatives have endorsed the EAD initiative as a model of “consensus” on teaching civics, but Kurtz calls this “consensus by surrender.” Fordham is one of these “conservative” groups. Endorsing EAD, Fordham is now replicating its Common Core strategy to install progressive civics instruction in K-12 schools.

Fordham’s schtick is analyzing state curriculum standards and using its analysis to nudge states where it wants them. In the case of English and math, that meant issuing a report mendaciously declaring the merits of the Common Core standards, awarding high grades to the few states that had similar standards, and downgrading states that dared to differ. At that point, the rest of the D.C.-centric education blob took over to shame the low-graded states into adopting the curriculum mandates – Common Core – that had the Fordham seal of approval.

That was in 2010, and it worked beautifully. So here we are in 2021, treated to Fordham’s new review of state standards in civics and U.S. history, “The State of State Standards for Civics and U.S. History in 2021.”

Open Approval of Leftist Civics and History

Once again, Fordham declares itself the arbiter of good standards, this time in civics and history. Once again, a few states are highly graded for meeting that standard. And once again, states that don’t follow Fordham’s template are downgraded and criticized.

What is the approved template for civics study? Although Fordham includes a vague, noncommittal statement about the term “action civics,” it’s clear from a broader review of the report that standards pushing political advocacy get a gold star, while standards focusing on academic content rather than protest receive a wag of the disapproving finger.

“Some civic dispositions are habitual, meaning they should be practiced as well as preached,” Fordham lectures, “which is why the strongest civics standards insist on students’ active participation.” The report evaluated schools based partially on the “essential dispositions” they imparted to students. One such “disposition” demanded: “Students should be motivated to educate themselves on major social and political issues [and] to make a difference in those that are important to them.”

State standards earning kudos from Fordham include Utah’s requirement that students engage in political advocacy, a requirement Fordham praises as “exactly right.” South Dakota wins plaudits for its “explicit call to ‘organize actions for social justice.’” Listed among the strengths of the New Jersey standards is the “active citizenship” strand, which Fordham approvingly describes as “an unapologetic call to arms.”

Since when should schools be in the business of calling students to arms over political issues? Proponents of such a concept can be described as many things, but not conservative. Fordham is once again hiding behind its undeserved “right-leaning” reputation to help impose leftist education policies.

While the EAD coalition and other proponents of protest civics will cite Fordham’s support as proof of bipartisan consensus, Fordham sold out long ago to the leftist education establishment and has profited handsomely from doing so. Parents and policymakers should not be fooled.

"Global Protests Erupt Over Tyrannical Attempts To Force Lockdowns, Vaxx","Protests broke out in multiple Western countries this past week, as thousands of citizens in Australia, France, Italy, and the U.K. took to the streets to push back against government-mandated lockdowns and COVID-19 vaccine passports.

Australia

In the nation’s largest city of Sydney, protesters voiced opposition to newly implemented lockdown restrictions by the New South Wales government. According to the Daily Caller, the city has already been subject to a four-week lockdown.

Following 111 newly confirmed cases and the death of a man in his 80s, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian issued an extended stay-at-home order for the areas of Fairfield, Canterbury-Bankstown, and Liverpool, mandating that residents cannot leave their local government areas until July 30. Moreover, the order calls for restrictions on businesses and construction sites, while also designating which citizens are permitted to leave their homes and for what reasons.

Per the Daily Caller, “During the protests, many people were heard chanting ‘freedom,’ and signs with phrases like ‘unmask the truth’ and ‘no forced vaccines, no vax passports’ were seen among the crowd. Some violence also broke out as protesters clashed with police officers who tried to disband the demonstrations.”

Sydney police have arrested and charged 57 people, with New South Wales Police Deputy Commissioner Mal Lanyon encouraging Aussie citizens to share any footage of the protests with law enforcement so authorities can identify and punish remaining violators.

France

More than 160,000 people took to the streets of Paris and various other cities to protest a proposed law that would mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for health care workers and require citizens to carry a special virus pass for all restaurants and domestic travel.

According to Fox News, “Protesters chanting ‘Liberty! Liberty!’ gathered at Bastille plaza and marched through eastern Paris in one of several demonstrations Saturday around France.” Protesters were also present across the Seine River from the Eiffel Tower.

In the town of Chambéry, more than 300 protesters stormed the locality’s town hall while shouting various chants, including “No to the [vaccine] pass,” and “Macron must resign!” Soon after, demonstrators took down the official portrait of French President Emmanuel Macron.

Despite the massive showings, French lawmakers passed the law early Monday, giving health care workers until Sept. 15 to get vaccinated or face possible suspension. In order to get the “health pass,” citizens must have proof of vaccination, recently tested negative, or recently recovered from the virus.

In response to the backlash, Macron, who backed the legislation, publicly criticized the demonstrations.

“What is your freedom worth if you say to me, ‘I don’t want to be vaccinated,’ but tomorrow you infect your father, your mother, or myself?” he said.

Italy

Similar to France, Italy recently implemented its own version of vaccine passports in the form of “green passes.” Starting Aug. 6, the passes will be required “to enter cinemas, museums, indoor swimming pools or sports stadiums, or eat indoors at restaurants.” Moreover, “It will serve as proof bearers have either been vaccinated, undergone a recent negative Covid-19 test, or recovered from a coronavirus infection.”

“The health pass is an instrument to allow Italians to continue their activities with the guarantee of not being among contagious people,” said Prime Minister Mario Draghi. “No vaccines means new lockdowns.”

A proposal to expand the pass to incorporate public transportation is expected to be re-evaluated in September.

“I invite all Italians to get vaccinated and do it immediately,” said Draghi, while also arguing that avoiding vaccination “is an appeal to die.”

In response to the mandate, thousands of Italian citizens protested across major cities, chanting phrases such as “Freedom,” “Down with the dictatorship,” and “No green pass” while waving the Italian flag. Demonstrations had previously been announced for Saturday in at least 80 cities across the country, including Rome, Milan, and Naples.

The United Kingdom

In London’s Trafalgar Square in the U.K., at least 15,000 demonstrators gathered to protest the country’s new lockdown measures and COVID-19 vaccination mandates. Most recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced he plans “to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather” by the end of September through the use of the National Health Service’s COVID Pass.

“The vaccine passport system is the final straw, it’s the thin end of the wedge,” one protester told Breitbart News. “Deaths have dropped, people are getting vaccinated, and in theory, that’s supposed to protect us, and here we still are. I see no end to it, they are never going to let go of the powers that they have stolen, they are loving it too much.”

Additionally, another protester said that although he had already had one dose of the COVID vaccine and was by no means an “anti-vaxxer,” he insisted, “I will not show my papers when the state asks for them because it has no right to do so.”

Other countries that have seen an increase in pushback against government-mandated COVID-19 vaccine passports include Slovakia, Ireland, and Greece, among others. Lawmakers in Germany have proposed similar French-style passports, but have faced pushback from German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

"German Police Brawl With Anti-Lockdown Protesters, Amid Growing Opposition To COVID Mandates","Thousands of German civilians protested new government COVID-19 lockdowns and vaccine passports across 13 separate demonstrations in Berlin on Sunday. Local authorities had banned such weekend protests, but countless Germans refused to be forced into silence and proceeded to demonstrate anyways, causing German authorities to deploy approximately 2,000 police officers onto Berlin’s streets in riot gear.

Over a year into lockdowns, Germany requires that individuals show vaccine passports, proof of recovery from COVID-19 or proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test, in order to dine indoors or book a hotel room, among other activities.

According to video footage obtained on Twitter, Berlin police officers brawled with anti-lockdown civilians, who have grown tired of tyrannical rules, throughout Berlin’s streets.

Police told the press that they were “harassed and attacked,” while protesters allegedly ignored roadblocks. Video footage shows both law enforcement and civilians initiating confrontations, which many establishment media outlets omitted.

Police detained protesters, but the crowds kept marching from Berlin’s Charlottenburg neighborhood toward Brandenburg Gate. Around 600 protesters were detained in total, while the police used irritants and batons to try to quell the crowds.

In one instance, a 49-year-old man collapsed and died, shortly after breaking through a street barrier. According to The Guardian, his cause of death is still unknown.

Is Germany Spying on Anti-Lockdown Groups?

Among other demonstrations, local authorities preemptively banned the Querdenker movement, the “most visible anti-lockdown movement in Germany,” according the Associated Press, from organizing a protest over the weekend. The movement has gathered thousands of Germans from across the political spectrum to challenge the government’s mandates. They view the government’s response to COVID as being fascistic and condemn vaccine mandates as a modern form of apartheid.

The German government sees the Querdenker movement as a threat to its power. Not only has Germany limited its citizens’ speech when it comes to protesting COVID-19 mandates, but the BBC recently reported that Germany’s domestic intelligence service is spying on members of the Querdenker movement, “amid concerns [that] they may be trying to delegitimize the state” and that their opinions could be dangerous to the status quo.

AP reports the movement includes “those opposing vaccinations, coronavirus deniers, conspiracy theorists and right-wing extremists.” However, the Querdenker movement’s founder, Michael Ballweg, vehemently rejects this portrayal of his group, arguing that “[he and his colleagues] are a peaceful movement and not a political party.”

Members of the German elite nonetheless find Ballweg’s movement threatening. Germany’s Parliament President Wolfgang Schäuble recently mouthed off about protesters, suggesting they should let the experts do all the thinking.

“If practically all experts worldwide say the coronavirus is dangerous and vaccination helps, then who actually has the right to say, ‘Actually, I’m smarter than that?’” Schäuble asked. “To me, that is an almost unbearable level of arrogance.”

Schäuble’s rhetoric does not appear to have put his people at ease, and more demonstrations in Germany are planned.

Global Opposition to COVID-19 Mandates

The German people aren’t the only ones to challenge their government’s COVID policies. For the third weekend in a row of protests, over 200,000 individuals gathered in France on Saturday to challenge their country’s vaccine mandates. The weekend prior, over 80,000 frustrated civilians similarly protested in Italy.

Such protests have persisted for weeks. As Federalist intern Shawn Fleetwood recently reported, civilians have challenged forced lockdowns and vaccine passports everywhere from Australia and France, to Italy and the United Kingdom.

Protesters in Sydney, Australia recently chanted “freedom,” while holding signs with quotations like “unmask the truth” and “no forced vaccines, no vax passports.” In France, tens of thousands of protesters gathered on July 24, with some of them shouting “Liberty! Liberty!” on Bastille plaza. Italian citizens recently gathered across Italy to protest the country’s vaccine passports, with many of them chanting “Freedom” and “Down with the dictatorship.”

One U.K. protester recently told Breitbart News that, “The vaccine passport system is the final straw, it’s the thin edge of the wedge. …Deaths have dropped, people are getting vaccinated, and in theory, that’s supposed to protect us, and here we still are.”

“I see no end to it, they are never going to let go of the powers that they have stolen, they are loving it too much,” she lamented.

The people of Slovakia, Ireland, and Greece, among others, have also pushed back strongly against vaccine passports.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/08/02/german-police-brawl-with-anti-lockdown-protesters-amid-growing-opposition-to-covid-mandates-across-europe/,2021-08-02
Group Behind Hong Kong Protests Disbands Amid China Crackdown,"The Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), the pro-democracy group behind Hong Kong’s annual July 1 rally and the famous street protests of 2019, has announced it is disbanding amid the city’s crackdown on groups and individuals opposed to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

“In the course of over a year, the government continuously used the pandemic as a reason to reject the demonstration applications of CHRF and other groups — each member group was oppressed, and civil society was facing unprecedented challenges,” the group said in a statement. “Even though CHRF no longer exists today, we believe that different organisations will still keep their beliefs, not forget about their original intentions, and support civil society.”

The organization added that its roughly HK$1.6 million worth of assets would be donated to “appropriate groups.”

According to Reuters, the group “was established in 2002 with an aim to provide a platform for different organizations to promote the development of human rights and civil society in Hong Kong.” Moreover, CHRF “organized the global financial centre’s first July 1 rally in 2003 that saw half a million people took to the streets to protest against a draft national security law, known as Article 23, that was later shelved.”

Hong Kong police issued a statement on Sunday, arguing that law enforcement will spare no effort in punishing violators of the city’s national security law.

“The police reiterated that for crimes committed by an organization and its members, the criminal responsibility will not be wiped out due to the disbandment or resignation of the members,” the statement read.

The move to disband CHRF comes as the group faces intense pressure from city officials aligned with the CCP. According to local reporting, Hong Kong police have recently launched an investigation into CHRF for alleged violations of the Hong Kong national security law.

“Anyone who violates the law, they better not think they can escape,” Police Commissioner Raymond Siu Chak-yee told a local newspaper. When pressed by ABC News on the matter, however, the Hong Kong Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.

Unsurprisingly, China responded positively to the news, with the country’s state-run CGTN cable channel claiming that “few tears will be shed” over the group’s dissolution.

“Dominated by attention seekers and bigots, it prided itself on organizing mass protests and inflaming tensions and became a magnet for anti-China elements hoping to sabotage the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ principle,” the network said. “Given that its antics are incompatible with the values of a civilized society, the restoration of decency and sanity has rendered its demise inevitable.”

Iran Cements Its Advantage While Biden Sleeps,"Six months into President Joe Biden’s term, several sanctions against Iran were lifted and new ones imposed as the administration seeks to cajole Iran back to the negotiating table over their nuclear capacity. While the messaging from Washington, and the signaling from Tehran, was mixed, one thing was clear this past July in the southwestern city of Ahvaz: people were thirsty. On July 15, after weeks of irregular access to water and periods of several hours with no water, a spontaneous protest emerged.

Desperate, angry citizens took to the streets and blocked roads as the growing service shortages plaguing Iran reached a breaking point. Dubbed the Uprising of the Thirsty, within days the protests were province-wide then soon spread around the country and into Tehran. Citizens blamed the government, and widespread corruption, for water and power shortages, and in some instances chanted “Death to the dictator.”

Some reports indicate the regime was taken aback by the speed at which the protests spread, the biggest in the capital since after the mistaken downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane in January 2020. Security forces killed protesters in cities near Ahvaz and the government throttled Internet service to limit organizers’ ability. Given the frequency of unrest in the past several years, the regime by now has a well-worn playbook, much of it dedicated to suppressing demonstrators with deadly force.

So, despite the protests’ organic and widespread nature, there will be no revolution this year. Still, an important evolution has taken place in Iran in 2021. Conventional wisdom has for years suggested that relief from Western sanctions is a drastic and urgent need for the regime. But a more careful read of their actions in 2021 suggests relief as maybe the third or fourth priority of the government.

These Leaders Are Not Motivated By Compassion

Iran’s leaders recognize the economic pain and domestic dissatisfaction that result from sanctions do not pose an existential threat to a regime willing to rule through hard power. Its protesters and would-be revolutionaries lack much international support.

The regime survived shooting a young woman named Neda in the chest on video in 2009, drawing harshly worded statements from around the world, and little else. The Green Revolution more than a decade ago made clear: no one is coming to help the Iranian people. The mullahs will suppress widespread dissent with proven, and sadly well precedented, force.

Ensuring regime stability is the first and ultimate goal. After that, the actions of the mullahs suggest that access to hard cash and balancing against Israel are the regime’s next two highest priorities.

In fact, Iran’s recent attack on an Israeli-affiliated tanker is not just about cementing proxy advantage in any of the region’s particular conflicts, nor the typical angling for military superiority of two regional powers. That attack serves a more immediate need. Specifically, the Iranians rely on a naval deterrent to prevent the interdiction of ships selling reduced-rate oil for cash to Syria and China—one way they blunt the ability of sanctions to rob them of operating funds.

So the regime now knows that deadly crackdowns and evading sanctions are not showstopping impediments to its domestic and regional goals. It knows foreign governments lack the will to crack down on illicit oil shipments, and it knows it can survive even temporarily destabilizing protests.

Regime Stability Is a Key Goal

Seeing those lifelines, it chose to abandon even the veneer of election legitimacy in bringing in hardliner Ebrahim Raisi to the presidency this summer. The mullahs broke with longstanding tradition and fixed the June presidential election in a dramatic and obvious manner. The fix was so obvious that a majority of Iranians stayed home, knowing who Supreme Leader Khamenei’s handpicked candidate was, as speculation also increased that Raisi may transition from president to supreme leader when the aging Khamenei dies.

Previously, the presidency was a mechanism for at least limited domestic reflection of popular concerns. Instead, it’s now occupied by a man himself a symbol of and groomed for only one interest: regime stability.

In the past few years, Iran has attacked U.S. forces, a U.K. ship, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and planned further attacks in Washington, Paris, and elsewhere. These military operations supplement the ongoing proxy maneuvers and paramilitary meddling they conduct in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and elsewhere.

Hard power reigns in the region, and Iran is wielding it to the most effect. None of this activity is simply explainable as Iran “ratcheting up tensions” in the push for a deal or “strengthening their hand” in advance of one. The deal is just not very relevant anymore; maybe third or fourth on their list of priorities, and even the Israeli sabotage campaign against their nuclear program has not prevented further enrichment of fissile material.

The Deterrent Is Israel

The hard power calculation underlying the region now is certainly not Iran estimating how the United States will respond to their nuclear program, nor fear of Gulf states with limited military capacity. It’s the open Israel-Iran conflict: not quite a war, certainly not peace.

The deterrent is Israel, not a United States unwilling to even retaliate against Iranian attacks on facilities in Iraq manned by U.S. personnel. Iran’s freedom of action is everything that won’t provoke a full-fledged war with Israel. Few, if any, other guardrails exist.

The extent of Iranian meddling in the region has essentially created a new sub-state order, one subject to Iranian control. Through these interventions, Iran has a veto over the domestic politics experienced by millions of people, a manifestation of the Islamic revolution absent the formal overthrows typically associated with this.

It’s not that they rule those countries, but it’s more than foreign meddling, a kind of “soft sovereignty.” Iran does not determine every domestic choice in these countries, but it does mean that by using subversive proxy support in places like Lebanon and Iraq they have the ability to override democratic institutions at key moments and shape the acceptable window of outcomes. Sponsored, armed militias get a veto over outcomes they don’t like.

What Happens When the United States Weakens

The region cannot make progress in these conditions. A radical aggressive hegemon and regional piece cannot coexist, and conflict, delayed humanitarian progress, and frustration will remain the norm.

The U.S. is unwilling to force a further step-change in regional dynamics. Iran gets that. Israel gets that. The Gulf powers get that. So, what does a Middle East with an uninterested U.S. look like?

Two critical variables will determine much, with potential implications for not just the region but the world. The first is whether other nation-states in the region break open, a la Syria and Yemen. If that happens, a broader instability spiral could emerge, with the number of refugees and internally displaced at some point nearly equaling the number of settled, preventing virtually any progress from being made both regionally or in individual countries.

The second is whether the existing low-level conflict can sustain as-is with only the occasional boil-over or whether major state-to-state war breaks out, with Iran enlisting its proxies across the region in subversion and regional sabotage. If the pace of the current unnamed but open conflict—already involving naval vessels in the Mediterranean, armed drones in Iraq and Syria, and long-range missiles in Yemen—quickens, our ability to call it anything other than regional war won’t be the only thing on shaky ground.

Press Makes No Outcry Over Antifa Routinely Assaulting Journalists,"From covering displaced refugees around the globe to the obstacles faced by protesters seeking change in America, freelance photojournalist Maranie Staab believes her camera can be a force for truth and social justice. The work of a “conflict photographer” often requires physical courage in places she has reported from, such as Africa and the Middle East. It certainly did so on Aug. 22, while Staab was covering demonstrations in Portland, Ore.

Members of the left-wing group antifa called her a “slut” and then demanded that journalists assembled to cover the protests “get the f— out.” Staab, a 2020 reporting fellow for the liberal Pulitzer Center, tried to calm the situation. She was assaulted. She told the Willamette Week that they grabbed her phone and smashed it.

Then they threw her to the pavement and sprayed her with mace. The ugly assault on Staab (below) was filmed and distributed quickly online, resulting in widespread condemnation. “If we’re on a public street and a newsworthy event is occurring, you’re not going to tell me what I can and cannot film,” Staab told the weekly newspaper.

Antifascists threatened to “smash cameras” of journalists, and targeted @MaranieRae personally. She approached to speak to their group, and they shot paint and mace at her and threw her on the ground. As she recovered, one shot more paint at both her and press helping her.

For the small band of reporters willing cover the violent left-wing radicals in antifa, such attacks are distressingly common. Protest mayhem has been in the news since the murder of George Floyd last summer brought many Black Lives Matter and antifa activists out on the streets. But the anti-media animus of antifa – which, unlike BLM, focuses on deliberately attacking reporters – has been an issue for years.

“We are deeply concerned by the increase in attacks on journalists working in the United States,” the Committee to Protect Journalists tells RealClearInvestigations. “Since 2017, the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker has documented 517 journalists attacked during protests, 400 of those in 2020 alone. Attacking reporters who are covering matters of public interest is never okay.”

Despite the alarming increase in such attacks, reporters who cover antifa express frustration that the condemnation of the attack on Staab was an aberration. More often than not, antifa’s attacks on the press have gone ignored, with the police typically standing back in the current climate of hostility toward law enforcement.

The journalists who have done significant reporting on the loose-knit group are of divergent backgrounds and motivations, but tend to have one thing in common – they represent a new breed of journalist without the backing of traditional corporate media outlets. Instead, they rely on social media to break news. Some of their work has been criticized by other journalists who claim they blur the line between professional reporting and activism.

No reporter is better known for covering antifa than Andy Ngo, author of the best-selling book “Unmasked: Inside Antifa’s Radical Plan to Destroy Democracy.” Ngo, the son of Vietnamese immigrants, first started reporting on protest violence for the Portland State Vanguard, Portland State University’s student newspaper, in 2016. He was fired from his job at the paper the next year after he was accused of sensationalizing a clip of a Muslim student at a university event saying that “being an infidel is not allowed” in Muslim countries. This ended Ngo’s traditional journalism career, but the story blew up online and was picked up by conservative media nationally.

With left-wing violence largely ignored by legacy news organizations, Ngo quickly found there was a market for coverage of Portland’s growing problem with street violence — notably by antifa, a largely decentralized, avowedly anti-fascist and anti-racist political movement without an identifiable leader or spokesperson that is concentrated in the Pacific Northwest.

Soon Ngo was in the streets working as a freelance reporter while his Twitter feed became a nationally known clearinghouse for information related to antifa – everything from videos of violence and vandalism to the ensuing mugshots and charging documents. Ngo currently works as editor-at-large for a right-leaning web outlet, The Post Millennial. However, his journalism is still largely defined by his outsized social media presence, to say nothing of his reputation for angering antifa.

In June of 2019, Ngo was jumped by a crowd of antifa protesters while reporting on a demonstration in the city. They kicked him in the groin, repeatedly punched him in the head while wearing tactical gloves with fiberglass-reinforced knuckles, and then pelted him with hard objects. Ngo ended up in the hospital with a brain hemorrhage.

Ngo says he has been attacked four times and no longer lives in Portland out of concern for his safety, but antifa regularly show up and make menacing appearances at his aging mother’s house in the city. Graffiti has appeared in Portland saying, “Kill Andy Ngo” and “Andy Ngo 187” – 187 being a police code to denote a murder. “It’s just been this constant incitement to kill me,” he says. “That’s why I left at the end of last year,” Ngo said. When he returned to Portland this past May, he said, he was chased down a street and beaten and bloodied. He narrowly escaped when he took refuge in a hotel, with the antifa mob surrounding the lobby doors and demanding that he come outside.

RCI could find only one other statement from the society’s Oregon’s chapter condemning an attack by left-wing protesters, one earlier this year involving Justin Yau, a journalist working for Willamette Week. The organization did not respond to RCI’s request for other examples of its condemnation of attacks on other reporters or for comment on this article. SPJ’s national president, Rebecca Aguilar, said in an email Wednesday that she would need more time to issue a “proper response,” acknowledging “a very dangerous situation for journalists seeking the truth.” (Reporters Without Borders, the international organization, also did not respond to a request for comment on antifa attacks on reporters.)

Ngo isn’t alone in thinking that these attacks on the press are being downplayed. So does Nancy Rommelmann, who as a journalist has written for the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, and has been an author for decades. Her well-received 2018 book, “To the Bridge: A True Story of Motherhood and Murder,” detailed an infamous case of infanticide in Portland. As a longtime area resident who watched her husband’s small business suffer from antifa’s violence, she felt compelled to get to the bottom of what was happening. Working as a freelancer, she filed several reports on antifa and street violence in Portland for the libertarian magazine Reason.

She was attacked in the streets, she says, and threatened online, with her photo publicly posted. Rommelmann believes the traditional media are ignoring the street violence for political reasons – they don’t want antifa’s extremism to be seen as discrediting to liberal causes. “I can tell you that 100% of the people that have attacked and continue to attack me, they’re all on the left – all of them. And I consider myself a liberal,” Rommelmann said.

To the extent that traditional news media are forced to cover antifa, Rommelmann says, they do so only when its adherents clash with right-wing protesters, and draw equivalencies with right-wing violence regardless of whether comparisons are warranted.

After the assault on Staab last month, Rommelmann began venting on Twitter about why the media refused to acknowledge that “black bloc protesters [those wearing black ski masks and other garments to obscure their identities] in Portland are the MAIN source of violence. Proud Boys and right-wing groups rolled through [just] four times in 2020. Then who tf was committing the violence every night?”

She then linked to video footage she took of a man in downtown Portland trying to smash a window with a fire extinguisher. “I was reminded, again, of a Portland editor telling someone my reporting ‘infers without actual evidence,’” she tweeted. “Like, what, my eyeballs were rolled in flour? I didn’t have my phone stolen? We are supposed to believe the guy who says I staged this video in a studio?”

.@mtaibbi links video to what happened in Portland this weekend. THIS HAPPENED ALL THE TIME WHEN I WAS ON THE GROUND! Taibbi is right to write, ""It’s time the wider press took more notice, because this is not an aberration with this type of activist"" but what took so f*king long? — Nancy Rommelmann (@NancyRomm) August 25, 2021

There’s no question that attacks on journalists are common from angry Americans on the right. The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker notes a number of recent violent episodes at school board meetings and anti-COVID restriction protests. But a number of the right-wing groups that clash with antifa don’t necessarily have hostile relationships with the media. Joey Gibson, the founder of Patriot Prayer, a right-wing group active in Portland known for clashing with antifa, has shown a willingness to be profiled and talk to reporters. The difference with antifa is that it espouses an explicit ideology that compels its adherents to attack the press.

In “The Antifa Handbook,” radical Rutgers University lecturer Mark Bray observes that First Amendment beliefs are held only by “a minority of today’s anti-fascists in the United States.” Bray writes that they distrust the press because, “instead of privileging allegedly ‘neutral’ universal rights, anti-fascists prioritize the political project of destroying fascism and protecting the vulnerable regardless of whether their actions are considered violations of the free speech of fascists or not.”

Rommelmann reports that “‘YOU’RE NOT ALLOWED TO FILM’ and its occasional variation, ‘PHOTOGRAPHY EQUALS DEATH!’” are rallying cries at protests where antifa is present. And at the same time some antifa protesters assault independent journalists and smash their cameras, she says, radical activists run around protests with PRESS emblazoned on their clothing as a putative “Independent Press Corps” in league with antifa. The goal is to shut down impartial reporters covering events so that the only photos and video footage released on social media are hand-selected by antifa to make police look bad and for other propaganda purposes. “It’s a revolution via the cellphone video they allow you to see,” Rommelmann said.

Rommelmann says this strategy of limiting what people see appeared to work when antifa and allied leftist groups laid siege to the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse in downtown Portland for a month last summer.

“They would then disseminate [their own recordings] to news organizations around the country and around the world and on their own Instagrams. And they would form a narrative and the narrative was, all from the Antifa black bloc saying, the protesters are beleaguered. Were the feds inside shooting things out at the protesters? Hell, yeah. Mostly hours after the protesters had been shooting stuff at them, but that was not the story that was getting disseminated,” Rommelmann says. “The story that was getting disseminated was, ‘People on the right bad, people on the left good.’ Well, when I would try to bring some balance to this, I had my phone stolen. I was called a fascist and that continues to this day, because of the narrative that’s seeped out in the mainstream media.”

Making matters worse, the media readily adopted the simplistic and inaccurate framing of protest violence because it fed into national political narratives. “There seemed to be this sense, amid the massive pro-Trump/anti-Trump environment of last year’s protests, that if you said one eenie-weenie bad thing about the violence, it meant you were, at best, anti-protest movement, and at worst a racist,” Rommelmann says. “This caused the cognitive dissonance we saw on both ‘sides’: Fox News shouting, ‘SAVAGES COMING TO YOUR TOWN!!!’ and the CNN anchor in Kenosha standing in front of an absolute conflagration and saying, ‘It’s really mostly peaceful.’”

More broadly, many news outlets downplayed the left-wing violence associated with the broader protest movement that swept the country in the wake of the murder of a black man, George Floyd, at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer. According to data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project – an independent organization that receives funding from the State Department, German Foreign Office, and University of Texas – during the peak months of the protests last summer, there were 11,541 “civil-society incidents.” Of those events, 1,101 devolved into some form of violence or rioting, and 933 of the violent incidents directly involved events affiliated with Black Lives Matter.

The organization’s data is pulled from media reports, so this figure is likely understating the problem. Nevertheless, many news outlets reported on the findings as if they absolved BLM and the left of violence. “About 93% of racial justice protests in the U.S. since the death of George Floyd have been peaceful and nondestructive, according to a new report,” reported CNN. “The findings, released Thursday, contradict assumptions and claims by some that protests associated with the Black Lives Matter movement are spawning violence and destruction of property.”

Counterinsurgency expert David Kilcullen, a senior adviser to Gen. David Petraeus and one of the architects of the “surge” in Iraq, said those stats were more in line with the levels of violence seen in war zones, writing that:

[T]he argument that the protests have been ‘largely peaceful’ may be true, but it is also irrelevant. Only a tiny minority – 2 to 5 percent – of individuals in insurgencies, civil wars, or criminal gangs actually commit violence. In Iraq during the ‘Surge,’ my team started from the assumption that 20 percent of insurgents would prove so irreconcilably violent that they would never negotiate and must therefore be killed or captured. We were off by an order of magnitude – the true number was not 20, but 2 percent.

Even as outlets including the Guardian and the Washington Post published articles dismissing left-wing violence — including a Post fact-check piece last summer declaring, “Who caused the violence at protests? It wasn’t antifa” — others attacked the journalists trying to cover the protests.

In May, the left-wing publication The Intercept published a lengthy feature headlined “ Meet the Riot Squad: Right-Wing Reporters Whose Viral Videos Are Used to Smear BLM ,” which identified a “tight-knit group of eight young journalists” who travel around the country and report on street violence. The article highlighted instances where reporters critical of left-wing protesters shared video of street violence that appeared to be either selectively edited or missing important context. This is bad journalism for sure, but it’s also a problem endemic to social media. All journalists covering breaking news – not just those dedicated to covering antifa – have been incentivized to rush to get viral clips online or share clips they’ve been given without knowing the context, and examples of it are widespread.

The article was quickly denounced by a founder of The Intercept, Glenn Greenwald, who resigned from the website during the 2020 presidential campaign citing censorship of his work and “ideological homogeneity.” “This is what so much ‘journalism’ is now,” Greenwald tweeted. “They believe that the real menaces are individuals who have politics or ideology different than their liberal orthodoxies. So these reporters are now like criminals to them because they report for right-wing sites, thus this targeting.”

Robert Mackey, one of the Intercept article’s co-authors, tweeted in response: “These journalists are public figures, already familiar faces on the most-watched prime time shows on the most-watched television news network in America; what is overlooked is how their reporting and video is used by Fox to distort the real scope of violence at BLM protests. … There have been assaults on some conservative video journalists by left-wing protesters who view them as propagandists, attacks I reported and showed in the video and denounced forcefully in my article. The claim that I intended to promote more attacks is false and repulsive.”

Facing similar criticism from the left, Andy Ngo has been dogged by accusations that he should not be treated as a legitimate journalist because critics accuse him of having reported misleading information and not reporting on antifa objectively. An article in the Columbia Journalism Review referred to him as a “discredited provocateur.”

Ngo does much of his reporting on Twitter and social media, in part due to a lack of interest in antifa from the broader media. Leftists on Twitter complained that the social media platform labeled him a journalist on the site’s curated newsfeed, so in response Twitter relabeled him an “author.” Twitter also took away Ngo’s coveted “blue check” that signifies his is an account verified by the platform.

Twitter’s move prompted an editorial in the New York Post defending Ngo’s reporting. “How is he not a journalist? Indeed, that he’s doing the work that establishment outlets skip out on makes him more of a journo than the members of the press who turn a blind eye to Antifa’s violence,” the paper wrote.

Ngo’s reporting has always made it clear that he’s critical of antifa. Moreover, if making the occasional error or having a point of view is disqualifying for a journalist, the New York Times and Washington Post — and the vast majority of reporters and editors in the country — would have their press credentials revoked.

The criticism of Ngo is particularly galling when one considers that his main point of view is that “political violence is wrong.” And while Ngo’s nontraditional, social-media-heavy approach to reporting might be disdained by traditional media outlets, he has distinguished himself by authoring a best-selling book on antifa and having a track record of breaking several major stories.

Ngo, however, remains undeterred. In June, when a reporter from the left-leaning sports site Deadspin was among those demanding Twitter stop calling Ngo a journalist, he responded. “My detractors do this because they want to take away the one thing that all decent people agree on: press freedom is sacred,” Ngo wrote. “Who the far-left defines as ‘press’ are those who write what they approve of. Anyone else is a ‘provocateur’ deserving of intimidation and violence.”

"Liz Cheney, Democrats Target Americans For Exercising Right To Protest","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Jan. 6 select committee is targeting private citizens over the free exercise to petition and protest, a primary pillar of American democracy the partisan probe purports to protect.

On Wednesday, the committee unveiled its latest round of subpoenas in its investigation, including subpoenas for 11 organizers of peaceful demonstrations between Jan. 5-6. The organizers collectively petitioned the government to hold a protest, were granted permission to hold that protest, and are now being investigated in a politicized probe by vindictive lawmakers who seek punishment for any and all involved regardless of their presence at the Capitol.

Even leftists have recognized the latest subpoenas targeting citizens for holding a protest as extreme overreach.

“At minimum, there needs to be some distinction between people who actually participated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol and those who were in D.C. lawfully exercising their right to protest,” said Elizabeth Goitein, the co-director of the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program, fearing a “dangerous precedent.”

The Brennan Center is a radical leftist group.

That the subpoenas are a bridge too far for them illustrates how radical the move is — or, really just shows how scared they are about Republicans using the same pretext.

“For instance, I worry about a future committee, under different leadership, finding some pretext to subpoena the emails and text messages of Black Lives Matter leaders or other racial justice activists,” Goeitein added.

While lawmakers on Capitol Hill hold oversight powers to subpoena records from executive agencies, the legislature’s investigative powers targeting private citizens are far more narrow. The subpoenas issued by the committee to date possess no legislative purpose but were instead crafted to generate more exposure to paint the Capitol riot as rising to the same level as the terrorist attacks on 9/11. Only by doing so, Democrats in partnership with NeverTrump Reps. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., and Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., who was stripped of her number three role in House leadership this spring, are targeting American citizens.

Those newly subpoenaed by the committee include Amy Kremer, Caroline Wren, and Maggie Mulvaney, the niece of former President Donald Trump’s former Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. The probe has also used its subpoena power to compel records from Trump campaign operative Katrina Pierson and Cindy Chafian, whose group organized an event the day prior to the Capitol riot. Others subpoenaed for their roles in organizing the “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House on Jan. 6 include Tim Unes, Justin Caporale, Megan Powers, Kylie Jane Kremer, Hannah Salem Stone, and Lyndon Brentnall.

Since its inception, the Jan. 6 committee has taken the shape of a partisan show-trial sought to weaponize the legislative branch against the Democrats’ political dissidents rather than a legitimate probe investigating the breach of the Capitol complex. As the committee formed, Pelosi barred participation by Republican Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Jim Banks of Indiana, prompting Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to urge members to boycott the investigation altogether. Cheney and Kinzinger joined the Democrats’ panel anyway, with Cheney serving as the committee’s vice chair, and a close Cheney ally tapped as its lead investigator.

“Congress is obligated to conduct a full investigation of the most serious attack on our Capitol since 1814,” the Wyoming congresswoman said when tapped by the speaker for the committee in July.

The comparison ignored the 1954 raid by Puerto Rican nationalists who shot five congressmen, the 1983 Senate bombing by left-wing militants later granted clemency by Democrats, and the al-Qaeda terrorists who flew a plane into the Pentagon on 9/11, let alone the routine outbursts of domestic terrorism by left-wing militants throughout the nation’s capital last summer.

At the investigation’s first hearing in July, the committee opened with a panel of anti-Trump police officers who testified about their experiences at the Capitol building the day of the January riot as members showed tears for the cameras.

Did any of these politicians cry when the capital looked like this last summer? Did they even care? https://t.co/r99pcI8D4M pic.twitter.com/fpWbxkft62 — Tristan Justice (@JusticeTristan) July 27, 2021

One officer, Harry Dunn, had previously defended the riots engulfing the nation’s capital last year. The devastation from the two weeks of rioting in the immediate aftermath of George Floyd’s death alone cost an estimated 66 times more than the damage at the Capitol on Jan. 6.

The Jan. 6 committee’s first round of subpoenas issued last week targeted four former aides in the Trump White House, including a former chief of staff.

No subpoenas have yet been issued for officials at the FBI, which The New York Times admitted last week planted informants in the crowd that overtook the Capitol.

"As Christian Cold War Heats Up, The Faithful Are Equipping For Battle","Along with the rest of the country, American Christianity is in the middle of a cold war. As this war heats up, it will mean church splits, takeovers, fights over denominational resources, and other power struggles as the Donald Trump era has increasingly brought clarity and pushed people to choose sides on existential questions.

The Southern Baptist Convention, the United States’ largest Protestant denomination, is one key example of this dynamic affecting American Christianity as a whole. On Oct. 1 in The American Conservative, Jackson Waters and Emma Posey reported on new developments in that denomination’s growing identity crisis. They contrast the Russell Moore, Beth Moore, and David French wing with the Voddie Baucham, Douglas Wilson, and I’d add Thomas Ascol wing.

“The direction Moore, French, and Moore are walking is not simply traditional evangelicalism, but a form of cultural accommodation dressed as convictional religion,” Waters and Posey write, after describing how the three have theologically shifted in recent years and months. “The result is a religious respectability that promotes national unity, liberalism, and wokeism under the rhetorical guise of love for neighbor. While Moore and his guest [Beth Moore] try to straddle the fence, there is little doubt that their biggest support is now coming from those significantly to their left politically.”

The Polarization Isn’t Superficial or Random

Many religious leaders have mistaken American polarization as merely political, thus scapegoating Trump for pulling the rug off many cockroach nests that predate his presidency. Yet this polarization in fact sprouts from irreconcilable theological and philosophical differences, which accounts for its fierceness and existential nature.

Americans are debating whether truth and human nature exist, and whether such things can be objectively defined for all or must be subjectively defined by power or “lived experience.” They are debating whether all men truly are created equal, or whether some are more equal than others. Christianity has a lot to say about these philosophical questions that also affect politics.

There are other political intersections and parallels. They include how some church leaders often use their authority against their own people instead of on their behalf, are utterly detached from ordinary people’s concerns, and appear to have little understanding of the nature of the cultural battles they try to avoid. These mass failures are prompting new leaders to take up the spiritual warfare many legacy leaders have abandoned.

Christ to the Sons of Peter: Feed My Sheep

While examples of leadership failures in the church are legion, one seems front and center today. In the face of mass government persecution of religious exercise over the past year and a half, Christian leaders overwhelmingly cowered and canceled services.

Shutdowns violate the theology of all Christians, both non-sacramentarians to sacramentarians. Those who don’t believe Christ’s statement, “This is my Body,” do heavily lean on his command called the Great Commission. In it, Christ tells the apostles to “Go and make disciples of all nations,” then tells them exactly how: “Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.” You can’t baptize or make disciples via Zoom.

In addition, corporate gathering for worship is expressly commanded in the Bible. Christians also don’t live in fear of suffering or death, for “to live is Christ, and to die is gain.”

For Christians who do believe in Christ’s real presence in Holy Communion, forbidding in-person worship is an even greater blasphemy. It means denying the Christ-mandated distribution of his physical Body and Blood to heal and preserve the souls of the redeemed for all eternity, the very reason for which Christ came to earth, was crucified, and resurrected.

All this means the very people charged with feeding Christ’s sheep his most precious Blood and Word, as Jesus demanded of Peter before commissioning him as an apostle, instead spiritually starved Christ’s children. They left the sheep without the shepherds commissioned by Christ Himself to care for them even to the point of death. These are the acts of traitors.

‘My People Are Destroyed for Lack of Knowledge’

An abandoned and starving flock is easier prey for false shepherds and false teachings. It’s therefore no surprise that the same churches and believers that have forsaken Christ’s most important commands are also riven with the trendy heresies of cultural Marxism. Widely read evangelical publications, high-visibility preachers, Christian universities’ professors, and church bureaucrats often either refuse to rebuke or openly endorse the identity politics racism, erasure of sexual differences, and indulgence of sexual sin in vogue in the West.

As Baucham notes in his book “Fault Lines,” religious leaders who push back on identity-politics corrosion of Christian teachings are typically criticized by their own colleagues, while those on the hard left are engaged with and treated as good-faith interlocutors. Presbyterian seminary professor Ben Dunson put it bluntly in an interview: “A lot of people aren’t willing to be called a white supremacist, so they stay silent.”

This one-sided pressure causes many church leaders to avoid discussing culture war topics even when those topics have major theological implications, says Adam Koontz, co-host of the “A Brief History of Power with Two White Guys” podcast who directs pastoral field education as a professor for Concordia Theological Seminary.

“It’s not that our people don’t know about these [social] issues, but they often don’t hear about it in the pews,” Koontz said in a phone interview. “We are very good at telling about, say, the courage of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, but you have to take that and apply it to modern-day America and explain why being white is not a problem.”

These Christians Are Reporting For Duty

There is a “big disconnect between the evangelical elite and the people in the pews,” said Reformed writer Aaron Renn of The Masculinist in an interview. Waters and Posey also point out evangelicals’ institutions are largely controlled by those who oppose what the laypeople believe: “Over the last year, the division between evangelicals and their leadership has only grown, raising the question of who is driving the movement.”

This is what prompted Renn and Dunson to create the publication American Reformer, to equip Christians to respond to increasing cultural hostility. The publication aims to be robustly intellectual while still approachable, aimed at both pastors and lay leaders, “To be the voice for people who have lost their institutional voices,” Renn said.

“[S]o many Protestant leaders are MIA on the big issues of the day,” Renn told me in an email. For example, he noted, the people introducing Americans to the deeply Calvinist political thought of Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban are the political commentators Rod Dreher and Tucker Carlson.

The people most visibly opposing “the woke revolution,” he noted, are not Christian leaders but atheist James Lindsay and journalist Chris Rufo, whose religious beliefs are not part of his advocacy. Thirdly, Renn pointed out, very few Christian institutions consciously aim to equip Christians to live in a society that is hostile to their beliefs. Instead, institutional leaders largely prefer to pretend that America is still a “Christian nation” instead of facing the reality that Christianity is now an open target for many U.S. government officials and agencies.

American Reformer aims to address these key issues, and more. Dunson and Renn also hope to raise and distribute funds to assist efforts to keep religious institutions orthodox, as well as sponsor non-woke theological scholarship.

“The goal would be to have people who understand their own Protestant history better,” Dunson said. “Classic Protestant thinking is well aware of the fact that in a fallen world we seek to do the good we can where we are, and that means starting with our families and our communities, our states, our nation, as much as we’re able.”

The difference between mainstream evangelicalism and classical Protestantism on the state could not be summed better than in this tweet. For classic Protestants state power (dangerous, no doubt) is to be directed toward virtuous ends, not to be abandoned as inherently defiling. https://t.co/FvM7oBtoj1 — Ben C. Dunson (@BenDunson1) September 22, 2021

“We want to encourage those who are serious and aspiring to lead to stand up. People are hungry for leadership,” Dunson said.

From the Moral Majority to the Woke Church

Koontz said deepening animosity towards American Christians is prompting more pastors to dive into such discussions with parishioners. If pastors don’t teach their people what scripture says about major cultural issues, he said, this abandonment of their duties can badly damage a congregation.

Another block to pastors addressing such problems can be evangelical theology itself, Koontz noted. The woke “children of the Moral Majority are now doing what their parents did, but in the new politically trendy way,” he observed. He underscored the belief, common to much of evangelicalism and to Roman Catholicism, that humans participate in their own salvation — i.e., “make a decision for Christ” — rather than Christ doing it all, one of the “solas” of the Protestant Reformation.

This fuels the belief that Christianity is not about being transformed solely by Christ through his clearly defined gifts of Word and Sacrament for a life of service to others, but about validating one’s faith through human works. That, in turn, stimulates a religious impetus for pursuing an earthly utopia through politics, a dangerous unity of faith and state that has historically at best fueled failed nation-building abroad and a rogue administrative state at home, and at worst totalitarianism and mass murder.

Just as substituting politics for faith also ultimately decimated mainline denominations, Koontz noted, so those who follow its woke version today will eventually abandon Christianity. The only way out of this is the same way out of every other spiritual dead end: repentance.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/10/04/as-christian-cold-war-heats-up-the-faithful-are-equipping-for-battle/,2021-10-04
School Boards' Gripes About Parents Don't Justify 'Terrorism' Probes,"The National School Boards Association (NSBA) last week begged President Joe Biden to use domestic terrorism laws to target parent protesters who oppose anti-science mask mandates for children and the infiltration of racist curriculum in schools. But the incidents the group listed as proof that “immediate assistance is required to protect our students, school board members, and educators who are susceptible to acts of violence affecting interstate commerce because of threats to their districts, families, and personal safety,” are hardly worth the involvement of federal law enforcement.

In the letter to the Biden administration, the NSBA listed out pages of examples of what it classified as “immediate threats” to the people in and of public schools across the nation. But as Zaid Jilani points out in his Substack article “Rowdy Town Halls Aren’t ‘Domestic Terror,’” the NSBA’s written request for the U.S. Department of Justice, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, Secret Service, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service “to intervene against threatening letters and cyberbullying attacks” and label these “heinous actions” as “a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes” is unnecessary.

One of the incidents raised by the NSBA occurred at the Marysville School Board meeting in Washington state where protesters against mask mandates for children “banged on windows” and yelled enough to force the gathering into a recess. A handful of the protesters reportedly “surrounded a district official’s car, preventing the driver from leaving” in what one article author characterized as “a violation of democratic principles, one with all-too-familiar overtones of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.”

Other incidents the NSBA listed that occurred in Sarasota, Florida, and San Diego focused on disruptions by protesters but were handled fine by local police fine, and neither produced any arrests.

“One man made a satirical Nazi salute to protest a mask mandate for students at the Birmingham Board of Education. (It’s pretty obvious that the man was protesting what he believed to be authoritarianism and was not, in fact, a neo-Nazi. If you were alive during the Bush years, you saw a million progressive protesters doing similar stuff.)” Jilani wrote.

The NSBA also cited a case where local law enforcement in Norfolk, Virginia, was already reviewing a series of social media threats. The kicker is “the threats appear to be related to typical school violence.”

“The local news has been reporting on this story notes that one teenager recently shot two others at a Virginia high school, an incident that had nothing to do with conservative mobs terrorizing school boards,” Jilani said.

Jilani noted that some of the incidents listed do “include some type of actual physical confrontation” and a couple of arrests, but “none of this even comes close to terrorism or other crimes that would justify the involvement of the FBI, DHS, and DOJ as well as federal prosecutions.”

“Local police have all the resources they need to handle a few disruptive parents,” he wrote.

Despite the weak case NSBA presented for federal involvement, Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the FBI and state attorneys to address “a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff who participate in the vital work of running our nation’s public schools.”

On Wednesday, the Associated Press amplified the NSBA’s claims with a false “fact check” simply restating the organization’s intentions to use the Biden administration’s prosecution and law enforcement power to curb parents’ protests.

More Jan. 6 Subpoenas Target Citizens Exercising Right To Protest,"Since its inception, however, the Select Committee on Jan. 6 has served as a show trial for Democrats in partnership with a pair of leading NeverTrump Republicans to seek retribution against political dissidents. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tapped Kinzinger and Cheney to serve on the probe after the Democrat barred Republicans Jim Banks, R-Ind., and Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, from the panel.

The committee’s first hearing in July featured a slate of Capitol police officers airing a public vendetta against the former president while lawmakers manufactured tears. One officer, Harry Dunn, had also previously defended the riots that engulfed the nation’s capital last year. The devastation from the two weeks of rioting in the immediate aftermath of George Floyd’s death alone cost an estimated 66 times more than the damage at the Capitol on Jan. 6.

Eleven other organizers of the peaceful demonstration preceding the Capitol riot were also subpoenaed last week in the panel’s second round of subpoenas issued. Even leftists at the Brennan Center have criticized the deliberate targeting of private citizens exercising their First Amendment rights to peacefully assemble.

“At minimum, there needs to be some distinction between people who actually participated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol and those who were in D.C. lawfully exercising their right to protest,” said Elizabeth Goitein, the co-director of the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program. Goitein said she feared this is setting a “dangerous precedent.”

The Purpose Of The Jan. 6 Select Committee Is To Suppress Free Speech,"A third round of subpoenas issued last week by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s select committee on the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol has revealed the committee’s investigation for what it is: a brazen attack on the First Amendment rights of peaceful, law-abiding Americans.

Indeed, it’s not too much to say that the committee’s targeting of ordinary Americans poses a far greater threat to freedom and democracy than the Capitol riot ever did.

Why? Because the subpoenas were issued to a pair of private citizens, right-wing activist Ali Alexander and a man named Nathan Martin, as well as a group the men were associated with called Stop the Steal, which had applied for and received a permit from the U.S. Capitol Police to hold a rally on the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6.

Ali and Martin didn’t take part in the riot and have no connection to it. Both men were indeed present at the Capitol grounds that day, along with hundreds of thousands of other people, to host a rally for which, I repeat, their organization applied for and received a permit from U.S. Capitol Police. But their permitted event never even took place.

As Martin told me back in January, about a week after the riot, he was setting up for the event when he saw people entering the U.S. Capitol building from a side door, which didn’t seem right to him. Shortly thereafter, Martin received a text that the event was canceled and he left the Capitol grounds. He didn’t find out about the riot and the breach of the Capitol until he got back to his hotel room later that day.

Martin, an Iraq War veteran and city councilman in Shelby, Ohio, was much like the vast majority of people who came to Washington, D.C., to protest the election in January. He wasn’t there to cause trouble or incite violence, and he didn’t think the protest would change the outcome of the election. His hope, he told me, was that Republican lawmakers would put their objections on the record and go through claims of election fraud “line by line,” especially from states where instances of fraud and irregularities were well-documented.

“I didn’t have any delusions of grandeur that Vice President Pence would come swooping in and change the results or anything like that,” he said. “Although there had been some constitutional talk about whether that was allowed or not, I didn’t feel constitutionally that there was room for that.”

That is, Martin expected Jan. 6 to be what the overwhelming majority of protesters that day expected it to be: a peaceful, orderly, and permitted demonstration at the U.S. Capitol to make their voices heard. The corporate media’s attempt to smear every person who was present on the Capitol grounds that day as an “insurrectionist” is flatly appalling and utterly fantastical.

But it hasn’t stopped them from trying. Martin and other permit applicants for planned rallies on Jan. 6 at the Capitol grounds were badly misrepresented in a BuzzFeed article last month, portrayed as shadowy figures who were evasive or deceptive in their permit applications and conversations with Capitol Police.

By contrast, what the permit applications, which BuzzFeed obtained through a lawsuit against the Capitol Police, and BuzzFeed’s own reporting reveal is that a number of unaffiliated groups applied for and received permits to hold various rallies on the sprawling Capitol grounds that day. Martin told BuzzFeed he hadn’t seen the permit application and didn’t know why his name was on it, and it appears that communications between event organizers was not without some confusion in the weeks leading up to the event — which you would expect with a hastily planned event with many moving parts.

But there is so far zero evidence any of these organizers had anything to do with the comparatively small number of people who used the occasion to assault police and breach the U.S. Capitol itself. Tens of thousands of people, possibly more, were on the Capitol grounds that day. Yet nine months after the riot, fewer than 200 people have been charged with assaulting Capitol Police officers and the vast majority of the 650 named defendants are being charged with misdemeanor trespass or other minor violations that carry no prison time.

Nevertheless, last week after news broke of the Select Committee’s subpoenas, nearly the entire corporate press, as if with one voice, lumped in Martin and Alexander, who have been charged with nothing, with the rioters.

If our news media had any interest in holding power to account, the headlines and coverage would have focused instead on how Democratic lawmakers on the committee, together with NeverTrump GOP Reps. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., are using their subpoena powers to target law-abiding Americans who wished to exercise their right to peacefully assemble and protest.

Let’s be clear on this point. Since its inception, the Select Committee has amounted to a show-trial for House Democrats and leading NeverTrumpers who are attempting to make examples out of ordinary citizens who dared to protest the election, just as President Biden’s Justice Department is throwing the book at anyone connected to the events of Jan. 6 to make examples of them.

The message is clear: if you protest, if you exercise your First Amendment rights for a cause that those in power have not approved, you will be targeted by the government, smeared and harassed by the media, and made into a spectacle — pour encourager les autres.

Katie Couric Omitted 'Unworthy' RBG Quotes Slamming Anthem Protests,"Former “Today” host Katie Couric deceptively edited her 2016 interview with former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to omit comments made by the “elderly” justice that cast a negative light on leftist sports players who kneel during the national anthem, according to a report from the Daily Mail.

In the original interview published in October 2016, Couric claimed that Ginsburg called the refusal to stand during the national anthem by athletes such as Colin Kaepernick “dumb and disrespectful.”

“Would I arrest them for doing it? No,” Ginsburg said. “I think it’s dumb and disrespectful. I would have the same answer if you asked me about flag burning. I think it’s a terrible thing to do, but I wouldn’t lock a person up for doing it. I would point out how ridiculous it seems to me to do such an act.”

Couric pushed Ginsburg on the issue further and asked for confirmation that athletes had the right to protest.

“Yes. If they want to be stupid, there’s no law that should be preventive,” Ginsburg replied. “If they want to be arrogant, there’s no law that prevents them from that. What I would do is strongly take issue with the point of view that they are expressing when they do that.”

But Couric’s new memoir, “Going There,” suggests that the anchor, who brags that she strives to keep “personal politics” out of her reporting, omitted portions of the interview where Ginsburg came out even stronger against kneeling protests.

Unpublished parts of the interview included commentary from Ginsburg who said that the athlete protests showed “contempt for a government that has made it possible for their parents and grandparents to live a decent life.”

“Which they probably could not have lived in the places they came from … as they became older they realize that this was youthful folly. And that’s why education is important,” Ginsburg reportedly said.

At the request of the head of public affairs for the U.S. Supreme Court who claimed Ginsburg had “misspoken” and after the New York Times’s David Brooks suggested that Ginsburg probably didn’t understand the question, Couric stopped the quotes from ever reaching the public eye. Her decision directly contradicted the advice of David Westin, the former head of ABC News who believed that “people should hear what [Ginsburg] thinks” due to her position on the highest court in the land.

In her new book, Couric admits that she felt Ginsburg’s comments were “unworthy of a crusader for equality” and that she felt as though her decision protected Ginsburg from showing the public that racial issues were a “blind spot.” Couric justified her behavior by writing off Ginsburg as “elderly” and said the Supreme Court justice “probably didn’t fully understand the question.”

New Yorkers Put Livelihoods On The Line To Protest Vaccine Coercion,"Thousands of New Yorkers gathered in Times Square on Saturday to protest COVID shot coercion by the Biden administration, New York City government, and private companies.

Anti vaccine mandate protesters in nyc protest outside the @nytimes chanting “defund the media” pic.twitter.com/BfalDbabqC — Elad Eliahu (@elaadeliahu) October 16, 2021

New York is home to some of the strictest vaccine mandates in the nation. On top of the state’s medical coercion of state workers, health-care workers, and teachers, the city is forcing businesses to require verified “vaccine passports” in exchange for goods and services.

“Businesses that do not comply with this policy will be subject to fines,” the NYC Department of Health warns on its website.

These mandates have extended far beyond the skyscrapers in NYC, private companies, restaurants, gyms, and movie theaters into private homes. Earlier this month, a New York City judge ruled that a father must get vaccinated or be subject to regular COVID-19 testing if he wanted to maintain his every other weekend in-person visits with his three-year-old daughter. Democrat NYC mayor nominee Eric Adams also recently vowed to mandate the COVID vaccine for all public school students if he is elected.

‘Let My People Go’

NYC citizens are fed up with this prolonged bullying. While some stay quiet in hopes they won’t lose their families, jobs, or access to activities, many are risking it all to stand up for personal liberty and the freedom to live their lives as they please.

John Matland is just one of the many health-care workers in New York who took issue with the government and Staten Island University Hospital South telling him what to put in his body.

“I wasn’t going to budge. So what I did was I started to organize,” Matland told The Federalist.

Matland quickly gained support from colleagues who felt it was unfair for the hospital to try to force them into medical choices they believe should be private. He participated in rallies and even a protest with more than 100 people outside of the hospital on his lunch. But even after devoting 15 years of his life to working as a CAT scan tech including during the height of the pandemic, Matland was terminated when he could not prove that he had received the vaccine by his hospital’s deadline.

New York’s tyranny has pushed some to leave the blue concrete jungles they once loved for Republican-controlled states such as Florida and Texas, where government leaders are working to protect personal freedom in medicine. Others such as Rachel Maniscalco, a schoolteacher forced out of her job due to declining a COVID shot, however, want to “stay and fight.”

“I’ve realized that I don’t want to run away from the place where I was born and raised. Also, I am needed here right now,” Maniscalco said.

Maniscalco is just one of the many New York teachers who chose to sacrifice her career and membership in the United Federation of Teachers in exchange for speaking out against mandatory vaccinations. What started as her staunch refusal to cave to her Staten Island school’s vaccine requirement per the government’s orders quickly turned into a legal application for injunctive relief. When that was denied by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Maniscalco, who worked in her school through most of the pandemic pregnant, plowed through and continued the legal fight against the vax mandate.

“I do understand that there’s a lot of fear. And for me, I kind of thought, ‘Well, I’m never getting this. I know where my boundary is. So the only thing to do at this point is to fight,'” Maniscalco said.

Now, Maniscalco, often joined by her infant daughter, uses her free time to speak rallies by Teachers For Choice and New York Freedom Rally to encourage others that they shouldn’t comply if they aren’t comfortable. It’s a sacrifice, but it’s one she’s willing to make.

“I can’t go inside to a restaurant and I can’t go to a bar and I can’t go into a gym and there’s so many things that I can’t do, which I’m glad to forego for the cause. I don’t want to go anywhere that’s going to be enforcing this. But, you know, a lot of my friends have and what I tried to do is just to say, ‘I’m not judging.’ I do understand that people are being forced to comply. I understand it completely. I think it’s horrendous,'” Maniscalco said. “I do have a husband. He doesn’t make a ton of money so we’re kind of blowing through our savings but he understands how important this is.”

Small Victories

Courts have delivered some small victories to New Yorkers weary of their state’s COVID-19 overreach. Last week, a federal judge ruled that the state must allow health-care employers to consider religious exemptions for workers even though the state has tried to pressure companies against it.

“There is no adequate explanation from defendants about why the ‘reasonable accommodation’ that must be extended to a medically exempt health care worker under 2.61 could not similarly be extended to a health-care worker with a sincere religious objection,” Judge David Hurd of Utica wrote.

Teachers, however, were not awarded the same treatment from a federal judge in Manhattan last week. That judge denied at least 10 educators’ requests for the court to block enforcement of New York City’s COVID vaccine mandate.

“Plaintiffs have not shown they are entitled to this extraordinary remedy,” Judge Valerie Caproni said. She also downplayed the plaintiffs’ concerns that the city is “openly hostile” towards religion.

Jo Rose, a teacher’s assistant in the Bronx who is also heavily involved with the New York Freedom Rally, was terminated from her job earlier this month over the issue. Multiple teachers expressed discomfort with the vaccine mandate and Sept. 27 deadline from the Department of Education, but by the time a temporary injunction pushed the shot deadline back to Oct. 1, Rose said she was just one of the four other staff members at her school who didn’t cave to the pressure.

“I feel like I was being discarded and then I had to explain to the children who are being brainwashed into thinking, like, if you don’t get vaccinated, you’re a bad person, that you’re dirty … And I explained to them that I can’t be coerced into doing something that the government is making me do,” Rose told The Federalist. “… I’d rather lose my job than to be coerced into getting a vaccine that is experimental that I don’t want in my body. So it was very emotional for me. I left and I didn’t want to cry in front of the kids but I cried once I walked out of school because I have been in that particular school for three years.”

Rose said that while her situation is unfortunate and far too prolific in the city, she is encouraged by the number of people willing to publicly oppose the mandates.

“The positive change is that now more people are aware and even within our protest, we have a lot of people that are vaccinated… and to pull them to see and understand that we need to be together whether you’re vaccinated or not,” Rose said.

She also said many people are realizing the role the corrupt corporate media has played in aiding vaccine coercion.

“The media has many believing that they have the higher authority and whatever they say it’s 100 percent true and that we cannot ask any questions outside of their little television,” Rose said. “…They’re not there to inform the public, they’re there to manipulate the public. They should be unbiased. You’re supposed to only report. Your job isn’t supposed to be taking sides of anything or making one group look bad or things of that nature… Also when it comes to the vaccines, they don’t report any side effects.”

Students Protest Texas High School After Allegations Of Sexual Assault,"On the morning of Oct. 15, hundreds of students at Geyer High School in Denton, Texas staged a walkout in protest of a recent alleged sexual assault that went unrepressed by police and school administrators. The crowd of students and parents walked around the school a few times, calling for action against alleged sexual abusers. Many of the protesters carried Me Too signs and repeatedly chanted “Enough is enough.”

Other parents at the protest related their own children who were allegedly assaulted at Denton schools. After her daughter was allegedly assaulted, Jennifer Jenkins says the officers working on the case, “actually said to my husband, ‘You’ve been a 14-year-old boy before’ and my husband said, ‘I didn’t do this, did you?’”

Denton police and school administrators claim to be investigating the matter, but their actions don’t seem to amount to actually keeping anyone safe or enforcing any punishment. Even a thing like assault seems to meet with little disciplinary action.

According to other students at the school along with a recent petition, the claimed assailant had a record of multiple assault allegations since he moved to Denton as an 8th grader, yet he was still allowed to attend class, and even play in the varsity football game five days after the attack. Meanwhile, the alleged victim was hospitalized after being attacked on campus.

The University of North Texas rescinded the alleged assailant’s football scholarship when news broke out of yet another assault allegation.

BREAKING: Per a source, Denton Guyer DE/LB Vincent Paige is no longer considered a North Texas commit. A separate source confirms Paige is being investigated for off-field allegations. — Mike Roach (@MikeRoach247) October 13, 2021

Otherwise, the outcome of this story remains unclear. The principal of Guyer High School issued a statement, assuring the community that he was “conducting a thorough investigation.”

Presumably, this means they are taking statements, checking camera footage, examining the student’s disciplinary and academic record, and keeping the suspected person detained until they establish the facts of the case. However, in this case (and others), it doesn’t seem like they were doing any of this, as the accused student simply returned to class and no charges were made after the alleged assault, and it seems like they were going to let the issue rest, conveniently claiming they just didn’t have enough evidence to take any action.

This left little recourse for the alleged victim and her family except to protest, as they did. They couldn’t simply “trust the process.” Judging from the large crowd of supporters marching in solidarity, this problem of ignoring assault allegations appears to be systemic. The whole issue is finally becoming public.

Before this protest, most parents were unaware of any alleged sexual predators at the school. As Brayden Garcia reports in The Dallas Morning News, “Parents at the protest said they receive daily COVID-19 reports from the school, but had to find out about the allegations from their children and social media.” Although keeping quiet about investigations of students is intended to protect those in question, this lack of transparency has easily achieved the opposite for those students forced to be in classrooms with potentially dangerous classmates.

Whatever is decided in the most recent case, parents are becoming aware that Denton ISD — and likely other districts — have a serious problem. Parents need to be sure that their kids are safe and that any juvenile delinquent, even a star football player, who sexually assaults other students is swiftly brought to justice. If school leaders can’t keep their students safe, then nothing else on their agenda ultimately matters.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/10/25/families-protest-texas-high-school-after-allegations-of-sexual-assault-went-unreported/,2021-10-25
Rolling Stone Jan. 6 'Scoop' Erases Distinction Between Riot And Protest,"Rolling Stone published an exclusive Sunday detailing what the paper branded “explosive allegations” from organizers of the Jan. 6 White House protest.

“As the House investigation into the Jan. 6 attack heats up, some of the planners of the pro-Trump rallies that took place in Washington, D.C., have begun communication with congressional investigators,” reported the story, which is now trending on Twitter.

The paper’s “explosive” scoop? That elected members of Congress were involved in the planning of a political rally where several of them gave speeches.

“Multiple members,” Rolling Stone wrote, “were intimately involved in planning both Trump’s efforts to overturn his election loss and the Jan. 6 events that turned violent.” The last three words, which encapsulate the entire framing of the piece, were ostensibly added to erase any distinction between the peaceful demonstrations at the White House and the riot at the Capitol, which began before President Donald Trump finished his address.

Relying on three anonymous sources, Rolling Stone documented coordination between the offices of Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., Mo Brooks, R-Ala., Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., and Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, and protest organizers; the story then framed routine planning as a scandal. Cawthorn and Brooks each spoke at the event.

“This is the first report that the committee is hearing major new allegations from potential cooperating witnesses,” the paper wrote in reference to House Democrats’ weaponized probe to indict any and all involved as criminal dissidents. “While there have been prior indications that members of Congress were involved, this is also the first account detailing their purported role and its scope.”

The scope? Assistance in planning a White House protest with the president.

“Everyone was going to stay at the Ellipse throughout the congressional thing,” one organizer said. “The Capitol was never in play,” said another.

Any association with the protest, however, has been deemed toxic after House Democrats in conjunction with select Republicans with a vendetta against Trump launched a snap impeachment, indicting the rally as the trigger for the Capitol chaos. Despite multiple degrees of separation, including the fact the assault began 20 minutes before Trump was done speaking, the president’s explicit calls to remain peaceful, and the failed impeachment with fabricated evidence, Democrats continue to treat the riot at the Capitol and the rally at the White House as the same.

The Rolling Stone piece was given a highlighted front-page hit on the Drudge Report Monday, with an aggregation of the magazine’s reporting trending as the most popular headline on The Hill.

In their first three rounds of subpoenas, Democrats and GOP Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney primarily targeted private citizens involved with the peaceful demonstrations as part of the lower chamber’s Jan. 6 investigation.

Even Elizabeth Goitein, the co-director of the leftist Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program, called the House subpoenas a bridge too far.

“At minimum, there needs to be some distinction between people who actually participated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol and those who were in D.C. lawfully exercising their right to protest,” Goitein said, fearing a “dangerous precedent.”

“For instance, I worry about a future committee, under different leadership, finding some pretext to subpoena the emails and text messages of Black Lives Matter Leaders or other racial justice activists,” she added.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/10/25/rolling-stone-jan-6-scoop-erases-distinction-between-capitol-riot-and-white-house-protest/,2021-10-25
Loudoun County Students Walk Out In Protest Of Sexual Assault Cover Up,"Students at multiple schools in Loudoun County, Virginia staged a walkout on Tuesday in protest of the district’s cover-up of a sexual assault case.

“Loudoun County protects rapists,” some students at Broad Run High chanted in front of the school.

Clarification: The suspect in both sex assaults at 2 different high schools in Loudoun County was not charged or convicted of rape. @7NewsDC #7NewsITeam pic.twitter.com/VnoPAvl8jO — Scott Taylor 7 News I-Team (@ScottTaylorTV) October 26, 2021

Social media posts reportedly framed the protest as a way to “show solidarity to victims of sexual violence and demand safety in our schools.” The protest follows months of controversy after members of the Loudoun County School Board and the superintendent publicly denied that there had been any sexual assault by transgender-identifying students in school bathrooms in the district, even though multiple assaults by the same “gender fluid” assailant were reported in two different Loudoun County high schools.

One of the assaults occurred in May against a teenage girl whose father, Scott Smith, was smeared as a “domestic terrorist” after he spoke up and was arrested at a school board meeting. At that same meeting, school board members claimed there was no “record of assaults occurring in our restrooms.”

“Our students do not need to be protected, and they are not in danger. Do we have assaults in our bathrooms or locker rooms regularly?” said school board member Beth Barts.

“To my knowledge, we don’t have any record of assaults occurring in our restrooms,” Superintendent Scott Ziegler replied.

The board chairwoman Brenda Sheridan also asked if the district had “any issues involving transgender students in our bathrooms or locker rooms,” before Ziegler claimed that the predatory trans-identifying person doesn’t exist.

A Virginia judge found the teenage male, who was allegedly wearing a skirt when he entered a girls’ bathroom at Stone Bridge High School in May and was then involved in a similar incident at Broad Run High School in early October, guilty of sexual assault on Monday.

Other reports indicate that Loudoun County Public Schools failed to report multiple alleged sexual assaults in its district for years. One LCPS board member, Barts, stepped down from the board after the controversy gained conservative media attention. Others are currently the subjects of recall efforts.

Why These Protesters Are Standing Up To Loudoun County Schools,"ASHBURN, Va. — Parents and other protesters braved wind, rain, and one of the coldest nights the area has seen this fall to gather at the Loudoun County School Board meeting on Tuesday and speak out against the board and Superintendent Scott Ziegler.

One of the administrators present told me that 120 people were signed up to speak. Many of them waited together in front of the building for their turns, holding homemade signs and speaking animatedly with each other.

A lineup of speakers took the stage of the parking lot rally, kicking off with a recital of the national anthem by one of the young girls in attendance. I heard someone chant “Let’s go Brandon” at another point.

Here’s what parents, students, and other protesters told me about why they showed up.

Chuck Izzo

Chuck Izzo, a U.S. Army veteran from Purcellville, showed up to give public comment at the board meeting and slammed “the way that the cover-up [of sexual assaults in the school district] happened, and just the lack of integrity” in the school board. “My intent is to go up there and just voice my opinion and say, ‘You were all either under duress or you knew about this and either way you lied and you’re not representing us effectively, so you have to go.'”

Izzo’s daughter, a senior at Woodgrove High School, participated in the walkouts that occurred throughout Loudoun County schools earlier in the day to protest the school board’s complicity in recent revelations of sexual assault. He noted problems within the school district that had frustrated him even before the assaults, however.

“The first thing that was brought to my attention was when [recently resigned school board member] Beth Barts and the other folks had their secret little Facebook group trying to doxx parents who were opposed to the policies … that’s really secret police kind of stuff,” he told me. “And then when the gym teacher came out and spoke his conscience in an open public forum and then was punished for it that added up, and when the news came out about the sexual assaults, it was just really shocking.”

Kara Dansky

Kara Dansky said she is a lifelong Democrat and self-described “radical feminist” from Washington, D.C. “We really want to see the school board rescind the policy, there is absolutely no justifiable reason to have a policy that allows boys into women’s bathrooms,” she said. “It’s just not acceptable, it’s anti-feminist, it’s misogynistic, it’s politically regressive.”

“All of the women standing behind me and near me are radical feminists, most of us are Democrats,” she told me, gesturing to about six other women standing beside her. “We are here because we are on the political left and we stand in support of female-only spaces.”

Dansky said she came to Loudoun in August for a rally the day before LCPS instituted its gender identity policy that allows co-ed bathrooms, after which a sexual assault by a “gender fluid” boy of a female teen in the girls’ bathroom was reported. “I was very proud to stand with Loudoun County parents and students and I’m very proud to stand with Loudoun County parents and students here today.”

Erin Roselle Poe

Erin Roselle Poe has a 10th grader and a fifth grader in Loudoun County Public Schools.

“I stood on these grounds 20 months ago and fought to get our schools open, and that like most parents opened our eyes to actually what was happening here in the county,” she told me. “When you have two kids here that are constantly exposed to everything going on, all you can do is fight.”

Poe also signed up to speak to the school board, to tell them “that they’ve failed this county, they’ve failed students, they’ve lied to our faces, they’ve left our children very vulnerable and unsafe, and they continue to preach policies that are more coverups for their actions.”

“We’ve got to get the evil out of the schools,” she added.

Anthony Mace

Anthony Mace used to be a Fairfax County resident, but moved to Loudoun County last year and has a son who is a senior in high school in LCPS. “I thought Fairfax was getting a little out of control so we moved out this way, and this is even more ridiculous,” he told me. “The longer I’m here I can’t believe what Loudoun has become. It’s just a shadow of itself.”

Mace, who considers himself an independent, said he was present “to really support the parents of Loudoun County that aren’t being heard.” For the school board “to blatantly lie to the parents, it’s criminal and they should all resign.”

“As long as I live in Loudoun I will be coming to the [school board] meetings, I will be supporting the parents,” he said. “They should have a say in their children’s education.”

Nick, Crunchy, and Maddy

Nick and Crunchy used to attend LCPS until about a year ago. “We’re here to support the cause against them,” Nick told me, gesturing to the school board’s building. “Especially Ziegler,” Crunchy piped in. “Especially against Ziegler, because he knew about that rape charge,” Nick finished. He showed me his red, white, and blue sign, emblazoned with the words “Dear NSBA and Ziegler, sorry ain’t good enough! You must be FIRED, you LIED to promote your agenda!”

Maddy is an eighth-grader who’s currently in private school but will be going to public school in Loudoun County soon. She’s been to board meetings before, but spoke for the first time at one of the meetings Tuesday night.

“I’m here because I’m concerned about the public safety of the public schools in Loudoun County,” Maddy said.

Her mom added that they started getting involved with the school system when schools closed during COVID, “and then I started seeing the behaviors of some of the board members.”

“When the sexual assaults came out now every day I think … do I have to worry about her safety?” she added. “This is definitely weighing on my mind.”

Erin Smith

I spoke with Erin Smith as she exited the building after giving public comment, and she told me the speakers were “annihilating” the board, while she hadn’t heard anyone speak in support of the school board. “Each person has their own little speech about what’s important to them,” she said. “There’s plenty of things to talk about.”

In her speaking time, she focused on “the email that Dr. Ziegler sent everyone on May 28.”

“Did anyone respond to the email? Did they just get the email and not care? Was it just a normal day to them to have an email about sexual assault in a high school and nobody care about it?”

“I’ve been fighting to get a voice heard with the LCPS for over a year now,” she said. “It started back last year when they promised to open schools and didn’t, it’s been a snowball effect ever since.”

Joe Mobley

The host of “The Joe Mobley Show” said he showed up “to urge the school board to resign, because they lie, about everything!” Mobley cited the email Ziegler sent on May 28 to the board acknowledging the sexual assault that happened that day, a month before the board publicly denied the crime’s existence.

“With all this COVID bullcrap, they’ve said ‘we care more about you than your parents do,’ and they’re telling me as a parent that the government cares more about my kids than I do, which is absurd, but at the same time they’re sending sexual predators into the classroom,” he said.

“I’m just one of many parents, I have four kids,” he added. “We’re lucky enough to homeschool but our kids are going to have to work and interact with these kids and we’d prefer for them not to be Marxist, but even if they are going to be Marxist, we have to insist that they’re taught truth and that truth is at least exposed to them.”

While the board’s recent policies only allow a few speakers inside the building at a time, many gathered outside to watch a livestream of the meeting on a projector in the parking lot. A small contingent of people supporting the school board and sporting “diversity, equity, and inclusion” signs also showed up, but were far outnumbered by the school board’s critics.

Musician John Ondrasik Sings The Protest Song That Other Rock Artists Won’t,"Grammy-nominated Five For Fighting’s John Ondrasik joins Culture Editor Emily Jashinsky on The Federalist Radio Hour, where he discusses and performs his new song titled “Blood On My Hands.”

Ondraski said he wrote the song in reaction to the recently botched withdrawal from Afghanistan and to call for accountability of our leaders. “Blood On My Hands” has already surpassed well over a quarter of a million views on YouTube.

Ondrasik discusses how some band members disagree with the message of his song, how the music industry is no longer interested in fighting the system, and how artists can confront cancel culture.

“You would think in this day and age, the usual suspects who usually like to write protest songs about oppression, and women’s rights, and gay rights, would be all over Afghanistan,” Ondrasik said. “It’s ironic that the music industry and the music media have frankly become ‘The Man’ and they have little to do with rock and roll anymore which is disappointing.”

AP Calls Pro-Life Doctors 'Anti-Abortion Protesters Wearing Doctors Uniforms',"The Associated Press erased the credentials of more than 75 healthcare workers who flew into D.C. to represent the majority of OB/GYNs who do not perform abortions by captioning multiple photos of the medical professionals as “anti-abortion protesters wearing doctors uniforms.”

The Associated Press, which has a lengthy history of activism for abortion, posted multiple pictures of the doctors in front of the Supreme Court with the curious downplaying of their credentials.

“Anti-abortion protesters wearing doctors uniforms demonstrate in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, Wednesday, Dec. 1, 2021, in Washington, as the court hears arguments in a case from Mississippi, where a 2018 law would ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, well before viability,” read one caption.

“A man wears a sign on his back that reads ‘Unborn Lives Matter’ as he and other anti-abortion protesters wearing doctors uniforms demonstrate in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, Wednesday, Dec. 1, 2021, in Washington, as the court hears arguments in a case from Mississippi, where a 2018 law would ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, well before viability,” another caption stated.

The pro-life medical professionals came from a variety of groups, such as the American Association of Pro-life Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Some 93 percent of OB/GYNs had not done an abortion for an entire year of practice when surveyed in 2014.

Women’s rates of pre-term birth and risk of low-birthweight babies increase following a surgical abortion. Women who have had abortions also can face increased odds of depression and generalized anxiety.

The doctors were at the Supreme Court because it heard Mississippi’s Dobbs v. Jackson case about a law limiting abortions after 15 weeks gestation. Hundreds of activists came out to mark the occasion, both those who support and oppose abortion.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/12/01/ap-calls-pro-life-doctors-at-supreme-court-anti-abortion-protesters-wearing-doctors-uniforms/,2021-12-01
Dallas Students Riot Amid Rising Violence In Public Schools Nationwide,"Earlier this month in a north Dallas suburb, students at Little Elm High School staged a walk-out in protest of a sexual assault allegation they say school administrators failed to address. What started as a peaceful assembly soon escalated into a violent conflict that led to four arrests and the use of pepper spray and tasers on teenagers.

Unlike a similar protest that happened at nearby Guyer High School a month earlier, the protesters at Little Elm High School were mainly students, not adults. Also, instead of marching around the school peacefully, the protesters attempted to enter the school and presumably confront its principal, Dr. Gerald Muhammad, in his office. According to witnesses and videos, students were shouting and banging on windows and doors.

This led administrators to summon the police to “calm” down the situation, which soon became a “major disruption,” according to local news reports. Far from diffusing the tension, police took aggressive action against some of the students, wrestling a young woman to the ground, tasing a young man, and using pepper spray on another student.

By the end of the whole affair, four students were arrested and the district issued a statement taking no responsibility for what transpired. They blamed a social media post for spreading misinformation about the situation and justified their decision to call in law enforcement. Some parents complained of the excessive force and the permissive attitude towards alleged sexual abuse, but there has been no indication that either the school or local authorities will take any further action regarding the alleged victim or her advocates.

While it would be easy to write off the whole thing as a group of juvenile delinquents using an online rumor as a pretext to rampage through their high school, this would ignore some troubling issues that have become systemic in schools, particularly this year.

First, it must be understood that many school campuses, even those in the suburbs, are not safe places anymore. Fights between students, bullying, and even gun violence are becoming more common, and students are understandably more anxious and depressed. The National Association of School Resource Officers reports that gun-related incidents tripled this year compared to 2019.

This protest is already the third public instance of campus safety being compromised in a Texan high school within the past month. The first was the shooting at Timberview High School in Mansfield ISD. The second concerned an alleged serial sexual abuser at Guyer High School in Denton ISD. The third was the sexual assault allegation and subsequent outcry in Little Elm ISD.

Whatever side one takes in these matters, it’s clear that all students, particularly female students, are running increasing risks of being bullied, harassed, or assaulted when they go to school. This has been made worse by school shutdowns that have delayed maturity and introduced antisocial habits in many students at the most formative time of their lives.

A recent online petition addressing the Little Elm uproar alleges a freshmen boy targeted a sophomore girl and violated her personal space, first through harassment and then through unwanted touching and groping on a school bus. Whether the allegations prove to be true or not, the adults in charge should have intervened in this situation, investigated the matter, and disciplined any found responsible accordingly.

But they didn’t. When the girl reported the abuse to an administrator and school resource officer, she simply wasn’t believed, a local outlet reports. Instead, they took the side of the boy who was accused and assigned the girl three days of in-school suspension because she made a false accusation and apparently confronted the boy when she was told not to.

Based on my years of experience teaching in public schools, this happens all the time. School administrators can always claim there’s “insufficient evidence” to punish an accused student. If they seriously investigated the issue, it would require police work such as looking at camera footage, taking statements from other students, and reviewing student disciplinary records. What’s more, if they find the accused student guilty, there would be even more paperwork to determine and carry out the proper punishment.

Furthermore, if school administrators are willing to punish this student, then they need to start doing the same for the other guilty students, resulting in more work, more suspensions, and potential charges of racism if the guilty students happen to be black.

In a political environment that stresses equity and minimizing consequences for criminal behavior, there is far more incentive to ignore and discourage reports of bullying and sexual assault than suspending or expelling any bad students. This pressure is why so many school districts have adopted various forms of “restorative discipline” in which they stress therapy and dialogue over investigation and punishment. Restorative discipline does cut down the number of referrals and suspensions, but it also results in much more chaotic campuses.

All this leaves victimized students and their parents with few options. Either they can enlist the help of fellow students to fight on their behalf or they can organize a protest and try to gain public attention. What happened at Little Elm High School seemed to be a mix of both: in one sense, it was a protest against the administrators’ inaction; in another sense, it was a mob intending to intimidate authority.

This makes it difficult to fairly judge the whole thing. The students had every right to assemble and demand justice, but provoking police officers detracts from their cause. Any demand for accountability is undermined by anarchic behavior. Instead of banging on windows and threatening administrators, the students should have involved more adults and spokespeople to articulate and publicize their grievances and call for action.

That said, the protest has succeeded in reopening the investigation of the case that prompted the protest and has resulted in the creation of an independent committee to review sexual assault cases. This is only one step in the right direction. There is still more to do to prevent these cases in the first place. After all, the goal should be to make schools safer, not improve the district’s optics in order to fend off any more protests.

In much the same way that cities have become crime-ridden danger zones due to the literal and rhetorical diminishment of law enforcement, schools are now falling into the same patterns for the same reason. Teachers and administrators are portrayed as perpetrators of injustice if they take serious action against the bullies and predators on their campuses, so they have stepped back.

Until this dangerous cultural dynamic is resolved, or until the government empowers parents to choose where they send their children to school, we can expect more protests and outbreaks of violence, as well as a precipitous decline in the quality of instruction. Hopefully, political and educational leaders can take heed from the lessons of Little Elm High School and restore order, if not for the sake of justice, then at least for the sake of the children.

8 Times Left-Wing Protesters Assaulted Government Buildings,"Self-absorbed congressional Democrats held a group therapy session on Capitol Hill on Thursday as they work tirelessly to immortalize Jan. 6 as an annual day of doom, but the rest of us are old enough to remember a few more times when riots and protests overwhelmed government buildings with no such theatrical response.

More than a few times, actually. The 2020 summer of rage was more or less “incited” by these same top Democrats, who race-baited as if their lives depended on it, and even our vice president, who helped bail violent rioters out of jail. It featured a number of these attacks on the government (which strangely weren’t called attacks on democracy at the time).

Not all of these demonstrations were allegedly a response to the Minnesota death of George Floyd, however. Left-wing demonstrators have long made a habit of attacking, infiltrating, and occupying government buildings. It started long before Jan. 6, 2021, and continued long after.

1. Interior Department Overtaken

Can you spot the difference between these two insurrection photos?

Didn’t think so. One of them was compared to Pearl Harbor and 9/11 by our vice president. The other one barely made the news and was referred to as a mere “sit-in.” Both were attacks by political activists on government buildings.

On Oct. 14, 2021, climate activists breached the Interior Department, with demonstrators who were left outside struggling with law enforcement officers as they reportedly tried to force their way in, shouting “Go inside! Go inside!” Some activists vandalized a building, while others pinned police against a wall. The ordeal resulted in a number of injuries, according to multiple sources, with a police officer being transported to the hospital.

2. President Moved to Bunker After White House Fence Breach

In June 2020, then-President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, and their son Barron were reportedly rushed to a secure bunker when a group of protesters breached temporary barricades that had been set up around the White House complex.

Secret Service reportedly arrested and charged at least four protesters with unlawful entry at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

3. Wisconsin Capitol Overwhelmed

In 2011, thousands of people opposed to Republican Gov. Scott Walker filled the Wisconsin state Capitol, screaming in opposition to the governor’s budget repair bill.

4. Portland Federal Courthouse Overtaken by Violence

The federal courthouse in Portland has been a repeated target of violent Antifa rioters. In July 2020, a mob began setting fires inside the fence protecting the courthouse, shaking the fence, launching projectiles over it, and even trying to take it down. Several people even breached it, with rioters launching projectiles and flashing lasers at the federal police officers who responded.

The next month, the courthouse was shut down completely over domestic terrorism threats that someone might drive a vehicle filled with explosives into the building.

Just hours after a security fence was removed from the courthouse in March 2021, rioters broke glass and lit fires once again.

https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1370281113239891969

Antifa had previously attempted to menace people inside the federal courthouse on the afternoon of March 11, yelling “come outside,” “you don’t scare me b-tch,” “death to America,” and “f-ck the United States” while hurling water and other liquids inside the glass doors, banging on them, and attempting to get inside.

5. Democracy Halted at the Texas Capitol

In July 2013, an unruly mob of pro-abortion demonstrators interfered with the democratic process when thousands of them occupied the Texas Capitol and screamed at the top of their lungs, “grinding the Senate to a halt” with the noise.

6. SCOTUS Police Lines Breached, Senate Overwhelmed by Anti-Kavanaugh Activists

During the dustup over now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination and confirmation to the Supreme Court, which was radically amplified thanks to the Christine Blasey Ford circus, demonstrators forced their way past law enforcement, breaching police lines at both the Senate and the Supreme Court, where they stormed the steps and beat on the doors.

After announcing that he planned to vote for Kavanaugh’s confirmation, then-Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., was accosted on an elevator by several women, who shouted in his face and wouldn’t let him move.

At the beginning of October, shortly before the Senate voted to confirm Kavanaugh, a mob of protesters took over a part of the Hart Senate Office Building, which is part of the Capitol complex.

How many of these people were thrown in solitary confinement for obstructing a democratic process https://t.co/tACqsUWwna — Greg Price (@greg_price11) January 6, 2022

Some even made their way into the gallery during the final vote.

7. Senate Bombed by Left-Wing Terrorists

Linda Evans and Susan Rosenberg, two left-wing extremists, along with five others planted a bomb outside the Senate chamber inside the U.S. Capitol, where it detonated and caused $1 million in damage in 1983.

On his last day as president, Jan. 20, 2001, Bill Clinton commuted the sentences of the violent pair, spurred on by his Democrat buddy Jerry Nadler. As Tristan Justice wrote:

According to the New York Post in 2001, New York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, who today serves as the House Judiciary Committee chairman, played a ‘crucial role’ in Clinton’s decision to commute Rosenberg’s sentence. Nadler’s rabbi, a Nadler spokesman at the time told the Post, gave ‘compelling information from [Rosenberg’s] parole hearing’ to the Manhattan congressman, who, in turn, passed on the material to the White House counsel’s office. That transfer, the Post reported, played a ‘key role’ in the president’s decision to include Rosenberg on his list of 140 last-minute pardons just moments before George W. Bush took the White House.

Each of the women served only 16 years of her long sentence. Rosenberg escaped 42 years of a 58-year sentence, and Evans trimmed 24 years off her 40-year sentence.

8. Senate Chamber Breached by Biden Himself

In now-President Joe Biden’s farewell address to the Senate in 2009, he claimed to have broken into the chamber and sat in the vice president’s chair when he was 21 years old. The first time he stood on the Senate floor was when he visited with friends in the early 1960s, he said.

“I remember vividly the first time I walked in this chamber. I walked through those doors, but I walked through those doors as a 21-year-old tourist,” Biden claimed. “In those days, you could literally drive right up to the front steps. … I drove up to the steps and there had been a rare Saturday session. It had just ended. So I walked up the steps, found myself in front of what we call the elevators, and I walked to the right to the Reception Room.”

“There was no one there. The glass doors, those French doors that lead behind the chamber, were open. There were no signs then. I just walked,” Biden continued. “…I sat in the presiding officer’s chair. I was mesmerized.”

He was then caught by a Capitol Police officer. I wonder if Biden thinks his self-guided Capitol tour “borders on sedition“?",https://thefederalist.com/2022/01/07/8-times-left-wing-protesters-broke-into-government-buildings-and-assaulted-democracy/,2022-01-07
Inside The Latest Protest Against Vaccine Coercion At The Nation’s Capital,"Thousands from across the world gathered in the U.S. capital to protest the Covid-19 vaccination mandates recently put in place in cities across the country, most prominently last week in Washington, D.C., in an event called “Defeat the Mandates: An American Homecoming.” Protesters marched from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial, where they heard speeches and music, all encouraging noncompliance of the vaccine mandates.

Speakers ranged from doctors to comedians to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The overall message of the day was clear: vaccine mandates are unconstitutional and must be abolished. Nearly every speaker also preached a more surprising message of love, bipartisanship, unity, and peace.

The sign hanging from behind the media platform read “vaccinated unvaccinated democrat republican independent Americans of all races backgrounds religions united we stand in peace we march.” Dr. Kevin Ahmaad Jenkins harkened back to Martin Luther King Jr. who spoke where he was 58 years ago, saying that both of them are fighting for freedom.

“You understand 58 years ago we were standing in this square, trying to unite the world to come together to fight against the tyranny of their time. Now it is our time to fight against the tyranny of our time.”

Peaceful and Loving Protest

Jenkins said Americans are loving people, and it will take courage, sacrifice, and love of one another to save the nation from succumbing to tyrannical mandates. In a moment of what can only be described as pure endearment, he even asked protestors to hug one another, many of whom did.

Allison Schuster

Through much of the protest, amid audience-wide chants of saving the children and ending the tyranny, music from solo artists and a live band blared through the speakers in front of the Lincoln Memorial. Other common themes include trusting God, distrusting the media, and a strong disdain for big pharma and the Centers for Disease Control, World Health Organization, and National Institutes of Health.

A few speakers adopted some rhetoric from the left, arguing everyone at the protest will be on the “right side of history.” One such speaker, emcee J.P. Sears, described the gravity of the mandates, telling how he and others will tell future generations of current times.

Allison Schuster

“We will either be telling them stories about what freedom was or what mandates were.”

Doctors Emphasize Natural Immunity’s Strengths

A team of doctors took up a large portion of the speech portion of the demonstration. Although individual doctors spoke with varying emphases, all echoed that natural immunity is undoubtedly stronger than protection from the vaccine.

Almost all doctors also said the vaccine is a result of corrupt corporations and government agencies working to promote their own profits rather than actually promoting life-saving treatment, which was available long before the vaccine was created.

Big Pharma Controlling Our Health Policy

“We are fighting a war. It’s a war on our health. It’s a war that’s been going on for decades and it’s waged by the pharmaceutical industry. They have always put profits before patients. That toll has been heavy over the decades. It is now a crime against humanity,” Dr. Pierre Kory, founding member of Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance said. “We are fighting against Big Pharma. They have controlled and captured our health agencies. Every single policy that they have issued out of those agencies.”

Kory said for two years there have been “cheap, safe, highly effective, and widely available medicines” to treat Covid-19, a fact that has been suppressed through censorship and propaganda. Many of his colleagues in health care have even been brainwashed, he said, although many may not believe vaccines are more effective but encourage patients to get them to avoid losing licensing.

Losing Liberty

“They tell us to vaccinate ourselves endlessly and boost ourselves. Even though that single strategy has failed, is failing, it will continue to fail,” Kory said. “The phrase ‘live free or die’ has never meant more to me than it does now. We must live free or we will die, everybody.”

Both Dr. Aaron Kheriaty, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and chief of ethics at The Unity Project, and Dr. Robert Malone, the scientist known for helping invent mRNA technology, focused on the ruling class’s manipulation of Covid to foster control. A society grounded in social distancing is antithetical to humanity, Kheriaty argued, and has served as a pretext for expanding state powers with no end in sight.

Allison Schuster

“We’re seeing the emergence of what I call a biosecurity surveillance regime. The welding of digital technologies, public health, and police power, are leading to unprecedented invasions on our privacy, and intrusive methods of control,” Kheriaty said. “And keep in mind that this pretext of public health and public safety historically has been used to pave the way even for totalitarian regimes.”

Those who have suffered serious health consequences after receiving the vaccine were also represented at the rally. A few shared their testimonies, and there was a moment of silence for those suffering from adverse effects of the vaccine.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/01/25/inside-the-latest-protest-against-vaccine-coercion-at-the-nations-capital/,2022-01-25
Canada's Truckers Inspire Global Convoy Protests Against Covid Fascism,"Image Credit Reuters/YouTube

What started out as a localized protest ignored by legacy media has now devolved into a worldwide demonstration against Covid fascism. Following moves by the Canadian federal government to mandate Covid jabs for truckers crossing the U.S.-Canada border, drivers launched a protest movement dubbed the “Freedom Convoy,” which began in the western province of British Columbia early last week and arrived in the Canadian capital of Ottawa on Friday evening.

Parking outside of the nation’s Parliament Hill, the truckers were joined by thousands of Canadians to voice their opposition to the country’s increasingly draconian Covid mandates, with one participant telling the BBC that Canadians just want “to be free again.”

“[W]e want to have our choice again, and we want hope – and the government has taken that away,” Harold Jonker, a truck driver, said.

Originally expecting as many as 10,000 people by Saturday’s end, Canadian police said that by evening, “the force did not have an official estimate of the crowd’s size.” According to the Toronto Sun, the convoy “could comprise 50,000 trucks from the West, East, and even from the United States,” but noted that its actual size “has not been independently verified.”

https://twitter.com/aginnt/status/1487694543243956225?s=20&t=9IHmFZRWjdAh9LQNlcytzg

Canada’s leftist politicians and media figures predictably attempted to smear the truckers as radical extremists, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau labeling the group as a “small, fringe minority of people who are on their way to Ottawa or who are holding unacceptable views that they are expressing do not represent the views of Canadians following the science.” Trudeau has reportedly been moved from his residence to an undisclosed location within the capital amid the ongoing protest.

A journalist for Canadian news outlet CBC decided to give her own hot take on the matter, suggesting Russia was behind the massive protest.

“Given Canada’s support of Ukraine in this current crisis with Russia, I don’t know if it is far-fetched to ask, but there is concern that Russian actors could be continuing to fuel things as this protest grows. But perhaps, even instigating it from the outset,” she said.

So desperate to smear. pic.twitter.com/x8h6BSmOJh — Canada Proud (@WeAreCanProud) January 29, 2022

In the fight against their government’s totalitarian edicts, Canada’s truckers have also inspired numerous convoy-style protests across the globe. In Australia, truckers are reportedly planning a “Convoy to Canberra” protest against the country’s medical mandates and restrictions, with participants scheduled “to meet in cities in Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia before making their way to the nation’s capital.”

Across the globe in the Netherlands, Dutch drivers held their own convoy protest where “everything and everyone on wheels” is welcome.

“Omrop Fryslâan reported that about 25 trucks, dozens of cars and several tractors gathered in Leeuwarden to drive past all 11 Frisian cities to protest the coronavirus restrictions,” the Netherlands Times reported Sunday. “A convoy also drove around in Overijssel, which according to RTV Oost, consists of dozens of demonstrators in trucks and cars that would move from Hengelo to Zwolle. Convoys were also seen in Noord-Holland, Flevoland and Limburg.”

What GoFundMe's Grab For Trucker Funds Proves About Big Tech's Evils,"GoFundMe’s grab for the money raised by the Freedom Convoy exposes just how evil tech companies that do the bidding of government tyrants can be.

In response to concerns by Canadian officials who openly despise the mass trucker protest against the vaccine mandate and called protesters racists, GoFundMe announced on Friday that the truckers who raised millions of dollars from people around the world would be cut off from the funds. GoFundMe announced that instead, it would be stealing the funds collected by the Freedom Convoy account to redistribute to its own inevitably leftist charities.

At the request of Trudeau, @GoFundMe has just stolen $9,000,000 from the truckers. Rather than automatically refunding it to the donors, they say they’re going to give it to groups of their own choosing. What a windfall for Black Lives Matter, Greenpeace and Planned Parenthood! pic.twitter.com/prEwLnypfe — Ezra Levant 🍁🚛 (@ezralevant) February 4, 2022

Facing legal backlash from Florida and Texas for its corrupt actions, GoFundMe backtracked its threat and agreed to return the donations, but the fundraising site shouldn’t be let off the hook. GoFundMe proved what many Americans already knew to be true about tech companies: They will gladly collude with governments to silence dissenters and smear peaceful protesters as extremists.

The social media platforms that were once hailed as great tools for promoting civic engagement and activism have transformed into tyrannical instruments for subduing dissenting opinions and movements.

In just the last two years, Big Tech has morphed into the biggest enemy of the people and free speech by censoring discussions about Anthony Fauci and the origins of COVID-19, quelling coverage of Biden family corruption, silencing critics of election fraud, and deplatforming Donald Trump while he was still the sitting U.S. president.

The Federalist and other conservative organizations have endured fake “fact checks” commissioned by Big Tech and executed by propaganda organizations with leftist and communist ties. Pro-life organizations, charities supporting sick children, and others have also suffered censorship at the hands of these companies that work in tandem to silence them.

These companies routinely choose strong-arm tactics to get what they and the government want. It’s a strategy eerily similar to communist China’s. When it comes to censoring people, Big Tech is more often than not prompted, encouraged, and celebrated by the Biden administration and Democrats, who throw around buzzwords like “misinformation” and “insurrection” to sanitize their iron-fisted efforts and demonize their opponents.

Now protesters in Canada are facing the same tyranny from GoFundMe, which has stood ready to answer the call of government to shut down dissidents. Already Ottawa government officials are setting up the truckers, who are protesting for freedom in the heart of a province ruled by vaccine mandates, to be further persecuted by the government.

Using the same excuses employed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s partisan Jan. 6 committee to justify targeting Americans, members of the Ottawa government are smearing the freedom convoy as a “nationwide insurrection.” As a result, hundreds of people were ticketed and others arrested for participating in what has been a largely peaceful demonstration against Canada’s hunger for despotism.

Diane Deans, the chair of the city’s police services board not only said protesters are “a threat to our democracy,” but claimed they were “emboldened by the lack of enforcement by every level of government.”

Videos and pictures from the protest, however, show a different scene. Law enforcement officers seized gasoline cans from protesters and said that anyone “attempting to bring material supports to demonstrators could be subject to arrest.”

Ottowa Police even encouraged people to report the convoy to the city’s “hate crime hotline,” which received more than 150 calls on Friday.

Just days before the authoritarian arrest frenzy, Ottawa police praised GoFundMe for “listening to our concerns as a City” by stealing the funds raised by the Freedom Convoy to redistribute to its own causes.

We want to thank @gofundme for listening to our concerns as a City and a police service. The decision to withhold funding for these unlawful demonstrations is an important step and we call on all crowdfunding sites to follow. — Ottawa Police (@OttawaPolice) February 5, 2022

GoFundMe may have backed down for now, but the Freedom Convoy truckers should expect more opposition, more censorship, more corruption, and more evil from the tech companies that have proved they’re ready and more than willing to do the government’s authoritarian bidding.

18 Fundraisers Aiding Riots And Murder That GoFundMe Didn't Shut Down,"While GoFundMe races to confiscate millions of dollars from Canadians protesting the country’s coercive Covid response, the left-wing fundraising site has proven itself very willing to help raise funds for criminal riots, abortions, and genital mutilation.

“We now have evidence from law enforcement that the previously peaceful demonstration has become an occupation, with police reports of violence and other unlawful activity,” GoFundMe wrote in the company’s Friday announcement that it would steal millions from the truckers participating in the “Freedom Convoy” to protest Canada’s Covid mandates, diverting the money “to credible and established charities chosen by the Freedom Convoy 2022 organizers and verified by GoFundMe.” After backlash, the platform announced it would instead refund the money to donors.

GoFundMe cited one of its terms of service that “prohibits the promotion of violence and harassment.” The group used similar logic to suspend fundraising campaigns for Kyle Rittenhouse, who was acquitted of all charges after he shot three men in self-defense. GoFundMe tried to defend its decision then by claiming that “GoFundMe’s Terms of Service prohibit raising money for the legal defense of an alleged violent crime,” despite the platform’s willingness to crowdsource for arrested rioters.

Also, after a protest on Jan. 6, 2021 saw some attendees forcibly enter the U.S. Capitol building, GoFundMe said it would nix fundraisers for “travel to a political event where there’s risk of violence by the attendees,” as well as those that “spread misinformation about the election, promote conspiracy theories and contribute to or participate in attacks on U.S. democracy.”

Those who now seek to shut down the “Freedom Convoy” in Canada are leaning on similar inflammatory language as that used to stoke outrage in describing the U.S. Capitol incident. Yet for all the company’s efforts to shut down freedom-minded Canadians, GoFundMe has done plenty to help unsavory fundraising campaigns on the left, which include funding for crimes, criminal defense, killing babies, and more. Here are just a few examples.

Funding for Criminals, Riots

One GoFundMe fundraising campaign entitled “CHARGED WITH BANK ROBBERY DURING GEORGE FLOYD RIOT” is seeking bail money for Dominique Maxey, who was arrested in May 2020 and charged with bank larceny.

In another listing, Raven S. is seeking $2,000 to help pay fines after, as she wrote, “on November 13 I was arrested and detained for trying to assist a man being wrongfully assaulted by police.”

A woman named Stephanie has raised nearly $3,000 for her daughter who was arrested in conjunction with a riot in 2020. “Tia Pugh, a 21 year old resident of Mobile, was arrested for alleged criminal mischief and inciting a riot while attending a George Floyd protest the Sunday prior; two municipal misdemeanors. She was then arrested for federal felony civil unrest for the same incident,” she wrote.

After three suspects were arrested for vandalizing the home of a defense witness in the Derek Chauvin trial, leaving his home “smeared with animal blood” with “a severed pig’s head dumped on the front porch,” GoFundMe enabled the three self-described “community activists” to raise more than $10,000 for legal fees.

GoFundMe allowed a campaign called “PDX Protest Bail Fund” to raise nearly $1.4 million for arrestees.

The fundraising site has also enabled CrimethInc. to raise nearly $60,000, despite the group’s promotion of violence to an extent that even Facebook banned it.

After Alissa Azar was indicted on a felony riot charge and multiple misdemeanor charges, including one relating to the use of tear gas and pepper spray against another person, GoFundMe helped her raise more than $6,000 for legal defense.

When “comrades” “reclaimed” (read: took over) a hotel in Minneapolis, GoFundMe enabled the trespassers to raise more than $245,000.

GoFundMe itself donated $500 to the Riot Kitchen, a pro-riot food truck. Eight “Riot Kitchen” members were arrested in August 2020 near Kenosha, Wis., after filling numerous gas cans and attempting to escape after police confronted them, according to law enforcement. Police also reported “helmets, gas masks, protective vests, illegal fireworks and suspected controlled substances” in the vehicles.

GoFundMe also took to Twitter to promote a fundraiser for farmers inside Seattle’s “Capitol Hill Occupational Protest,” in which rioters overtook a police precinct and set up their own lawless compound for weeks. (Contrast that to what GoFundMe’s leftist allies are calling an “occupation” in Canada.)

Killing Babies and Funding Mutilation

GoFundMe also helps people to raise money to be able to kill their unwanted children.

In a listing titled “Help fund my abortion,” Sofia Abdul has raised $183 toward an $800 goal to put her child to death.

Another person named Sol who describes herself as nonbinary has raised $460 to get an abortion because she “got pregnant when I missed a couple pills.”

Similar listings seek money to “Help Create An Abortion Fund In South Carolina” and “Help Fund Texan Abortions.”

GoFundMe also platforms numerous fundraisers where people can pay for the mutilation of other people’s bodies. “I can’t stand my body anymore,” says a man who goes by Lena B. who is reportedly €35,000 in debt after “5 years of transition” and seeking more money to finish his surgical abuse.

A man who goes by Maeve has raised nearly £8,000 to affirm his fantasies of being a woman. “I first realised that I was transgender when I was 14 years old in 2009, but unfortunately due to my anxious and depressive disposition combined at that point undiagnosed Autism, I stayed in the closet until a botched suicide attempt when I was 24,” he wrote, seeking money for things like “Facial Feminization Surgery” and “psychotherapy” after a “bad experience” with “one evangelical Christian psychotherapist that sought to deny my transness.” Clearly this suffering man needs help, but not via the financing of mutilative surgery and further mental anguish.

A mom calling herself Helen is using GoFundMe to raise money to pay for similarly deforming “treatment” for her child. “Please help us to support my son’s transition,” she wrote of her son Max.

Another mom named Marie is seeking money to mutilate her daughter’s genitals and breasts. “I am trying to raise funds to support my son within his transition from female to male,” she wrote. “The money raised will be spent on appointment fees, Top Surgery & Bottom Surgery.”

"Canadian Elites Created The Ottawa Crisis, Have No Idea How To End It","Corporate media outlets like The Atlantic and The New York Times have been telling us for years now how Hungary and Poland are incubators of authoritarianism that represent an existential threat to democracy. But it turns out we should have been worried about Canada and Australia, of all places.

If you had told me 18 months ago that Australia, a democratic country that once seemed to exude rugged individualism, would devolve into a Covid police state that imprisons its citizens in quarantine camps and deploys riot police to crush lockdown protests with brute force, I wouldn’t have believed you. But here we are.

Now comes Canada, where the “Freedom Convoy” of truckers that arrived in Ottawa more than a week ago to protest Covid vaccine mandates has effectively shut down Canada’s capital. The mayor declared a state of emergency on Monday after the city’s law enforcement authorities talked openly about calling in the military over the weekend.

Foremost among these has been Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly, who has ominously called the protests “highly organized, well-funded, extremely committed to resisting all attempts to end the demonstrations safely,” and rather recklessly said there “may not be a policing solution” to the crisis. Meanwhile, the police appear to be making the situation worse. Faced with hundreds of heavy-duty trucks and tractors downtown, authorities in Ottawa are now seizing gasoline, food, and other supplies from protesters, although it’s unclear they have any legal authority to do so.

News media in both Canada and the United States have worked hard to portray the protesters as far-right conspiracy theorists and white supremacists, despite little evidence that the protests are motivated by anything other than sincere opposition to Covid vaccine mandates. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, taking his cues from the press, last week condemned the protests as an “insult to memory and truth,” and implied they were motivated not by objections to vaccine mandates but by racial animus. Canada’s conservative politicians seem divided and rudderless, unable to provide the protesters a voice or meaningful support, let alone a legitimate democratic outlet for their grievances.

The situation, in short, is a powder keg. There are no clear off-ramps for the protesters, and no one in a position of authority seems to know how to deescalate the situation. Having accepted the Canadian media’s near-uniform portrayal of the protesters as racists and bigots, it’s unlikely Trudeau’s government will be willing to compromise. What happens next is anybody’s guess, but it will likely involve violent clashes between police and protesters.

How did this happen? The idea that the Canadian capital would become the site of such a standoff in 2022 seems frankly unbelievable. But the chaos now unfolding in Ottawa can be traced directly to the harsh treatment of unvaccinated Canadians by their government over the past six months or so.

It’s true that Canadians have largely embraced the Covid vaccines, with a vaccination rate of about 85 percent nationwide, and large majorities also support vaccine passports and say they don’t trust the unvaccinated. But this has given Canadian political and media elites cover to threaten the unvaccinated in what often seems a gleeful tone.

As my friend David Agren has reported, Canada’s federal jobs minister in October stated bluntly — and without a hint of sympathy — that Canadians fired for not getting the vaccine would also lose their unemployment insurance. Indeed, threatening the livelihoods of the unvaccinated, or threatening to tax them, has become commonplace for Canadian government officials at the federal and provincial levels.

However, a significant minority of Canadians are staunchly opposed to getting the vaccine, and likely won’t get it no matter what the government threatens to do to them. The unwillingness or inability on the part of Trudeau to compromise with these holdouts has arguably precipitated the current stand-off in Ottawa. Some, like Canadian pollster John Wright, have been warning of this outcome for some time now. Over the weekend, Wright noted that even if only one out of 10 Canadians refuse to get the vaccine, that’s still a major problem.

As far back as a 18 months ago I said 1 in 10 Canadians would not go along with passports/restrictions/vaccines and would resort to doing exactly as they are doing today. This is about 3.8 million people. Those who think this will end soon or peacefully are dreaming. — John Wright (@JohnWrightLive) February 5, 2022

Trudeau and his fellow left-wing elites, who have long defined themselves by their anti-Americanism, might revel in a confrontation with what they perceive to be a Trumpian populist movement in Canada. But they should be careful, because what comes next might well have reverberations outside Canada.

The Ottawa stand-off has already spilled over into a broader conflict between Big Tech and populism in the United States, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis forcing GoFundMe to back away from its threat to confiscate and redistribute some $10 million in donations for the convoy protesters.

From here, the crisis could easily widen further. Sloly, the Ottawa police chief, has claimed that a “significant element from the United States” has been involved in the funding and organization of the protest convoy. It’s not hard to imagine the U.S. intelligence community and the F.B.I., at the behest of Trudeau’s government, going after convoy protest organizers inside the United States.

In that case, the Biden administration’s support for a Trudeau crackdown should rightly be understood as a terrifying and malign collusion of left-wing elites in Ottawa and Washington, D.C. Such collusion would of course have implications far beyond the frozen streets of the Canadian capital.

It might seem unbelievable, after two years of this pandemic, that we’re now discussing the possible deployment of Canada’s military to crush a domestic populist revolt, or grappling with the prospect of a weaponized U.S. law enforcement colluding with the Canadian left to crush dissenting voices in America. But this is really happening, and it’s happening because our elites will not tolerate dissent — at least not from the wrong sort of people.

Freedom Convoy To End Covid Tyranny Is Getting Results Worldwide,"After the embarrassment of the Freedom Convoy, Canada’s Justin Trudeau is facing a new challenge to his authority. This time, it’s coming from within his own party.

For the last two weeks, more than 1,000 truck drivers have converged on Canada’s capital, Ottawa, to protest the country’s coronavirus restrictions. Their movement, dubbed the Freedom Convoy, is demanding an end to the country’s strict vaccine and mask mandates for travel across the U.S.-Canada Border, or Trudeau’s resignation as prime minister.

Initially, Trudeau dismissed the group as a “fringe minority” that didn’t represent the views of Canadians. Since it began, however, the protest has attracted more than 10,000 participants and gained global attention as a flashpoint in the civil divide over pandemic restrictions.

It has inspired another planned truck convoy in the United States, from California to Washington D.C., as well as other protests in solidarity around the world. Another group of truckers have blocked traffic on the Ambassador Bridge connecting Detroit, Michigan with Windsor, Canada — the largest port of cross-border trade — costing Canada’s economy more than $300 million per day.

Opinions of the protest have been sharply divided along political lines, especially in the United States. While corporate media outlets have been quick to side with the Canadian government, calling it a “cult” and “insurrection,” conservative politicians and commentators have endorsed the protest. Four GOP state attorneys-general – in Florida, Texas, West Virginia, and Louisiana – have vowed to investigate crowdfunding website GoFundMe for shutting down a fundraiser for the truckers that raised $7.5 Million.

It now seems that Trudeau is losing the left, as well. In the last two days, members of Canada’s parliament in Trudeau’s Liberal Party caucus have criticized his mask and vaccine mandates.

Joel Lightbound, an MP from the politically important province of Quebec, slammed the government for “politicization of the pandemic” and “normalizing [Covid measures] with no end in sight.” In a speech on the Freedom Convoy implicitly challenging Trudeau, he claimed “no epidemiological evidence” had been provided in support of the measures and demanded a timeline to end all mask and vaccine mandates.

The next day, another Liberal MP, Yves Robillard, endorsed the speech, claiming “He said exactly what a lot of us [in the caucus] think,” and saying Canada’s Covid mandates had affected his mental health.

These comments are a political earthquake for Trudeau. While in the United States members of Congress often dissent from their leadership, Canada’s parliamentary government means party discipline is rigid. Backbench MPs usually never break with the prime minister on any issue, and risk expulsion from the party (and loss of their seats next election) if they do. That even two MPs from Trudeau’s party would criticize him openly is unprecedented, revealing that opinion is souring on his leadership during Covid-19 and response to the protests.

Moreover, if Robillard’s comments are to be believed, several other Liberal MPs may share these views. In Canada’s parliament, where Trudeau has a minority, this could set the stage for a challenge to his premiership if more support is forthcoming, with the Liberal caucus or parliament as a whole, voting to reject confidence in Trudeau’s government.

Success of either measure would remove Trudeau as prime minister, one of the Freedom Convoy’s objectives. It would also likely plunge Canada into a general election, the second within five months after the last one in 2021.

All this comes as the opposition Conservative Party faces its own leadership race after former leader Erin O’Toole was ousted from his job because of the Freedom Convoy. O’Toole, a center-right politician with liberal positions on vaccines and masks, had been reluctant to support the protests, which angered his caucus and led to his swift removal by a vote of MPs last week.

Ottawa-area Conservative Pierre Poilievre – known for his social media clips of verbal jousting with Trudeau in parliament – is the frontrunner in the race to replace him, and has openly embraced the protesters. These events demonstrate that the Freedom Convoy is beginning to impact mainstream politics across North America.

More than one dozen U.S. states, and four of Canada’s ten provinces, this week announced timelines to end most Covid regulations within the next month. Meanwhile, the Freedom Convoy continues to garner donations. After its removal from GoFundMe, it has raised nearly $9 million on the Christian crowdfunding website GiveSendGo.

Trudeau Doesn't Want To End The Protests Peacefully. He Wants Violence,"The only way to understand the actions of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over the past two weeks is that he wants the Freedom Convoy protests in Ottawa, which so far have been entirely peaceful, to descend into a violent confrontation between protesters and police.

Everything Trudeau has done, from his initial dismissive remarks about the protesters being a “small, fringe minority” with “unacceptable views,” to his ongoing refusal to meet with them, to the unprecedented invocation of the Emergencies Act this week, has served to escalate the situation in Ottawa and increase the likelihood that it ends in some kind of violence.

Consider the draconian measures Trudeau’s government is now pursuing. The protests, while certainly inconvenient and even onerous to the residents of Ottawa, are obviously not an existential threat to Canada. They are not even a national emergency according to the Emergencies Act’s own definition: an “urgent and critical situation” that “seriously endangers the lives, health or safety of Canadians and is of such proportions or nature as to exceed the capacity or authority of a province to deal with it.”

No reasonable person thinks that’s what the protests in Ottawa are. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association has said the federal government has not met the threshold necessary to invoke the Emergencies Act, and that invoking it “threatens our democracy and our civil liberties.” According to some recent polls, a not insignificant number of Canadians agree.

Yet Trudeau is bringing down the full force of the federal government to quash the Freedom Convoy. Under the Emergencies Act, protesters can have their bank accounts frozen, and so can people who simply donate to protesters. Crowdfunding platforms and payment service providers must cease all services to anyone they suspect might be participating in “illegal blockades,” and report it to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Truckers can have their commercial and private drivers’ licenses revoked, and can lose their insurance and their vehicles.

Even more ominously, Canadian government officials are now warning parents who bring their children to “illegal assemblies,” or even provide food or fuel to protesters, that they could not only face jail time and steep fines, they could lose custody of their children. On Wednesday, the Children’s Aid Society of Ottawa put out a statement urging parents at the demonstrations to make alternate care arrangements, “should they become unable to care for their children following potential police action.”

The threat here is obvious: if you protest, we’ll arrest you and take your children away. Trudeau has effectively weaponized Canada’s version of child protective services to suppress legitimate political dissent. What do you think is going to happen when the police start trying to remove children from their parents? If it were your child, what would you do?

All of this could come to a head in the coming days. Police in Ottawa have begun handing out notices to protesters that they must “leave the area now” or face arrest. According to some reports, if police want to clear the streets of Ottawa, they’re going to have to get it done in the next 48 hours, because thousands more protesters are expected to arrive in the Canadian capital this coming weekend in what could be the largest demonstration yet.

But it’s unclear how exactly the authorities are going to clear the trucks. Towing these semi-trailers is going to take heavy equipment, and so far local towing companies have refused government requests to tow the Freedom Convoy trucks. The military would be able to move them, and Trudeau’s invocation of the Emergencies Act enables the use of the military for such an operation. But that would create a disturbing spectacle at the least, and at worst provoke a confrontation that could turn violent.

If that happens, Trudeau will bear the blame. He has set up a situation where violence, or at least some kind of forcible crackdown by Canadian law enforcement against protesters, is becoming inevitable. Indeed, how else are we to understand Trudeau’s statement earlier this week that the protests, which have so far been totally peaceful, are in his judgment no longer “non-violent”?

At no point, even after drawing widespread criticism for his mishandling of the situation, has Trudeau shown any sign of compromise, or done anything to give the protesters an off-ramp. Even as provincial governments have eased or rescinded Covid mandates and restrictions in the face of sharply declining case numbers and hospitalizations, Trudeau is holding fast. As Eric Kaufman noted this week in the Telegraph, Trudeau’s hypocrisy in these matters is blatant:

Contrast his combative posture towards the truckers with his gentle approach to protesters who would seem to share his philosophy. When Left-wing arsonists burned some 30 Catholic churches over a false claim that mass graves had been discovered near a former residential school for indigenous Canadians, Trudeau called the violence ‘understandable’. When indigenous protesters and their allies blocked rail lines and pipelines over a longer period than the trucker convoy, Trudeau patiently called for ‘dialogue and mutual respect’.

The Canadian prime minister’s reactions to these events tell us that he condones actual political violence and disruptive blockades, as long he agrees with the people who are doing it. The truckers, though, have gotten neither dialogue nor respect from Trudeau and his administration. After all, to Trudeau they’re just a bunch of racists and misogynists with “unacceptable views.”

On Wednesday, he doubled down on the name-calling, responding to a conservative Jewish MP that Conservative Party members “stand with people who wave swastikas,” and “stand with people who wave the Confederate flag…” (For that quip, Trudeau earned a rebuke from the speaker of the House of Commons, who reminded him “to use words that are not inflammatory.”)

At this point, if you’re a protester in Canada, or someone who supports the protests, or even someone who thinks the protesters are wrong but the government has gone too far, the message from Trudeau is clear: We will not listen to you, we will not compromise with you, and if you don’t comply with our orders, we will ruin you.

That is a recipe for violence, and Trudeau knows it. He wants to make an example out of these truckers because deep down he is an illiberal man with an intolerant worldview.

These protesters have the wrong views, so they don’t deserve the “dialogue and mutual respect” afforded to left-wing protesters. For all his virtue-signaling about diversity, Trudeau doesn’t really believe in Canada as a pluralistic society where people of different views and ways of life can live together in peace. He believes in a society where the little people, the people with the wrong views, do as they’re told.

The thing is, most of these protesters have done just that. The vast majority of the truckers are vaccinated. They have complied with some of the most severe Covid mandates and restrictions in the western world for two years now. They did all that was asked of them, and when they finally got fed up with it they organized a peaceful protest.

And for that, Trudeau is trying to crush them.

Trudeau’s Harsh Response To Peaceful Trucker Protest Is A Fool’s Move,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has invoked Canada’s Emergencies Act to treat like terrorists the trucker protest in the capital city of Ottawa and at key Canada-U.S. border crossings. Citing a “public order emergency,” Trudeau can now deploy the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, forbid any public assembly, control private companies, cut off supplies, and seize bank accounts to stop the “emergency.”

“Without a court order, banks will be able freeze personal accounts of anyone linked to the protests,” noted Aaron Kheriaty.

These powers are unilateral, neither requiring court orders nor approval from the Canadian parliament until such time as the parliament sees fit to end the declaration or for 30 days. The Emergencies Act has never been used since its inception in 1988.

The federal government has not met the threshold necessary to invoke the Emergencies Act. This law creates a high and clear standard for good reason: the Act allows government to bypass ordinary democratic processes. This standard has not been met. 1/3 — Canadian Civil Liberties Association (@cancivlib) February 15, 2022

Beginning in late January, truckers amassed in a convoy across Canada to protest the country’s vaccine requirements for border crossings and other Covid restrictions. Dubbed “The Freedom Convoy,” the demonstration consists of several hundred big rigs and personal vehicles.

This moving protest culminated in a week-long blockade of one of the busiest Canada-U.S. border crossings, the Ambassador Bridge, connecting Windsor, Ontario with Detroit, Michigan. While the bridge blockade has been dissipated by national, provincial, and local police, Ottawa remains in gridlock, which prompted the PM’s seizure of emergency powers.

Trudeau is playing a very dangerous game here. As a truck driver myself, I warn my friends and family to not mess with truckers. Normally, I’m talking about not cutting us off in traffic, passing on the right, or pulling out in front of big rigs on busy highways and streets. People should also be warned not to mess with a trucker’s money, home time, and most especially his rigs and equipment.

Furthermore, officials ought to know that getting any two truck drivers to agree on anything is a monumental task. When you get several hundred of them in solidarity and willing to forsake cash, time at home, and even their own trucks, you’d better believe that whatever they’re after is deadly serious.

Fortunately, no one has been killed or even injured during the convoy and blockades, but introducing threats of government force greatly increases the likelihood of that possibility. Knowing truckers and their respect for both law enforcement and the rule of law, the ideal outcome will be that the drivers simply go home having made their presence and voices known in noble fashion. Trudeau loses in this situation because he comes off as an unimaginative tyrant whose creativity to deal with peaceful political expression is limited to bringing in storm troopers.

A less desirable outcome for this authoritarian power grab is that the PM arrests the truckers and their families, dragging them out of their rigs, while forcing tow trucks to come in and haul them away. Trudeau and his party will pay dearly as their political opponents use those images ad infinitum to win future elections. Truckers 2. Trudeau 0.

Trudeau’s best option at this point is negotiation, but he’s refused to do even a little. He should have used that option as his opening salvo. He could have saved face and stayed the protests when the convoys began.

No one wants violence to be the result of these demonstrations. Still, armed officers making arrests while clearing blockades can go sideways very quickly, and it’s likely Trudeau knows this and wants to bait truckers into violence. Fighting words, aggressive behavior, and even bad moods can ruin a trucker’s day on the road, and the same goes for law enforcement. These lines of work are dangerous, stressful, and exhausting jobs.

And all this for what? To protect Covid restrictions that are quickly being revoked across the world and Canada, expiring or due to expire early next month? There is no obvious upside for the PM here, and he is daily proving his incompetence as Canada’s leader. His response is extreme and vacuous on the merits.

At any rate, Trudeau’s sophomoric name-calling has quickly escalated into a potentially violent situation that presents no good effects for him or Canada and only elevates the message of the trucker convoy-protest to worldwide recognition. Truckers in New Zealand and France have followed the lead of the Canadian demonstrations with similar results. Starting on Feb. 23, U.S. truckers are planning a nationwide convoy beginning in California, picking up drivers through the “Crossroads of America” in Indiana, and converging on Washington DC.

These truckers are merely asserting their rights to decide what goes into their bodies and to speak freely and peaceably about their political views. Like U.S. Democrats, Trudeau may believe it’s a good idea to label his peaceful political opponents as domestic terrorists, but this will in the long run only embitter them and provoke more anger instead of bringing about a peaceful resolution to these citizens’ concerns.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/18/trudeaus-harsh-response-to-peaceful-trucker-protest-is-a-fools-move/,2022-02-18
Canadian Veteran: Trudeau Has Declared War On His Own People,"Harold Ristau was born in Kitchener, Ontario, and deployed several times to Iraq and Afghanistan in the Canadian armed forces as a military chaplain. He told a local paper he was motivated to join the military after helping Afghan refugees with asylum cases while he pastored an inner-city church in Montreal. In 2014, Canada awarded Ristau one of its highest military recognitions, the Chief of the Defense Staff Commendation, for “achievements beyond the line of duty.”

He wore that medal atop his veteran uniform when he visited the trucker Freedom Convoy in Ottawa on Feb. 12, he told The Federalist in a phone interview. There, smartphone cameras captured him leading other veterans in slowly dismantling a blockade around a war memorial, then cleaning and decorating the monument. Police stood by and watched.

Then Ristau led attendees in the Lord’s Prayer, Apostle’s Creed, and a rendition of “O, Canada,” the national anthem. He also gave a benediction and led the crowd in an impromptu prayer for peace and the well-being of those in government, as well as accountability for their abuses of the Canadian people over the past two years. The convoy began when the Canadian government started enforcing vaccine passports on truckers and others at its border with the United States.

“We prayed to hold those who have done bad, who need to repent and take account for wrongdoing, that they be held accountable for their sins and receive the mercy of God,” Ristau told The Federalist. “We prayed that there be no injuries, that no one here would have a hateful thought in our hearts, that our hearts would be filled with love.”

Ristau noted that before police closed in on the protesters, the demonstration had a sort of market fair attitude, with bouncy castles for children, soup kitchens for the hungry, and organized cleanups of public property. When there were complaints about the truckers’ noise and local disruptions, they stopped making noise after 6 p.m., local news accounts confirm. He also witnessed that the truckers kept emergency lanes open during their protest to protect locals.

For his peaceful participation in this public assembly, Ristau has faced criticism and threats from fellow pastors, fellow citizens, the government-run Canadian media, and the government itself. On Feb. 14, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act, which he claims allows the Canadian government to seize the children and property of anyone who attended the protest, without a court order or even proceeding.

“Since this legislation was enacted in 1988, we have faced separatist movements that sought to break up the country, terrorist movements that sought to wreak havoc and a pandemic that has brought our society to a standstill. Not once has the federal government resorted to this law or these extraordinary and overreaching measures,” noted Toronto Sun columnist Brian Lilley on Sunday.

The Canadian government has also deployed anti-terrorist banking measures to shut down the personal and crowdfunding accounts of those involved in the protests.

Canadian police arrested nearly 200 protesters Sunday and threatened those who brought their children to the Ottawa protest with up to five years in prison. In response, convoy organizers announced an orderly departure from the nation’s capital. On Monday, the Canadian Senate is scheduled to review Trudeau’s use of the act previously known as the War Measures Act, which was only used once before to unilaterally suspend the rule of law in the country, during a hostage and murder situation in Parliament in the 1970s.

Using the act in response to a peaceful protest with largely only traffic violation-level offenses, Ristau said in an interview with the Christian radio program Issues, Etc. last week, means “you basically declare war on your own people.” As a Canadian veteran — he is now a civilian chaplain supervising Canadian military chaplains — threatening to use war powers against one’s own citizens is a clear breach of law and public trust, he said.

It’s also dangerous to a democracy, in which governments are supposed to wield their powers under the rule of law and with the consent of the governed. Yet “from the get-go Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has treated [the Canadian truckers] like terrorists,” Ristau said on the program. “You don’t negotiate with terrorists.”

Violence related to the protest has been largely used by those opposed to the convoy and its counterparts in other parts of Canada. Perhaps the most significant act of violence was when a man allegedly drove an SUV headlong into convoy supporters, injuring four.

While the Royal Mounted Canadian Police cleared Ottawa streets over the weekend, they trampled several protesters with their horses, including an elderly woman with a walker, according to the Toronto Sun. Police also beat journalists while clearing the streets over the weekend, according to videos. The government is investigating several incidents of alleged police violence and allegedly leaked police messages including “Time for the protesters to hear our jackboots on the ground.”

“Over in Ottawa on Friday they were singing ‘A Mighty Fortress is Our God,” Ristau told The Federalist. “We have masses of people praying in front of the police as they come in and use pepper spray and rubber bullets on them.”

Earlier, the Canadian government and crowdfunding site GoFundMe attempted to confiscate millions of dollars in donations to the convoy. The identities of donors to the fund were publicly released, after which some donors have been fired from their jobs. Private citizens who contributed have had bricks thrown through their shop windows, they told the Sun.

“When you make protesting illegality illegal, what does that mean for democracy? That’s why protesters won’t go home and are staying to be arrested. When it’s illegal to protest illegality, what measures do we have left?” Ristau asked.

“Once you’ve named someone a terrorist, I guess you can just do what you want,” Ristau said.

Due to the videos of him praying at the protest, Ristau told The Federalist, he received a death threat confirmed by local police, besides other forms of severe social rebuke. The father of five children ages 19 and younger says being treated as a domestic terrorist for peacefully petitioning his government to stop violating both Canadian laws and his Christian beliefs says he’s been more frightened by Trudeau suspending civil liberties over a peaceful protest than almost anything else in his 50 years of life.

“I’m not a chicken. I’ve been on the frontline overseas—Iraq, Afghanistan several times. I’ve been shot at, I’ve been blown off my feet. I’ve been at mass graves, I’ve been at mass casualties. I can’t count the number of bodies I’ve moved,” he told The Federalist. “I still have combat boots that I use for gardening. They’re a reminder to me of the good men, Americans and Canadians, who died for freedom. And it’s always a reminder of the importance of freedom. It’s not just about my rights but it’s also about being able to spread the gospel and to be human, to be the person God has made me to be.”

Ristau said in the last two years in Canada, the government has used people’s fear of Covid to suspend basic human rights, as well as sneak through radical changes to social policy. Those have included proposals to legally make abortion a human right — making pro-lifers de facto opponents of “human rights” — and let children medically mutilate their bodies without parental consent. Many Canadian hospitals and doctors now deny medical care to people who aren’t vaccinated.

“There hasn’t been a climate of ‘we can agree to disagree.’ Hence, people are being fired and losing their incomes and their livelihoods because they’re not vaccinated,” he said. The Freedom Convoy participants, most of whom were vaccinated, said this was too far.

Ristau also noted that government discrimination has not only been based on people’s medical decisions, but also has encompassed clear discrimination against religion. Canadian Covid regulations have banned people from singing in church, attending church for large stretches of time or unless they accept government-demanded medical procedures, handling the body and blood of Christ as their churches require, and from attending church without registering their names with the government. All of these are clear violations of the Bible or classic Christian teachings.

So Ristau considers objecting to Covid impositions not only his civic duty, but also “as standing for the sake of Christ. As a Christian, I am interested in ensuring that our freedom of speech is ensured, that the preaching of the gospel is not muzzled.”

Canada’s Parliament is considering a bill, C10, that would censor public statements of basic Christian teachings, such as about sex and marriage. It would also censor public criticism of the government, such as possibly social media postings about the Freedom Convoy and any dissent from Covid regulations.

Ristau noted both that a good number of Canadians — half in some polls — support the Freedom Convoy, but that he and his family have been repeatedly ostracized for their objections to the last two years of increasing tyranny under an unending state of emergency. But he can’t be silent, he said, even at the risk of losing his job or being prosecuted for attending a peaceful protest: “My parents escaped from Germany under the Nazis and Communists. I’ve seen real terrorism. Our freedoms are at stake here.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/21/decorated-canadian-veteran-and-pastor-trudeau-has-declared-war-on-his-own-people/,2022-02-21
Exclusive: ‘American Freedom Convoy’ Set To Launch On March 1,"Following weeks of speculation of a potential U.S. trucker convoy, grassroots activists known as the “American Freedom Convoy” are set to launch such a feat next month to protest tyrannical COVID mandates.

Comprised of everyday Americans from across the country, the nationwide protest is set to kick off on the west coast on March 1 and aims to arrive in Washington, D.C. by March 7. According to co-organizer and head of the movement’s Indiana-Ohio region Nicole Robinson, the convoy will accumulate truckers and supporters living in Midwestern, Southern, and Eastern states as it makes its way towards the U.S. capital.

“We have groups that are coming from the west coast. I believe we have Washington, Oregon and then Colorado,” she told The Federalist. “We got people joining in from small towns and stuff. By the time they reach Indiana, it’ll be March 5; they’ll stay overnight here in Indiana and our last leg of the trip will be made on the sixth and we will stop just outside of DC, and we will land in DC on the morning of the seventh.”

The group is separate from the “People’s Convoy,” which has received national media attention and changed its launch date multiple times.

A single mom and travel-certified nursing assistant, Robinson says that after watching the Canadian convoy and witnessing “everything that [her] kids went through with the mandates with school and the school closing down,” she “felt a pull” to take action.

“I decided to do a state Facebook page and I invited a few close friends and family and said, ‘if you know anybody who would be interested, send them the link. It’s a private page, you have to be invited or answer questions to join,'” she said. “It blew up. By the end of the day, I had like 400 people and I’m like, ‘Whoa, what is going on here?'”

The growth and success of Robinson’s page eventually led to Facebook convoy group administrators from other states reaching out to her, which paved the way for forming a team to establish travel routes for a formal nationwide protest.

Chris Merill, a big-rig owner-operator and the coordinator for Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Wyoming, and Iowa, notes that while organizing and participating in such a movement could certainly bear significant personal and financial costs, he believes his children’s future is worth fighting for.

“All that’s been shoved in our faces the last two years is fear,” said Merill. “And I don’t want them to be growing up in a world like that where they’ve got to be afraid to do anything and to be afraid of other people. Anybody is scared to do anything anymore and I don’t like that. That is not the United States that I was proud of. The United States now, it worries me, it scares me.”

“People should not be afraid to stand up for their beliefs, and right now they are. We want everybody to unite and be able to stand up together,” he added.

Derek DePauw, a trucker and coordinator for the Northwestern region of the country, echoed similar sentiments, while also adding that he’s fighting for the “millions out there that aren’t willing, or able, to put themselves in the uncomfortable situations that freedom requires.”

“They are just looking for someone to take that first step up to give them the courage to stand up themselves. At the end of the day, I want to see all of America come together,” said DePauw. “As unrealistic as it sounds, and it likely is, I hope that those that don’t see the reality of it, finally see that it is their freedom as well, that we are doing all this for. We need to make sure that no government, at any point, in futures to come, can ever do this sort of thing ever again. The American people need to have their rights restored, protected, and preserved.”

While organizing the protest, both Robinson and Merill have noted instances of interference from Facebook, with Merill claiming that he’s been shadowbanned on the platform “at least a dozen times in the last week.”

“There was a period of about 72 hours where I couldn’t post anything. I couldn’t edit any of my posts that were already up, and I was never given a reason for it,” he said. “There was a period of time where I had to use other means to communicate with people that I’ve been helping.”

This isn’t the first time Facebook has attempted to suppress attempts to orchestrate a U.S. trucker convoy, however. Earlier this month, the Big Tech platform removed the “Convoy to D.C. 2022” group for purportedly “violating [their] policies around QAnon.” The group had reportedly garnered over 130,000 members prior to its removal.

The launch of the American Freedom Convoy comes on the heels of the Canadian government utilizing police violence against Canadian truckers and protestors in the country’s capital of Ottawa. Following the declaration of Canada’s Emergencies Act, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has ramped up his war on basic freedoms by deploying armed police in riot gear to squash the peaceful demonstrations, while also threatening to freeze the bank accounts of those involved. As of Sunday, nearly 200 individuals have been arrested, including four leaders of the protest.

While Robinson and Merill expressed concerns that such brutal tactics could be employed by the Biden administration against their members, they, along with DePauw, strongly emphasized that they are a peaceful movement with no violent intentions.

“This 100 percent peaceful protest will be just that: 100 percent peaceful,” said DePauw. “Please keep your eyes open, as there will be, beyond all reasonable doubts, bad actors that will get put into the spotlight by the media. We all know this, and 100 percent expect it. There will be false flag events going on. There is no question. But I can assure everyone, it will not be from us. We have absolute zero intention of causing any form of violence to arise.”

“We are not out for any type of vengeance, violence, any of that stuff. The one thing that we have preached is the one thing that everybody has preached, and that’s follow all the laws,” said Robinson, who added that the group has no intentions of blocking interstates and has reached out to several state police departments to notify them of the convoy’s dates and travel routes.

Information about the convoy can be found on their website.

The Plague You Should Be Freaking Out About Is Abuse Of Power,"For anyone still naïve, stubborn, or fanatical enough to believe the Covid tyranny we’ve been suffocating under for the past two years is about a virus, let the events unfolding in Canada disabuse you of that illusion.

Invoking the Emergencies Act to freeze bank accounts, conduct mass arrests of peaceful demonstrators and protest organizers, target reporters and photographers, and establish “red zones” and checkpoints, all in response to a mobilized citizenry that is weary of ineffective, illiberal, and discriminatory Covid restrictions — this all smacks of dictatorship, not democracy. It certainly has nothing to do with public health.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau walked back his use of the Emergencies Act this week, but the Canadian government continues to keep protesters in jail and push banks to freeze nearly C$8 million in the personal and business accounts of people who peacefully contributed to the protest before it was criminalized. Banks also have threatened to suspend loans of those on government blacklists of Canadian citizens who peacefully participated.

Meanwhile, jurisdictions around the world are hastily rolling back Covid edicts, lamely pointing to the usual fake science. Behind the scenes, governments understand what their counterparts in places like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and France seem determined to ignore: the people are no longer buying their narrative. Instead of bingeing on Covid fear porn, the real plague we should have been freaking out about is totalitarianism, the 20th century’s deadliest scourge.

Totalitarian Impulses Rear Their Ugly Heads

The Canadian government declared war on a grassroots, non-violent protest against compulsory vaccinations and other Covid restrictions. Enabled and emboldened by a complicit press, the regime demonizes those who demand the protection of fundamental individual rights over submission to collectivist oppression. Trudeau ludicrously and disingenuously labeled protestors “racists” and “misogynists.”

Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland threatened that recalcitrant truckers would have their bank accounts frozen and their vehicle insurance suspended. She also announced the broadening of terrorist financing rules to encompass crowdfunding platforms, and warned that Big Brother would be coming for their cash.

Ottawa police are threatening protestors with criminal charges and financial retribution. Last week, an elderly, mobility-impaired woman was shockingly trampled by Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Police have even been targeting citizens in their own homes over social media posts.

A Global Pandemic of Lies

Around the world, other aspiring dictators and their henchmen are using one hand to smother their subjects with public health love and the other to trample, beat, detain, and arrest those who disobey. Western governments are reverting to the abhorrent trends of technologically enabled totalitarian ideologies that shaped the European continent for the better part of a century.

Australia was at the cutting edge of crushing dissenters long before Ottawa. As early as September 2020, Victoria Police barged into the home of a pregnant woman and arrested her in front of her husband and two children for a Facebook post encouraging people to attend an anti-lockdown protest.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern laughed off the estimated 1,500 protestors gathered outside Parliament demanding an end to her repressive health dictatorship, as spreaders of “misinformation” and “disinformation.” Like Trudeau, Ardern is dishonest and deranged enough to keep rabbiting on that her number one priority—roughly 700 days and 56 deaths into slowing the spread—is steering New Zealand through the pandemic.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who infamously said he wanted to use the vaccine pass to “piss off” the unvaccinated by making life as hard as possible for them, is doing just that. French authorities responded to their country’s own Freedom Convoy by banning the demonstration, threatening heavy fines, license suspension, and jail time for unauthorized protestors. They deployed 7,200 police officers and armored vehicles, who resorted to firing teargas at bystanders including families with children, all for the people’s health and safety.

When We Stop Respecting Individual Freedoms

The West didn’t win the day over communism in Eastern Europe in 1989 because of democracy’s deep roots in European soil. There were none. On the contrary, Europe’s interwar experiment with parliamentary democracy following the World War I collapse of the great autocratic empires was a blip on the radar.

By the mid-1930s, a crisis of capitalism and loss of trust in liberal institutions left many Europeans feeling that democracy had done its dash and individual freedoms were overrated, thus paving the way for both the tyranny of fascism and the “specter of Communism.” There’s a similar feeling enabling Covidianism today. Under the last century’s violent New Orders that followed this public acceptance, which led to the deaths of tens of millions of people in Europe alone, rapid technological advances enabled a self-perpetuating elite to use terror and ideology to dominate the mobilized masses in an unprecedented manner.

Significantly, the authoritarian regimes that supplanted democracy craftily used and abused democratic freedoms and institutions in order to abolish democracy itself. The National Socialists, under Adolf Hitler, rose to power using legitimate elections and the parliamentary process, then exploited an unstable and neutered legislature, a strengthened executive, and a disturbing pattern of emergency orders to trash the whole system. Across Eastern Europe after World War II, the Communist Party relied on coalition governments to get its boot in the door, then systematically began kicking out the other parties.

There’s no such thing as “it can’t happen here.” We must always be vigilant given these terrifying lessons from history.

People Are Waking Up—Is It Too Late?

Seventy-five years down the track, Gen Xers, millennials, and even boomers, who grew up taking for granted that democracy is the norm rather than the status quo, are now learning in real time that liberty must be shaped, won, and preserved. This reckoning is throwing a spanner in the works of the Covid-powered totalitarian machine.

Contrary to Trudeau’s propaganda about “a small fringe minority with unacceptable views,” protestors have turned out en masse in Toronto and Calgary to express solidarity with those demonstrating in Ottawa. Two-thirds of Canadians say it’s time to end Covid restrictions and learn to live with the virus.

In the United States, only one-third of Americans list Covid as a top-five issue for 2022, and 59 percent of voters support the truckers. European leaders and democratic governors and mayors across the United States, who glimpse electoral annihilation on the horizon, are spending Biden’s “winter of severe illness and death” quietly archiving their blueprints.

The Emergency That Wasn’t

It would seem that the gig is up. Twentieth-century philosopher and writer Hannah Arendt wrote that totalitarian regimes cannot survive without a fanatical mass cult, unshaken by reason, argument, or experience, that identifies with and conforms to the movement, even at their own expense.

It may be dawning on petty tyrants like Trudeau that there just aren’t enough Covid cultists to sustain the beast. This would explain his astonishing about-face when he announced the revocation of the Emergencies Act. After sniveling literally two days before, he had no choice but to invoke these powers, employing the abusive spouse’s textbook trick of “I didn’t want to hit you but you made me do it.” The “national emergency” has apparently now evaporated.

On Monday, it was all about “misinformation,” “disinformation,” foreign funds, “ideologically motivated violent extremism,” and urging the Canadian Parliament, Weimar Republic-style, to take an ax to democracy in order to safeguard democracy. Within 48 hours, it was back to the “we’re all in this together” sweet talk about “healing,” working together, and “fighting a virus, not each other.”

Only it’s not about fighting a virus, and it never was. Covid-19 is a smokescreen for the most lethal plague of all. That’s the ever-present evil by which men seek to dominate the masses, smash and rebuild their minds, and bend them to some relentless dogma or ideology. Victims of this devilry invariably respond by collaborating, conforming, submitting—or resisting.

Texas School Defends Having 6th-Graders 'Protest' During 'Queer Week',"Image Credit Pexels

Miller Middle School in San Marcos, Texas is hosting a “Queer Week” where students as young as sixth grade are urged to dress in “pride” colors, wear nametags with preferred names and pronouns, and “protest” LGBT discrimination.

“The goal of the week is to provide a school culture that values diversity, equity and inclusion,” MMS Principal Saumnya Hart told parents in an email forwarded to The Federalist by the school.

According to a “Miller Queer Week” schedule obtained by The Federalist, MMS set aside four school days in April “to provide support for students in the LGTBQIA+ community, their allies, and the greater student and staff body.”

Beginning on Tuesday, April 19, students were encouraged to “share their stories on the wall in the hallway in order to stand against mistreatment.” On Wednesday, students were told to “dress in colors of the rainbow to support the LGTBQ+ community.”

Nametags designated for “pronouns and preferred names” will be supplied for all students on Thursday, according to the “Queer Week” calendar. On Friday, the week is scheduled to close out with a “National Day of Silence” where “LGTBQ+ students and their allies protest the harmful effects of harassment and discrimination of LGTBQ people in schools.”

Hart told parents that she approved the event after approximately 15 students “who identify in the LGTBQIA+ community” asked the administration for “protection and a safe place to learn without being belittled.” She justified the school-sanctioned event by claiming that the activities “are completely voluntary and will not be included as part of any lesson or instruction being provided.”

San Marcos Consolidated Independent School District Chief of Communications Andrew Fernandez told The Federalist that the school has received complaints from concerned parents but believes the activities are appropriate because they are “not part of the instructional day.”

“We have calls every day about questions or concerns that families may have and we’re handling the situation as we do any other situation,” Fernandez said. “We speak with the parent. Hear their thoughts and concerns and then share the reasoning behind the activities taking place this week.”

Texas officials have made it very clear that school-sanctioned activities dealing with sexuality violate the state’s sex education opt-out requirements for parents.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton recently scolded Austin Independent School District for hosting its annual Pride Week which featured activities such as “watching Queer Eye” and “nail painting.”

More from @AustinISD’s pride week this week. Homeschool your kids. pic.twitter.com/8Juz5b0a8Z — Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) March 23, 2022

“The Texas Legislature has made it clear that when it comes to sex education, parents — not school districts — are in charge,” Paxton wrote. “By hosting ‘Pride Week,’ your district has, at best, undertaken a week-long instructional effort in human sexuality without parental consent. Or, worse, your district is cynically pushing a week-long indoctrination of your students that not only fails to obtain parental consent, but subtly cuts parents out of the loop. Either way, you are breaking state law.”

It appears based on the email and the substance of the activities at Miller Middle School that this school is likewise in violation of Texas state law.

Left-Wing Group Offers Abortion Radicals Stipends As It Plans Protests At Justices' Homes,"A left-wing group is gathering abortion activists to march at Supreme Court justices’ homes next week, with stipends available for some protesters who participate in the Roe v. Wade crusade.

Beginning on Sunday, the group organized under the moniker “Ruth Sent Us” will embark on a week-long demonstration, with plans to protest outside the homes of the six conservative Supreme Court justices, whose alleged addresses have been published on the group’s website.

“Our 6-3 extremist Supreme Court routinely issues rulings that hurt women, racial minorities, LGBTQ+ and immigrant rights. We must rise up to force accountability using a diversity of tactics,” reads the group’s website, advertising monetary compensation for recruits. “Are you a muralist or chalk artist? Are you a graphic designer who would like to contribute remotely? Large-scale art will be included in the protests against the Supreme Court. Stipends available.”

The protests come on the heels of a leaked February draft ruling in which five out of six conservative judges concurred, with the majority draft opinion authored by Justice Samuel Alito to overturn Roe v. Wade. Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Neil Gorsuch each reportedly joined the opinion, with Chief Justice John Roberts remaining undecided.

The leaked opinion only offers a snapshot in time of the justices’ thinking, however, with members of the bench still able to change their minds before the final ruling is published this summer. Roberts’ home remains a target for protesters who aim to intimidate justices into safeguarding the nearly 50-year-old precedent ensuring abortion access.

The leaked opinion, apparently intended to foment public unrest in support of the 1973 landmark case, has already successfully galvanized abortion advocates who staged protests at the Supreme Court this week and in New York City. In Los Angeles, demonstrations quickly turned into violence reminiscent of 2020 when protesters clashed with police. Law enforcement erected non-scalable fencing around the Supreme Court building ahead of more protests.

Demonstrators with “Ruth Sent Us” appear to be coordinating with several allied activist groups including Code Pink, Kavanaugh Off Our Court, and Black Lives Matter. While the website advertises “peaceful protests,” the recent memories of Black Lives Matter riots terrorizing the country remain fresh in the minds of the public as communities are still rebuilding. This week’s violence in Los Angeles offers little comfort.

Harassment of conservative policymakers at their private homes has become an increasingly popular tactic among left-wing activists, who demonstrated at Kavanaugh’s home in September over anxieties related to Roe v. Wade. Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley and Fox News prime-time anchor Tucker Carlson have each also suffered from protesters staking out their D.C.-area residences.

"The Kavanaugh Circus Continues, More Dangerous Than Ever","When Justice Samuel Alito’s draft majority opinion for the Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was leaked to the news media, it came as a shock. How could such a thing happen? Are the norms that keep our government together unraveling? For those who have followed the Supreme Court over the last several years, there is unfortunately more continuity to outrageous behavior than is often recognized.

Immediately after the leak, we learned that the sort of left-wing dark money groups that brought the Supreme Court confirmation process to new lows with their antics with Justice Kavanaugh’s hearings are at it again. An outfit calling itself “Ruth Sent Us” has posted a map with the home addresses of what it calls “the six extremist justices” and organized protests next week at their personal homes. The radical left is now doxxing Supreme Court justices.

The Left’s Radical Tactics

Do you remember the circus of obstruction and vilification that the left inflicted on the nation in opposition to Brett Kavanaugh’s 2018 nomination? We documented it in our book, “Justice on Trial.” Protesters funded by dark-money groups, including Planned Parenthood, shouting down the Senate Judiciary Committee and having to be dragged out by police, with over 200 arrests? Protesters dressed like handmaids converging on Capitol Hill to communicate that Kavanaugh’s confirmation would hurl America into a dark dystopia?

And how about the Democratic senators who went along, waging scurrilous arguments to try to delegitimize the nominee from the outset and interrupting their own hearings on the Senate Judiciary Committee 63 times before the first lunch break? Through a week of hearings, they tried one stunt after another, sometimes operating in jaw-dropping lockstep with the protestors. The Senate’s final vote on the nomination was taken amid repeated interruptions from yet another brigade of protesters — who had to be taken out of the Senate gallery by U.S. Capitol Police. Other protesters crossed police lines at the Capitol Building or stormed up the steps of the Supreme Court to pound on its doors. 164 arrests resulted.

Once Kavanaugh officially joined the Court, he did not make the traditional walk down the marble steps of the Court out of concern for his safety.

The left failed to defeat Kavanaugh in 2018, but they did not shed their radicalism — they only got more strident. Less than a year went by before Democratic senators threatened the Court in an amicus brief with restructuring if it did not rule the way they preferred. In 2020, then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer threatened Justices Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch by name in front of the Supreme Court after oral arguments in an abortion case, warning that they would “pay the price” for a disagreeable decision.

Now that the Court appears poised to finally overturn Roe v. Wade and correct one of the greatest acts of judicial arrogance in American history, the radical Left appears intent on following through with Senator Schumer’s threat.

When asked whether President Biden supports the doxxing of Supreme Court justices, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki refused to criticize the tactic, glibly remarking that “I think the president’s view is that there is a lot of passion.” What an appalling abdication of responsibility.

Who Funds ‘Ruth Sent Us’?

There are a number of unanswered questions about the Ruth Sent Us group. Its website notes, “Stipends [are] available” for protestors. Who exactly is paying for these stipends? Recall that during the Kavanaugh hearings, left-wing groups also provided financial incentives for protestors, including offering lodging to traveling protesters and “jail and bail support” if necessary.

The website links to a different organization, Strike for Choice, which shows connections to groups including Black Lives Matter, Code Pink, Women’s March SF, Kavanaugh Off Our Court, and Rise Up 4 Abortion Rights. How exactly are these groups connected?

Similar to Biden’s White House, the Ruth Sent Us website purports to advocate for “peaceful protests.” Is that like the “mostly peaceful” protests burning down cities across the country two years ago at the BLM-organized demonstrations? Already this week pro-abortion protestors and police clashed in Los Angeles when a group of protestors “began to throw rocks and bottles” in a demonstration in front of the federal courthouse. At least one officer was injured.

Will groups like Demand Justice condemn these protests at justices’ homes? So far, they have been silent. What about Demand Justice board member Elie Mystal, who called the Constitution “kind of trash?” Demand Justice’s executive director Brian Fallon has instead criticized the increased security measures being taken at the Supreme Court itself, stating that the Court “needs more accountability, not less.” Sounds a lot like Psaki yesterday.

Psaki’s stunning comments yesterday should come as no surprise given that she herself worked for Demand Justice before joining the White House — this is after all the White House that left-wing dark money built. Demand Justice was launched by the Arabella Advisors network, which spent over one billion dollars in the 2020 election cycle to help elect Joe Biden president and win a Democratic Senate.

Since its launch, Demand Justice has led the charge to pack the Court and bullied Justice Stephen Breyer off the bench so that a younger activist could take his place. We don’t know if Ruth Sent Us is also funded by groups in the expansive Arabella network because they have yet to disclose their donors but it certainly resembles the kind of pop-up groups that Arabella is known for.

The parallels between this planned protest and the disgusting antics we saw from left-wing dark-money groups during the Kavanaugh confirmation are striking. Even the handmaids are going to be making a return. In these days before whatever they have planned for the justices’ homes, they are already disrupting Catholic churches.

It is as if there is no institution left in American society that leftists are not willing to destroy if they think that is what they need to do to achieve their policy goals.

Get ready for the next iteration of the Kavanaugh circus. Indeed, protecting Roe is what that circus was about in the first place. Now, with Roe itself facing its imminent demise, the left has made itself more dangerous than ever before.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/06/the-kavanaugh-circus-continues-more-dangerous-than-ever/,2022-05-06
Hillary-Endorsed Abortion Group Targeting Churches Is A Front For Revolutionary Communists￼,"Following the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case, left-wing organizers have swept into action, launching rallies and events designed to put pressure on the justices. Over the Mother’s Day Weekend protestors forced Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito to an undisclosed location and carried out disruptive demonstrations outside — and in some cases inside — a number of churches including New York’s St. Patrick Cathedral, where a picture of pro-life Catholics blocking the entrance to the church from screaming protestors went viral.

The leaked draft memo that states the Supreme Court has struck down #RoeVWade is an ATROCITY but It is not yet law & doesn’t have to be, but what they plan to do & will do if WE don't stop them

In a number of pictures and videos from the Mother’s Day protests, abortion protestors were seen wearing green bandanas, shirts, and holding green banners, part of a #Green4Abortion campaign. The color choice was even endorsed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who tweeted out an announcement for a protest in New York’s Foley Square with the instructions “wear green.”

The organization responsible for the hashtag encouraging supporters to wear green is Rise Up 4 Abortion Rights which launched “a ‘week of action’ beginning on May 8, Mother’s Day, including an emphasis on “Actions Outside of Churches.”

Rise Up 4 Abortion’s Twitter page shows them playing a major role in protests in New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles, and Chicago over the weekend, with additional protests planned May 14 in New York City, Chicago, Austin, Honolulu, Seattle, San Francisco, and Boston.

While the left’s ability to rapidly throw together color-coordinated protest groups is well known, in this case, there is more to Rise Up 4 Abortion than meets the eye. An examination of the group’s website suggests the group is little more than a front for the radical Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP), a Maoist organization founded by ‘60s radical Bob Avakian, a former leader of the Anti-war Students for a Democratic Society.

For starters, the group references leading RCP member and Avakian devotee Sunsara Taylor and directs donors via Paypal to World Can’t Wait Inc., another organization co-founded by Taylor. World Can’t Wait also shares a mailing address with Refuse Fascism, another Taylor-led RCP front group that organized Antifa-style protests aimed at the Trump Administration. The Rise Up 4 Abortion page even includes a link to “Revolution Nothing Less!,” an RCP Youtube show, “based on Bob Avakian’s new Communism.”

The RCP has historically played a front and center role in orchestrating violent riots, including the 1992 Los Angeles Rodney King Riots and the 2014 Ferguson riots, where the Daily Beast called them “the communist agitators trying to ignite Ferguson.”

The Revolutionary Communist Party is no mere liberal wine moms, despite urging people to vote for Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Instead, the party’s constitution says they openly seek, “a revolution that overthrows this system and the capitalist-imperialist class that embodies and runs it—a revolution that will immediately establish a new power.”

Avakian has called “the overthrow of U.S. imperialism and the establishment of the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat” the “greatest contribution to the world revolution that can be made…”

Despite their Communist orientation the group clearly has no problem seeking funding and support from Democrat billionaires like George Soros and Tom Steyer, according to a June 2020 undercover video by Project Veritas showing Refuse Fascism organizers discussing fundraising efforts. Other support for RCP’s Refuse Fascism project came from the Alliance for Global Justice, a 501(c) with historic links to the communist Sandinistas.

Ironically, not everyone in the pro-Abortion coalition is excited about marching alongside overt Maoists. D.C. Anti-Fascist Action, a Washington D.C. based Antifa group, posted a series of tweets condemning the RCP as a “cult”:

Today @/riseup4abortion aka rebranded @/RefuseFascism aka off-shoot of Bob Avakian's cult @/therevcoms held a pro-choice rally at SCOTUS and will probably be at more. Read the thread linked below that gives a great overview of why you should avoid them ⬇️ — DC Antifascist Action (@DC_AFA) May 6, 2022

The Antifa account went on to link a Twitter thread calling for RCP signs and banners to be taken down.

Tension between anarchist groups and more hierarchical communist groups is not uncommon among the radical left, but it does raise important questions. If even Antifa knows that the presence of the RCP at protests is bad news, why can’t Hillary Clinton and other Democrats come to the same conclusion?

"Why Won't Biden Condemn Attacks On Churches, Justices' Homes?","Shortly after Politico published the U.S. Supreme Court’s leaked Dobbs v. Jackson opinion draft last Monday, leftists took to the streets to express their outrage that SCOTUS plans to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Since the first night when pro-abortion supporters picketed in front of the barricades protecting the Supreme Court, radical pro-abortion groups, some with communist undertones, sicced their supporters on conservative justices with hopes of intimidating them into changing their minds. They shared the justices’ alleged home addresses and even bribed people to participate with stipends.

Other groups focused on targeting pro-life religious institutions. Catholic churches and pregnancy centers were vandalized with pro-abortion graffiti.

While he was quick to threaten to reject the court’s “continued attack on abortion and reproductive rights,” the “deeply Catholic” President Joe Biden has yet to personally and publicly denounce the political violence perpetrated by his supporters.

In addition to refusing to condemn the SCOTUS leak or investigate it as a crime, the Biden administration did not even acknowledge the attacks until Fox News’s Peter Doocy demanded comment from White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki last week.

“Do you think that progressive activists that are now planning protests outside some of the justices’ houses are extreme?” he asked during a White House press briefing.

“Peaceful protest? No, peaceful protest is not extreme,” Psaki replied.

The pair volleyed back and forth about the dangers associated with organized intimidation of SCOTUS justices before Psaki admitted that “The president’s view is that there’s a lot of passion, a lot of fear, a lot of sadness from many, many people across this country about what they saw in that leaked document.”

“We obviously want people’s privacy to be respected. We want people to protest peacefully if they want to protest. That is certainly what the president’s view would be,” she said. “But I think we shouldn’t lose the point here. The reason people are protesting is because women across the country are worried about their fundamental rights that had been law for 50 years — their rights to make choices about their own bodies and their own health care — are at risk. That’s why people are protesting. They’re unhappy. They’re scared.”

Days after the violence and destruction, however, Psaki reversed course and issued a statement condemning “violence, threats, or vandalism” on Twitter.

“.@POTUS strongly believes in the Constitutional right to protest. But that should never include violence, threats, or vandalism. Judges perform an incredibly important function in our society, and they must be able to do their jobs without concern for their personal safety,” she wrote.

Despite increasing calls for the president to denounce the violence, Biden has yet to personally call for peace.

Democrats tried to impeach former President Donald Trump for “inciting a riot” on Jan. 6, 2021. They accused him of egging on his supporters even though he called for peace in a video that was quickly censored by Big Tech.

When it comes to Biden and the leftists-endorsed violence over the Dobbs decision, however, many of those same Democrats refuse to hold the president accountable and have joined in the battle cries for destruction themselves.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki voiced support for the pro-abortion mobs gathering outside U.S. Supreme Court justices’ homes as the justices are being protected with increased security amid threats against their lives and family members.

“I know that there is an outrage right now about protests that have been peaceful to date,” Psaki said in a May 10 press briefing. “We certainly continue to encourage that outside of judge’s homes.”

This is a violation of federal law. The President is literally encouraging an insurrection. And nobody cares! https://t.co/kunNTWzDhO — Jon Schweppe (@JonSchweppe) May 10, 2022

Since the Supreme Court’s leaked draft opinion that would return abortion policy to elected representatives through overturning Roe v. Wade, pro-abortionists have vocally and violently expressed their fury in an attempt to influence the court’s decision. Recently, their actions expanded to congregating outside justices’ homes with signs and chanting phrases such as “Our bodies, hands-off.”

Psaki condemned the right wing as hypocrites for criticizing these protests while remaining silent about other public demonstrations, such as those outside homes of school board members or the Michigan secretary of state. However, according to the Federal U.S. Code 1507, it is illegal for anyone to picket or parade outside homes where judges reside “with the intent of interfering with, obstructing, or impeding the administration of justice, or with the intent of influencing any judge.” The Biden Department of Justice has so far refrained from enforcing this law while angry mobs surround the homes of constitutionalist Supreme Court justices.

A poll conducted by the Convention of States Action, in partnership with The Trafalgar Group, found that a majority of Americans do not support the protests.

In their survey, they asked 1,000 likely voters for 2022 nationwide the question, “Do you believe that publishing the home addresses of the five U.S. Supreme Court Justices and calling for protests at their private homes is an acceptable way to protest the High Court’s upcoming decision on Roe v. Wade?”

Three-quarters of American voters answered “no.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/12/white-house-press-secretary-encourages-angry-mobs-surrounding-supreme-court-justices-homes/,2022-05-12
Enforcing Picketing Laws Might've Prevented Attempt On Kavanaugh's Life,"Everyone is more or less familiar with the concept of broken windows policing. Theories vary on whether prosecuting minor crimes directly deters more serious crime (because criminals fear the severity of prosecution) or whether it is the fear and withdrawal of citizens from disordered communities that allows more serious crime to come in.

Either way, the theory can be summarized as follows: When law enforcement vigorously prosecutes minor crimes such as littering, loitering, and vandalism, the effect is less serious crime in the community. If you allow one broken window in a building, soon the other windows will be broken, and more severe crime will follow.

Now apply that principle to the current situation regarding the leaked draft of the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health. Once the draft opinion leaked and appeared to signal that Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey would soon be overruled, the protests began. These protests included threats to storm and burn down the Supreme Court building, as well as protests outside the personal residences of Supreme Court justices who are likely to vote to overturn Roe.

The Constitution protects the right to free speech and free assembly, but there are legal limits that clearly apply here. Federal law is quite clear about pickets or parades that seek to interfere with the administration of justice or influence a judge in the administration of his duty. Such action is criminal, punishable by up to one year in prison. If the pickets were a peaceful assembly of people who support abortion in a public place, such as the Supreme Court building, this would be political activity protected by the First Amendment.

But the protesters are bringing their demonstrations to the front yards of Supreme Court justices’ private residences. They come in large numbers; they shout through bullhorns; they utter profanities. Since this is in response to a leaked draft of an opinion that the Supreme Court justices have not yet voted on, there is no conceivable intent of such behavior other than to influence the decision. This is a federal crime.

Federal crimes should be prosecuted by federal authorities. Attorney General Merrick Garland was silent about these protests at the justices’ homes when they began. Only recently has he condemned the threats of violence and vowed the Department of Justice would “do everything we can to prevent” violence against the Supreme Court justices. Doing everything they can apparently doesn’t include enforcing the directly applicable federal criminal law, since the DOJ has announced no investigations or arrests related to these intimidating protests.

Fast forward one month, and a radical shows up at Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s house with the admitted purpose of assassinating him. Like the protesters, the alleged attempted murderer stated his primary motive was anger about the impending reversal of Roe v. Wade as well as his opinion that Justice Kavanaugh would vote to loosen gun restrictions.

This is what happens when we refuse to enforce the law. Obviously, nobody can look back and say that if the protesters outside the justices’ homes were vigorously prosecuted, this man definitely would not have attempted to assassinate Justice Kavanaugh. But the broken windows theory is telling: Failing to enforce the law on “smaller” issues creates an atmosphere that fosters more serious crime.

If the Department of Justice announced it would relentlessly prosecute any protesters who intended to use intimidation tactics to affect the outcome of the Dobbs case, it would create an atmosphere of law and order — an atmosphere that might dissuade someone from traveling across the country to assassinate a sitting Supreme Court justice. By completely failing to enforce the law, law enforcement allowed a societal window to be broken.

As Rod Dreher recently wrote, we now live in a society full of broken windows, of “small but telling outward sign[s] of inner disorder.” The escalation of protests that led to the attempted murder of Justice Kavanaugh is one poignant example.

Each time we allow protests to turn into violent riots, each time we allow the law to be broken because those in power agree with the politics of the lawbreakers, we allow another window to be broken in our society. We send a message that disorder is acceptable. We must draw clearer lines and restore order in our society. If we don’t clean up the graffiti and broken windows of lawlessness, we should expect the disorder to escalate.

Dutch Government Begins Canadian-Style Crackdown On Farmer Protests,"For the past several weeks, Dutch farmers in the Netherlands have been engaged in a nationwide protest against their government’s new arbitrary climate policies, which demonstrators say will impede their ability to sustain a living.

On Monday, dozens of farmers in trucks and tractors parked outside major supermarket distribution centers in cities throughout the country. The blockade comes on the heels of a convoy protest of approximately 40,000 farmers in “the central Netherlands’ agricultural heartland” last week, which clogged up local roadways and led to standstill traffic.

As Reuters reported, the demonstrations came in response to “targets introduced last month” by the Dutch government “to reduce harmful nitrogen compounds by 2030,” which authorities say “are necessary in emissions of nitrogen oxides from farm animal manure and from the use of ammonia in fertilizer.”

If successfully implemented, the state initiative to “go green” would almost certainly cripple the country’s private agricultural industry, as the regulations are “expected to include reducing livestock and buying up some farms whose animals produce large amounts of ammonia.”

“The honest message … is that not all farmers can continue their business,” the government admitted in a statement last month.

The agricultural sector is not the only industry to voice its displeasure with the government’s actions, however. In solidarity with their fellow countrymen, Dutch fishermen have also joined the farmers’ protests and have begun using their ships to block ports throughout the country.

“In Harlingen, they blocked the port with trawlers meaning ferries to the islands of Terschelling and Vlieland could not leave for hours,” Euro News reported.

https://twitter.com/TheRealKeean/status/1542600414943539200?s=20&t=reMLQwgZQSaPpVbMXlBenQ

Farmer protests over excessive environmental regulations aren’t new for the Netherlands. Back in 2019, the country experienced similar tractor convoy protests over the state’s attempt to curb nitrogen emissions through overbearing regulations, with farmers accusing the government of targeting their industry.

Government Cracks Down

Despite their large numbers and commitment to freedom, Dutch farmers have begun to feel the wrath from their government. On Monday, police deployed tear gas and dogs to break up protests in cities such as Heerenveen, where farmers reportedly used tractors to block off a Lidl distribution center.

In addition to reports of police allegedly firing upon demonstrators, law enforcement officials have also issued more than 200 fines and made several arrests for “open violence” and blocking roadways.

https://twitter.com/risemelbourne/status/1544129586904338437?s=20&t=G1AKXkkaAFbWpbcUJvfLQg

The increasingly heavy-handed response from the Dutch government is beginning to resemble that of the Canadian federal government, which employed totalitarian tactics to crack down on citizens protesting state-mandated Covid-19 vaccinations earlier this year. In addition to falsely labeling demonstrators as racists, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau proceeded to utilize the country’s Emergencies Act to mobilize the Canadian military and intelligence agencies to remove protesters occupying Parliament Hill in the nation’s capital of Ottawa.

As if allowing local police to use tear gas on peaceful protesters weren’t bad enough, Trudeau also expanded his government’s terrorist financing rules to go after crowdfunding sites the convoy utilized, such as the new GiveSendGo, and actively supported efforts by GoFundMe to deplatform fundraising efforts for the protesters.

Elitism Knows No Borders

Whether it’s the Netherlands or Canada, the story is the same across the globe. Over the past several years, elitists occupying positions of power within governments have grown accustomed to imposing their will on ordinary citizens.

It doesn’t matter that they’re blatantly violating the social contract established by their own people. For the elitist, the only item on the agenda is maintaining power and dominion over the populace, whom they view as nothing more than subjects meant to obey their diktats without question.

Avoiding such power grabs, however, requires a vigilant citizenry, whose dedication to liberty must be stronger and more widespread than elitists’ devotion to tyranny. As witnessed during the Covid regime, compliance with the state gives birth to more draconian edicts, which only continue to erode the line between democracy and oligarchy.

Make no mistake, if the Dutch farmer protesters let their foot off the gas for one second, the state will not hesitate to shove their alarmist, degrowth policies down the people’s throats without remorse. Any form of surrender will likely continue to enable more overreaching policies, which will undoubtedly infringe upon the everyday lives of Dutch people.

Media Ignore Dutch Farmer Protests To Protect Climate Fearmongering,"The government of the Netherlands seems to be willing to starve Europe to browbeat Dutch farmers about climate change, and American corporate media outlets are largely ignoring it.

The Netherlands is demanding its farmers drastically reduce their herds of livestock in order to eliminate 50 percent of the nation’s nitrogen pollution by 2030. That leaves just eight years for farmers whose livelihoods revolve around cultivating land and raising animals to figure out how they can keep supplying the continent with food.

Under the new “green” restrictions, many generational farmers say that they risk bankruptcy or being forced out of the industry altogether. Even the government has admitted that “The honest message … is that not all farmers can continue their business.” That’s why, for more than a month now, large numbers of these Dutch farmers have protested government policies forcing them to wreak havoc on the nation’s agricultural industry.

A disruption like this, to a nation that is the “largest exporter of meat in Europe and the second largest exporter of food overall after the United States,” will also likely exacerbate food shortages caused by the Ukraine-Russia war throughout the European Union and other parts of the world.

Despite the effects of the Dutch farmer protests on not just the global food supply but global climate policies, the issue has received little to no attention from corporate U.S. press outlets.

Aside from a couple of general rundown articles from Reuters and ABC News, the American media has failed to report on the Dutch farmer’s concerns in any depth, much less address the implications the protests, and the climate policies that triggered them, have for the Netherlands and the rest of the world.

The media’s scant coverage of the protests certainly isn’t on front pages or during prime time. As a matter of fact, it is framed to claim that farmers in the Netherlands “oppose pollution cuts” that could “protect human health and vulnerable natural habitats from pollution in the form of nitrogen oxides and ammonia.” That’s quite a dishonest way to smear the industry that “is a [global] leader in efficient and sustainable agriculture.”

This time, instead of taking sides like they did when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau smeared Canadian truckers for their Covid mandate protests, the American media has taken a backseat. They don’t want to give attention to the issue and it’s no surprise why: It would hurt their ability to fearmonger about the climate.

Much like the Canadian trucker protests, tens of thousands of farmers in the Netherlands participated in tractor caravans that brought traffic in the center of the country to a standstill. And much like the Canadian government’s extreme crackdown on drivers who didn’t want to be forced into getting the Covid jab, the Dutch government is shunning farmers, who are largely conservative, for daring to question its leftist climate agenda. In some cases, Dutch police have even fired shots at the protesters, and the prime minister reportedly said in private company that he believes the farmers are “a-holes.”

The corporate media found the Canadian trucker protests worth covering because it gave them ammunition to further taint Americans who were against Covid jab mandates. They simply parroted Trudeau’s disdain for the Freedom Convoy’s “unacceptable views,” and channeled it into their ongoing campaign against anyone who dares question the Biden administration’s narrative on the virus.

As my colleague David Harsanyi has noted, for years now corporate media outlets have “enabled destructive climate change hysteria.” In some cases, the corrupt press has even dredged it up by promoting destructive climate policies such as the Green New Deal and highlighting sham polls claiming climate change is a top priority for voters. In other cases, the media have been the ones Big Tech censors turned to when their narratives about ineffective “green power” and other climate propaganda were threatened.

If corporate media show the world that so-called green policies will hurt their food supply and ravage the lives of tens of thousands of hardworking people like the Dutch farmers, they might not only lose even more credibility with Americans than they already have, but also inadvertently bolster the case that climate policies like the ones adopted by the Netherlands will be disastrous.

Here's Why Media Don't Want You To Know About Huge Global Protests,"If you skim the front pages of major corporate news outlets, you’ll find no mention of the economic protests raging in Spain, Morocco, Greece, and the United Kingdom.

On The Washington Post homepage these days, you’ll find headlines such as, “How To Deal With A Chatty Coworker Who Won’t Get Out Of Your Office,” but you won’t find mention of the more than 100,000 people protesting in Madrid. You’ll find the story of a gay union entitled, “What’s Two ‘Yentas’ Plus One Senator? A Lifetime Together” at The New York Times, but you won’t see a single heading on the more than 10,000 protesters in Athens. Corporate media has largely glossed over the tens of thousands of farmers in the Netherlands who clogged up roadways and distributions centers by holding Canadian-trucker-convoy-style demonstrations to protest radical climate policies.

According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which records protests worldwide, 11 countries are currently seeing protests of more than 1,000 people in response to the rising cost of living and other economic woes in 2022. As of July 5, Carnegie had recorded protests of more than 120,000 people in France, 100,000 in Spain, 10,000 in Greece, 10,000 in Kazakhstan, 10,000 in Sri Lanka, 10,000 in India, 5,000 in Iran, 5,000 in Peru, 1,000 people in Argentina, 1,000 in Morocco, and 1,000 in the U.K.

When vaccine passports were being implemented, protests took place around the world – but there was hardly any coverage from the media.



Due to the cost of living crisis, protests are happening around the world – but again, the media turns a blind eye.

Many of the French protesters took to the streets on May Day for salary increases and against President Emmanuel Macron’s increase of the retirement age. Fifty-four people were reportedly arrested in Paris after some demonstrations turned violent. France’s economy, Europe’s third-largest, shrank in the first quarter of 2022, and in June, inflation shot up 5.8 percent compared to last year. Protesters also held demonstrations in March, with some complaining they had lost 15 to 20 percent of their purchasing power. Meanwhile, France’s answer to inflation? Keep spending; the country is throwing $20.4 billion at the problem.

In Spain, with gas subsidies, direct grants, and an increase in the minimum wage, the socialist-leaning government has seen only rising inflation rates (10.2 percent), and the accompanying price hikes are driving thousands of people onto the streets to protest. The country is finding out the hard way what a 40 percent reliance on renewable energy will do to the labor market. With its high unemployment rate at 13.65 percent as of the first quarter of 2022, labor shortages are raising prices on staple grocery items to an almost 30-year high. Thousands of demonstrators protested in March for relief in the form of tax cuts.

Meanwhile, it’s no surprise that any supply issues, aggravated or initiated by the Russia-Ukraine war, would burden Greece’s weakened economy that only just emerged from a decade-long crisis in 2018 to be sent right back by Covid shutdowns in 2020. In April, thousands gathered at a labor union-organized rally outside parliament in protest of inflation, which followed a February demonstration where about 10,000 people showed up to protest electricity prices that had leaped 56 percent, fuel prices that had jumped 21.6 percent, and natural gas prices that had skyrocketed 156 percent in January.

In India, a country locked in a vicious cycle of going into debt to pay off interest of former debts, the increasing cost of living is racking the country. In March, an estimated 50 million workers participated in a two-day strike to protest the loss of jobs and income, with communist groups organizing rallies in May decrying the high rate of inflation.

The socialist government in Argentina that led the country to default seven times and produced the largest decline in the relative standard of living in the world since 1900 is trying to do something new. On Monday, Argentina’s new economy minister Silvina Batakis announced her plan to cut the fiscal deficit — a proposal more than a thousand Argentines are protesting.

Decades of government spending and faulty economic policies have led to Argentina’s inflation rate growing to 58 percent. Prices are liquid and through the roof, with iPhones costing six months’ rent and a two-hour plane ticket equaling the cost of a month’s college tuition. Batakis plans to hold Argentina to the terms of a $44 billion debt deal it made earlier this year with the International Monetary Fund. Thousands of Argentines meanwhile flocked to protest against the economic hardships felt by the country upon cutting spending and took up banners crying for Argentina’s separation from the IMF.

The United Kingdom is suffering from a high 9.1 percent inflation rate as of May, and many are tired of the government’s response. Brits flocked out in February to protest rising costs of living, with demonstrations held in at least 25 towns and cities and signs reading, “tax the rich” and “freeze prices not the poor.” The U.K.’s inflation rate was already at 5.4 percent in January of this year due in part to the 2020 Covid shutdowns, but it has since almost doubled, largely due to the EU’s sanctions on Russian oil. In June, thousands marched down central London in protest, wanting the government to boost its welfare response.

Still reeling from the worst drought it has had in 40 years, Morocco is seeing price spikes on even the most basic goods. Thousands of Moroccans joined protests in February to decry the increasing cost of living, with unions staging more demonstrations in April. The country has high unemployment rates and large public debt, along with a heavy reliance on imports.

Aside from a scant headline here and there, America’s most popular news providers, The Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, and NBC, did not cover these protests, despite the French and Spanish protests being 10 to 100 times larger than the protests these corporate media giants did report.

None of these four major outlets wrote a single line on the protests of more than 100,000 demonstrators in Spain, more than 10,000 in Greece, more than 1,000 in Morocco, and more than 1,000 in the U.K. The New York Times published one lone article on the strike in India, where an estimated 50 million people walked off the job. The Washington Post has two small articles on the Argentinian protests of more than 1,000 as inflation appears set to hit 70 percent, and it has reported once on the May Day protests in France where more than 120,000 people protested government pension reforms. NBC mentioned the May Day protests once in a world report. This is the entire 2022 coverage by these media giants of these countries’ protests over economic turmoil.

Of these 11 countries, only four made any major headlines. The corporate press oftentimes only highlights these economic protests when they get so loud they can no longer be ignored, as we saw with Kazakhstan’s kill order to quell protests and the Sri Lankans’ attack on their president’s home. Over the weekend, the biased media finally began covering the Sri Lanka protests that are over 10,000 people strong — but only because footage of demonstrators swarming the president’s residence by the thousands on Saturday went viral.

Corporate media won’t talk about the rest of these protests because the countries are struggling from economically disastrous policies akin to President Joe Biden’s. Any show of economic turmoil in EU member states could be traced back to EU sanctions on Russia or green energy failures, which would fly in the face of the corporate media’s agenda. Many of these countries have inflationary monetary policies.

The leftist media will tell you about Sri Lanka, Kazakhstan, Iran, and Peru, however, but only to bolster its pro-Ukraine/anti-Russia narrative that denies the realities of war to promote Biden’s efforts to empty our pockets and replenish Ukraine’s.

In its treatment of the Kazakhstan protests, The Washington Post made sure to mention the country’s relationship with Russia. The Times’ articles on the Sri Lanka protests framed the economic downturns in terms of problems stemming from Russia’s invasion and ignored Sri Lanka’s Green Deal ban on chemical fertilizer that ultimately crashed its economy. Both CNN’s coverage of protests in Iran and NBC’s reports of those in Peru likewise stressed the Russia-Ukraine war as the cause for economic turmoil.

The media only highlight these world protests when they grow too big to ignore or when the facts can be skewed toward their preferring narratives. Cherry-picking which protests to highlight gives media cover to paint them as isolated incidents in non-Western countries instead of a worldwide trend showing the consequences of embracing left-wing policies. After all, Biden is making the same blunders in the United States, and corporate media can’t have Americans connecting those dots.

The U.S. labor market is in shambles. Inflation has skyrocketed to a 40-year high at 9.1 percent. The Biden administration is drawing down our emergency oil reserves, shipping it overseas to nations that can’t function on their “Green Energy” policies anymore than we can. Irony alert: The oil will go through a European pipeline despite Biden citing climate conservation to shut down our own Keystone pipeline.

Discontent with these policy failures is triggering massive protests all over the world. Just don’t expect to read all about it in the New York Times.

Pay Attention To The Dutch Farmer Protests. America Is Next,"Americans should start paying closer attention to the ongoing farmer protests in the Netherlands, which this week transformed long swaths of Dutch highways into what looked like a post-apocalyptic warzone: roadside fires raging out of control, manure and farming detritus heaped across highways, traffic stalled for miles, and massive protests across the country in support of the farmers.

Why is the Netherlands, of all places, experiencing such unrest? Americans need to understand what’s happening over there because the ruinous climate policies that triggered these protests are precisely what President Joe Biden and the Democrats have in mind for the United States.

Specifically, Dutch farmers are protesting a government plan to cut fertilizer use and reduce livestock numbers so drastically that it will force many farms out of business. Earlier this month, farmers used tractors and trucks to block highways and entrances to food distribution centers across the country, saying their livelihood and way of life are being targeted by the government.

And they more or less are. The ruling coalition government claims its radical plan, pushed by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who branded the protests “unacceptable,” is part of an “unavoidable transition” to improve air, land, and water quality. The goal is to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide and ammonia, which are produced by livestock but which the government is labeling “pollutants,” by 50 percent nationwide by the year 2030.

The only way to do that, many Dutch farmers say, is to slaughter the vast majority of their livestock and shutter their farms. The government knows this and admitted as much earlier this year, saying in a statement, “The honest message … is that not all farmers can continue their business,” and that farmers have three options: “Becoming more sustainable, relocating or ending their business.”

https://twitter.com/TheRealKeean/status/1552269285803843584?s=20&t=uCWd-CGVF32vmVc9xCR1zA

The genesis of the scheme was a court ruling from 2019 that said the Dutch government’s plan for reducing nitrogen emissions violated EU laws protecting its Natura 2000 network of supposedly vulnerable and endangered plant and animal habitats — basically a bunch of EU-governed wildlife preserves. These sites span the EU, covering 18 percent of the bloc’s land area and 8 percent of its marine territory.

To protect these wildlife preserves, Dutch farmers are being told they must submit to their government’s ruinous emissions plan.

But the Natura 2000 preserves are only part of the story. European leaders such as Rutte are environmental ideologues who want to transform global food production and eliminate private land ownership, and he sees an opportunity in this court order to reshape agriculture and land use in the Netherlands.

Indeed, Rutte — a walking embodiment of the Davos Man if there ever was one — is a big proponent of the United Nations’ “Agenda 2030” and its Sustainable Development Goals, which aim to squeeze farmers and ranchers around the world in order to reduce “emissions.” The policies that flow from these goals, such as drastically reducing the use of fertilizer, contributed to the recent economic collapse of Sri Lanka, which triggered mass protests that toppled Sri Lanka’s government and ousted its president earlier this month.

Last year, Rutte spoke to the World Economic Forum about “transforming food systems and land use” at Davos Agenda Week, announcing that the Netherlands would host something called the “Global Coordinating Secretariat of the World Economic Food Innovation Hubs,” whose job would be to “connect all other food innovation hubs.”

In Davos-speak, that means agricultural production and the supply of food will be centrally controlled by intra-governmental bodies and “stakeholders” consisting mainly of the world’s largest food corporations and international NGOs. Private farms and independent farmers will be a thing of the past, supplanted by global bodies making decisions about how much and what kinds of food are produced. The private sector and the independent farmers will have no place in the future that the UN and the WEF are planning.

Dutch farmers understand this. They know Rutte and his ministers want above all to eradicate their farms and way of life. But they’re not going down without a fight.

All of which brings us back to the U.S. This week news broke that congressional Democrats had finally reached a deal on the largest piece of climate legislation in American history. The bill is a tax-and-spend cornucopia of some $369 billion for wind, solar, geothermal, battery, and other industries over the next decade, along with generous subsidies for electric vehicles and incentives to keep nuclear plants open and capture emissions from industrial plants.

After pretending to oppose Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s climate legislation, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin relented this week, clearing the way for the bill to proceed. Senate Democrats say the bill will allow the U.S. to cut greenhouse emissions by 40 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 — matching up nicely with the UN’s “Agenda 2030.”

Understand that the Senate bill isn’t the end, it’s the beginning. Climate activists and ideologues are working at the highest levels to transform not just the global food supply, but the nature of private property and property rights, all in the name of saving the planet. What Rutte and his government are doing to Dutch farmers, Schumer and Biden are planning to do to American farmers and American industries.

So pay attention to the roadside fires and blocked highways and mass civic unrest in places like the Netherlands and Sri Lanka. America is next.

Biden Says He Backs Iran's Protesters While Boosting The Regime,"Following the death of a young woman detained by Iran’s morality police last week, massive anti-government protests have broken out all across the country.

According to BBC News, “Anger erupted after Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman from the north-western city of Saqez, died in hospital in Tehran on Friday following three days in a coma.”

“She was visiting the capital with her family on 13 September when she was arrested by morality police officers, who accused her of violating the law requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab, or headscarf, and their arms and legs with loose clothing. She collapsed after being taken to a detention centre,” the BBC report reads. “There are reports that officers beat Ms Amini’s head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. The police have said there is no evidence of any mistreatment and that she suffered ‘sudden heart failure.'”

Among the nation’s most active demonstrators voicing their opposition to the country’s ruling regime are Iranian women, who “have been heavily present in the protests” and have been documented “waving or burning their veils, or cutting their hair in public.”

“Videos shared on social media have also shown demonstrators damaging symbols of the Islamic Republic,” The Washington Free Beacon reported. “One showed a man scaling the facade of the townhall in the northern city of Sari and tearing down an image of Ayatollah Khomeini, who established Iran’s Islamist government after the 1979 revolution.”

In addition to demonstrations in the capital city of Tehran, protests have also been reported in many of the Islamic Republic’s other major cities, leading to confrontations with the government security forces. According to citizen activists, eight protesters were shot and killed Wednesday night, with Iran’s state media claiming 11 people died, including both demonstrators and state security officials.

While some Kurdish human rights organizations say 15 protesters “have died in western Iran alone,” the true number of total fatalities throughout the country remains unknown.

Joe Biden’s Hypocrisy

The outbreak of the protests has led to statements of support from members of the international community, including President Joe Biden. While speaking before the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, Biden proclaimed his support for the ongoing demonstrations and the Iranian people in their struggle for freedom.

“Today we stand with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights,” he said.

While the remarks are sure to provide good fodder for America’s left-wing, corporate media to run interference for the Democrat president and distract from his failing policies, they’re a massive contradiction given Biden’s efforts to provide the Iranian government with the resources necessary to develop nuclear weapons. Since taking office last year, Biden and his administration have worked relentlessly to persuade the Islamic Republic to sign on to a new nuclear agreement after the Trump administration withdrew the U.S. from the Obama-era 2015 deal in 2018.

In addition to easing numerous sanctions that will enable the regime to fast-track the development of nuclear weapons, Biden’s administration has also restored “so-called ‘civ-nuke’ waivers,” on Iran, which would allow for “non-American companies to work on civilian nuclear projects” in the Middle Eastern country “without drawing retaliation from the US government.”

As if providing economic relief to Iran weren’t bad enough, the administration’s proposed nuclear agreement would purportedly pave the way for the Iranian regime to craft nuclear weapons much sooner than expected. During a briefing last month, Israel’s Defense Minister Benny Gantz warned that the sunset clauses of the proposed deal are “problematic” and that the accord would allow Iran “to acquire a nuclear weapon when said agreement ended in 2031.”

“Iran has gained knowledge, infrastructure and capabilities—much of which is irreversible,” Gantz said. “This will enable Iran to further expand its nuclear program during the period of an agreement that would have fewer restrictions.”

A letter signed by 5,000 members of Israel’s Defense and Security Forum was later sent to Biden in late August, urging him not to sign on to the agreement with Tehran.

At the end of the day, Biden can issue all the feel-good rhetoric about supporting the Iranian people he wants. None of it will change the actions he and his administration have taken in negotiating a horribly structured deal that will only continue to provide Iran’s dictatorial regime with the military power it needs to inflict greater suffering upon the Middle East and the Iranian people.

Will Biden And 'The Squad' Really Stand Up For Women?,"A young woman’s death in police custody for not complying with Iran’s strict dress code has sparked mass protest in that country and worldwide condemnation of the Iranian government. Yet Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., known as “the squad,” have remained unusually quiet. What happened to these self-proclaimed defenders of women’s rights and warriors against patriarchy?

Mahsa Amini, a beautiful 22-year-old Iranian woman, died on Sept. 16 in Tehran after the so-called “morality police” arrested and beat her for the crime of “unsuitable attire” — she allegedly had some hair visible under her headscarf. Since the founding of the Islamic Republic in 1979, the Iranian government has mandated that women cover their hair with hijabs and wear loose-fitting clothes in public. Those who fail to comply have been treated like criminals and often faced severe punishment.

Masih Alinejad, a U.S.-based Iranian activist, tweeted, “only in one year, the morality police arrested 3.6 million women in Iran.” While it is difficult to independently verify the exact number of Iranian women arrested by the morality police, what is evident is that the Iranian government has intensified its oppression of women. Last month, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi imposed even more restrictions on Iranian women, including using “surveillance cameras to monitor and fine unveiled women or refer them for ‘counseling,’ and a mandatory prison sentence for any Iranian who questioned or posted content against the hijab rules online,” the BBC reported.

The Iranian regime did not expect its medieval dress code and heavy-handed enforcement would be so unpopular with Iranians. Amini’s death has become the canary in the coal mine and sparked nationwide mass protests. Many Iranian women demonstrated their solidarity with Amini by posting images of cutting their own hair and burning their hijabs, and many Iranian men joined their resistance. Some protesters chanted “death to the dictator.”

The Iranian government responded with an iron fist. At least 57 protesters were killed, according to The Iran Human Rights Organization. Alinejad said in a Twitter thread that some victims were young women like Amini. Many protesters were also reportedly either injured or arrested by the government. The Iranian government shut down the nation’s Internet service to cover up the truth of the protests and its own brutality. The last time Tehran cut off the Internet was in November 2019, when Iranians protested against the country’s failing economy. Then, the Iranian government’s lethal crackdown left at least 304 people dead, Amnesty International said.

The Biden Administration’s Empty Gestures

The Iranian government is facing international condemnation over Amini’s death and the government’s brutal response to protesters. The Biden administration imposed sanctions on Iran’s morality police, and the U.S. Treasury also imposed sanctions on several high-level Iranian military and security officials. But these actions seem like empty gestures for two reasons. First, the Biden administration wouldn’t deny Iranian President Raisi’s entry to the United States to attend the United Nations meeting in New York City, despite a request by a bipartisan group of U.S. House lawmakers. Raisi took advantage of his U.N. speech to shamefully proclaim that the Iranian government always fights against injustice.

Second, the Biden administration continues its nuclear negotiations with Iran. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan claimed, “The fact that we are in negotiations with Iran on its nuclear program is in no way impacting our willingness and our vehemence in speaking out about what is happening on the streets of Iran.” Unfortunately, few see it that way.

By being unwilling to walk away from negotiating with Tehran, the Biden administration has already lost its credibility and the moral high ground. Why should Tehran change its behaviors when the Biden administration is so desperate to reach a deal? The sanctions relief provided by the Biden administration as part of the nuclear agreement will likely sustain the current Iranian regime, giving it even greater ability to suppress the human rights of Iranianians, fund regional terror groups, and endanger Americans abroad. Most importantly, many predict the nuclear deal will not stop Iran from building nuclear weapons.

Some Women Take a Stand, Some Are Silent

During his stay in New York City, Iran’s president Raisi was scheduled to have a sit-down interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. According to Amanpour’s Twitter thread, Raisi’s aide demanded Amanpour wear a hijab during the interview. Amanpour said she declined the request and walked away because “We are in New York, where there is no law or tradition regarding headscarves.” Amanpour won wide praise for taking a stand. But the four “squad” congresswomen have been noticeably silent about Amini’s death, the government’s compulsory law on hijabs, and women’s rights in Iran.

These four congresswomen have branded themselves as defenders of women’s rights. They pretended to be arrested in July at a rally protesting the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling overturning Roe v. Wade. Despite their professional success, which resembles some of the best examples of the American Dream, the squad never hesitates to criticize the United States and cast it and people who disagree with them politically in the worst light possible.

Omar’s Vile Words

Last year, Omar compared the United States and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban by claiming, “We must have the same level of accountability and justice for all victims of crimes against humanity. We have seen unthinkable atrocities committed by the U.S., Hamas, Israel, Afghanistan, and the Taliban.”

Yet, Omar has remained silent over Iran’s human rights abuses. Instead, she focuses her criticism on Alinejad. In 2020, Alinejad tweeted, “Ilhan Omar shared a defamatory article about me on social media by a Koch-Brothers funded ‘think tank’ co-founded by a known sympathizer of the Iranian regime.” Last year, after Alinejad penned an article opposing Omar’s anti-Islamophobia bill, political consultant Tim Mynett, Omar’s husband, tweeted of Masih, “this lady … doesn’t like Muslims.” Are either of them aware that Masih Alinejad survived several likely assassination attempts by the Iranian government because of her activism and outspokenness?

It seems that the four progressive congresswomen are only vocal about defending women’s rights and social justice when they get to criticize the United States and when their activism is politically beneficial (Ocasio-Cortez started fundraising immediately after posting her fake handcuffing video). They are known to be sympathetic to foreign authoritarian regimes and dictators, and somehow they always find a way to blame the United States for miseries in other nations caused by their dictatorial governments. For example, when asked about Venezuela’s economic hardship and social unrest, Ocasio-Cortez condemned the United States rather than Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro. So did Omar.

So we shouldn’t be surprised that we haven’t heard any of these four progressive congresswomen condemning the Iranian regime’s gross violation of women’s rights. Next time, when any of these four slams the U.S. as the worst country for women and says American women live like handmaidens, will someone in the press please ask if the congresswoman will say Mahsa Amini’s name?",https://thefederalist.com/2022/09/28/will-biden-and-the-squad-really-stand-up-for-women-like-iranian-mahsa-amini/,2022-09-28
The Rise And Fall Of Sexual Sanity In Western Civilization,"When people think of the sexual revolution, they generally imagine some time in the ’60s when drug-addled hippies at Woodstock were practicing free love, women were liberated from the home and entering the workforce, pornography and pornographic images were lining the newsstands, and abortions were legalized and frequent.

While this idea is not altogether inaccurate, the West has actually experienced multiple sexual revolutions, and each of them happened gradually. In his most recent book “Three Sexual Revolutions: Catholic, Protestant, Atheist,” David Carlin charts the progression and logic of sex and its relation to Western society. The book is succinct, clear, and quite pessimistic. After one sees the big picture, it’s difficult not to conclude that things will get much worse before they get any better.

Ironically, the current confusion about sex that dominates the popular imagination bears some resemblance to the confusion of Ancient Rome, which is where Carlin begins his discussion. In the centuries before the birth of Christ, pagan Rome did at least adhere to some degree of sexual prudence and chastity. Carlin notes, “For centuries Roman women were as famous for their chastity as Roman men were for their courage. But toward the latter days of the republic, things had changed considerably — at least on the chastity front.”

To illustrate this, he cites the scandals of adultery with Julius Caesar, which still meant something in public life. His heir Augustus tried in vain to revive the virtue of chastity, outlawing adultery and even making an example of his own daughter who violated this law. However, right after Augustus’s reign, sexual chaos soon set in, starting from the top, as each successor indulged in increasingly disgusting and destructive sexual fetishes.

Although he makes serious points about Rome’s sexual decadence, Carlin has a sense of humor about it. When describing Augustus’s daughter Julia, he explains that she “had the bad habit of going to bed with men who were not her husband.” In his point on Emperor Claudius, Carlin writes, “The sexual improprieties of the Emperor Claudius were relatively tame. He married four times. He divorced his first two wives, and had a third executed. His fourth wife was his niece, a marriage Romans considered to be incestuous.” The levity works well to counterbalance the unbelievable darkness of these men and women.

In such an environment, Judaism and Christianity held a great appeal to disenchanted gentiles: “What attracted [Roman pagans] to the Jewish religion? Two things, especially, its monotheism and its sexual ethic.” Thus, many gentiles either became semi-Jews or Christians to join churches that actually set boundaries for promiscuity and abided by logic.

This in turn precipitated the first sexual revolution. As Christianity was becoming more established in the Roman Empire, the Catholic Church adopted what Carlin calls an attitude of “hyper-chastity.” After all, this is what Christ commanded in the Gospels and St. Paul prescribed in his letters. Influential Christians doubled down on this message, best shown in the conversion of St. Augustine of Hippo who traded away a life of sexual dissolution for strict celibacy.

According to Carlin, this fixation on chastity that placed strict regulations on marriage and recommended an ascetic way of life partially led to the popularity of Gnosticism, a heretical belief that condemned material pleasure and extolled the spirit. It wasn’t so much that the arguments of gnostics were persuasive, but a general feeling they tapped into: “It was an attitude that held, or rather felt, that there is something fundamentally wrong with the material world — and hence with our bodies.”

Even after Gnosticism disappeared, the commitment to hyper-chastity and a rigorous sexual ethic continued well into the Middle Ages, playing a key role in how the church and Christendom developed. Then came the second sexual revolution that happened with the Protestant Reformation.

Because Luther and other Protestant leaders believed that much of the Catholic Church’s corruption stemmed from their hyper-chaste dogmas, they sought to remove these restrictions. In practice, this resulted in ending monasticism and priestly celibacy, permitting remarriage and divorce, and legitimizing private judgment among believers. Thus, the sexual culture of Protestant kingdoms transitioned from hyper-chaste to relatively chaste, influencing adjacent Catholic cultures to have a similar mentality.

This broad agreement on chastity and Christian sexual morality breaks down in the final sexual revolution that happened in the ’60s. Carlin considers this an atheistic revolution, explaining how prominent atheists and atheistic ideas laid the groundwork for this last sexual revolution. He remarks from the outset, “just as the Protestant sexual revolution of the 1600s was an anti-Catholicism revolution, so this modern sexual revolution has been an anti-Christianity revolution.” This was what drove the modern forces of feminism, popular entertainment, public intellectuals, and the social sciences.

Carlin recognizes that though the claims made in these domains have all been largely discredited, they nevertheless had their effect. Hollywood may have been all fake, but the stories they told made sexual dissipation quite real. Alfred Kinsey was a dishonest pervert, but he successfully normalized what was formerly considered “deviant.” Margaret Mead basically fabricated a sexual island utopia in “Coming of Age in Samoa,” but professors continue assigning it, making promiscuity not only normal but natural and good. Feminists continue preaching abortion as empowering, even though this rewards irresponsible men, traumatizes mothers, and kills innocent children — most of them girls.

Today’s world is the natural result of these influences. The structures that brought about stability in households and civilization at large are quickly breaking down. Whereas chastity and marriage were the general expectation for men and women, Carlin lists what has come to replace them: premarital sex, cohabitation, promiscuity, unmarried parenthood, abortion, homosexuality, and homo-conformity (actively endorsing homosexuality), and transgenderism. In such a climate, the idea of marrying and having children becomes not only unusual, but even hateful and judgmental to those who have alternative lifestyles.

As sexual morality has given way, so too has religious practice. The argument of Carlin’s conclusion mirrors the memorable quote from Fulton Sheen: “If you do not live what you believe, you end up believing what you live.” Religion, which set up limiting principles to sexual behavior, is waning. Because of this, there’s no reason to see sexual conventions change trajectory or diminish. Carlin foresees a continued disintegration of religion and the home, with the lingering remnants of Christianity uniting in “the cultural and political struggle against atheism.”

To call Carlin’s analysis sobering would be something of an understatement. Rather, it’s profoundly dour with little hope of redemption. His tone is one of a jaded man who has seen it all and can see all too clearly the inevitable doom to befall a fallen civilization. And while he’s done his part to explain why this is so, it would have been nice to have some kind of solution or way forward. Instead, he simply concludes that he’ll be long dead before there’s any change on the horizon.

Then again, perhaps this is a challenge for the reader to take on after reflecting on the history given in “Three Sexual Revolutions.” True, it certainly seems like Western civilization is reverting back to its ancient past where so many varieties of relational dysfunction brought about the decline of great empires. And it may be the case that today’s decadence will do the same.

However, if tomorrow’s leaders can heed the warnings of today, it’s only reasonable to have hope that they can ignite a fourth sexual revolution in the future by adopting the Christian values that ultimately redeemed Rome and ultimately restoring some semblance of order and virtue to families and communities.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/17/the-rise-and-fall-of-sexual-sanity-in-western-civilization/,2022-10-17
"Green Agenda Leaves Europe Suffering, Climate Crazies Still Rage","Several ostentatious climate stunts in Europe have recently captured the world’s attention, particularly when activists splattered Vincent van Gogh’s priceless “Sunflowers” painting with tomato soup at London’s National Gallery last Friday.

Two activists just threw tomato soup at Van Gogh’s original masterpiece, “Sunflowers” to protest natural gas and oil. With millions at risk of dying around the world from energy & food shortages, this isn’t climate altruism, it’s anti-human nihilism.

It appears the climate protesters believe they are demonstrating on behalf of families suffering during the energy crisis. One of the soup-throwers with purple hair cried out: “The cost of living crisis is part of the cost of the oil crisis. Fuel is unaffordable to millions of cold, hungry families. They can’t even afford to heat a tin of soup.”

Indeed, the cost of living crisis is part of the oil crisis, but the oil crisis was in part caused by irresponsible and damaging environmental policies supported by the likes of the aforementioned activists. For decades, the rich and powerful members of the World Economic Forum have pushed governments into adopting their socialist master plan for transitioning economies away from their reliance on coal, oil, and natural gas by “[p]ricing the alternatives to green energy out of the market.”

While climate activists like the van Gogh defacers will argue that reliance on Russia signals a need for more so-called green energy, the truth is, these alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power have proved insufficient. To fill in the gaps, 15 of the 19 EU countries consequently depended on Russia for about half of their natural gas before the war in Ukraine. After the war started, Russia rolled back gas production, and prices shot up almost 400 percent.

Recent government measures to curtail the energy crisis and put the climate agenda on hold have sparked many of the environmentalist demonstrations. On Monday, Germany moved to postpone the scheduled closure of its three nuclear plants. On Friday, British officials launched their first oil and gas licensing round since 2019, “aiming to award more than 100 licenses to ramp up domestic oil and gas production and reduce dependence on foreign sources of fossil fuels,” according to OilPrice.com.

However, other European elites are doing nothing to mitigate the effects of the harmful World Economic Forum climate agenda, and, as CatholicVote reports, they are actually “doubl[ing] down on aggressive green energy goals, compounding the effects of the recession on middle-class and low-income Europeans.”

The bizarre move to vandalize paintings for the climate agenda is not the activists’ only tactic; they target anything or anyone that stands in their way. This includes everyday people who use vehicles, car companies, government officials who allegedly don’t promote the green agenda, and dairy providers, since activists argue nitrous oxide and methane emissions from livestock harm the environment.

Animal Rebellion, an organization that opposes eating animals and wants a “plant-based food system,” enlisted activists to dump milk out on the floor of an Edinburgh Waitrose store on Saturday. The demonstration is one of many similar Animal Rebellion protests that took place across the United Kingdom last weekend.

It remains unclear how vandalizing beloved paintings, making people late for work, slowing down ambulances, and wasting milk is supposed to inspire people to join the climate cause.

"FBI Publicly Indicted 22 Pro-Lifers, No Pregnancy Center Arsonists","The Department of Justice under Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the indictment of pro-life activist Herb Geraghty on Oct. 14, bringing the number of apparently nonviolent pro-life protesters targeted under the FACE (Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances) Act by President Joe Biden’s DOJ this year to 22. Meanwhile, the agency has yet to announce a single arrest or indictment against any of the vandals or arsonists who terrorized and firebombed crisis pregnancy centers after the leak of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision overturning Roe v. Wade.

Geraghty, a 25-year-old from Pittsburgh, is accused of participating in a “reproductive health care clinic blockade in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 22, 2020.” Along with nine other defendants, the DOJ alleges, Geraghty “forcefully entered the [abortion facility] and set about blockading two clinic doors using their bodies, furniture, chains and ropes.” In March, the FBI announced indictments against the other nine: “Lauren Handy, 28, of Alexandria, Virginia; Jonathan Darnel, 40, of Arlington, Virginia, Jay Smith, 32, of Freeport, New York; Paulette Harlow, 73, of Kingston, Massachusetts; Jean Marshall, 72, of Kingston, Massachusetts; John Hinshaw, 67, of Levittown, New York; Heather Idoni, 61, of Linden, Michigan; William Goodman, 52, of the Bronx, New York; and Joan Bell, 74, of Montague, New Jersey.”

“The indictment also alleges that all 10 defendants violated the FACE Act by using a physical obstruction to injure, intimidate and interfere with the clinic’s employees and a patient, because they were providing or obtaining reproductive health services,” the DOJ continued in its recent press release.

A description of the demonstration by LifeSiteNews, however, paints a far less charged picture:

Once inside, the rescuers sought to offer help to families who were seeking abortion, counselling them to change their minds about aborting their babies, praying with them, and informing them about local resource centers. Rescuers blocked the abortion facility’s entrances and stationed themselves around the complex to physically prevent access to the building.

The protest very well may have violated trespassing restrictions, as well as provisions of the FACE Act, which criminalizes “attempts to … interfere with” a person for “obtaining or providing reproductive health services.” The law was passed in 1994 and designed to crack down on attempted bombings or arson of abortion offices. The DOJ claims, “The FACE Act is not about abortions [but] protects all patients, providers, and facilities that provide reproductive health services, including pro-life pregnancy counseling services.” But under Biden’s Justice Department, it might as well limit its protections to abortion facilities. Furthermore, if the overbroad law can be stretched by corrupt G-men to prosecute peaceful Americans exercising their First Amendment rights — as the Garland DOJ has since stretched it — Congress should repeal it.

In a just world, federal law wouldn’t exist to protect the practice of killing babies in their mothers’ wombs. But since it does, it appears the FBI made an easy example out of Geraghty and the nine other participants who were indicted in March of this year. If convicted, they face “up to a maximum of 11 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $260,000,” even though their alleged crimes pale in comparison to the devastation wrought by abortion activists shattering windows and pitching Molotov cocktails into pro-life pregnancy resource centers.

Since the roundup of nine pro-lifers who participated in the D.C. protest, the FBI has made similar arrests of pro-life protesters whose alleged crimes are far less clear — indicating that the weaponized agency is becoming more emboldened in its crackdown on opponents of the administration’s radical pro-abortion stance.

On Sept. 23, some 20 to 30 armed FBI agents with more than a dozen vehicles swarmed Catholic pro-life activist and author Mark Houck’s Pennsylvania home and arrested him in front of his children, according to Houck’s wife Ryan-Marie. Houck is accused of “attacking a patient escort” named Bruce Love at a Planned Parenthood facility in violation of the FACE Act. But Ryan-Marie says her husband only “shoved him away from his child” after Love refused to stop verbally harassing their 12-year-old son and “came into [the son’s] personal space.” Furthermore, as The Federalist’s Senior Legal Correspondent Margot Cleveland reported:

[A]s a matter of law, the facts of the private criminal complaint sworn out by Love do not constitute a violation of the FACE Act because Houck was standing at a corner away from the abortion facility, no clients were involved, and the alleged assault had nothing to do with so-called reproductive services. And that conclusion flows from Love’s version of the facts, ignoring Houck’s allegation that Love was harassing his 12-year-old son.

The case against Mark was thrown out of the district court in Philadelphia earlier this year, LifeSiteNews reported, but the FBI picked it up as the federal agency continues to wage war on the administration’s political opponents. Houck faces “a maximum possible sentence of 11 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and fines of up to $350,000” if convicted.

On Oct. 5, the DOJ unsealed another indictment against “Chester Gallagher, Heather Idoni, Calvin Zastrow, Coleman Boyd, Caroline Davis, Paul Vaughn, Dennis Green, Eva Edl, Eva Zastrow, James Zastrow and Paul Place” for “an alleged reproductive health care clinic blockade in Mount Juliet, Tennessee, on March 5, 2021.” They are accused of using “force and physical obstruction to injure, intimidate and interfere with employees of the clinic and a patient who was seeking reproductive health services,” and face prison time and fines if convicted.

The FBI conducted an armed raid on Gallagher’s home on the same day, entering his home and questioning his neighbors when agents realized Gallagher was out of town. As The Federalist’s Evita Duffy noted, far from using violence, the 11 peaceful protesters “lined the inside hallway of a medical building that houses multiple offices, including the Carafem abortion facility, and peacefully tried to convince mothers seeking an abortion to choose life.”

As the FBI targets pro-lifers with less and less evidence of even superficial crimes, what has it done to hold accountable the pro-abortion terrorists who firebombed numerous pro-life organizations and pregnancy resource centers after the Supreme Court removed its prohibition on state abortion bans? Apparently nothing.

A Federalist review of Justice Department press releases in 2022 revealed not a single announcement of the arrest or indictment of a pregnancy center arsonist. It took the FBI 44 days after the Dobbs opinion leaked to even acknowledge it was investigating incidents of violence against pro-life groups. As The Federalist’s Jordan Boyd concluded earlier this month, “the arrest of peaceful pro-lifers but not of violent pro-abortionists confirms Biden’s DOJ does not equally apply the law.”

Asked on Tuesday if “the FBI has made any arrests related to the vandalism, firebombing, etc. of dozens of pregnancy resource centers and churches around the country since the leak of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision?” the FBI refused to comment. The FBI also declined to answer whether any individuals had been indicted, or if the FBI had conducted any raids on potential suspects such as those used to target pro-life activists Mark Houck and Chester Gallagher; the agency directed The Federalist to the DOJ for indictment inquiries. The DOJ did not respond.

Chinese Protesters Have Zero Tolerance For Xi's 'Zero Covid',"From Beijing to Shanghai, demonstrations erupted in major cities across China over the weekend, with protesters voicing their dissatisfaction with the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) draconian “zero Covid” policies. The protests mark a rare occurrence in a nation where basic civil rights are routinely suppressed by China’s authoritarian government.

The protests erupted after the deaths of 10 people in an apartment building fire in the city of Urumqi, the capital of the western region of China known as Xinjiang. According to The New York Times, it took authorities three hours to fully extinguish the flames, leading many on Chinese social media to criticize the CCP’s “zero Covid” approach and citizens throughout Xinjiang to take to the streets.

The backlash to the government’s handling of the incident spread throughout the country, leading to protests in some of China’s biggest population hubs. In the capital of Beijing, residents generated multiple, small-scale protests throughout the city on Saturday, with participants reportedly shouting phrases such as “End the lockdown.” Larger demonstrations against the CCP’s “zero Covid” strategy were also seen in Shanghai, where citizens with candles and flowers called for Chinese dictator Xi Jinping and the ruling CCP to “step down” from leadership and for a reversal of the city’s heavy-handed Covid restrictions.

Other Chinese cities that have reportedly experienced protests include Nanjing, Guangzhou, Xian, and Wuhan.

“These people have been languishing under Covid Zero policies … for almost three years now and they’re tired of it,” Steven Mosher, the president of the Population Research Institute and a notable authority on Chinese affairs, told The Federalist. “They’re also suffering because the promise of the Chinese Communist Party, that China was going to be in the first rank of nations and that people in China were going to enjoy a standard of living equivalent to what we enjoy in the United States and the West, has turned out to be false.”

The nationwide protests have since been collectively called the “White Paper Revolution,” in reference to the blank sheets of white paper being used as a symbol of defiance by many of the gatherings’ participants.

Many Chinese youths are notably participating in the demonstrations. On Sunday, for instance, hundreds of students rallied at Beijing’s Tsinghua University, singing the Chinese national anthem and chanting phrases such as, “Freedom will prevail,” and, “No to lockdowns, we want freedom.” Student protests have also been reported at numerous other universities throughout China.

According to Mosher, this stems from a growing view among Chinese youths that life under an increasingly dictatorial Xi, combined with accretive economic challenges (such as high unemployment), does not bode well for their future prospects.

“The chants range all the way from ‘End Covid’ to ‘Get rid of the traitor Xi Jinping,’ so you’ve got a pretty broad swath there [ranging] from a very narrow complaint about a specific government policy to a complaint about the Chinese Communist Party and its leader,” Mosher said.

How Are Xi and the CCP Responding?

As expected, Xi and government authorities have resorted to brutal force to break up the largely peaceful demonstrations. On Sunday, police violently removed protesters in Shanghai, with CBS News reporting incidents of demonstrators being dragged into vans and pepper sprayed. Police in major cities such as Beijing have also been tasked with stopping and searching the phones of citizens found at protest sites to check if they have been using illegal social media apps and virtual private networks.

According to Mosher, given the authoritarian nature of Xi and the CCP, it remains plausible that the former will “use as much force as he needs to put down the demonstrations,” adding that he wouldn’t be surprised if the ongoing protests “end in bloodshed.”

“China actually spends more money on internal security than it does on its external military buildup, which is quite an astonishing fact, but tells you the kind of police state we’re talking about,” Mosher said. “I don’t think anybody in the [People’s Liberation Army] or the People’s Armed Police will oppose [Xi] because he’s basically fired or charged with corruption any high-level officials who have opposed his rule over the last 10 years. So, he’s pretty much in charge in China.”

The increased crackdown by government authorities has not been exclusive to Chinese citizens, however. While reporting on the protests in Shanghai, BBC News journalist Ed Lawrence was beaten and detained by Chinese police before being released a few hours later. The Chinese government has since offered a myriad of excuses for the incident, ranging from claims that Lawrence was arrested “for his own good in case he caught COVID from the crowd” to assertions that he “did not identify himself as a journalist and didn’t voluntarily present his press credentials.”

Joe Biden’s Muted Response

As of this article’s publication, the response to the ongoing protests from President Joe Biden and his administration has been largely mute. While Biden himself has yet to issue a public statement about the matter, the reaction from administration officials such as National Security Council spokesman John Kirby has been just as dismissive.

When asked during a White House press briefing on Monday about Biden’s reaction to hearing Chinese protesters shout “freedom” or “Xi Jinping step down,” Kirby deflected by saying, “The president’s not going to speak for protesters,” and that the “protesters are speaking for themselves.”

Reporter: ""What is the president's reaction when he hears protesters in China chant 'freedom' or 'Xi Jinping step down'?""



Kirby: ""The president's not going to speak for protesters.""



Reporter: ""So there's no reaction?""



Kirby: ""These protesters are speaking for themselves."" pic.twitter.com/Q8Rg0QOx9J — Washington Free Beacon (@FreeBeacon) November 28, 2022

Kirby’s refusal to publicly back the protesters’ fight for freedom mirrors a statement from a National Security Council official provided to Politico, which claimed that the Biden administration is not pursuing a “zero COVID” strategy in the U.S. and that they are focused on enhancing “vaccination rates, including boosters and making testing and treatment easily accessible.”

“We should be saying to China’s leaders, that if you open fire on peaceful crowds of demonstrators, you will lose your assets in the United States,” said Mosher. “We will confiscate your assets [just] as we confiscated the yachts of the Russian oligarchs. We will send Chinese students [studying in the U.S.] home in large numbers. … We will decouple from China’s economy at an even faster rate.”

“There are things we should be saying right now, and all the White House is saying is ‘Increase your vaccination rate and don’t forget your second or third booster.’ It’s just ridiculous,” he added.

Apple Can’t Ignore Its Giant China Problem,"While Americans were enjoying the Thanksgiving holiday with their families and friends last week, protests broke out at the world’s largest iPhone factory in China, and protesters clashed with police. The incident is a reminder that Apple can no longer afford to ignore its China problem.

Foxconn, a Taiwan-based company and one of Apple’s most important suppliers, owns the factory in Zhengzhou, China. The factory reportedly employs about 200,000 people. Last week’s protests were driven mainly by two grievances.

First and foremost was workers’ dissatisfaction with the company’s strict Covid protocols and poor living conditions. It has been three years since the first Covid outbreak in Wuhan, China, became known. Yet Beijing has continued to stick to its “zero Covid” policy and to enforce it with harsh measures, including frequent lockdowns.

To avoid shutting down its factory, Foxconn has been running a closed-loop system, keeping employees confined within the factory and company-run dormitories. Following the Chinese government’s Covid protocols, workers have been subjected to daily mass Covid testing and mandatory quarantine for those who tested positive and everyone in their proximity. The company also compels workers to wear N95 masks and take Chinese traditional medicine (there’s no independent research supporting Beijing’s claim that certain traditional Chinese medicine can fight Covid).

According to Bloomberg, these Covid protocols are deeply flawed. For instance, “As many as 20 workers’ throat swabs were put into one tube to speed testing and lower costs. If the results came back positive, all the workers whose samples were in that one tube were put into isolation for further testing. Those who worked on the same production line with someone who tested positive were also immediately removed from their duties and put into quarantine.” As of October, about 20,000 workers were reportedly put in quarantine on-site.

Unable to go outside, workers complained about long physical isolations from friends and families. They were also unhappy with the living conditions inside their dorms. They told reporters that they either received poor quality food or sometimes no food at all. “In some dormitories, trash piled up for weeks because no one was allowed to leave the building.”

Workers Flee

The Chinese government’s “zero Covid” policy created much fear among the Chinese. In October, when rumors about a Covid outbreak inside the plant began to spread, thousands of workers who were already sick of the isolation and the pathetic living conditions fled the factory on foot.

Foxconn tried to lure workers back by promising to pay an extra 30 yuan (about $4.19) in hourly pay. It might not sound much to Americans, but before this additional bonus, only those holding key positions inside the factory earned about 38 yuan ($5.30) per hour. Thus, the bonus was significant enough to entice some workers who fled in October back to work. But last week, when a rumor began to spread that Foxconn would delay the bonus payment until next March, workers had enough, and they staged a protest to express frustration with both the company’s and the government’s inhuman Covid policies.

The Chinese authorities responded to protests by sending hazmat-clad police wielding batons to crack down on protesters. Dressed like stormtroopers from “Star Wars,” these thugs have become the most-hated symbol of China’s “zero Covid” policy. The images of protesters shouting “stand up for your rights” while confronting the police went viral on China’s social media before censors removed them. Beijing further punished protesters by putting 6 million people in and around the iPhone factory under a five-day lockdown.

Foxconn later announced that it would honor the promised bonus payment for new workers and “offered a 10,000 yuan payment, equivalent to $1,400, to newly recruited workers who wanted to leave their jobs and return home.”

Apple’s Problems Will Continue

Apple’s China problem will remain even if these additional payments may quiet labor unrest temporarily. The Foxconn factory will have even more difficulty recruiting workers after these protests and the government’s subsequent crackdown. Since the plant was responsible for making “more than 80% of the latest iPhone 14 base models and 85% of the high-end Pro models,” a labor shortage means Apple likely will not have enough of the newest iPhones available for sale this holiday season, which in turn will severely affect the company’s bottom line. Morgan Stanley even predicted a worst-case scenario: “no more iPhones will be shipped from the site this year.”

Apple has only itself to blame for exposing itself to such supply chain risk. According to Reuters, nearly 50 percent of Apple suppliers are located in China as of 2019. In recent years, Apple has added more contract factories in China and employed hundreds of thousands of Chinese to assemble Apple devices, from Apple watches to iPhones to MacBooks. China represents not only Apple’s most critical manufacturing site but also an important market. In its 2022 third-quarter earnings report, Apple credits China for generating $15.5 billion in sales.

Apple’s reliance on China represents an enormous liability. The lack of an off-ramp from the Chinese government’s “zero Covid” policy means Apple’s supply chain and the company’s profitability are at the mercy of one man — China’s dictator-for-life, Xi Jinping. Since he has staked his reputation and legacy on “zero Covid,” Xi has shown no signs of backing down, even though his policies have been deeply unpopular due to the resulting economic cost and human suffering.

In the same week that workers protested at the Foxconn factory, another protest erupted in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang and home to millions of Uyghur Muslims and minorities. Protesters were angry because after a high-rise apartment building caught on fire, barriers erected by the local government to confine residents inside the apartment hindered residents’ escape and fire-fighters’ rescue efforts, leading to unnecessary deaths.

Xi doesn’t care about Chinese people’s suffering. He is probably more embarrassed that his policy hasn’t prevented Covid from spreading — China reported a record number of Covid cases last week, which proved that the government’s policy was an utter failure after three years.

While Apple prides itself on being a good global corporate citizen for supporting the environment and human rights elsewhere, the company choses to ignore environmental issues and human rights violations in China. The company’s reputation has suffered after repeatedly kowtowing to Beijing’s authoritarian demands. For example, in 2019, Apple, urged by the Chinese government, removed a police-tracking app used by Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters.

Apple has been widely criticized for its “one company, two systems” hypocrisy, and it isn’t alone. Many other Western companies, from Nike to BlackRock, also seem to believe they can bend their knees to the Chinese authorities while promoting liberal democratic values everywhere else, all without suffering economic consequences or damage to their reputations. Last week’s protests at an iPhone plant and their implications for Apple’s supply chain and the bottom line affirm that the “one company, two systems” approach is risky and unsustainable.

Even Foxconn has sought to reduce its reliance on China by building more factories in neighboring countries such as Vietnam and India. Leaders at Western companies, including Apple’s Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, have a business and moral obligation to address their dependency on China and seek alternatives. Continuing business as usual will be irresponsible to their customers, employees, and shareholders.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/11/29/apple-cant-ignore-its-giant-china-problem/,2022-11-29
'Paper Revolution' May Be The Beginning Of The End For Xi,"When the Chinese people saw images of maskless fans enjoying the World Cup, they asked why the rest of the world had moved on while they were still cooped up in their tiny apartments like animals, bored and hungry (Chinese censors reportedly stopped showing images of fans during World Cup broadcasts).

This is while something extraordinary is happening in China: Residents in multiple cities, at significant personal risk, took to the streets over the weekend to demand an end to the government’s draconian “zero Covid” policy. These protests have quickly spread nationwide and become venues for the Chinese people to express their dissatisfaction with China’s leader Xi Jinping. Many protesters held blank sheets of paper as a symbol of lacking free speech under Beijing’s censorship (hence, the nickname “Paper Revolution”). Some even openly called for Xi to resign.

Xi’s most prominent concern has always been that a color revolution (a term that describes anti-government movements) might take place in China and topple his and the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) rule. Since coming to power in late 2012, Xi has built a high-tech surveillance state to monitor 1.4 billion Chinese people’s thoughts and behaviors while ruthlessly suppressing dissenters.

Xi’s intimidation seemed to have worked. While some small and isolated protests, mostly over environmental issues or economic grievances, took place in China during the first 10 years of his rule, China hadn’t experienced any large-scale protests nationwide that directly challenged the CCP and Xi personally until now. Xi has no one but himself to blame for sparking China’s “Paper Revolution” and jeopardizing his third term and beyond.

Series of Tragedies Under Lockdown

A deadly fire in a high-rise apartment in Xinjiang initially triggered the weekend protests. In the same region, the CCP has been accused of subjecting millions of Uyghur Muslims to genocide. Videos spread of victims desperately crying for help from the apartment building, but people could not escape nor rescuers enter because the entrance was sealed, a common lockdown measure imposed by local authorities. It took fire trucks more than two hours to reach the burning building, again, due to the barriers set up by local authorities to keep people confined inside their apartments. Since the early days of the Covid outbreak in 2020, Chinese authorities have routinely sealed the front entrances of entire apartment buildings or barricaded residential communities to enforce lockdowns.

The deadly fire in Xinjiang is sadly one of a long string of tragedies caused by the government’s inhumane Covid restrictions. Several other incidents have drawn national outcries this year alone. In January, a woman who was eight months pregnant in Xi’an lost her baby after local hospitals refused to treat her because her Covid test had expired by a few hours. During Shanghai lockdowns between March and April, children as young as newborns were taken away from their parents and committed to poorly run government daycare facilities. Residents also experienced severe food shortages unheard of since the Great Chinese famine (1959-1961).

Last month, a woman in Beijing, the capital of China, who was welded into her apartment for days, jumped to her death from her apartment building. The audio of her daughter from days before, “banging on the gate and begging community workers to unseal her mother’s door and help her,” went viral on China’s social media before censors took it down, the Daily Mail reported.

These heartbreaking incidents represent the human toll caused by the Chinese government’s cruel “zero Covid” policy. The Chinese people have experienced many pent-up fears, frustrations, and furies for the last three years. They are afraid that such tragedies will happen to them or their families, and they desperately want to avoid becoming the next victims. They are frustrated that their suffering has not “defeated” Covid as Beijing promised. On the contrary, China has recently reported a record number of Covid infections. The Chinese people are also furious Xi made it clear during his most recent speech at the 20th Party Congress that his “zero Covid” approach is here to stay.

Many Have Had Enough

Many Chinese have had enough, and the deadly fire incident in Xinjiang became the last straw. They decided to take a stand, regardless of possible consequences (in China, those who participate in protests usually are imprisoned) because, after three years of hardship, many felt they had nothing more to lose.

Judging by the slogans protesters chanted, last weekend’s protests were against more than the government’s Covid restrictions. People are dissatisfied with Xi’s economic policies too. Xi’s ideological war on China’s private businesses and Chinese entrepreneurs, his tit-for-tat trade war with then-President Donald Trump, and the three-year lockdowns have caused China’s economic growth to significantly slow down, depressed some sectors such as the property market, and pushed up unemployment rates, especially among the young. The lockdowns also drained many people’s savings since they couldn’t go to work.

Huge Sex Trafficking Problem

Besides economic issues, the Chinese people are concerned about their safety and the government’s corruption. In February this year, right around the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, news of a woman in Xuzhou, China, being found locked up in a doorless animal hut in freezing temperatures, sparked a national uproar. Local police and government officials claimed she had mental health issues, and they didn’t know about her situation until the news broke out. But it turned out the woman was a victim of sex trafficking and had endured her husband’s abuses for years. Under public pressure, local authorities arrested a few human traffickers but held no one else accountable. Censors scrubbed the internet to prevent any discussion related to this case and sex trafficking in general.

The government had underestimated the public furor. Sex trafficking is a massive problem in China, where men outnumber women by 32 million due to China’s cruel “one child” policy from 1979 to 2015. Desperate Chinese men, especially those living in rural China, have resorted to trafficking women from other parts of China or neighboring countries to be their brides. Sometimes brothers or even fathers and sons from the same families would share a bride. Often, human traffickers and those families who “purchased” brides bribed local police and officials not to intervene.

Perhaps the Beginning of the End

Many Chinese demanded to know how China claims to be a superpower yet fails to protect its most vulnerable citizens; what’s the real purpose of all these surveillance tools if not to stop crimes; why there is no accountability for government officials; and why citizens aren’t even allowed to share their concerns on social media.

Xi and the CCP seem to forget that the Chinese people only accepted fewer rights and more political oppression provided the party would deliver safety and prosperity. Yet more and more people feel neither safe nor prosperous under Xi’s rule. The demonstrations were the last resort for people to express their discontent and demand accountability.

What made these protests even more remarkable was that they were leaderless. Unlike the 1989 pro-democracy movement, no single group or national figure led last week’s demonstrations. Protests erupted in multiple cities in China organically and even spilled over to foreign soils — Chinese students at several American universities, including Columbia University, staged their anti-Xi demonstrations.

Unfortunately, Xi will survive this crisis of his own making and remain in power. The Chinese government is reportedly taking action to crack down on demonstrators. But China’s “paper revolution” shows Xi has no firm control of the nation and its people. The “Paper Revolution” will not end the CCP’s authoritarian rule in China. Still, it is likely the beginning of the end of the CCP if Xi continues to forge ahead with his destructive policies.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/12/01/chinas-paper-revolution-could-be-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-xi/,2022-12-01
Iran Grilling US Reveals Bad Faith Of Our Racial Outrage Machine,"Iran was recently pressured into supposedly disbanding its “morality police” after its violent roundup of protesters caused international outcry. The impoverished country run by Islamic theocrats who are one of the world’s largest funders of terrorism made the change the same week its state-controlled press slung bad-faith critiques at America, in a display of the complete unseriousness of those who claim Americans are “oppressed.”

Leading up to the FIFA World Cup match between the U.S. and Iran last week, an Iranian reporter grilled an American soccer player on so-called discrimination in the United States. In the press conference, Press TV’s Milad Javanmardi zeroed in on 23-year-old team captain Tyler Adams, asking if he was okay with playing for “a country that has so much discrimination against black people in its own borders.”

Adams, who is black, calmly answered the reporter’s question by saying, “You know, there’s discrimination everywhere you go. One thing that I’ve learned, especially from living abroad in the past few years … is that in the U.S., we’re continuing to make progress every single day.”

This question Javanmardi asked is eyebrow-raising, especially considering Iran’s horrific treatment of its own people. More than 15,000 protesters are being held in Iranian prisons and hundreds are dead after Ayatollah Khomeini cracked down on the demonstrations.

The protests, which started after 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died in police custody in Iran after being brutally arrested for wearing an “improper” hijab, have been going on for more than 70 days. The government has even threatened to execute the protesters, many of whom are women and teenagers.

More than 227 members of the Iranian Parliament signed a letter arguing those in prison should face the death penalty for defying the government. Only 63 members abstained from signing it.

The inhumane treatment happening in Iran doubtlessly deserves international condemnation. But it also highlights the unseriousness of similar “international criticism” of so-called “discrimination” in the United States. Although America offers more opportunities to all races than arguably anywhere else in the world, her enemies and useless corporate press have fanned flames of racial tension to the point that America’s soccer team was grilled by foreign reporters from a country that kills its women for failing to wear hijabs.

There is no equivalence between the United States and Iran. It’s a tactic of our enemies to fan flames of racial division in America to distract from the abuses of their own regimes. In 2019, following President Donald Trump’s decision to back pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, Chinese foreign ministry official Zhao Lijian released a series of tweets condemning “systematic racial discrimination” in the United States.

Part of his tweet read, “Systematic racial discrimination has long existed in US. Ethnic minorities faced restrictions in exercising their voting rights. US made little progress in reducing racial discrimination.”

Supporters of Zhao’s tweet, and even Zhao himself, are deflecting from the reality that the Chinese government has been routinely locking up and abusing Uyghur Muslims in “reeducation” camps since 2017 — subjecting them to forced labor, involuntary sterilization, rape, and other atrocities — not to mention countless other human rights violations the CCP has committed over the years.

Yet, many continue to push the radical talking points that the United States is an oppressive nation where black or Hispanic people are systemically mistreated because of the color of their skin or don’t have the same rights as other citizens — something that couldn’t be further from the truth.

The anti-American media and politicians in the U.S. contribute to this insane rhetoric, choosing to spread the lie that the United States and evil dictatorships are moral peers.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez compared the Iranian regime to the pro-life movement in America. “Mahsa Amini was senselessly murdered by the same patriarchal and autocratic forces repressing women the world over” she said in a tweet. “The right to choose belongs to us all, from hijabs to reproductive care.”

In 2020, a New York Times Magazine piece by Isabel Wilkerson compared so-called discrimination in the U.S. to Nazi Germany, the nation that murdered more than 11 million people during WWII.

And this isn’t a recent phenomenon. In 2011, Time Magazine published an article asking which country has a worse record on human rights, America or China, and noting that China’s report on the U.S. said “The United States turned a blind eye to its own terrible human rights situation.”

There are many other examples of this.

The corporate news media lie regularly, and their dishonest equivocation between America and foreign dictatorships is just one example. Americans should have no patience for these outlets fanning the wildfire of hate and division in the U.S. when there are people in other countries losing their lives and facing actual oppression every single day.

Corporate Journalists Need To Stop Covering For Tyrants Abroad,"The New York Times broke the news last Sunday morning that the Iranian government abolished its notorious morality police, government agents who enforce a strict dress code based on the state’s interpretation of Islamic Sharia law. They have become a universally condemned symbol of oppression after 22-year-old Iranian woman Mahsa Amini died on Sept. 16 in Tehran after the “morality police” arrested and beat her for not wearing her hijab “properly.” Amini’s death sparked nationwide protests that continue today.

The Times celebrated Iran’s abolishment of the morality police as an “apparent victory for feminists.” Other corporate media, from The Wall Street Journal to CNBC, quickly repeated the Times’ story. Margaret Brennan, host of CBS’s “Face the Nation,” began her interview with the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken by saying, “I want to start with some breaking news overnight out of Iran, they have abolished the morality police.”

Yet within minutes of the Times’ reporting, human rights activists in Iran and the West denounced the Times story as false. U.S.-based Iranian activist Masih Alinejad tweeted, “It’s disinformation that the Islamic Republic of Iran has abolished it’s [sic] morality police. It’s a tactic to stop the uprising.” Another Iranian activist, Amin Pouria, tweeted, “To lift world’s public opinion pressure, the IR changes [the] name of the ‘Morality Police.’ However, Iranian women & girls are still beaten, imprisoned or killed like #MahsaAmini for mandatory dress code. Don’t let the IR fool you with lies and be Iranian’s voice.”

Even Iran’s government and state media have denied suspending the morality police. Iranian lawmaker and cleric Hossein Jalali reportedly said the morality police are here to stay, and “the Islamic Republic’s crackdown on women not wearing proper hijab will continue with a range of measures that may include blocking their bank accounts.” Kasra Aarabi, an analyst of the U.K.’s Tony Blair Institute, called the Times’ story “fake news.” He pointed out in his tweet, “This disinfo was propagated today to distract media attention from the 3 days of major protests in #Iran which begin tomo. Why did mainstream media ignore this context?”

It turned out the Times’ report was based on a vague comment by Iran’s Attorney General Mohammad Jafar Montazeri. When asked by reporters why people hadn’t seen many “morality police” on the streets, Montazeri replied, “The morality police had nothing to do with the judiciary, and the same institution that established it has now shut it down.” The Times ran its story based on this comment while ignoring what Montazeri said: “the judiciary will continue to supervise social behaviors.” After the pushback from Iranian human rights activists, some media began questioning or adding context to the story. Still, the Times has issued no correction or apology to its original report.

How did Western corporate media such as the Times get the morality police story wrong? Corporate media today are less about reporting straight news than advocating narratives, and people who work at these outlets see themselves as activists more than traditional journalists. They search for and only report news that supports their preferred narratives. The fake story of the morality police’s abolishment fits neatly with the narrative that courageous feminists forced an authoritarian regime to make a compromise. It was such a perfect story that the Times’ reporters ran with it rather than spending time to verify and confirm it with more reliable sources.

I see a similar pattern in how Beijing’s latest moves to lift some Covid restrictions after week-long national protests were reported. One analyst of Human Rights Watch tweeted, “The Chinese government is now easing Covid restrictions, thanks to the protesters who courageously took to the street.” While it is true that Chinese protesters were courageous, and Beijing did announce some relief from its Covid restrictions this week, it is delusional to interpret Beijing’s action as a comprise to the protesters.

The Wall Street Journal reported that some Chinese officials were quietly seeking ways to ease the “zero Covid” restrictions to rescue China’s falling economy months before the nationwide protests. According to the WSJ, “Chinese exports fell at the steepest pace in more than two years in November, the latest indication of how the country’s pandemic restrictions and waning global demand for goods are throttling China’s economy.” Besides the economic toll, Beijing is concerned that the continuation of strict Covid controls would “threaten China’s key position in global supply chains” and “lead to a broader decoupling between China and the world.” While Xi publicly vowed to stick to his “zero Covid” policy, he permitted the lifting of some Covid restrictions because even he was keenly aware that economic instability would lead to social unrest. The economic reality, not the nationwide protests, drove Beijing’s latest announcement.

While there is easing, some loathed Covid restrictions remain in place. For example, in some cities, when even one person in an apartment building tested positive, local Covid police sealed the entrance and exit to the entire building and confined all residents in their tiny apartments, forcing them to survive on limited and often overpriced food delivery. The continuation of these inhuman restrictions should surprise no one because Beijing’s “zero Covid” policy was never about health care but controlling people.

Besides chasing narratives, the lack of understanding of the true nature of authoritarian regimes is another explanation for why corporate media outlets often fall for authoritarian disinformation and inadvertently become useful idiots for these regimes.

It is common for democracies to respond to people’s will and make necessary policy changes. But authoritarian regimes do not budge, and their response to civil disobedience is more violent oppression. Since nationwide protests erupted in Iran, more than 18,000 protesters have reportedly been arrested, and the death toll of protesters surpassed 470. This week, Aarabi tweeted that the Iranian government executed another young protester and announced more future executions. Canadian human rights activist and lawyer Kaveh Shahrooz said in an interview, “Iran’s regime is not normal; its official statements are often lies designed to mislead the world. Our media should not take them at their word and must exercise extra caution when reporting on Iran.”

The CCP is not normal, either. It didn’t send tanks to flatten protesters last week only because the regime has found a better way to crack down on dissent without the “unpleasant” visuals of protesters dying in broad daylight. In recent years, Beijing has perfected its surveillance tools in Xinjiang against the Uyghurs. By persecuting Hong Kong’s pro-democracy activists under a dubious national security law, the Chinese authorities have not only silenced the city’s political dissent but also established the illusion that the CCP practices “rule by law.”

Beijing has already deployed these tactics to identify and intimidate protesters. Additionally, Covid-tracking QR codes that every Chinese citizen was forced to download on their phones to “track not only their COVID-19 risk status, but also their minute-by-minute movements — where they go, how they travel, and the people they encounter — data that is available to police.” Even if not all of these protesters end up in jail, the omnipresent social credit system will ensure they live a miserable life, unable to travel, find employment, open a bank account, or even own a pet.

If the corporate media truly care about maintaining their credibility and striving to support people who live in authoritarian regimes who yearn for freedom and democracy, they need to develop an understanding of these authoritarian regimes and understand that tyrants do not compromise. Corporate journalists must stop passing on these regimes’ disinformation, no matter how well it fits their preferred narratives. They must also find the decency to apologize and retract reporting when proven wrong.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/12/09/iran-grilling-americans-on-discrimination-highlights-the-unseriousness-of-our-racial-outrage-machine/,2022-12-12
Did Twitter Suppress Covid Lockdown Protests?,"During the Covid lockdowns, did you ever wonder why there weren’t more peaceful protests as we lost our basic liberties?

The release of the “Twitter Files” has shown the government collaborated with the Big Tech platform to suppress free speech by censoring disfavored news stories and speakers. But as journalists Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, and others comb through years of Twitter data, they should seek to discover whether another of our most basic rights was also subverted: the First Amendment “right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”

A month into the Covid-19 lockdowns, anti-lockdown protests were taking place nationwide. Politico reported: “Facebook is blocking anti-quarantine protesters from using the site to organize in-person gatherings that violate states’ stay-at-home orders.” A Facebook spokesman said the company was removing posts “when gatherings do not follow the health parameters established by the government and are therefore unlawful.” Protest organizers’ Pages were also shut down by Facebook for violating its terms of service by allegedly inciting violence.

But protest organizers knew to encourage participants to wear masks, socially distance, and not carry guns to avoid criticism. How much did Twitter, Facebook, and other tech giants restrict protesters from organizing under the guise of concerns about health risks or incitement to violence?

While there were those calling for revolution and saying menacing things on social media, did groups clearly advocating nonviolent demonstrations get blocked too? What was Twitter’s policy on sharing posts inviting people to demonstrate peacefully?

We know tech giants acted to support heavy-handed Covid-19 policies. They suppressed content questioning Covid lockdowns, mask mandates, and vaccines. Anthony Fauci directly communicated with Facebook’s chief, Mark Zuckerberg, to control coronavirus information. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s digital medical chief communicated with Twitter executives about censoring unapproved opinions on social media.

As the Twitter Files have revealed, Twitter executives are about 99 percent Democrat and amplify and suppress viewpoints “quite a bit.”

Anti-Lockdown Protests Quelled

We know Twitter has quelled demonstrations in Canada too: the “Freedom Convoy” of truckers, who protested Covid shot mandates and policies in the Canadian capital of Ottawa in February 2022, two years after the Covid outbreak. Twitter banned their account, again using the reasoning that the group was inciting violence. The Canadian government also froze protesters’ bank accounts, and GoFundMe demonetized the group. The trucker convoy was noisy and blocked traffic, but it appears to have been nonviolent.

Contrast that with the Black Lives Matter demonstrations in the summer of 2020, which frequently turned violent and did billions of dollars of damage. Did tech giants amplify calls for BLM demonstrations? How much more manipulation might Big Tech have wrought? How much were President Donald Trump’s tweets suppressed?

Massive Democrat Effort to Manipulate Election Protesters

If this seems too speculative, remember that a key Time magazine article clearly states at its very beginning that avoiding protests was the main focus of a massive effort by “left-wing activists and business titans” to influence the 2020 election, an effort that began around when Covid-19 broke out.

“There was a conspiracy unfolding behind the scenes, one that … curtailed the protests,” Molly Ball wrote, referring to possible post-election demonstrations.

This anti-Trump campaign premised on Trump stealing the election included plans to counter any pro-Trump protests.

What was the Effect?

We’ll never know how large protests might have been, and whether they could have ended harmful lockdowns and other Covid measures sooner, or even created massive unrest.

Of course, there are many other reasons Americans didn’t more strongly protest against Covid policies. Fed disinformation by corporate media, many agreed with draconian interventions. Others were too comfortable working from home — and not working at all, with government benefits — to protest them.

Perhaps Americans were afraid to speak up, given Big Tech’s censorship and corporate media’s disparagement of critics of the conventional wisdom on Covid. They were silenced into submission because they could get “canceled” or fired. With few protesting, they were made to feel more alone in their beliefs and that most people were going along with it all.

All the more reason to be grateful Musk has taken over Twitter so that reasonable critics of the government don’t have to feel so persecuted and ideas can be exchanged freely.

In fact, why aren’t Americans peacefully protesting Big Tech now, given that Musk has given us proof that Twitter suppressed information so vital to the functioning of our democracy?

Perhaps because conservatives have known about media bias for a long time, but let’s hope the Twitter Files open other people’s eyes to this huge threat to the health of our nation — and that key records have not been deleted, as Musk has said they might have been.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/12/12/corporate-journalists-need-to-stop-being-useful-idiots-for-authoritarian-regimes/,2022-12-12
Records: Interior Dept. Knew Protesters Could Turn Violent In 2021,"Internal records made public by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) show officials at the Department of the Interior downplayed the threat presented by left-wing climate protesters who, in October 2021, launched what could be called an insurrection by Democrats’ standards.

On Oct. 14, 2021, a swarm of demonstrators with the group People vs. Fossil Fuels stormed the Department of the Interior’s D.C. headquarters to conclude five days of activism in the nation’s capital. Fifty-five protesters were arrested in the demonstrations that turned violent, and “multiple injuries were sustained by security personnel,” according to the Interior Department. One officer was hospitalized.

[READ: Can You Spot The Difference Between These Two Insurrection Photos?]

Records compelled by the nonprofit government watchdog group Protect the Public’s Trust show agency leaders were caught off guard and unprepared for the eruption of violence despite clear warnings of unrest.

On the morning of the riot, Mili Gosar, the deputy chief of staff for operations in the secretary’s office, commiserated with colleagues about protesters outside the building.

“Hey all, just a heads up if you’re in the building, Lt. [REDACTED] just called me to say there were about 30 protestors inside the building at C st. and another 60 or so outside,” she wrote. “I’m sure they’re friendly and everything is fine, but just passing along the message in case anyone is trying to head out for lunch or anything like that!”

About 15 minutes later, Interior Department Communications Director Melissa Schwartz responded with a word of caution.

“Not friendly,” Schwartz wrote. “And everyone should avoid C Street, thanks.”

Senior leadership had ample notice, however, that the demonstrators who flocked to agency headquarters planned to be far from friendly.

According to messages dated the day before the riot, Steve Hargrave, the security chief at the department, highlighted concerns over the demonstrations, which led to the cancellation of a press conference.

“I just spoke to Commander [REDACTED] with the Federal Protective Service,” Hargrave wrote. “He contacted the organizer for the peaceful visit to the DOI and she expressed concerns about the group that would accompany them to DOI. The organizer has decided to cancel the DOI visit.”

According to emails made public by Protect the Public’s Trust, demonstration organizers met with the National Park Police six days before the riot to discuss planned episodes of “civil disobedience.”

“Your application indicates a plan by your group for civil disobedience,” wrote the park ranger assigned to process the application for demonstration. “Please describe what type of civil disobedience your group is planning as well as the location and duration of those actions.”

“Perhaps we need to schedule a meeting,” the organizer wrote back in an email dated Oct. 5, 2021.

On Oct. 6, 2021, the park ranger thanked the organizer for the meeting and sent over a map of Freedom Plaza.

The assault on the Interior Department came 10 months after the infamous Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, which Democrats have sought to etch into the nation’s memory by comparing the outbreak of civil unrest to 9/11 and conducting partisan show trials. House Democrats held hearing after hearing in the lead-up to the 2022 midterms to smear Republicans as complicit in the Capitol violence. Minority appointments to the select committee that conducted the hearings were barred by then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Despite the dramatic display of performative outrage by lawmakers such as former GOP Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, however, whose tears on television landed him a gig at CNN, Democrats remained silent on the attack at the Interior Department in the fall of 2021, just as they were when the capital city burned under the guise of social justice in 2020.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/12/12/did-twitter-suppress-covid-lockdown-protests-elon-musk-should-find-out/,2023-01-30
"Trans Activists Stage Insurrection, Leftist Media Completely Silent","Remember when storming and occupying a government capitol was considered an insurrection? Apparently it’s permissible as long as you’re protesting a cause backed by the leftist establishment. That’s what happened in Oklahoma on Monday.

Yesterday, a mob of trans activists stormed and occupied the Oklahoma state capitol to protest legislation that would prohibit sterilizing and mutilating children. The bill — known as the Millstone Act — would “prohibit Oklahoma doctors from providing gender transition procedures or referral services relating to such procedures to anyone under the age of 26.”

“Child abuse is a felony in our state and mutilating a young person’s genitalia should be viewed no differently. The Millstone Act will hold those who perform child mutilation accountable by making such activity a felony. Those guilty of such a heinous crime will be both legally and financially liable,” bill sponsor and state Sen. David Bullard said in a press release.

State legislators were expected to consider the act on Monday. Yet transgender activists stormed in and blocked a government proceeding.

https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1622810446637170689?s=20&t=lNUYFIxEPOc8uhOBl8_28g

To protest the clear intention of the bill to protect children from irreversible medical procedures, hundreds of trans activists occupied the Oklahoma Capitol to disrupt legislative proceedings on the bill, shouting “Trans Lives Matter” in unison at one point.

They were allowed to do so. No one was shot. No one was arrested or sentenced to several years in prison over “obstruction of official proceeding.” And not a peep was heard from corporate media about this occupation of the Oklahoma state capitol. You can bet there will be no federal investigation that jails everyone who was near the occupiers until they’re maybe proven innocent in a court of law.

The point here is that there are double standards for protesting in America. There are the establishment-backed, leftist-affirming protests (that many times turn violent with no recourse) and there are protests that attack that establishment. Establishment-backed protestors can do whatever they want.

Case-in-point: during the height of the Covid-19 lockdowns, although anti-lockdown protestors were fined and jailed, hospital lobbying groups said protests attracting thousands of Black Lives Matter supporters in the wake of George Floyd’s death were OK because racism was a public health crisis, too.

And then there are the protests the establishment does not like, against the establishment itself. These are wiped out or used to control the populace through message manipulation and intimidation. As columnist Auron MacIntyre put it, “protests that actually challenge power get crushed.”

But because trans-activist protestors spout leftist orthodoxy, they can get away with doing what the left calls an “insurrection” when regime opponents do it, and will be treated with kid gloves. Such protests the establishment will allow to continue unencumbered — even if they turn violent. But woe to protestors who actually attack establishment power.
